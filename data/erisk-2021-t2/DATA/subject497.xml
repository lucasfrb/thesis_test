    <TEXT>I'm currently at a low point in life where I think that no matter how hard I try, I'll never get to where I want to be. But now I've decided to tell myself instead, I didn't work so hard for nothing, and there's at least SOME school out there that is going to want me.  #8203; **These are the colleges I'm currently looking at:** Occidental College Rice University University of Southern California Smith College Bryn Mawr College Wellesley College Mount Holyoke College Drexel University University of Maryland College Park (In State) George Washington University (Legacy) Case Western Reserve University Would be nice but not a necessity: Scripps College Pitzer College Pomona College  #8203; **My top for now are:** Occidental Smith Rice USC GW  #8203; I wanted to look into Ivies (specifically **Stanford, Columbia, UPenn, Cornell, and Princeton**) as well, but I thought those were too far out of my league.  #8203; Anyways, I am a Junior in high school from Southern Maryland, Multiracial Female (Pacific Islander, South Asian, and Hispanic) **Class Rank: 24/413 (top 5%), WGPA: 4.4, UGPA: 3.9, SAT: n/a ACT: n/a** (I'm taking both this spring and summer)  #8203; **AP Courses:** APUSH AP World AP Human Geography AP Lang and Comp AP Lit AP Environmental AP Stats AP Spanish AP Psych Everything else was honors, with the exception of my piano and gym classes.  #8203; **Grades:** I have 2 B's on my transcript which really worry me, and they're in APUSH and Biology.  #8203; **EC:** NOAA Key Club Coalition of Leaders Academic Eagles Secretary of the Spanish Club Sociedad Honoraria Hispanica National Society of High School Scholars Orchestra (Violin 4, Bass 1) for 5 years Not really an EC, but I helped plan and execute an event for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, because I felt like the school needed more equality (it turned out great!). In middle school I was the secretary of the Rotary/Interact Club, I was on the soccer team, and I was in Educators Rising and participated in Read Across America. I don't know if those count, but if they do, sweet.  #8203; My career choice is Pediatric Occupational therapy, and I plan to major in psychology, with a double minor in Spanish and Chinese. In the future I'd like to move to Oceania and help my people in the Islander community.  #8203; Sorry for such a long post, I'm just extremely nervous,as I have to begin applying for colleges in September/October. Any advice and help would be nice, and feel free to ask anything else you'd need to know about me. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a minority myself, I feel like All Lives Matter isn #8217;t an ignorant thing to say in response to BLM. It #8217;s just that, many Asian and Latino men have gotten killed for no reason even up to recently, yet there #8217;s no Asian Lives Matter or Latinx Lives Matter. Hell, even hundreds of white men get killed on the weekly. If they tried to advocate against the killing of their people, all hell would break loose. These stories don #8217;t even make the news as much as one would about  #8216;The murder of our [innocent] black boys, #8217; yet they happen just as often. When people say All Lives Matter, I understand because there are too many other people who go through the same thing, but don #8217;t get as much attention. If they say  #8220;___ Lives Matter too #8221; someone is going to get offended. The way the news is today, it seems like it doesn #8217;t matter if you were shot by police or killed innocently unless you #8217;re black.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to start applying to college soon, and I'm already extremely anxious about the whole thing. I thought my own stats were pretty average and that I could get into a good amount of schools on my list, but then I come on here and see some pretty outstanding kids saying they got rejected from 10, 15, 17 colleges. I do have safeties, but at this point, I basically fear rejection. My parents already keep telling me that I will never succeed and I don't want them to have the satisfaction of being right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paying for application fees and financial literacy.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-16 17:08:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>\*\*I was going to ask this in a financial independence or fin lit subreddit, but the mods said it had nothing to do with the topic and I had to remove it. So, I'm asking here.  #8203; I apologize in advance if this sounds ignorant, but I've been having trouble getting my parents to comply with paying for college. I have college coming up, and the application fees add up to be at least $1600 in total. It's not much, honestly. Where I live, that's how much parents pay to buy their kids shoes. My parents have the money, but they'd rather spend it on their other kids. You see, they don't want me to go to college at all. My mother especially is narcissistic, and she doesn't want me to be independent. She feels more powerful if she has control over me, and she knows how badly I want an education. I am only 17, and they wouldn't let me get my license, nor would they let me get a job so I can make the money to pay for it on my own. I'm not worried about affording college itself because there are programs for that, it's the app fees I'm most worried about. As of now I'm trying anything I can to earn money, from tutoring to selling feet pics online. Anyways, my main questions are, When you get a part time job, do they pay you in cash? Am I able to get a debit card without a bank account? If I earn money online, how can I put it onto a card to pay my app fees? If my parents refuse to pay the fees and I can't come up with the money, is there something similar to FAFSA to help me out? Are application fees paid in cash or online? Thank you in advance. Any help at all is much appreciated. Edit: My English goes out the window when I'm nervous and I'm freaking out right now. Sorry if this sounds rushed, desperate, or annoying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was a real culture shock coming here and seeing how mean the kids are to the people who help them so much.

    <TEXT>I was taking an SAT practice test, and a passage came up about something I don #8217;t completely agree with, as in today #8217;s society, it doesn #8217;t exist anymore like it did back then (not going to go into details so I don #8217;t get roasted.) Not saying that history isn #8217;t valuable, but why don #8217;t we ever learn/talk about modern issues as opposed to things that aren #8217;t as relevant anymore? Is it because these are things we #8217;ve been learning all along, and they assume we are knowledgeable enough about them?

    <DATE>2019-05-04 17:17:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I won #8217;t be able to get into my dream school. If I don #8217;t get into my dream school, I already know what I will do. I am really dumb. I don #8217;t learn anything in school, I just memorize. And memorizing, along with turning in papers on time and doing extra credit is what has gotten me straight As and in the top 5% of my graduating class. It #8217;s not like I don #8217;t try, but my brain for some reason shoves out all information after I #8217;ve taken the test on it. I try so hard but I can never remember. I also fall asleep during major tests. I can #8217;t keep myself awake for some reason, even if I am getting sleep, eating healthy, etc. I just keep failing. And I didn #8217;t bust my ass all four year of high school sacrificing sleep and sanity for numbers just to fail at the most important point in my life. My goal for the SAT is a 1500. My grade today went down from my first practice test, and is nowhere near that number. I can #8217;t help but feel worthless. I study but I can #8217;t get it. I ask for help and I still don #8217;t understand. Absolutely nothing works. If I don #8217;t pass the SAT in August with a 1500, it #8217;s all over. I won #8217;t succeed. I already have a makeshift noose just in case, and I #8217;ve made a SuSan account recently. I guess we #8217;ll see how things turn out. I wanted to live so badly. I wanted to wear pretty clothes and travel and try all the different teas and have so many pets. But for that you need money. And to make money, you have to be successful. Something I am apparently not.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>US citizen wanting to go to college abroad.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-17 17:03:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I apologize if this has already been addressed, or if I come off as naive/ignorant.  #8203; I am a 17 year old Maryland native graduating around this time next year (class of 2020). My main goal has been for a while to take the education that I receive back to Fiji and help out my people. Regardless of the college I attend, that is what I am set on doing. I lowkey resent the idea of going to college in America because it's extremely expensive, and I doubt I'm smart enough to get a scholarship. Also, I thought it would be much easier to go to college in the country that I plan on moving to/living in. The problem is, I don't know exactly how easy or hard the process is, not only for application, but for obtaining the paperwork to go to school abroad. I've been looking into attending the University of the South Pacific-Suva, which already has a fairly large international population. [https://international.usp.ac.fj/](https://international.usp.ac.fj/) I've done a good amount of research, but my knowledge of how to go about getting student visas and whatever other paperwork I need is very limited. Most of the pages of the website that had detailed information have expired. I plan to live on campus, so a host family isn't necessary, and although the tuition is semi-affordable, any financial aid information would be helpful.  #8203; If anyone could offer information about paperwork, housing, visas, or anything else, it would be much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>International Students, How Are You Paying For College?</TITLE>

    <TEXT> #8203; I apologize if there is already a post like this, but Google failed to guide me to it, so here I am again. I was wondering where most international students are from, where you are attending university, and how are you able to afford it. Does your school have a special program to assist you financially? Did you receive a lot of outside scholarships? Or are you taking out loans?  #8203; I'm currently a US junior hoping to attend university in Canada or possibly another country (currently looking at UBC, UWaterloo, HKU, and Aston). When doing research, I read that the college you are attending is almost always likely to not help you financially, and that your only real option is to "take out student loans from your own country." How exactly does that work, and where do you go to do this? I'm not really financially literate, so any resources about this would be much appreciated.  #8203; Thanks in advance for any help!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What do you think about people naming their children after Asian countries/culture?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-22 13:57:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope I #8217;m not breaking any rules, but this is something I came across quite recently in my life. I go to a primarily African American [with a slash of] Caucasian school, and the amount of kids I see named after Asian things kinda baffles me. I understand if they were half Asian or something but the majority, if not all of them, are not. There are girls with names like China, Malaysia, Asia, India, and there #8217;s even a Himalaya, Kimchi, and a guy named Samurai. It doesn #8217;t exactly bother me, but I #8217;ve always wondered why. It also kinda makes me sad when these people talk crap about Asian people and traditions. For example, the girl named Kimchi said,  #8220; I dislike Asian people because whenever they #8217;re in public, they never speak English. It #8217;s like they #8217;re talking about you. If they don #8217;t know English, they should go back to their country. #8221; Given the fact that they are named after...Asian things, I #8217;d expect them to be more respectful, y #8217;know? Of course that #8217;s not everyone, but it #8217;s just a thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But these past few days at school I had noticed the most aesthetically pleasing, well-dressed, and breathtakingly beautiful girl I'd ever seen in my life. I've known that she existed for a few months, but for some reason I've been seeing her more and more often just recently, and every time I see her my heart just melts and I turn into an absolute mess. I can't help but look at her perfect features, her amazing sense of style, and how confident she always seems to be. Her voice is smooth and deep, yet there's a hardness that I can't quite describe in it that blows me away. I'm not trying to sound creepy, but there's an urge inside of me that wants to get to know her. It's like we have so much in common yet I barely know who she is. As cliche as it sounds, she's a mysterious person, and I want to know how to make her smile. How to make her happy. How to make her see me as a person she wants to include in her friend circle. And the thought that she is too cool for me, a grade below me, and will probably never speak a word to me in my life just makes me so extremely sad. I don't have the guts to talk to her because of my social anxiety, and I doubt she'll ever talk to me out of the blue. Well, I did talk to her once, and complimented her attire, but she seemed utterly shocked and mumbled an inaudible response that made it seem like she hated me even though we just met. This has been going on for a while now and I just needed to tell someone how this girl makes me feel, with the hope that y'all may know what's going on with me. I'm not the type of person to fall head over heels for anyone. I'm ace after all. It's not quite a romantic attraction, but more of a "you seem like an amazing individual and I want to exist within your realm" type of thing. Her aura is just so satisfying. My heart is breaking even right now just thinking about it and for whatever stupid reason I feel like crying. I don't know. Sorry if I sound like a loser. I've been an emotional wreck for the past few weeks and this may just be a result of that.</TEXT>

That obviously didn #8217;t happen, but I need help destroying the evidence. I have a small bottle that can fit in my purse, and I need to get rid of it. I was going to throw it out at school, but I was afraid they #8217;d find the bottle, question why it #8217;s there, pull up the camera and find out I was the one who put it there, and phone the  #8216;rents. My parents are the ones who take the trash down, and if they hear glass they #8217;ll most likely see it and get pissed off with me.

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a girl at my school that I can #8217;t stop thinking about. She #8217;s almost everything that I could ever ask for, but there #8217;s literally no chance in the world that we will end up together, which I have accepted. The thing is, even if I don #8217;t end up with her, I want to be with someone like her. Even though I #8217;ve accepted that we #8217;ll never end up together, just seeing her hang out with other people and enjoy her life while I #8217;m here being lonely makes me incredibly sad, and I #8217;ve started craving a relationship.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been feeling like this for the past few years now. My nmom has always stopped me from enjoying my childhood, and I was forced to take on adult roles at a very young age. For the longest time, all I ever cared about was doing everything in my power to get her to like me. I wanted to make good grades and go to an Ivy League to become some kind of rich doctor just to please her. I sacrifice my mental health, my time, and my energy just to make sure I do everything perfectly for her. And you know what? I just don #8217;t care anymore. All of my life she #8217;s been controlling everything I do. All of my life she #8217;s never allowed me to live how I ant and be who I want. Hearing her talk more and more about how I #8217;m a failure and I #8217;m never going to achieve anything in life as college approaches has made me more anxious and depressed than I #8217;ve ever been in my life. I #8217;m tired of feeling like shit so that she can feel better about herself, and I don #8217;t want to punish myself anymore because of her. I deserve to be happy goddammit. As soon as I get away from her I want to be able to breath. I want to do what I want to do and live how I want to live without feeling guilty. I want to be able to eat healthy without having her there to make fun of my weight. I want to be able to wear makeup and get those tattoos and piercings I #8217;ve always wanted without having here there to ridicule my appearance. I want to be able to buy books without her telling me that I don #8217;t focus enough on my education. I want to be able to have friends and go out to have fun without her there to tell me that I don #8217;t study hard enough and that I #8217;m becoming so kind of street roaming whore. I want to be able to talk freely about my beliefs without having her there to tell me I #8217;m wrong because I don #8217;t agree with hers. I will not be controlled anymore by her. I will be able to live my life freely and as I please. tl;dr: Nmom has been controlling me ever since I was young and I want to live how I want when I graduate in a year. Does anyone else feel/has felt this way before? How did it end up for you?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-13 18:21:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been seeing so many Instagram posts to the point where I decided to log off for a few weeks. Call me horrible, but I just don #8217;t understand why Sudan is any different than the rest of the violence happening in this world. I have nothing to do with it, and there #8217;s literally nothing I can do to make the situation better. What #8217;s happening there does not impact my life whatsoever and I dislike how many people are clogging my timeline with GoFundMes and trying to guilt trip people or whatever. Not saying that it #8217;s not important, but it #8217;s literally nothing new. I see these posts claiming that if you don #8217;t donate/care/speak out/bring awareness or whatever that you #8217;re a horrible person that is  #8220;a part of the problem #8221; and honestly I don #8217;t mind being labeled as a heartless asshole at this point. I #8217;m so tired of seeing it. It has nothing to do with us, and I have other things to worry about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I usually don #8217;t believe in love at first sight</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-14 18:53:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>But these past few weeks at school I have noticed the most aesthetically pleasing, well-dressed, and breathtakingly beautiful girl I'd ever seen in my life. I've known that she existed for a few months, but for some reason I've been seeing her more and more often just recently, and every time I see her my heart just melts and I turn into an absolute mess. I can't help but look at her perfect features, her amazing sense of style, and how confident she always seems to be. Her voice is smooth and deep, yet there's a hardness that I can't quite describe in it that blows me away. I'm not trying to sound creepy, but there's an urge inside of me that wants to get to know her. It's like we have so much in common yet I barely know who she is. As cliche as it sounds, she's a mysterious person, and I want to know how to make her smile. How to make her happy. How to make her see me as a person she wants to include in her friend circle. And the thought that she is too cool for me, a grade below me, and will probably never speak a word to me in my life just makes me so extremely sad. I don't have the guts to talk to her because of my social anxiety, and I doubt she'll ever talk to me out of the blue. Well, I did talk to her twice, complimenting her attire and art skills, but she seemed utterly shocked and mumbled an inaudible response that made it seem like she hated me even though we just met. This has been going on for a while now and I just needed to tell someone how this girl makes me feel. She #8217;s just so freaking beautiful and seems like a genuinely lit person to be around. I'm not the type of person to fall head over heels for anyone, but her aura is just so satisfying. Even if I don #8217;t specifically end up with her, I at least want to be with someone like her in the future, with similar characteristics, and a similar personality, ya feel? I have her Instagram, and I every once in a while scroll through her selfies like the hopeless romantic I am. I would have messaged her a long time ago, but I #8217;m literally ass ugly, and even if we did hit it off over dms, when she realizes who I am she #8217;ll probably get freaked/grossed out. I #8217;ve dedicated this summer to getting in shape and taking care of my body now that I actually have motivation, which is probably the only good thing that has come out of this mess. I don't know. Sorry if I sound like a loser. I've been an emotional wreck for the past few weeks and this may just be a result of that. I #8217;m not looking for advice or anything, I just wanted to get this off of my chest. (I posted this a while back in TOMC, but I think here is a better place to put it!)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-19 20:33:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in an area that #8217;s extremely diverse. There #8217;s literally almost every race here, with the exception of little to no Native Americans and me being probably the only Nesian. Something I noticed when I moved here was the amount of competition when it came to skin color, whether it be among the blacks, Asians, South Asians, Latinos, etc. The longer I #8217;ve lived here, the more and more I #8217;ve seen people whether at school or on social media bragging about being lighter than others. Guys would talk about how they only want light girls, girls only want light guys, etc. People would use the fact that they are lighter to say,  #8220;Hey. I #8217;m probably better looking and more important than that person because they #8217;re dark. #8221; I myself have received hate from my own relatives (northies) for not being as light as them, and have been encouraged to bleach my skin so that I could be  #8220;light skinned #8221; like them. Most sites I #8217;ve read about colorism have never really pointed out how people who feel like they #8217;re more entitled due to being lighter are a huge part of the problem, and although not completely exempt, often blame others for the problem. I grew up absolutely hating myself up until recently because of my color while all the people around me bragged about being so  #8220;pale #8221; and cute, and I can only imagine how many others feel bad about themselves because of something they can #8217;t help. I apologize if this isn #8217;t written well, this is more of a rant than anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is more of a small rant but i wanted to get it off my chest if that #8217;s alright. I follow my crushy on both Instagram and Snapchat, and she was posting numerous videos of her and my friend hanging out at a local hotspot throughout the night. Normally I would #8217;ve been extremely jealous, or felt betrayed even for whatever selfish reason. But she looked so damn happy and I couldn #8217;t help but feel happy with her. She was (to my utter surprise) drunk, dancing, singing, and f*ckin it up like nobody #8217;s business. As cliche as it sounds, her laughter was like music, and her carefree vibes were contagious. Seeing her smile and be genuinely content just brought tears to my eyes. She radiated an energy so joyful that I #8217;d never seen before. And it was so freaking beautiful. At this point, even though I still like her a lot, I wouldn #8217;t want that indescribable joyfulness to go away because of me. No matter what, I want her to be happy. To be at peace. To be the same free, brilliant, and utterly amazing human being she was that day. Even if it #8217;s not with me. I care more about her happiness than ever having a chance. Eventually these feelings will fade and we will both go on with our lives, but for now I can #8217;t help but watch from afar. Her existence has breathed a new life into me almost. tl;dr - One of my friends and my crush went out together last night and I can #8217;t help but feel happy for the both of them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Application Race Question: How much would I get in trouble for this?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-02 20:56:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I #8217;ve mentioned this already on another thread, but the person I was talking to said it was fine. I wanted to hear your opinion. I #8217;m a Pacific Islander, iTaukei specifically, with Indigenous Latinx and Tamil on my mom #8217;s side. On any unofficial documents or websites that have asked my race, however, I would always say  #8220;other #8221; or  #8220;prefer not to answer #8221; because most of the time here people associate Pacific Islanders only with Polynesians, and I am Melanesian. While in Australia or New Zealand, people would understand that I #8217;m an Islander, in America people assume I #8217;m African American or mixed, which I #8217;m not. My question is, how much trouble would I be in if I identify as an Islander, but I look different from what they expect? Should I go ahead and put that on my application? I don #8217;t want to have to identify as something else because of the lack of knowledge surrounding my people but I also don #8217;t want to get in trouble if someone assumes I #8217;m trying to get urm status or something. I #8217;ve read numerous posts here about kids getting in trouble for claiming to be another ethnicity. Even though that #8217;s not my situation, I still feel nervous. What exactly do you think I should do? tl:dr - Because I #8217;m Melanesian, I don #8217;t look like what Americans think of when they hear  #8220;Pacific Islander #8221; even though I am one. I #8217;m afraid the AO won #8217;t believe me and I #8217;ll get in trouble. What do I put on my apps?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Airing out my family's dirty laundry and the college application process (any advice appreciated)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-12 16:44:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I apologize in advance for the rant, I just wanted some major advice on what to do in this situation.  #8203; **TW: Suicide, psych/emotional abuse.**  #8203; Up until this point my parents have been telling me that I will never be successful, and I'm starting to believe them.  #8203; To start off, my parents, especially my nmom, have never been the nicest people, but I didn't come here to complain about that. They have been extremely controlling ever since I was young, and now that college is approaching its gotten significantly worse. Since I was a Sophomore, I wanted to start touring schools, taking standardized tests, and preparing myself so that senior year I wouldn't have to stress over the application process. My parents like to use the phrase "you're worrying about the carriage before you worry about the horse," for literally everything, and they continuously told me that I was "too young" and should "wait." In addition to that, they refused to buy me any books to study for the SAT with, along with limiting my computer time and monitoring where I went. I now feel like I'm behind on absolutely everything.  #8203; Now, I'm 17, about to start applying to schools, and I just failed my first SAT along with my AP test. They won't let me retake it because "when \[they\] were in school, \[they\] didn't have to take the SAT more than once." They also said that about extracirriculars, which is why I rarely do after school activities and sports that I've always wanted to do. They think that everything is the same way that it was when they were in school and that I'm making shit up for whatever reason. I even show them the proof of the things I need to do to get into a good school and they straight up refuse to help me! Ever since my nmom saw my scores, she keeps telling me that I will end up at \[insert name of community college here\] and how if other kids are able to do it, I should be able to as well. I honestly thought that I was an intellingent kid, but with her continuously telling me things like this, I feel like all of my hard work was for nothing and that she's right.  #8203; I used to think that I was actually smart until I came on here and saw how freaking incredible everyone here was. I was told that I'm only in the top 5% of my class and I only get good grades because my school apparently has 'grade inflation,' and that if I have a high GPA and a low SAT score, I'm probably not as smart as I think I am. I guess it's actually true. I can see it now through my awful scores.  #8203; I decided recently to stop caring about getting into T20s and just worry about affording/getting into school period. My parents don't want to pay for my application fees, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify. They don't even want to pay for me to go college, because I don't want to be a doctor like they told me to (I failed biology and math. I'm not being defiant, I just genuinely think I can't succeed in that field.) My nmom keeps making a big deal about her reputation and how I am supposed to get into a good school so that \[insert all of her friends, enemies, and their dogs here\] would see how good she raised me, yet she doesn't want to go through the process of helping me.  #8203; My parents won't let me get a job or my license, so making money to pay for it myself is out of the question. And since I'm still a minor who only turned 17 recently, I can't be like "f this I'm an adult" and go do what I want. I was never allowed to have friends growing up, and the ones that I do have are on the internet, so I have no place to run to even if I wanted to. I have thought about going to community college in another state to escape my parents, but I wouldn't know how to afford it, or how to put clothes on my own back and a roof over my head. I've thought about going to school in another country where it's much cheaper (since they don't want to pay), or where I have relatives who could probably take better care of me, but they don't want to go through the paperwork. I even thought of taking a gap year, but I've read here that it's not a good option if I want to go into a good career, and my parents are about ready to kick me out, so I wouldn't be able to support myself.  #8203; I have absolutely no clue about what I'm going to do at this point. How do I afford app fees? How can I take subject tests, standardized tests, and fulfill other requirements if my parents flat out refuse? How do I afford college and classes? I'm just so stressed about the whole thing.  #8203; Since I'm being completely honest with y'all, I told myself that I was going to commit suicide on June 10th of this year, 2019. I had a plan, the noose is still in my closet, waiting for me. I started to believe that I was never going to be successful, and thought "what's the point then? " I was, and I still am ready to leave this world at this point. But I wanted to see if I could actually make it first. I wanted to see if I could actually succeed and prove my parents wrong. But now that I look at how things are going, I don't think I will. I feel like they're TRYING to make sure I don't succeed. But seriously, what parent would want something like that for their kid? My nmom is always belittling me, telling me how she wants to see me fail and how I will never be successful. She tells me that I'll end up like my sister (who was much older than me, but killed herself to get away from my nmom when I was just a toddler.) She tells me that I'll end up a whore on the streets or dead young. I don't know what I ever did to her to make her feel that way about me, but my future, especially my education, shouldn't be messed with just because she doesn't like me. I probably shouldn't be putting the blame on my parents tbh. If I wasn't such a shitty kid and if I had just conformed like I was supposed to when I was little, I wouldn't be going through this. I decided that I wanted to be divergent and do something different that made me happy and I screwed up everything. This is my own fault, and as much as I like to deny it, it most likely could've been avoided.  #8203; tl;dr - my parents keep telling me that they want me to fail or that I will never be successful, and they don't want to help me fulfill the requirements of the college application process so I can prove them wrong. I'm running out of options, and because I've been controlled most of my life by them, I don't know how to do things on my own. I'm open to a lot of things, but there are also many limitations that come with my current situation. I would appreciate any help that I could possibly receive. Thank you guys in advance :)  #8203; Edit: Sorry for my bad English, it comes and goes when I'm upset lol</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-18 23:11:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>To start off, I #8217;ve been begging my parents to learn a martial art for years now. As a 4 #8217;11 girl with the goal of traveling solo and eventually joining the Peace Corps, I knew that I #8217;d some day need it. My parents aren #8217;t the type of people to just let me go and do things, and they kept telling me to worry about school first and stop worrying about the future. Well, the future has come and I #8217;m going off to college in a year. My parents now want to sign me up for a self defense class for the school year ( along with other stuff) probably thinking that one year is enough to even get me comfortable with the skill. In my area there isn #8217;t much. Only Judo, Karate, Aikido (not for my age group tho), Jiu Jitsu, and Taekwondo (which I #8217;d prefer not to but wouldn #8217;t mind). If it #8217;s important, I have bad knees and I #8217;m pretty overweight for my height and age. I know the real world isn #8217;t going to give a shit but if any of these will be more lenient towards me then I #8217;d likely go with that one. As the title states, which of these would I learn the most self defense skills in a single year?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always been pretty good in school, decent grades and an above average GPA. But ever since I started high school, the work load became serious and I can never seem to get things don #8217;t in a specific amount of time without getting frustrated at even the tiniest things. I can turn off all of my devices but still get distracted by absolutely nothing, my mind begins to wander and I have a hard time getting it back. Even when I put my foot down and decide to start my work, I only get so far before I start shifting, getting up to walk around, playing with my pencil, etc. It #8217;s the most frustrating thing and it makes me feel like a horrible, lazy individual. I #8217;ve wanted to go to my Pediatrician about what I think is adhd, and I even wanted to talk to her about my depression (which was a completely different story) but my nmom refuses to let me get help for a bunch of different reasons. Reaching an agreement with her is virtually impossible so I have to wait until college or something until I can seek help on my own. I just hate having to deal with this, especially throughout school when I KNOW there #8217;s help out there. I #8217;ve been looking up ways to deal with it naturally or at home, but non of said tips have helped at all. Idk I #8217;m just frustrated and disappointed in myself.

    <TITLE>Could someone be kind enough to give me the rundown on these two Fijian universities?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-25 22:10:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm in a bit of a situaiton where my parents don't want to pay for me to retake the exams required to get into American universities, so I've been looking at international colleges in the UK and abroad that don't require AP Scores, SAT/ACT, etc. So far, I've been looking into the University of the South Pacific and the University of Fiji. I couldn't get the amount of information I needed on Fiji National University. **Why Fiji?** Well, I am Pasifika-American (Fijian) myself, so I thought it'd be easier to blend in/get used to things faster down there. My family isn't at all close to each other, so I can't quite get in contact with them to ask this information for myself, hence why I'm here. I entertained the idea of moving to Fiji a few posts ago, but I realized how unrealistic that probably was, and I don't want to move here and end up messing up something/taking someone's job in the long run. I've decided to just see if I get a career jumpstart after university, and if I don't, I have other plans anyways. I changed my course of study from healthcare and decided to go into Education/Language/Linguistics. If push comes to shove I can always use my education to assist in preserving the Fijian language, whether I get educated in the US, Uk, or South Pacific. I have a ~~lot~~ few questions about Fijian colleges and living in Fiji in general that I was not able to find through research and the university websites, and would appreciate it if anyone had information about it. For USP Anticipated Program: Certificate in Education and a Bachelor of Art Program For UniFiji Anticipated Program: Bachelor of Arts in iTaukei Language and Culture (Double Major), with my second major being Bachelor of Teaching (primary) **Questions** \-Can you get a part-time job in Fiji while studying, or would that require a work visa? If so, how would you go about this? \-How does the food system work? Is there a meal plan like in the US that you pay for during the application process, or do you pay per meal? Is there a grocery store nearby to purchase your own food? \-How is the shuttle system, and how does it work? How much does a ride usually cost, and can you pay with your student ID? Where can I find a schedule? \-Are students expected to return home on holidays/breaks as in the US? \-Do you have to reapply each semester? (I think I've read something about this on their Instagram story) \-How do you go about choosing courses and classes? Is it done online or on paper? How difficult is the process? \-Is the majority of sign-up, book purchasing, etc. done in the country? Besides the application and visa information, what else should you already have done before heading to Fiji? \-Are there any mental health services? I have adhd, and may need meds in the future. \-What should I do about cell phone service and international calls? Will WhatsApp work? Will my computer work over there? \-Do I need a bank account while there for purchases? \-I read up on international student requirements. Is it true that we only need to have a good GPA? No tests or anything? I read somewhere about a "Foundation program," but I couldn't figure out what that was, and the webpage for it was blank. My top choice of the two as of now is the University of Fiji, but so-far, the USP website provides the most/most clear information. Thank you in advance for any help, and if there are other websites that I #8217;m not checking out (besides the University sites), feel free to link them!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you have Rhythmic Movement Disorder (or any other  #8220;parasomnia #8221;)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-26 02:06:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope this doesn #8217;t violate rule 2, but I have searched reddit and saw nothing about it, so I wanted to see if anyone else experienced the same thing. I #8217;ve had RMD, or rhythmic movement disorder my entire life. My doctor said it was supposed to go away after a certain age and that it is more prevalent in young children, but I #8217;m one year away from adulthood and I still have it. My decision to research this supposedly rare disorder is what led me to discover that I may have adhd/aspergers, as it is normally (but not necessarily) a symptom of: ADHD Tourette syndrome Autism Rett syndrome Angelman syndrome Sleep apnea During sleep mine looks something [this](https://youtu.be/GthCtXvxa6Y), where it #8217;s more of a banging motion than a side to side movement, and whenever I #8217;m sitting up whether it be on the couch or in the car, it looks something like [this](https://youtu.be/GY-Di41j5Wk), although everyone #8217;s can be different.

    <DATE>2019-07-26 23:27:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can #8217;t fucking take her shit anymore. I #8217;ve tried. I #8217;ve really fucking tried to survive this last year of school but her bullshit has been getting worse and worse and worse. I #8217;m tired of the abuse. I #8217;m tired of her telling me that I should kill myself. I #8217;m tired of her telling me that she wants to see me fail. I #8217;m tired of her telling me I #8217;ll never be good enough. I #8217;m tired of her treating her other kids like saints and pushing me away like I #8217;m some kind of disease. I honestly don #8217;t know what I did wrong why she hates me so much. I really fucking don #8217;t. If she would just TELL me then I #8217;d do something to fucking fix it but apparently just being myself is enough to make any human despise me. I #8217;m a fucking monster undeserving of any joy or peace of mind. I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll ever find peace at this point in my life, but I won #8217;t let her have her way. I don #8217;t know how I #8217;m going to do it but I will get out of here. It #8217;s just a matter of surviving until I can finally escape.  #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; Sorry for the rant, man. I just don #8217;t understand how some people do this.  #8220;Talk to a trusted adult/school counselor! #8221; There are none.  #8220;Call CPS! #8221; That never worked.  #8220;Just ignore it! #8221; How?  #8220;Call the hotline! #8221; Really?  #8220;Go stay with a friend! #8221; Have none.  #8220;Get a job or a hobby outside of the house! #8221; Not allowed. I really don #8217;t know how to get through this last year. I don #8217;t want to die anymore but I want to leave this place as soon as possible. The twelve months I have left of living in this god awful family is too much time. Even when I do leave, my stuff, my memories will be here, my beloved pets will be here (can #8217;t take them with me), and my sister will be here. I don #8217;t want to leave all of this behind but I also don #8217;t want to be around my nmother for longer than the 17 years I already have. I don #8217;t want to ever have to return. Can she just fucking drop dead already? She already has a bunch of health problems, just finish her off already for Christ #8217;s sake. Boom. Population control. I know I sound like a cruel, heartless, good for nothing ungrateful little troll, but it #8217;s indescribable how painful it is to life in the same vicinity as someone so suffocating and evil. God keeps taking all of these beautiful people like Cameron, but he won #8217;t rid of the evil ass narcissistic bitches sucking the souls out of innocent kids and ruining their fucking lives. This fucking sucks man. I don #8217;t know how else to describe how I feel. It just sucks. Maybe I did something wrong in my past life and that #8217;s why I #8217;m suffering now. I just don #8217;t understand. I will make it. I will live a good life. I know I will. I just don #8217;t know how. **Edit: Tho I didn #8217;t respond to everyone individually, I read every single message, and I just wanted to thank you guys so much for the help and reassurance. It breaks my heart to know that you guys are suffering in the same or even worse ways. Sometimes I wish that I could take the pain away from others and put it onto myself, and sometimes I #8217;d selfishly hope that someone else would know what I #8217;m going through. You are all such beautiful souls and you deserve more than this, and I hope that in the near future your life will turn into what you always wanted it to be. I hope that you all will find the peace and calm that you long for. Thank you again for all of your help, and I wish you the absolute best. I truly appreciate each and every one of you.**</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-01 17:59:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So college is coming up, and for the longest time I've thought about changing my name. When I get older, I plan on doing it anyway, as I don't like my current name and would rather have something that represents me as an individual, but for now I've decided it would be better to just use a nickname. **My current ideas** I don't want to give out my real name exactly as it's super old and rare atm, but I was thinking as nicknames I'd use: **Thea \[Thee-Uh or They-Uh\]** \- Heard that people don't like this one but idk **Alma \[AHL-muh\] -** Cute and simple; Hispanic in Origin **Hanalei \[hana-LEY or ha-NAH-lay\]** \- I've heard that this would be insensitive since I'm not Hawaiian **Lahela \[La-HEY-Luh\]** \- Means Ewe in Hawaiian; Not sure if this would be insensitive or not as well **Hemlata \[hem-LAH-tah\]** \- Lati or Lottie for short; Indian origin **Makalae \[mah-KAH-lay or mahkah-LAY\]** \- Maka for short; It's actually just my middle name with a different spelling All of these are either anagrams, variations, or cominations of my first and middle name. If it helps, I'm a Melanesian Pacific Islander mixed with South Asian and Hispanic. Thank you guys in advance and if you have any ideas feel free to share them!

    <TEXT>Okay so I'm not going to sit here and say "I'm failing because I have a 1560 SAT and idk how to feel wahhh." BUT I genuinely think that my SAT/ACT scores are going to kill me, and I don't have the type of amazing ECs and awards that I see most of the kids here getting into these amazing schools with. I'm pretty average overall, and I'm afraid that I'm reaching to high. **Race:** Mixed Tamil, South Pacific Islander, and Hispanic **Gender:** Female **Location:** Maryland, USA **Hooks:** None. Not putting my race on the common app for personal reasons **SAT:** 1050 (parents won't let me retake it because "back in their day they didn't have to take all of these standardized tests." **ACT**: 21 (same as the SAT) **APs:** 9 no 4s or 5s on the four that I've already taken, and the 5 I'm doing next year won't count anyways. **Subject Tests:** 3 - World, Spanish, and Lit (taking in the fall) **GPA:** 4.4W, 3.9UW (as of now) **Extracurriculars:** Key Club for 2 years 2 years of Teen Court volunteering Secretary of the Spanish club for 4 years NOAA (environmental club) for 2 years + envirothon School Leadership club and class for 2 years Been playing piano since I was 2, violin since I was 10, and bass since I was 14. Awards: The only awards I've ever gotten were "outstanding student in \_\_\_\_ subject" at school and principle honors. Something almost everyone gets. Most of the awards I won were in middle school before we moved. My current college list has almost 30 schools both here and abroad, but I plan to apply to only 10 for the fafsa, 2 for ucas, and the two last resort colleges abroad. I'm planning to cut down the first 14 schools in some way shape or form, and omit the third group all together. **Intended Major:** Linguistics, Elementary Education, or Anthropology with a minor in Spanish. **Safeties:** George Mason Rutgers CUNY Queens University of Arizona Arizona State University University of Nevada Las Vegas **Top Colleges that I actually have a chance of getting into:** Trinity U - San Antonio GWU Smith Mount Holyoke UIUC UT Dallas UT Austin CUNY Baruch BYU Hawaii Texas A amp;M Corpus Cristi **Schools that I thought I was smart enough to get into but obviously not:** Barnard UNC Chapel Hill Northeastern Wellesley UMD (state school) University of Florida Florida State University University of South Florida University of Central Florida **UCAS Unis:** University of Sussex Queen Mary University of London **Others:** University of Nottingham Malaysia University of the South Pacific And possibly, University of Fiji.  #8203; As of now it looks like Malaysia is the only one I can afford because I am in the "too rich for aid, too poor for college" position. My tests scores are also not good enough for financial aid apparently. If there are any colleges on here that I should remove or add, please let me know! Also, in the schools that I chose, I was specifically looking for large Asian/Pasifika/Latinx population, so if you're going to recommend any I'd appreciate if they have these factors!.

    <TITLE>Is crime in Jamaica over exaggerated? - A question from a potential college student.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-02 22:42:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am a student, originally from Saint Vincent now living abroad in North America, who is entertaining the idea of going to the University of the West Indies. I haven #8217;t decided on a campus, but I #8217;m leaning towards Mona at the moment. I #8217;ve heard a lot about crime on all three campuses, and I was wondering how much trouble an introverted, 4 #8217;11 (150 cm) girl could find herself in. Most of the incidents I #8217;ve read about have been spontaneous, so I #8217;m afraid that no amount of safe precautions could save me if I happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, most of the people who cry about how violent a nation Jamaica is, aren #8217;t even Jamaican themselves, so I don #8217;t know if I should take that information seriously or not. After all, thousands of Jamaicans are living there with few problems, and I doubt each and every one of them are living their lives in fear. I #8217;m almost positive that I could fit in with the locals on the basis of looks, and the Vincy accent is a bit similar to Patois, so I don #8217;t think it #8217;d be hard to catch on. What is your view on safety around UWI and in the area of Kingston and St Andrews Perish? *I haven #8217;t decided upon a major yet, but at the moment all of my options are listed within the school of arts and humanities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>shitty pointless rant ahead. just needed to vent a little bit. I really want to live, I really do. But every single day proves to be getting worse and worse. It seems like there's some kind of invisible force working against me, trying to push me over the edge. My transcript came in today, and my gpa has dropped significantly. My class rank plummeted as well. My nmom won't stop fucking screaming at me, and I can already hear everyone's disappointment. My teachers, who have so much faith in me are going to see that I am a failure. The people who were waiting for me to fail are going to get what they wanted. My nmom, who is always telling me how she wants to see me fail in life and that I'm going to be miserable is going to so pleased that I've gone from the top to the very bottom. They were all right. I'm a worthless piece of nothing. I hate myself. I fucking hate myself. I can't control myself right now. There's blood everywhere. Fuck my mental health, man. Depression ruins fucking everything. I tried so hard but apparently that wasn't good enough. There's always that one person who tried harder. Now I'm never going to get where I want to in life. I can already see it. If I can't even pass high school what makes my dumb ass think that I'm going to achieve my goals of getting a master's and living abroad? I never wanted to get into a T20 college, but seeing what my transcript looks like now, I probably won't be able to get into college at all. And my parents are making this whole process even more unbearable because they don't want me to leave home. I'm not giving up so quickly, tho. I'm going to try my fucking hardest to bring that bitch back up in one semester so I can get back to where I was. I didn't bust my ass for the past 14 years just to fail in the end. I will get there, and if I don't, I guess I'll have to meet my demise. Idk man. I never wanted to die. But if I can't get to where I need to be, I may as well just quit while I'm here.

    <DATE>2019-08-14 22:29:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Whenever we go to the store, my nmom is quick to pick up useless things for herself that she wants and ends up never using. She bought a 50$ pedicure set that #8217;s been sitting in the closet for months that she #8217;ll yell at anyone if they touch, she #8217;s always buying herself candy, and at one point, she used to buy 100$ iTunes cards every time we went to Walmart to spend on the games she plays on her phone. In addition to this, she #8217;s always spending hundreds of dollars on her other kids, buying them the latest fashionable clothes that she finds, treats and snacks, technology, and toys. Meanwhile, I #8217;ve been wearing the same clothes since I was in 5th grade, every time I ask for something new, whether it be school supplies or clothes, she starts raising her voice and having an attitude with me, telling me how ungrateful I am for what I already have. She never used to buy me food to the point where I #8217;d have to risk getting cussed out for eating someone else #8217;s leftovers, and only recently I #8217;ve been able to go in the store and get myself frozen dinners, as long as it #8217;s under 2$. Every time she has to buy me basic necessities, she always insults me, telling me how much money she could save if I wasn #8217;t there and calling me fat whenever I ask for food (because I #8217;m not allowed to eat what #8217;s at home). Most of the time the only  #8220;food #8221; I pick up is 50 #162; sparkling water and some 88 #162; noodles because she #8217;ll yell at me for picking up anything relatively expensive or of higher quality. She even has the nerve to call ME selfish, when countless times she spent hundred of dollars on herself to buy useless things. And it #8217;s not like I can just get a job and buy it myself or ask someone to buy it for me, either. I don #8217;t know why, but I feel so selfish having to keep asking for these things. I feel like a fat, greedy pig always asking for food, to the point where I #8217;ve considered just starving myself. If there #8217;s a reason she refusing to buy it for me then I guess I #8217;ll just have to go without. It #8217;s better than being bullied about my weight or eating habits every time we go to the store. I feel so selfish asking for new shoes or clothes when kids all over the world have been wearing the same pair all their lives. I feel so useless asking for her attention only to get pushed away. Idk, man. I suck.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What does NOT count as an award?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-20 14:49:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an award after being accepted to the World Language Honor Society (which lots of kids also got), a Principle's Honors award for my GPA (which every kid with a 4.0 or above gets), plus perfect attendance, an Academic Letter, an "Outstanding Student in History" and "Outstanding Student in Physical Education" award. That was practically it. If you meet the requirements, a good majority of kids at my school get these awards, so I assume that I shouldn't list them, correct? Do they want awards like "Destination Imagination Champ" or "CTW Program Achievements?" Or am I allowed to use these?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>nMom is forcing me to go to an NSHSS event</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-22 00:57:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>To start off, my nmom forced me to join NSHSS just so she can brag about it to her friends. I told her it was a scam and that I refuse to do anything associated with it, but she won #8217;t listen. There #8217;s an [event](https://www.nshss.org/events/events-collection/nshss-new-york-member-event-at-columbia-university/) at Columbia honoring members and my nmom is forcing me to go because they #8217;re promising scholarships and shit. I #8217;m literally going to miss a day of schools AND it costs 60$ that I need to pay college application fees. She even tried to get my sister (who also knows it #8217;s a scam) to wear her NSHSS medals and whatnot to graduation and is trying to make me do the same. I really don #8217;t want to look like a fool by associating myself with them, but I literally have no choice in the matter. Roast me all y #8217;all want. Honestly it #8217;ll probably make me feel better when I #8217;m being laughed at irl. This isn #8217;t a troll post. I would really appreciate any advice, as I #8217;m super stressed out and this situation isn #8217;t making it better.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Career path to choose if you want to move abroad?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-25 02:59:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story short, I #8217;m one of those depressed kids who find joy in nothing that I can make a good career out of, so I don #8217;t have my mind set on one thing just yet. I am awful at math and science, hence why I decided not to go into the medical field like I was originally, but I love world history, anthropology, languages, and culture. The only jobs I could find with those is teaching, or something that requires a PhD. As of now, I plan to do TEFL teaching, but my ideal job is something that would allow me to settle down and have pets/a family and chill out. In addition to this, sometimes my depressive episodes make it so that i don #8217;t want to interact with people/get out of bed, and although I know I have to, I don #8217;t want my bad attitude to impact others, especially little kids. I don #8217;t want to stay in my country for personal reasons, and was looking to move to either South America (yes, I speak Spanish), Europe, Oceania, the Caribbean (have a parent from there), or Asia. What paths should I take that would make it relatively easy to get sponsorship in/move to another country besides TEFL? Anything I can do in the humanities/non-STEM? I considered occupational therapy at one point, but I #8217;m not sure about whether I can straight move to another country and get sponsored for that. I #8217;m not a fan of politics either, so it depends on the government job for me. I #8217;m really lost right now, and I #8217;ve considering just giving up and doing peace corps or bar tending until I keel over. I don #8217;t want to live frugally, but I #8217;m also not smart enough for a good job where people make decent living. I #8217;m an autistic introvert with adhd and depression and sometimes I feel like I #8217;m not cut out for life and jobs and school, etc. My number one choice is teaching right now, but I know what unless it #8217;s TEFL, teaching isn #8217;t something that a country is willing to sponsor you for because many local women can do the same thing. I #8217;ve been looking at skilled labor pages for the countries I would love to move to as well. I am currently in the college application process, so I #8217;m trying to plan my future and career now, without having to enter undecided. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you guys in advance! Tl;dr - I #8217;d like to find a job that has a good work life balance where I can move easily to another country permanently that isn #8217;t TEFL (I #8217;ve already considered TEFL, I #8217;m just looking for something to do afterwards).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know why, but I have to be 100% left alone in order to even begin getting work done. My parents like to drag us with them to the store and stuff, have me watch their kids, make dinner, etc., and that always throws off my entire day. I could have lots of time left at the end of the day, but because I didn #8217;t start working at the time that I wanted to, I can no longer focus, and my work never gets done. I have all of my summer reading assignments left to do and school starts next week. I #8217;ve been trying to get it done but my parents have been running around a lot, and they won #8217;t compromise so that I can stay home. I #8217;ve thought about just sleeping during the day and working during the night while everyone else is asleep, but my body gets tired at certain times, and the silence/lack of nutrition may get to me. Does anyone have any tips to focus when the people around you are always so busy and you can #8217;t get away from them? Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I lost one of my good friends and I need help finding them again (TW)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-01 18:09:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a really weird thing to request advice for, but I made a great friend online about a year ago. We talked a lot and though they may not have known, I really confided in that person. As someone who can barely make friends in real life due to crippling anxiety, I truly love my online friends, and this one specifically had me really worried. The last time I heard of them was back in March of 2019. They were diagnosed with a serious mental illness, was in and out of the mental hospital, considering sxicide, and disappeared from literally every platform. At first I assumed that I said something wrong and they blocked me, but everything, from Tumblr, Instagram, the website we met on, Discord, etc., ALL of their accounts are deleted. (No they weren't some 40 year old catfish btw.) We have some mutual online friends together whom I've asked if they heard from this kid, and they all said no. That they'd completely disappeared. I got a hold of their boyfriend online, who said he was talking to them around the beginning of August, but I believe he passed several days ago, as he announced he was going to ctb. I've gotten in contact with the people in his profile, and I'm still waiting to hear back. The only information I have on this person is their first name, age, birthday, what they look like, the city they live in (all information that was given to me by that person), and an idea of the usernames they'd used based on old ones if they ever decided to make a new account. I know I must sound insane right now, but I genuinely miss this person and I'm desperate to see if they're safe, or if they're still around. I want to know how to reach this person again, although right now it seems utterly impossible. I've already had two friends of mine die this year (one of which was close to the kid I'm looking for now) and I can't imagine losing another. Is there some way that I'm not thinking of that I could reunite with this online friend? If there is no way to find my friend, is there at least a way to cope with the fact that I'll never hear from them again?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So basically, I'm trying to leave America for college. My dad makes too much money for financial aid, I'm not smart enough for a full ride, and my parents don't want to pay a cent. School here is way too expensive for me to afford on my own, so I was looking for cheaper schools abroad. The cheapest I've found was for 5k in the Philippines, 10k in Malaysia, and 22k in Barbados, all of which at some point, I considered. Even my state school is super expensive, and community college isn't an option for me. If I were to get a degree from a non-English speaking country such as Malaysia, or a "second world" country that speaks English such as Barbados, would that hinder my ability to get a job in certain Asian/European/South American countries?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-21 17:30:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ever since I was a kid, it #8217;s been a dream of mine to teach abroad. I am going off to college next year, and I plan to get my bachelor #8217;s, master #8217;s, and then eventually a CELTA abroad. With the programs I #8217;m looking into, there #8217;s a 5 year master plan where I can get both my bachelors and masters in 5 years, and within that program, I will get my student teaching and licensure. The thing is, if I am planning to teach in international schools abroad permanently, I will have to keep renewing my teaching license. Is there a way to do this without returning to the US or having any connections/footprints there? Should I look into getting my license somewhere else, such as the UK? Or is it not possible to default at all if I need to keep renewing my US teaching license?</TEXT>

So far, I have this: \-I ask for LOR with my resume, \-She agrees \-I send her an invite through Common App and it shows up to her as an email. \-She writes LOR through that email somehow and it makes its way back to me. \-I use the LOR she wrote to me for my apps. Is this all she needs to know? Is there a way I can upload her hand written letter to Common App to make it easier for her? Is there a way I can explain it in a more simple manner?

    <DATE>2019-09-24 20:32:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>But for some reason, I don #8217;t feel scared. My nmom is trying to make me lie to them in order to save her, is being manipulative as fuck right now, and is being all types of nice to me, but to be honest, I don #8217;t care anymore. The past few times this happened, they didn #8217;t even speak to me, and when I came home from school, everything just got significantly worse. She #8217;s trying to manipulate me. Telling me it #8217;s my fault as usual, and trying to justify years of abuse. I truly don #8217;t care if I get taken away (although now that I #8217;m thinking about it, I may be too old haha). Heck, I don #8217;t care if SHE gets taken away. But I hope that something does happen, so that she can finally have some sort of wake up call. I #8217;m ready for it. Let #8217;s do this folks! **Updates since people wanted to see them:** My nmom came up with the genius idea of getting us out of the house before the folks arrived. At around 4:30pm, she had my dad take us (my older sister and I) with him to the store. We were out for a few hours, and returned around 7pm. I wanted to be there when they came (if they even did) and I told my nmom that I wasn #8217;t going to leave my room, but she forced me out of the house with threats regardless. I had a nice time with my dad and sister but I couldn #8217;t help but feel angry. I #8217;m not sure if the CPS folks even showed up (even though they said they would), but she was visibly angry when we got back. She said nothing to any of us, and we went upstairs quietly as not to bother her. Whenever she is angry she occasionally has her tantrums where she slams things down and mumbles under her breath, says  #8220;I don #8217;t give a ____ #8221; when we ask her a question, etc. I don #8217;t know what went down, but she is still getting phone calls about the situation from the school and other authority figures. The last time this happened, we jumped states to avoid ruining her reputation (and possibly jail time jaja). I heard her talking about it again, but it #8217;s not really her decision, as she has no money to do so. **Update #2:** So I found out (from eavesdropping on her gossiping with her friends) that they didn #8217;t show up. The reason she was angry was because she kept receiving those concerned phone calls, and despite trying to convince the school that everything is okay, they still want to send someone over to  #8220;make sure the children are safe. #8221; The CPS people will be coming either today or on Thursday. Probably while I #8217;m at school, just like last time : #8217;)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-24 21:09:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>So for some reason, my brain is wired funny and after being sad for a period of time I #8217;ll have this sudden spike in energy and the happiest happiness I could ever imagine that only lasts about a few days before I go back to being at an all time low again. So during this happy period, I #8217;ve decided that I am better than a 1050/21, and that I will retake the SAT and ACT again. The problem is, I am a senior (my parents didn #8217;t let me take my standardized tests prior to the summer of my senior year, hence why I started so late) and I only have 3 more opportunities combined for both tests. I plan to do all three, unless my parents throw another hissy fit about it being on a Weekend and tell me I can #8217;t. My goal right now is to get to a 1300 (in a month, yes) because it #8217;s around the score you need to get into my dream college (Barnard). The two books I have right now are -The Princeton Review: Cracking the SAT Premium, 2019 Edition and -College Board: The official SAT Study Guide plus 6 practice tests left on Khan Academy. These are the only books I #8217;ll have because my parents won #8217;t buy me anything else lol. But I #8217;ll make do. I #8217;m really scared but also really determined at the moment. I don #8217;t really know why I #8217;m typing this, but whenever I #8217;m in a rut, it #8217;s hard to get me to do anything really, and I #8217;m proud of myself for beginning this year on a semi positive note where I actually put in effort. Sorry for bothering you all and I hope you #8217;re all having a great day. Wish me luck on this! I really think I can do it this time :)</TEXT>

I come home from school at 3:15, have an hour to eat and usually start my homework around 4:30 at the latest.

I have a mega exam coming up that my life depends on and I want to know how to stay up until at least 10pm studying. Right now, I'm trying to drink lots of liquids, and sit in my sister's room for company (because I feel upset when everyone goes to be before me and I like to know that I'm not the only conscious person in the house), but I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to stay away just a teeny bit longer.

I #8217;m not good at anything STEM/Finance/Medical/Managerial, and people keep saying that a humanities degree will get you nowhere, so there goes my chance of making a career out of anything that I #8217;m actually good at.

I really don #8217;t want to die, but there #8217;s literally nothing that I want to do in life. I want to leave my family behind because my nmom is the absolute worst and keeps telling me that she wants me to suffer in life, but I can #8217;t afford college on my own, I #8217;m not smart enough for scholarships, and she refused to let me go to school for anything other than nursing. My adhd and autism makes it too difficult to do anything and I can #8217;t afford medicine. I have literally nothing going for me and I don #8217;t want to just barely make it through life.

    <DATE>2019-10-07 12:04:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am 17 years old, and ever since I was young, I #8217;ve hard these excruciatingly painful periods. It usually only happens during the first day, but going to school with them has been absolutely horrible. My nmom refuses to take me to a doctor or let me have painkillers (and there #8217;s no one else in my life who can get me there), so I have to steal from her when she #8217;s not around or hoard them whenever I find any laying around the house. I only ever use them on the first day, however, and even today as I #8217;m off to school I decided to try a heating pack so I can stop relying on medication. I tried convincing her to let me go on the pill, and even tried finding ways to get it myself (although I #8217;d have to pay AND it #8217;s coming to her address). Nothing has come out of it. My periods are usually irregular, lasting 5 days max, yet happening almost every other month. The pain makes me so freaking suicidal to the point where I sat in my kitchen for 10 minutes this morning contemplating whether I should go to school or go upstairs and hang myself. Even here on the bus as I type this Ijust want to stab myself with scissors or do something, ANYTHING to end the pain. I #8217;m sweating, I feel like I #8217;m going to collapse, and I have to pee every five seconds (which doesn #8217;t work at school because class). It doesn #8217;t help that I already have severe depression. I #8217;ve read the symptoms of endometriosis and I #8217;m pretty sure I don #8217;t have that, but I can #8217;t be too sure. I never want kids. EVER. And having to deal with this is so unbearable. I #8217;m exhausted just typing this. I #8217;ve heard that if you get an ablation at a young age, the lining will grow back and raise hell. I wanted to get one in college, but I #8217;ve heard that it #8217;s best to wait until your 30s for it to be permanent. What age do you recommend getting an ablation at? For women who have had an ablation, what age did you get yours, and was it permanent?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-08 11:50:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently a senior in high school trying to figure out what to pursue, so I wanted to verify this plan before I actually go through with it. My first, more realistic plan, is to go to college in the US and become a physiotherapist here, then move out to NZ when I #8217;ve made enough money to support myself on a skilled worker visa (since physio is on the long term shortage list). My second, dream plan, was to attend college in New Zealand, but my parents most certainly won #8217;t allow that, and I also can #8217;t afford it. When I researched the requirements for being a physiotherapist in NZ, the only thing I needed was a Bachelors in physiotherapy or something equivalent, and then an NCEA Level 3, but I #8217;m still researching that since I #8217;m not sure what it is. I #8217;m also contemplating going into education, but that takes way more steps and I heard they don #8217;t have it great over there so let #8217;s not worry about that haha. If I am coming from the US, would I have to retake any exams or classes to meet New Zealand #8217;s standards, or will I be all set and I can just get a job? If I do, how would I go about doing this? Would I go to New Zealand and take said classes on a working holiday or student visa and then transfer to the skilled worker visa after I find a job, or would I be offered a job, I come over on the SWV and I take classes as I work? How different is this career in New Zealand from what it is in America (asking New Zealanders or others who may know)? Thank you guys in advance, and if I didn #8217;t touch on anything important that I should know, please tell me!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nmom keeps stealing my [17F] stuff and getting rid of them. Is there a way I can take everything with me to college?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-17 00:13:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll admit that I'm a bit of a hoarder when it comes to memories, but I only like to keep things that hold extremely significant values. My parents did an overhaul of my room to switch out my bed, and I've noticed a bunch of my childhood items missing. I confronted my nmom about it, and she claims that "I don't need them anymore" and I "need to grow up." First things first, that's literally the worst thing you can ever tell someone who didn't have a childhood to begin with. Second of all, I don't hang onto them for childish reasons, I held onto them for sentimental reasons. For example, one of the things she took was a collection of CDs given to me by my older sister. Another thing that I found out she actually sold was a collection of vintage Disney princess figurines given to me by my sister who passed away almost 10 years ago. I had sensory playdough that I used in school to help me out, she took it. I had blankets given to me by my grandmother, she took them. I had a book also given to me by my dear sister and she took that as well, but luckily I found where she was keeping it and took it back. I had several novels that were given to me when I was younger that have notes in them from family members who are no longer around, and she took them. She's also been giving my stuff to her other kids, who she has voiced several times that she likes more than me. I'm really not trying to be selfish. If she thinks that I have too many collectables, I'd be willing to bargain with her and give anything away. But tossing things that deceased family members gave to me and things that have an ungodly amount of sentimental value hurts me in unexplainable ways. I just want my things back. I've been contemplating at this point whether I actually want to go to college or not, but if I do, I want to make sure that my belongings are safe. I have no friends or anyone that I trust to give away my items to, and my living sister still rooms at our house so she can't hide anything from my nmom. I've thought about packing every little thing that I own (which realistically isn't even that much anyways) and taking it with me to college, but university dorms are the size of fast food restaurant bathrooms and I doubt that stuff would have a place in there unless I get lucky. Is there a way that I can secure my stuff away from home while at the same time not having it on me 24/7? I was thinking a Uhaul Storage but instead a locker for small items that I can rent out for a certain period of time? Also is there anything I can do about my nmom taking my stuff? I've heard about the police presence thingy where they can accompany you in retrieving your belongings, but if she doesn't want to return them she can very much pretend like they never existed and nothing can be done about it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>17F US to Barbados/The West Indies - How to Get Out Through a Parent's Citizenship?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-20 00:45:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am currently in the college application process, and I've been looking at schools abroad. My scores are not good enough to get into universities in the UK, which is where I was previously looking, and the only other country on my list (NZ) is too expensive for me at the moment. My mother is from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and there is a law there that says my siblings and I can get citizenship through her. If I can somehow figure that out, I saw on the Bajan immigration website that citizens of CARICOM countries (aka West Indian countries) get exceptions when it comes to visas. I was looking to attend the University of the West Indies in Barbados then get a job there, but I am not sure if Bajan laws allow for that to happen, and if there are a decent amount of jobs for graudates in the first place. I'm also not sure if foreigners can work while on a student visa. I'm still contemplating going to Med School in the Caribbean as well as a way to get out, and afterwards getting a job in one of the West Indian countries since according to [this](https://www.learn4good.com/jobs/index.php?controller=job_list amp;action=display_search_results amp;page_number=1) and [this](https://www.caribbeanjobs.com/) website there's a pretty average demand for medical careers, but that's not all I'm looking into. I've also considered going to school here in the US if I can afford it, teaching abroad for a few years or working in order to gain experience, then looking for a for on the islands. The reason I don't want to return to our country at the moment is because jobs are scarce and there's an unbelievable amount of violence there these days. Although I do have family there still who would never leave because they love it so much, I just feel like there are safer Caribbean nations out there such as Barbados, Grenada, Dominica, etc. Similarly, the reason I'm not considering the US Virgin Islands is because 1) It's very hurricane prone unlike what I was used to back in SVG, and 2) there's something about it that's not the same as the vibe back home. I don't know if it's because it's too Americanized or what. It's not completely off the table though. I was actually looking at attending college there, but the only school they have is an HBCU and I'm not black. I've done my research on some websites but most of the information is for beach bums that want to kick it on the islands (nothing wrong with that, just not what I was looking for). I'm also almost certain that no job would want to sponsor foreigners to come over there unless they're from neighboring islands, so I want to be in the country on a visa that would last before I go job searching. The Caribbean countries I am looking at after graduation are: Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, Cura #231;ao, and possibly the USVI. The careers I'm considering are: Education/Teaching, nurse/doctor/healthcare, HR, marketing/sales, etc. Given this information, what are some of my options? Some more specific questions: 1) Can I work while on a student visa in Barbados? The websites I checked didn't have this information. 2) What is the best way to get a visa/ a job in one of the Caribbean islands after graduating from school? Is there a way to be in the country before I apply for jobs, or must I find someone willing to sponsor me with a visa before I can come? For example, can I just head over there (since Americans don't need visas to go to some islands), find a job, get said job, and then be granted a work visa after applying? 3) What are my odds of getting a job and being able to move permanently back to the Caribbean as a US citizen? Even though I am part Caribbean myself, I still think that because I've been gone from there for so long I'll have a hard time finding a career there when competeing against locals. Do you think it'll be easier to apply for citizenship in St Vincent first and then go to other countries, or will having a US passport be an advantage? My main reason for moving to the Caribbean isn't because I want to chill on the beach, do touristy things, drink rum, and live in "paradise." I know the tough realities of living in a developing country, how island fever works, and that nothing will be the same. Aside from the personal reasons I want to leave the US, I miss home so much right now, and I miss how life used to be while I was growing up there, which is why I'm considering moving back. I'm not 100% on my decision to move yet, I'm just evaluating my options before I choose a country. Thank you all in advance, and if I was unclear about anything, please ask about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't want to give out my real name exactly as it's super old and semi-rare atm, but I was thinking of using anagrams of my first or middle name to find a nice little nickname for college. My choices so far are: **Thea \[Thee-Uh or They-Uh\]** \- I think this would make more sense considering my first name, but I heard people don't like it as much. If you do, please tell my which pronunciation is more pleasing to the ear! **Alma \[AHL-muh\] -** Part of my middle name/what my friends used to call me when paired with the next name. I like this one a lot, but it's still hard to choose. **Maka \[MAH-kah\]** \- Short for my middle name, which is pronounced \[mahkah-LAY or maka-lei\]. I've been going by this on the internet and I'm afraid that's going to eventually get me in trouble since no one uses that name. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just the other day I started rescheduling my suicide. I hopped onto the SS website, revisited my old noose that #8217;s still in my closet, and trying to figure out where my carotids were. I was almost certain I was ready to go. Then that same day my sister and I were talking about our futures and though I still want to die, that pain and the left. I want to live to see my big sissy get married, and make sure she #8217;s safe from our horrible parents. I didn #8217;t want to be selfish. But my nmom has a history of doing things that she knows will piss me off and she does it just to get a rouse out of me. I have mental issues and though she doesn #8217;t like to admit it, she knows it. She #8217;ll do small things that #8217;ll leave me mad for days or cause me to pick up self harming. The fact that she does it on purpose knowing damn well that I #8217;m going to be upset gets me. She did it again today, and I decided to reschedule. I #8217;m planning for March of 2020, or maybe even my 18th birthday in February. I don #8217;t want to die, but I don #8217;t want to live here. People always recommend going somewhere else but they never realize that not every child has the blessing of family who will take them in or a reliable CPS in their state to take them away. Some of us have to stay and suffer, and it #8217;s unbearable. Every time I get the courage e to live, some other unfortunate event happens in my life making me want to die. I just can #8217;t take it anymore. Life sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to the [USVI Ministry of Education website](https://www.vide.vi/jobs), there seems to be a plethora of teaching jobs open. I am still planning out my future right now, and the Caribbean is one of the places I am looking into since I have connections there. I am 17F from the mainland US, and I currently plan to attend university and eventually move to the USVI after graduation. My first course of action was to receive St Vincent dual citizenship from my parent, but then I realized that I wouldn't need a visa to go there from the mainland. Is it as easy as moving there with some money, obtaining a job and licensure, then going about my life, as if I were simply moving to a new state, or is there more involved in moving to St. Croix? I've done some research and from the looks of it, I'm pretty much set as long as I have enough money to survive and a job lined up. I was just checking here to make sure, just in case there was someone else who has done it and succeeded. Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I go to college for nursing or teaching?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-30 00:41:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay so, I'm going to college soon and I'm still trying to figure out what to major in. I've looked into Immigration Social Work, ESL/Spanish Teacher, Mental Health or Pediatric Nurse, and Child Life Specialist as a career. My parents want me to go into the medical field but I'm horrible at math and not a fan of biology. However, the pay does look extremely good for a 4 year degree. I'm leaning towards nursing for the money and the more I look into teacher the more unpleasant it sounds having to deal with kids who don't want to learn, but I still miss the aspect of being able to dress how I want on the job and not have to be professional 24/7. CLS pays peanuts apparently and is extremely competitive to get into, but that's something that if I decide to switch over to, I can get a master's in with an Education degree. I've wanted to be a teacher since I was young, but at the same time I don't think I can survive solely on a teacher's salary in this economy. I'm not a fan of nursing but it does make good money and I love the mental health sector (as someone who has struggled and is still struggling with mental health issues of their own.)  #8203;  gt;!Pros of teaching:! lt;
      gt;!\- I get to wear what I want! lt;
      gt;!\- Stressful, but not as stressful as nursing! lt;
      gt;!\- I like stationary! lt;
      gt;!\- I'm passionate about ELL, ESOL, and the Spanish language, which I can utilize more in schools! lt;

      <TEXT>**Miniature Rant/Understanding of My Situation:** I \[17F\] just finished 1st quarter of my Senior year and a bunch of my classmates have already turned in their applications. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here being difficult and not knowing what to do with myself. I would go to community college, but I don't want to live at home anymore. And as my parents are extremely controlling, I never learned how to fend for myself in the real world. I'm afraid I'll end up in a situation worse than I already am. Plus, not going to college isn't a choice, because, like I said, if I don't go, I'm getting kicked out - And I have no idea how to survive out there if this ever happens. Sure, I have interests, but none of them pays the bills. When I finally set my heart on something I find out the true horrors of it which drive me away. I want to do so much, but at the same time, I don't want to do anything at all. I used to have these goshdarn amazing dreams when I was young, but as soon as I hit about 10 these feelings of sadness, nervousness, and self hate has been consuming me ever since. I just don't want to do anything anymore. I don't necessarily want to die but I don't want to live, either. At least not a job where I have to fake being happy just to rake in a few dollars to feed myself every month. I don't know. I'm just extremely overwhelmed right now. **Careers I Have Thought About Over the Years:** \- I thought about teaching or **TEFLing**, but I realized that many countries aren't ready for a little brown 'Nesian girl and I could face a lot of backlash which scared me off. In addition to that, I hate having to talk in front of people and I prefer not to deal with kids in a school setting, unless in a place where I am more comfortable (see below). \- I thought about **social work**. I really wanted to help LGBT or Pasifika youth or immigrant families but I've heard how stressful the job is for such little pay. I know every job is stressful, but I'm not great under pressure, and I feel as though social work will take the world's largest toll on me. In addition to this, the job isn't transferable, and I want to leave the States. \- I thought about becoming a **mortician**, but I heard the hours are hell and the field is extremely competitive. As much as I fancy death care, I feel as though having to act brave around mourning individuals will get frustrating after a while. Although I do enjoy the looks of the embalming process. \- I thought about **teaching ELL/Spanish speakers**, but I haven't found out exactly how that would apply, or where to start when looking for this type of job. It's still something I'm super passionate about, but again, if I plan to leave the country, I don't think this program exists elsewhere. \- I thought about doing an **RN** or **DH** program, but I heard that RN is extremely exhausting, and DH is extremely competitive, though both make great money. Other jobs I've been looking at were **Librarian** (competitive), **Curator** (competative/too much schooling), **Museum Tech** (not many jobs/competitive), **Esthetician** (commision based/not great pay), **Counsellor/Therapist** (too draining/poor pay), **Child Life Specialist** (not enough info on it), **Dance Fitness Studio Owner** (not a good entrepeneur), **CRNA** (too much school/too difficult), **Mental Health Nurse** (heard horror stories/draining), **CSI** (don't want to work for a government), and probably many others I can't think of off of the top of my head. **My Current Ideas:** My plan right now is to either 1. Become a Physiotherapist then move to New Zealand since they're in demand there, although I heard PTs have tons of debt and it's quite a bit of schooling. I used to want to become a Physical Therapist for Rugby players/olympians but that's a STRETCH. 2. Do something like teach in South America/Mexico for the rest of my life, eventually teach online (the route I'm taking now). Can't really find any cons to this one, really, although whenever I talk about TEFLing peoples say "don't go to SA/CA, the pay is so few waahhh!!" I don't wish to live luxuriously if I'm being honest. SA/M sounds super nice right now. 3. Make some cash stripping/bartending and probably end up c-ingtb at a young age because I hate life (jk although a week ago I was actually considering this haha). Bartending is actually a great career but I heard it gets tiring and I know absolutely nothing about drinks. Plus to be a female bartender you have to be good looking, which I am far from. I'm most interested in World History, Languages, Cultures (but only some cultures, I actually have a strong hatred for others), and that's about it. I hate politics, anything involving math or hard sciences, activism, hard labor, sitting jobs, anything STEM, dealing with people (in certain settings, not all), but most of the time I can work through \[some\] of these with a smile. So yeah. I apologize sincerely for the super long post but it's something that has been bothering me for years now. I know I have to get that depression fixed to actually start feeling anything but that's not something I can do right now so I have to work with what I got. Any ideas of careers that I'm completely overlooking are appreciated. If there are any flaws in my plans, feel free to correct me on that as well. **TL;DR** \--- gt; [I've got depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pypV-JPU1k) (and ASD) \*black flips\* and I have no passions in life. I plan right now to sell my soul to a TEFL degree and teach in South America/Mexico for the rest of my life because I'm too not smart to do anything else but I'm not sure if that's the only thing I have left for me. Thank you guys so much in advance for reading this atrocity/helping me out.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2019-11-16 14:32:57</DATE>
      <TEXT>Sorry for the useless rant but I just needed to get this out of my system. Every freaking weekend my nmom forces us to go outside in the yard and pick up every single leaf out there until the yard is spotless (mind you, my front and back yard combined is about a mile long because we live in bumfuck, nowhere). I understand the desire to keep things clean but when she literally sits around the house all day watching tv, eating, and playing games on her phone then waits until we come home from school to do the work she could #8217;ve been doing this whole time, it pisses me off. That woman has literally never held a job in her life and is more useless around the house than our pet birds because she just doesn #8217;t do anything. We have to clean. We have to do the yard. We have to make food for ourselves (and the only thing in the house we #8217;re allowed to eat is TV dinners, which is why I straight up don #8217;t eat sometimes.) she never helps do any of the chores and then gets so mad at us whenever it #8217;s done improperly. I, like many kids in this world, go to school for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, which isn #8217;t bad at all. That is the equivalent of nearly 35 hours a week, which is almost 40 hours a week, which is basically a full time job. School is not my issue, but to be fair I #8217;m always so freaking exhausted on Fridays that I just need a moment to sit down and have a break. This woman will have us out there in the yard from the time I get home to sometimes 1-2am just because she can and she wants to. Then we have to do it all again on Saturday because some leaves fell in the yard. I can never take a break because on Sundays I have so much homework and studying that I can barely take a nap. I #8217;m currently failing several classes because I never have enough time on the weekends to do work, or because I fall asleep at school from lack of sleep. I don #8217;t know what the point of this is, but I #8217;m just so frustrated with how my nmom, a housewife, never does anything around this house and gets to relax 24/7, but from such a young age we had to work doing the things that she as a mother and housewife is supposed to be doing without breaks. I #8217;m physically and mentally exhausted, my grades are suffering, and there are so many days that I #8217;ve considered suicide just to avoid having to go outside in that freezing ass weather for nearly 10 hours a day just doing straight work. I #8217;m so tired. I #8217;m so very tired. Even as I sit here right now I #8217;m debating on whether I have 20 minutes to go through with my plan because of this stupid ass headache, this 30 degree weather, and the amount of homework I have due next week. Idk, I #8217;m just so done at this point. Maybe it #8217;s me being lazy like she always says. Thanks for listening guys. Did any of your nparents force you to do hard labor/extreme chores as a kid? How did you handle it? Right now the only thing that keeps me happy out there is my podcasts. It still sucks tho. Have a great day y #8217;all  lt;3</TEXT>

      <TITLE>How far in advance can I send my applications without transcripts + scores?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2019-11-17 16:38:48</DATE>
      <TEXT>Basically my parents are refusing to pay the 22 dollars required for me to get an official transcript from my guidance counsellor, plus the extra money needed to send my SAT/ACT scores. I'm pretty much ready to send in my applications but I'm afraid that something will go wrong if I don't send in my transcript at the same time. In addition to this, I have absolutely no freaking clue how to send SAT scores to schools that aren't on the Common App, despite reading multipe articles from College Board about how to do so. Can I send in my applications without the official transcripts/scores, even if it's months in advance? Will that have any negative impacts on the process? Wouldn't that also hinder me from getting considered for scholarships?</TEXT>

      <TITLE>My nmom put schools on the FAFSA that I don #8217;t plan on applying to, and she refuses to let me see it/add my own schools. I don #8217;t think I #8217;d be able to get money for certain schools if I don #8217;t put them on the FAFSA, which I think is her plan.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2019-11-18 19:36:46</DATE>
      <TEXT>Long story short, I want to get as far as I can from my parents in college. The schools that I #8217;m looking at aren #8217;t necessarily far away, but they aren #8217;t in state. I don #8217;t have the scores to get into our state school, and the others I #8217;m just not interested in. She decides to fill out the fafsa without me and put a bunch of schools that SHE wants me to apply to on there (I know this because I caught a glimpse of it, and she also decreased the amount of schools I had initially). She put a bunch of colleges on there that I have no chance of getting into because of my SAT simply because she wants her friends to see that her kid is applying to some top schools (which I am not). She #8217;s also refusing to give me the correct amount of money to get my transcripts from my counselor and I have no other means of getting cash (unless I somehow get my sister to do it for me). She #8217;s doing this because she #8217;s angry at me for not wanted to go into the medical field like she wanted me to, but also because she wants me to go to community college so she can keep her grasp on me (like she #8217;s currently doing to my sister, who #8217;s an adult, and is not allowed to have an type of independence whatsoever.) I feel like she knows that if I don #8217;t get money and can #8217;t afford it I can #8217;t go, so she #8217;s trying to sabotage me or something (I know this is a heavy accusation, but trust me. I, along with many others, know the type of person she is. In addition to this FAFSA thing, I have guidance fees, application fees, and score sending fees that she #8217;s not trying to pay. I don #8217;t qualify for free anything, not allowed to get a job, and the only person who I have access to who has money is my sister (who is currently the one helping me). **Questions:** I guess my purpose of posting this is to ask, how the heck am I supposed to be considered for financial aid if my nmom doesn #8217;t put the correct schools on the fafsa? Do I just rely on scholarships from this point on? What do I do if I don #8217;t qualify for free waivers? Tl;dr - My nmom screwed up my fafsa for her own selfish reasons and is refusing to pay or allow me to pay my college fees. I #8217;m afraid that I won #8217;t receive money for college and will have to stay home, which I really don #8217;t want to do. Thanks in advance y #8217;all and I wish all of you the best of luck in the college application process  lt;3</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m planning on going out around Thanksgiving break, but I don #8217;t feel like doing my homework tonight so I #8217;ll probably just do it now. I initially planned to put my cats in the bathroom or my sisters room so they don #8217;t devour my corpse because they #8217;re both fat little shits and will literally eat out of the trash at 5am even if there #8217;s tons of food left out for them. I searched Reddit and it says that cats will only eat you after a few days. I #8217;m pretty sure my parents will find me within an hour or so, so do I need to move the cats out of my room? Idk, they #8217;re the thing that I #8217;ll miss the most so I wanted to be with them until the second I died, but now I #8217;m reconsidering that because I don #8217;t want them to get sick from eating me. I know this sounds troll-y but it #8217;s a legit question. I care more than anything about those babies and I want to make sure I #8217;m doing this right. Thanks in advance  lt;3</TEXT>

I'm going to write a formal one on a different website for my internet friends over on Instagram so they won't be upset when I stop responding to them. Basically, as the title says, people, mostly my nmom, and life, mainly being born into an ugly family situation, sucks, and I thought I could live with it, but I can't anymore. I planned to go last weekend but found some kind of desire to live and motivation to do my homework blah blah blah so I didn't. Tomorrow, imma have to go do the same hard labor that's been making me want to kill myself for the past 7 years or so and I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to. I'm so close to the end of senior year, the moment when I can move out of this godforsaken household, yet I don't want to continue. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and my nmom is too selfish to care. I'm going to miss a lot of people and a lot of things, but from what I've heard, the afterlife sounds super amazing, so I think it'll be worth it. Thanks to those of you who despite your anonymity, still behave humanely towards your fellow humans online. Thank you to those of who have been there for me before, despite me posting very little on this sub.

      <TITLE>What are the risks of reusing an essay topic?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2019-12-07 23:56:45</DATE>
      <TEXT>So, at first, I wanted to write my essay about my Misophonia, but then I did a quick internet search and realized someone already did an essay about it and hit many of the points that I would've made (such as always wearing headphones and hating ASMR, etc.), so I decided to scratch that idea. Another topic I was thinking about was being racially mislabeled growing up and what it's like growing up multiracial but I feel like that's an overused one. Lastly, I was thinking of writing about how growing up listening to different genres of music from my numerous backgrounds (for example, my nmother is Vincy so I grew up listening to Alston Beckett Cyrus, or my dad was adopted by a lovely Southern couple so I grew up listening to Conway Twitty) shaped who I am today and my interests. My question is, 1) How risky would it be writing about something as specific as Misophonia that someone else has already written about? 2) What is the risk in reusing old essays written in class (revised, of course)? 3) Which of these topics appear to be the most interesting?

      <TITLE>Mixed Asians, Hapas, and non-Asians saying the C word and other racial slurs: How do you feel about it? (+ a rant)</TITLE>
      <DATE>2019-12-14 19:33:18</DATE>
      <TEXT>[https://imgur.com/a/QKkdJoU](https://imgur.com/a/QKkdJoU) Over the past four years at my school, I've noticed many mixed Asians, mainly blasians and a few "wasians" who would freely call themselves "Ch\*\*ks" and tell their non-Asian friends that it's alright to say it. Yes, it's their life and they should be alllowed to say whatever they please, but at the same time for some reason it pisses me off so much that these people feel like they can normalize a word that's so damaging when they aren't even 100% Asian. As a Hapa person myself, I shouldn't really be talking, but my friends and I dislike the word because of the connotation, and we believe that we're not necessarily Asian enough to say it in the first place (which is something I'll come back to later). Just this past week I was in my APES class with a girl who is half Filipino, and she was having a conversation with her non-Asian friends about someone who accidentally picked up something that was hers. The conversation went as follows: Girl: "I'm half Asian so I'm not being racist, but I swear to god Asian people stay thinking they can get away with all types of shit" (and some other pretty racist/hurtful things.) Guy: "Oh shoot you a ch\*nk?" Girl: "Yes I'm a ch\*nk, what did you think I was mixed with? I'm the ch\*nkiest b\*tch up in this class!" Mind you, this is a girl who claims that Filipinos are Pacific Islanders and calls herself Moana. This is also a girl who you wouldn't know is mixed period without her telling you. She identifies mainly with her black side and talks so much crap about Asians that it physically pains me to be in a room with her, and then claims that she can't be racist because she's half Asian herself. Not only did this piss me off yesterday, but I woke up today and saw the above photo on my timeline. I respected her a lot as an artist because she actually acknowledges her Asian side and has done things for her community, but knowing that the majority of her followers are not Asian and allowing them to comment that word and other BS fetishizing Asian females really got to me. At least Hapa artists like Shenseea are respectful enough to not call themselves racial slurs and make dog eating jokes in order to please black/white people online. We've had incidents like this happen all the time at our school. A kid on my bus was calling Hispanics "Sp\*cks" and Asians "Ch\*nks," then when confronted by my Korean friend told her that he could say whatever he wanted because his girlfriend was Filipino. Another girl (who isn't part Asian at all) wore chopsticks in her hair and a kimono for no apparent reason and went around talking about how "Chinese" she looked that day, and when confronted by an Asian student (not from my friend group) said she can do whatever she wanted and "everybody came from Africa so it's technically her culture too." It's funny to me that saying that the N word is the most problematic thing you can ever do in your life, but using racial slurs against any other race is a-okay in today's society. The amount of times I've been called a curry-n\* or "coolie" by non-Asians is ridiculous. My friend, who's half-Japanese/Hong Konger has been called "J\*p" on multiple occasions, and his half-Korean girlfriend "g\*\*k," words that I've never even heard before until I moved to this tiny town. For the Hapas, I know that it is who they are and no one has room to tell them what they can and cannot say if they actually are part Asian, but some of these people barely identify with their Asian heritage, or only do so when beneficial to them. In addition to that, one could hardly tell that they're mixed until they say so because of how white/black passing they are, and even then you don't know whether it's true because for some reason so many people here think that being part Asian is some kind of Aesthetic (which my friends and I have caught many times after seeing someone's parents or their school contact card, which states their real race, even if you're mixed). For non-Asians, literally no one is telling these people that the stuff they're saying is offensive and wrong. When someone does, it's usually just the Asian kids, and no one listens to us anyway because apparently it's the Oppression Olympics here. Stuff like this just really gets me angry because of the double standard surrounding racial slurs. I've heard people who actually think that you can't be racist towards Asians. These are the same people who call every minor inconvenience "racist" and get triggered when someone tells them that their behavior is unacceptable. I mentioned before that my friends and I aren't necessarily "Asian enough" to say the C word. I personally am South/Southeast Asian mixed with some other stuff. My friends are mostly either Melanesian mixed with East Asian, or South Asian. We discussed that because we don't go through the same thing that your average Asian goes through because of our looks, we don't have a right to say those types of slurs directly strictly towards those who are called "yellow" or "ch\*nky-eyed" by westerners. The same way that someone like Logic or Halsey isn't allowed to say the N word by his community even though they technically are half black. If I don't have to worry about being called "ching chong" or having someone pull their eyes up at me and speak with some racist stereotypical accent or whatever else, then I personally don't believe that I should be allowed to use the C word, even though I do acknowledge my Asian heritage. As hypocritical and horrible as it sounds, I think that unless someone respects their Asian culture or is actually some sort of Asian passing, they shouldn't be allowed to say those types of slurs either and normalize these terms that we're trying to get rid of in our society. Sorry for the rant and I apologize if the majority of this makes no sense at all, I'm not really a good writer (and my English sucks). The past few school days have been awful and I'm so very tired of the crap that we have to put up with, especially in 2019. The thing that makes it worse is that the majority of people here being racist towards Asians aren't even white, and we'd expect us minorities to get along and respect each other, but obviously that's not the case. That event really set me off because of how ongoing the racism towards Asians here has been, and no one is doing anything despite kids complaining about it to the staff. Just one more week until break and hopefully nothing like this happens again for the rest of the school year.</TEXT>

I mainly want to speak on the double standards I see around here and about my realizing what type of person I don #8217;t want to become after being surrounded by negativity, but I don #8217;t want to offend anyone who may disagree with some of the claims I make despite them being true, or think I #8217;m just bashing kids.

      <TEXT>Long story short, my nmom comes to me today saying "your auntie and I have been talking, and she says she'll let you move in with her if you major in nursing." This doesn't seem like a big deal, but my aunt lives in the country that I grew up in, and the one I so desperately want to move back to. We just got back from vacation over there, and I've been homesick ever since, so of course, I'm more sensitive right now. I'm 100% down if that means I get to go back there and live, but how am I supposed to know if this is a trap or not to make me go into nursing like she's always wanted? You see, my goal ever since I was little was to be an ESL teacher, and I planned on going straight into that. My nmom on the other hand has always wanted me to be a doctor or nurse, despite me literally failing math and biology every year. I don't want to lose this opportunity if it is real, but I also don't want to be stuck doing something that I am not passionate about if she decides to go back on her word. As of now, if what she's saying is true, I will get my AA in nursing and dip. Due to my high school bio and math grades, there's no way in hell I'm getting into a BSN program. Even if I do, I feel like it'll be too much for me, and I should dip my toes in before going for the whole thing. If I end up liking it and I have the opportunity, I want to go back to school for mental health nursing. What do you guys think? Should I trust her and major in what she wants me to if it means getting what I want in the end? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

What are some free programs (Job Corps, AmeriCorps, Workaway, etc.) where I could get paid and eventually have assistance in getting back to school?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-01-18 18:57:18</DATE>
      <TEXT>Before we start, I am 17F, will be 18 in one month, and graduating high school in four. Was hoping to go to college for Spanish/Education, and eventually become an ESL teacher. So long story short, my parents are refusing to help with my college applications. They don't want to help me fill out financial aid, they're refusing to mail my transcripts, refusing to pay my application fees, and refusing to send my SAT/ACT scores. I am completely running out of time, and at this point, it doesn't look like I'll be able to get into/afford college this year. **I considered community college,** but that would require me to stay at home, which I cannot do anymore. **I am also not allowed to get a job** in order to pay for myself to move out. **I don't have any friends** to move in with either. **The military** is also something I #8217;m not willing to do for personal reasons. As hard as it is, I'm trying to keep my head up and not give up so soon, so I've been looking at gap year programs or other opportunities to make some money while at the same time, not having to stay at home any longer. First, **I looked into Job Corps**, but after the millions of horror stories I've read, I'm not sure if I want to put myself in that situation. My sister decided to move to Job Corps instead of staying home after our parents wouldn't let her go to college either, and she used to cry to me every night about how awful it was. Girls were trying to kill themselves, others and staff. There were drugs, violence, fighting, etc. Now that she's home, her certifications aren't even allowing her to get a decent job. I'm not completely scratching it off of the list, but if I could avoid it, I will. Next, **I looked into AmeriCorps,** but they don't provide housing, and the small stipend they give will be eaten away by rent money. It is still an option for me though, because some money is better than no money. Then **I looked into possibly finding a roommate** and working for a year or so, but that would require me to have money to move in, and to be financially literate, which I am not. **I also looked into Workaway.** The problem with this one is that I'd need to be able to pay for a plane ticket in order get to the site that I'm going to work on, and even then, most hosts don't pay. Lastly, **I found out about CoolWorks**, which looks oh so promising. Almost too promising. From here it looks as though I'll need experience or at least a way to get out there, which I don't. They do provide room and board as well as a payment though, so I'm really hoping this could be the option for me. All of the gap year programs that I have looked at require some sort of fee, which I read here on Reddit not to pay to volunteer. My last option would be moving to Guam or something and stripping for a year (they pay for flights, room and board, and give you a weekly payment), which I don't necessarily want to do, but I'd be okay with doing if I had no other choice. My goal is to be able to make enough money to pay for community college at least, or maybe even my first semester of college, then move into working a real job so I can afford the rest of my education. It's not going to be easy but I have a lot of hope. If any of you guys know anything that I am not looking at that I should be, please let me know. I'm super desperate at this point. Education is extremely important to me, and I'm literally willing to sell my soul for it. Tl;dr - My abusive parents sabotaged my college plans and before I have to become a sex worker (even though there's nothing wrong with that) I want to find some way to work before I eventually jump back into school.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>No money, no job/job experience, and no freedom. How can I move out and start my life?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-01-20 18:58:17</DATE>
      <TEXT>Before we start, I am 17F, will be 18 in one month, and graduating high school in four. Was hoping to go to college for Spanish/Education, and eventually become an ESL teacher. So long story short, my parents are refusing to help with my college applications. They don't want to help me fill out financial aid, they're refusing to mail my transcripts, refusing to pay my application fees, and refusing to send my SAT/ACT scores. I am completely running out of time, and at this point, it doesn't look like I'll be able to get into/afford college this year. **I considered community college,** but that would require me to stay at home, which I cannot do anymore. **I am also not allowed to get a job** in order to pay for myself to move out. **I don't have any friends** to move in with either. **The military** is also something I #8217;m not willing to do for personal reasons. As hard as it is, I'm trying to keep my head up and not give up so soon, so I've been looking at gap year programs or other opportunities to make some money while at the same time, not having to stay at home any longer. First, **I looked into Job Corps**, but after the millions of horror stories I've read, I'm not sure if I want to put myself in that situation. My sister decided to move to Job Corps instead of staying home after our parents wouldn't let her go to college either, and she used to cry to me every night about how awful it was. Girls were trying to kill themselves, others and staff. There were drugs, violence, fighting, etc. Now that she's home, her certifications aren't even allowing her to get a decent job. I'm not completely scratching it off of the list, but if I could avoid it, I will. Next, **I looked into AmeriCorps,** but they don't provide housing, and the small stipend they give will be eaten away by rent money. It is still an option for me though, because some money is better than no money. Then **I looked into possibly finding a roommate** and working for a year or so, but that would require me to have money to move in, and to be financially literate, which I am not. **I also looked into Workaway.** The problem with this one is that I'd need to be able to pay for a plane ticket in order get to the site that I'm going to work on, and even then, most hosts don't pay.

      <TITLE>Finally figured out an escape plan, but is it manageable?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-01-24 00:14:07</DATE>
      <TEXT>17F, 18 in less than a month. So I'm almost certain that I'm not getting into college this August because of my nmom's strong desire to keep me home, so I have to escape elsewhere. I was looking forward to college as a means of freedom, but seeing as that's no longer an option, I've decided upon something else. **The Plan:** 1. Help my sister get out first (she has a friend who is offering her a place to stay. It's a two bedroom which is why I won't be there with them). This will most likely be in either June, July, or August. 2. While my sister is leaving, I will send my belongings with her that I don't need immediately, and she will hold them at the apartment for me. As of now, I have no idea whether I am going to give my cats to my gym teacher, my sister's boyfriend, or an online stranger, but they'll be next priority. 3. With all of my things gone, I will start my journey. 4. I haven't really thought about how I'm actually going to leave the house until now. I was going to wait until some kind of weekend to leave, preferably at night but now that I think of it that's not such a good idea as I am a 12 year old looking child lol. I'm either going to **a)** Jump out of my window and smooth stripper slide down the railing on my front porch so I don't bust a kneecap, **b)** leave in the middle of the day while the house is quiet and pretend to take the dog out then dip (but they'll realize that I'm gone quick and probably pull up and find me rapidamente), or **c)** just tell them I'm leaving and walk out of the house (the most she can do is yell at me from the doorstep because she doesn't want to hurt her precious little ego). If they call the police I will let the police know that I am (will be) 18 and I'm moving out for good. 5. I'm going to walk from my house to my high school (which is a 5-10 minute drive, 1 hour walk away from my house). 6. Then I'll call an Uber and set out to Casa Ruby in DC (which is a 30 minute to 1 hour drive away, and costs about 60-100$). I don't know yet if my sister's boyfriend will come with me (as I'm still pretty young and naive when it comes to the world and I wanna be safe). Once I get to the shelter, I honestly don't know what I will do haha. I only planned the getting out part and not exactly the "what do I do when I get there" part. My priorities are **1) Getting my paperwork** (because my parents refuse to give me my passport/birth certificate/SSN, etc.), **2) Getting a job**, and **3) Getting into some form of education**. I heard that if you have no/bad parents, a social worker can help you get into Job Corps. If they have any other educational programs, I will gladly join them. **About the shelter:** Casa Ruby has a 3-6 months and 18 month housing program, so depending on which one I get into, I'll see what I can get out of that. If I get into the 3-6 program, I'll get a job or two and either **a)** make enough money to fly out to Guam, where (hopefully) I'll get a dancing job (they pay 500$ a week plus whatever you make for a 3+ month contract AND housing yeet) and live there until I make enough money to go to university (either the University of Guam, a CUNY, or a community college then transfer), **b)** make enough money to buy my own apartment which is much more expensive than the Guam plan but probably more sensible, or **c)** get enough money to save up for travel or a car, and then switch over to a CoolWorks job that gives me room and board as well as a yearly salary. If I enter the 18 month program, I will hopefully have enough money and experience after a year and a half to go back to school. **About the pets:** If I wasn't able to get the cats out, the only reason I'd ever go back to my parents house is to ask for them back (unless they already gave them away). They are my world and I would put food in their stomachs before I do mine own. Shoot, if bringing them with me means I can't afford college then looks like I'd be taking another gap year. ' **The issue:** My one huge flaw in the plan is that I don't know when I will leave. My family is planning to take a trip to my home country this year, and although I really want to go, I also don't trust them at all. In the past, they have taken my other siblings over there pretending to go on a vacation and left them there unknowingly. I don't know if I trust my parents enough to not leave me there to fend for myself like they did the others, which is why I'm hesitant to take this trip. If I leave in May when I graduate, I won't know if they were planning to send me to college or not. If I leave in August, that means I'll *have* to go on the trip, and I don't have a plan for if I get stuck there. It is a third world country and everything requires money. There are no free services. If I wanted to take a taxi to see my family there, it would cost nearly 300$. If I needed to take a ferry, another 300+$. I can survive on the street, yes, but there are no "part time jobs" or "special services" to get money in your pocket. The only plan I have is, I saw an ad on workaway for a European woman who needed someone to housesit for her on one of the islands, and the most I could do is ask her to take me in and I'll be her servant in return. But that would require WiFi, and most places make you pay to connect to their WiFi. **A few things to note:** \- I have no friends or family to take me in. I am 100% on my own. \- I'm not sure about the waitlist for La Casa, but I am planning to give them a call the day I depart. \- I only plan to take my phone with me to contact my sister/use WiFi. I can in no way buy a burner. \- I am not allowed to get a job or leave the house, which is why I have no money (should've dated the neighborhood drug dealer when I had the chance smh). I have no money saved up, which is why I'm relying on my sister and her novio to get me the Uber money. \- I know the dangers, and I'm willing to risk it all. I feel more safe on the streets than in my own home. Aside from all of this grammatically incorrect and hard to read BS, does my plan sound remotely good? Any adjustments I should make? Any tips? If you have anything you want to add or take away from my plan, please do let me know. I don't plan to leave until May, June, July, or August, so it won't be for a while, but I am still planning like I've never planned before. TL;DR - I am running away this year from my abusive household and heading to a shelter in DC with free housing for up to 18 months. My goal is to somehow use this service to help me get into college, but I'm not quite sure if I'm going about it the right way.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-01-25 14:57:47</DATE>
      <TEXT>First of all, yes I know there is a subreddit for that (r/asianparentstories). So basically my parents live in the Stone Age and think that a FAFSA is the only thing that you need to send to a school, and despite me showing them that they need to apply for ACTUAL financial aid, they refused to fill out the CSS on College Board. Smith and Mount Holyoke have been emailing about an incomplete financial aid profile and now the deadline is passed. They keep swearing up and down that by submitting your tax information and SSN the college is going to steal your identity blah blah blah. They don #8217;t want to send my SAT scores either to the colleges that need them. I decided to abandon my paper applications and apply to colleges through the common app that don #8217;t need SAT, App Fees, or anything but a FAFSA. It #8217;s fucking ridiculous but I have to do what I have to do. Their actions have knocked me down from 10 schools to 7, and still going. My two top choices and the only semi-prestigious schools on my list (Mount Holyoke and Smith) are now off the table because they wouldn #8217;t take a second to think,  #8220;Huh. Maybe things have changed since we were young and we should listen to our kid. #8221; If they continue with their mess I may not be going to college at all. Anyone else going through some straight up BS with delusional parents? I #8217;ve read through the sub and I feel what some of y #8217;all are going through. It #8217;s insane. This whole process is insane.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>To keep it simple, my nmom has been wanting to keep me at home for whatever reason and not go to college. This happened to my older sister, who is now stuck at home (not allowed to get a job, not allowed to leave, etc.) and they treat her pretty much like a house maid. She agreed to go to CC, flunked out due to them forcing to do chores (take care of their other kids, rake the yard, etc.) when she could've been studying, dropped out and went to Job Corps for a year, finished, and now is back at home with nowhere to go. Although it would be nice to have my old room, my cats, and food in my stomach for another two years, I don't trust them at all, and I feel like this is only a part of their scheme to keep me under their control. They already sabotaged my chances at getting financial aid, so I'm banking on a full ride right now, and I'm scared that they'll *claim* they're going to pay for my schooling, but keep me cooped up at home and basically say sike. Still, if I don't stay at home, I will be forced to move into a homeless shelter, I'll be dirt poor, I won't have the resources needed to survive, and I won't be able to attend college, therefore not being able to obtain my dream job until much later in life when I can afford it. **Pros of staying home:** \- Cats \- TV \- Supposed community college \- Warm bed and my comfy bedroom \- Running water, roof over my head, food, semi-stable living conditions, etc. **Cons of staying home:** \- Mentally/Emotionally/Verbally abusive parents \- Basically the house peasant, putting chores before my work \- Hard labor (yard work) for 10+ hours a day \- Not allowed to leave the house, get a job, have friends, socialize with the outside world, etc. **Pros of leaving home:** \- No more abusive parents \- Independence \- Ability to get a job, have a social life, experience the outside world, etc. \- Have control over my existence **Cons of leaving home:** \- No cats :( \- Shelter hopping \- Prone to street incidents \- No warm and comfy room/running water/food \- No chance at an education What do you guys say? Should I stay home and risk being manipulated and continue to be mentally abused by my nparents, or should I get out while I can, even if it means being homeless and not being able to go to school? Those of you who have gotten out, how did you do it without being homeless? (I don't have any friends to crash with, which I assume is the main way many people get out anyways.) Most importantly, how did you afford to go to college in those conditions?</TEXT>

Educators shouldn #8217;t be allowed to go all out or force participation if students don #8217;t want to be involved.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-02-03 11:26:30</DATE>
      <TEXT>At some schools, namely the one that I #8217;ve been to, we have weeklong celebrations and speakers for certain months, and then completely overlook others. For example, the whole school is forced to participate in Black History Month and Women #8217;s History Month  #8220;celebrations, #8221; but if we want to celebrate APAHM or Hispanic Heritage Month, we have to do it discretely and within our department (which I personally think is a better idea, so that only those who care have to hear about it/participate in it). I think that it comes with keeping politics out of school that you shouldn #8217;t force kids who don #8217;t apply to these things or simply don #8217;t care to be a part of something like this. It #8217;s alright if people want to have their own little celebrations but it gets annoying when every single day you have to hear about it, have to go to presentations about it instead of going to class, etc. I know these months are there for a reason and they are semi-important but an entire month full of festivities is unnecessary, and teachers/schools should not be allowed to mention and/or force kids into participating in activities associated with the month. It just comes off as weird and political and frustrating after a while. This is probably popular on Reddit but definitely not in the real world (or at least where I live).</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-02-09 20:51:10</DATE>
      <TEXT>And the thing is, I know exactly why, but there's nothing I can do about it. My parents claimed they called the school and they were told that they don't have to send in their Tax Returns and W2s for financial aid, but I've received about 5 emails stating that my financial aid profile is incomplete, and that it is necessary that I do something about it if I want aid. No matter how much I show them the emails or the information from the website or try to talk to them, they absolutely refuse to do it. I know it's because they don't want me going to college out of state and they hate the fact of me moving so far away, but they shouldn't be so immature as to sabotage my college career over their own selfishness. When I made the mistake of telling them that I had a chance at an automatic full ride somewhere, they refused to send an application fee and my test scores. That was the only place I could've gotten a full ride with my stats and they purposefully ruined it. I was told on this subreddit before to call in the financial aid office of the schools and explain the situation, and that colleges have experience working with kids with uncooperative/abusive/helicopter/narcissistic parents, but what exactly do I say to them? What if they think that I am lying just to get some kind of sympathy or more aid? How do I address them in a way where we can work together in this situation, hopefully without my parents finding out? Or should I just withdraw my applications all together and forget about applying to those schools? Any advice is much appreciated in this situation. Thanks in advance, guys.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In many of the Afterlife videos I #8217;ve listened to on YouTube, whether it be from mediums or people who #8217;ve had NDEs, many say that after you die, you spend time reviewing your life and/or healing in the spirit realm before returning to the earth if you so choose with a new life.

I #8217;ve also heard that if you commit suicide or something, you will enter the world again with the same lesson to learn and most likely have the same sad life that got you to those thoughts in the first place.

She also stalks the kids who were in my grade on Instagram and compares me to them a lot). I was set on not going, until my friends asked me to go with them as a group. My sister was excited and wanted to do my makeup, let me borrow her shoes, etc. I love her dearly and decided that since this is the only time she #8217;ll ever get to see her sister off to a dance, I may as well go. She helped me find a dress that we both loved on sale for Valentine #8217;s Day, and decided to get that one. We #8217;ve been asking my N #8217;mom every second of the day to inquire about the dress before the sale goes off, and she was all of a sudden so rude about it.  #8220;Why did you want to go to prom all of a sudden? #8221;  #8220;You know you #8217;re fat ass can #8217;t fit in that dress. It #8217;s for skinny people. #8221;  #8220;I #8217;ll order the dress when I #8217;m good and ready. #8221; I #8217;ve been asking her to please order the dress since last week but she wouldn #8217;t do it. I got an almost perfect score on a test for her. My grades got me into the top 10% of my graduating class, and I did it for her. But she couldn #8217;t do this one thing for me. She promised me 2 days ago that she #8217;ll order the dress for me, but when I went to ask her she started to yell, so I went to bed. I told her that the sale ended at 8pm yesterday, and asked her to order it when we got home. She started to fuss, so again, I just went to sleep. She came upstairs at 8:30pm telling me to bring her my computer so she can order the dress. I was already sitting in bed crying because I know she did it on purpose. I was so upset, but in the end, it was no use. I know there will always be other dresses and I #8217;m probably being spoiled and spiteful complaining about just one, but the fact that she acted like this during the whole thing just made me feel so worthless. She always says  #8220;you care too much about yourself. What about me? #8221; Blah blah blah. My entire life has been school then home, school then home, for 17 years. I #8217;ve never been allowed outside of the house without them there. I #8217;ve never had a birthday party or my quincea #241;era like my other relatives my age. Prom was my one chance to feel like a princess and to feel like I mattered for once, and now it looks like I #8217;m not even going. On the bright side, I get to stay home, watch Kdramas, and hang with my sister and my cats. And at least I don #8217;t have to diet anymore to fit into my dress!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>iphone 6s stuck on apple logo. Is there a way to fix my phone without losing my data?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-02-18 01:43:48</DATE>
      <TEXT>My apps on my phone kept crashing, so I decided to turn my phone completely off, and then turn it back on. I've done this before, but nothing bad ever happened, and my phone would turn back on normally. Today however, my phone got stuck on the apply logo screen, and **is altering between the apple logo and a black screen, then back to the apple logo.** I tried downloading fonelab or whatever it's called but I was required to purchase something, which I cannot/don't want to do. I wouldn't mind wiping my phone, but I have important photos I need for classes on there that I'm pretty sure haven't been backed up because I don't know how to do that. **I've heard of the iTunes method and DFU mode, but that will erase all of my data.** Is there a way I can turn my phone back on without wiping everything, or is it a lost cause?</TEXT>

      <TITLE>After 5 attempts and 9 years of being suicidal, I lived to see my 18th birthday today.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-02-20 12:50:50</DATE>
      <TEXT>I know this is a reoccurring subject within this sub and a cliche thing to say, but I #8217;m proud of myself. I was actually planning to kill myself the day before my birthday because I didn #8217;t want to grow up and have responsibilities, especially with such an unsupportive family and no one to be there for me. Granted, I #8217;m still suicidal so it #8217;s not that big of an accomplishment, but my eyes were opened when a kid in my community was murdered the other day. My school was silent, the teachers were crying, and the students were a mess. It was devastating to see people so heartbroken. Not to say that people will miss me as much, but I do have teachers that I confide in and who #8217;s day I always try to make. I cant imagine how much I #8217;d be hurting them if they found out that I had passed. I cant be selfish towards them, especially after all they #8217;ve don #8217;t for me. I have no way of getting help, so each day is a struggle for me, but I do have goals in mind and people that I love and they #8217;re the ones who push me to want to live. I didn #8217;t think I was going to make it this far. I honestly didn #8217;t. When I placed that noose around my neck for the first time last year I thought I was done for certain. But it seems as though every time I should #8217;ve died, every time I came close to dying, there was something that wrapped its arms around me and protected me from harm. Someone is watching out for me, and I cant help but feel grateful.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t hate my life anymore. I #8217;m disappointed by a lot of things, but I don #8217;t hate myself like I used to. The one thing making me extremely suicidal lately is the fact that everyone around me has a loving family, and I don #8217;t. I #8217;m tired of being told that I #8217;m a nuisance or a burden or that I #8217;m worthless. I #8217;m tired of not being rewarded for the good things that I do. I #8217;m tired of my nmom making everything about her and not taking a second to thing about how anyone else feels. There are times when I nearly cry because of how nice other older women treat me, and how they play with my hair or listen to me when I want to talk or give me advice when I need it. Why couldn #8217;t I have been their kid? I crave maternal love that I can never get from my family. It #8217;s not the same when a stranger is loving on you and not your own parents, whose job it is to love you. I shamelessly believe in reincarnation, and have been hoping that I could die young so I can be reborn into a family that loves me instead of living here and suffering. I have too many people in my life that I love to take my own life at the moment, but once I graduate high school I won #8217;t have those mom teachers to confide in anymore. The pain will be too unbearable. I hate that my family couldn #8217;t have just been normal.</TEXT>

If it was an Asian/White/Hispanic/Islander/Indigenous/Etc person doing something like this to a black person this video would #8217;ve been all over the news by now, BLM would be crying about how oppressed they are, etc.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Straight out of high school with no life knowledge. How exactly do I start life?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-03-02 19:46:53</DATE>
      <TEXT>For some background, I just turned 18, F. My parents are making it difficult for me to get my education, since they refuse to pay for my schooling due to me not choosing the major of their choice/ me not wanting to live with them. It looks like I #8217;m not going to college this fall, which means I need to get a job/find a place to stay until I turn 25, so I can go to school on my own terms. The thing is, I am/was never allowed to get a job, so I have absolutely no money. I have no friends to help me out, so I'm on my own. I have 0 life skills/street smarts, so I don't know how IDs, banking, etc. works. The one thing I absolutely need to know is, what do I do as soon as I walk out that door and never look back? I know that I need to have a job lined up before I leave. I'm already planning to do coolworks or something that involves live-in working so that I can have a place to stay while I earn money. My nmom also keeps my ID in her wallet saying that I don't need it, but I can probably grab it on my way out. I plan to leave my belongings with my sister at our parents house (she's still living at home) until I get my own place to stay. My sister is planning to escape to her boyfriend #8217;s house, and may or may not let me move with them. They moving after I graduate, so for now I plan to move with them and either 1) cop some cash to catch an Uber to a live in job of some sort or 2) make enough money over the summer while I #8217;m living with them to move out onto my own. For those of you who walked out of your parents house with no money, no friends to crash with, no job, etc., what did you do, and how did you jumpstart your future on your own? Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

Someone commented underneath her photo:  #8220;..... it #8217;s a video from two years ago please don #8217;t spread fake news #8221; And she responded with:  #8220;and they trifling  amp; nasty af too so what #8217;s your point? #8221; She has since wiped her Instagram account. I #8217;m glad that Azn Twitter and the likes are calling her out, but there are obviously still others who are trying to defend her behavior and claiming that they still like her. I #8217;m happy about this because it is evident that Asian American youth are starting to speak up more about racism against them, but upset at the same time because of the amount of people trying to justify said racism. Most of the racist tweets I have seen have since been deleted, and the racist comments went away when she deleted her posts. Still, I call it progress.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I grew up in an abusive household and my nmom did foster care. Straight up told us that she was trying to replace us with new kids. I was super pissed and jealous because my nmom loved someone else #8217;s kid more than her own and was being dirty about it (beating us when they did something wrong, making us sleep in the basement and them in our rooms, starving us out for misbehaving.) I was about 10 years old when I was planning to kill myself, and I though to myself  #8220;I #8217;m not going to die here tonight without taking one of those kids with me. #8221; I obviously didn #8217;t go through with it, but I #8217;m actually quite scared of myself knowing how much 10 year old me #8217;s anger built up to such a point.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It #8217;s not  #8220;anti-blackness, #8221; it #8217;s spreading awareness about black on Asian crime and racism against Asians in black communities, which has been around and overlooked for years. The fact that black people cant stand people calling them out to make them aware of the racists in their community is a huge part of the problem. Instead of being ignorant, butthurt, and wallowing in self pity, take this instance to have a conversation about Anti-Asian racism. Trying to justify that racism and complaining about the fact that they mentioned race means you #8217;re missing the whole point. Also, when someone white does something wrong, they make sure to mention that they #8217;re white. The news always brings race into it when something happens to a black person, so do the same thing when they #8217;re the ones acting up. Every person and every race needs to be held accountable for the shit that they do, and if you think that #8217;s  #8220;anti-black #8221; or  #8220;racist #8221; you #8217;re an idiot.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Agreed. As someone who grew up in an abusive household, CPS came to my house several times in about 4 years and did absolutely nothing to help me. My nmom did foster care and treated those kids 10 times better than us, like royalty. Whenever they didn #8217;t get what they wanted, they went to school saying they were being abused so they can be moved to a more luxurious home, and CPS was always quicker to investigate their issues more than mine, despite having clear evidence that their claims were false. I suffered for years. I have friends who have been let down by the system for years, including a friend who #8217;s now stuck in a psych ward because the abuse got so bad but CPS did nothing to help him. Society as a whole cares more about children and then wonder why us teens end up the way we do. It #8217;s extremely sad.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This pisses me off so much with her. This woman has never had a career in her life, and spends all of her time either on the computer, watching TV, on her phone, or all three at the same time. I call her a housewife because that's what she'd be if she'd actually get off her ass and do something around the place, and she gets mad when I tell her it's her job to do these things she keeps avoiding out of laziness. She doesn't cook, clean, take care of us kids or the pets, shop for groceries, etc., and then complains when those things don't get done. She makes me clean HER room, HER bathroom, do HER laundry, and if I refuse she starts to throw a tantrum and get violent. I'm not her babysitter, nor her maid. I shouldn't have to do her chores because she's too fucking lazy to get off of her ass and do it herself. She contributes absolutely nothing to this family and I'm tired of doing everything for her when I have homework to do or when I could be taking care of myself and my own issues. Does anyone else's nmom or nparent force them to do the chores that they should be doing themselves? Do you usually comply? What happens when you don't?</TEXT>

See why we can #8217;t get along? There are so many Asian people on this sub saying  #8220;leave black folks alone #8221; when we post about their racism and this is how they repay us. Talking about some,  #8220;don #8217;t defend them because they don #8217;t defend us #8221; and  #8220;we have it worse bs. #8221; These comments are a clear indicator of how many shits they give about the racism happening against us. It #8217;s over. There #8217;s nothing else to prove. We have to stand up for our own. As for Lupe, he #8217;s almost always been a good man. For the ones like him who have defeated ignorance, we #8217;ll protect him at all costs. He #8217;s the type of person the black community needs to listen to. Not people like Summer Walker or Lil Whatshimname who call Asians  #8220;nasty #8221; or  #8220;trifling. #8221;</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It #8217;s also crazy that grown ass women and men get to dictate how society sees young boys. Boys get body shamed, sexualized, fat shamed, called ugly, and held to atrocious societal standards too, but for some reason ADULTS get to say that  #8220;oh they don #8217;t have it as bad as ___ #8221; or  #8220;oh they should really man up #8221; blah blah blah. Young boys never get to speak for themselves without being bashed by older generations and even some fellow kids like ourselves. And when growing up in a society that constantly puts you down to bring others up or tells you that your problems don #8217;t matter as much just because you #8217;re a male is even worse. They take these things into their adulthood and have to suffer mentally which is horrible. I feel bad for them too.</TEXT>

It #8217;s sad to me that they want us to see their issues, but won #8217;t see ours and see how our problems are brushed under the rug in today #8217;s society. It #8217;s things like that why I don #8217;t believe in solidarity. I would #8217;ve taken a screenshot of the comments but I wasn #8217;t thinking about it at the time.

      <TEXT>Thank you! There are other Instagram accounts that are supposedly for Asian youth but they #8217;re usually blm supporters and don #8217;t post racist acts done by other POC. We need Asian youth to be aware of EVERYTHING, not just what we want to hear for our own safety. I #8217;ll be following soon, and I really hope this grows! Remember, use lots of tags, use hashtags on your stories often, and follow similar accounts. Some accounts to be wary of: @asiangirlsunited and @annoyed.asian (not exactly bad, but I and others have had bad encounters with them, plus they #8217;ve had scandals in the past). Some accounts to follow and possibly collab with: @asiansneverdie @asianandproud @growingupasian_ @nextshark (all of which I follow and have been updating throughout this whole COVID-19 thing, or just keeping people empowered in general). I also noticed that lots of accounts do  #8220;dm to feature, #8221; which is a great way to interact with your followers. Good luck!!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I know I #8217;m late, but you said you were living in Virginia. Does it happen to be NoVa, or somewhere around that (Stafford, Fredericksburg, King George, etc.?) You don #8217;t have to answer this to us (so you don #8217;t let everyone know your location), but if you happen to be an hour or two away from Washington DC, there are really great shelters for young people in the area. The ones that I #8217;ve been looking at for myself are Casa Ruby (for but not exclusive to Latino and LGBT youth aged 18-24). N Street Village (for but not exclusive to women 18+ and trans women). Georgetown Ministry Centre (a drop in center for everyone open from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm where you can shower, eat, and do laundry). I know most of these are 18+, but I #8217;m not sure whether or not you #8217;re turning 17 this year or you just turned 16. Here are a few other shelters that can help you with getting documents, mental help, and possibly schooling: https://www.seekingshelter.net/washington-d-c A few of them in there are for teens your age as well. Best of luck!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I did a bulletin board back in November for International Men #8217;s Day and Native American Heritage Month, where I used this poster from the International Men #8217;s Day website and a few others, including the one that said  #8220;celebrate men and boys #8221; (or smth like that). About a week after it was completely, I kept walking past the board, and the Men #8217;s Day portion was gone. I finally had the guts to ask what happened to it, and they said it was taken down for being  #8220;too offensive #8221;. Mind you, my school goes all out for women #8217;s history month, bringing in speakers, holding events, decorating hallways, etc., yet one poster about the struggles of men in modern society was deemed too offensive to be displayed to students. This didn #8217;t exactly piss me off because of how long I spent on it, but because I have to sit in class and listen to my female teachers talk about how men have no problems in this world, how men aren #8217;t body shamed, how men have it easier, and how men aren #8217;t allowed to make comments about women or else it #8217;s misogynistic, yet women can call men trash all they want. Things that I shouldn #8217;t have to hear in an academic setting, yet I #8217;m forced to and cannot say anything against it. It #8217;s reasons like this that I will always celebrate International Men #8217;s Day, because the double standards need to end, and the truth shouldn #8217;t be offensive. We shouldn #8217;t be teaching young kids my age that Men #8217;s Rights is stupid or doesn #8217;t exist the same way we wouldn #8217;t do it about females. We need them to understand stuff like this at a young age so that these same people don #8217;t go into the adult world believing that they #8217;re allowed to act the way they do when it comes to men and boys.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ah that #8217;s understandable. I #8217;m against shelters myself, but after seeing that my options were slim and I couldn #8217;t do it on my own, I decided to give it a thought. You don #8217;t by any means have to go to one, but these are for younger teens and adults, so normally they have more protection. If you #8217;re interested, there are also jobs that will give you room and board as well as a salary so that you can live somewhere other than home (Coolworks.com). Hope this helps!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m no teacher either, but as both a kid and a student, the one thing my teacher did that changed my life was let me vent, and then try to form a relationship with me. She let me talk freely of the stuff I had going on at home, and I didn #8217;t have to fear getting in trouble with my parents. When I told her my parents don #8217;t believe in mental health and wouldn #8217;t let me see a therapist, she asked her friend (who is a child psychologist) to help me in secret. When I told her my parents never celebrate my birthday, she brought me cupcakes and congratulated me on finally turning 18. The one thing that I hate about my nmom is that she never lets me talk or have an opinion without yelling at me and telling me how much of a failure I am. Being able to finally be comfortable enough to have a conversation with that teacher was a huge thing for me, and talking to her is what I wished talking with my parents was like. This probably isn #8217;t the best way to go about it, and I #8217;m sure there a more professional answer to your question, but it #8217;s small things like this that really help children who are being emotionally neglected at home, and it means more to us than people think.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thanks for this post. During times like this, people really need to stay put because we don #8217;t know how long this pandemic is going to keep on for. With that being said, after this whole thing is over, I #8217;m definitely not  #8220;staying put #8221; and risking my life when I know there are places I can go that will be better. Still, I appreciate this. Especially on r/runaway (which I suggest you crosspost to) there are a lot of young kids who are leaving their homes right now and they don #8217;t know how much worse this country is getting during these times. Things are closed, states are on lockdown, we have the national guard threatening people over here, and cops WILL arrest and/or fine you. It #8217;s so freaking hard right now but for the love of Buddha please don #8217;t risk your lives even more when the borderline apocalypse is going on.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>CSS Profile, Full Rides, and other last minute financial aid questions.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-04-02 15:26:59</DATE>
      <TEXT>**tl;dr - Questions are on the bottom if you don #8217;t want to read my explanation.** [cross-posting to r/raisedbynarcissists, r/financialaid] Long story short: I got into my dream school but my parents are refusing to send in their documents. I #8217;m afraid to contact the institution because I believe that if I do, 1) they #8217;re not going to answer because it #8217;s Corona Time or 2) They won #8217;t be able to do anything and I won #8217;t be able to attend. Long story long: I #8217;m starting to panic about whether or not I #8217;d get into college this year. My parents are completely bugging out and I #8217;m not even going to try with them anymore. I #8217;ve been applying to every single school that doesn #8217;t require an app fee or test scores on the common app in hopes that someone-anyone would give me a full ride, because if not, I won #8217;t be going to college this year and may even end up homeless. Talking to the financial aid office? Useless. Explaining my situation? Useless. Trying to get my parents to be understanding? Useless. I don #8217;t want to put in so much effort and not reap any reward, but I #8217;m really at my wits end. I wouldn #8217;t be so scared of taking a gap year if I didn #8217;t have to worry about where I was going to sleep this winter, but sadly that #8217;s a reality. I #8217;m sorry I keep bringing this topic up here and I know that you all may be annoyed with me, but I #8217;ve been really depressed as of late about the whole situation. I lose sleep over this shit, my anxiety had gotten worse and I #8217;m ready to give up. At this point, dying seems like the only valid option because if I can #8217;t get an education, I can #8217;t have my dream job. If I can #8217;t get my dream job, my life is going to be miserable just like my parents said they wanted me to be and I know that life isn #8217;t fair for everyone, but if so many people can escape their tough situations, then why can #8217;t I? **My questions are:** 1) Is it too late to apply anywhere and get a full ride? Is it worth it still applying for schools in this time? (I literally just filtered through the common app to see test optional schools with no app fees.) 2) Is there any way to get around submitting a CSS profile and W-2 forms? (My parents are refusing to send those in, saying I #8217;m not going to get any aid because I #8217;m not smart enough anyways). 3) Do I still have a chance at a full ride/good merit aid if I skip the FAFSA? (My parents refuse to add any more schools to the FAFSA, so I #8217;m counting on scholarships only). 4) Lastly, what exactly do I say to the financial aid office to explain my situation without making it sound like a sob story scam to get more aid? Every person I #8217;ve asked has said to contact the financial aid office but I have absolutely no idea what to do or say, and how to make sure that none of this information gets back to my parents or else I #8217;ll be in more trouble. Thank you all in advance. I really mean it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Do you have money on you? [Here](https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/cgi-bin/id/city.cgi?city=Mentor amp;state=OH) is a link of homeless shelters, with some youth outreach programs scrambled in near Mentor. If you have a few bucks, you can take a train, bus, or Uber to a shelter near you if those are available to you (idk if there are any in Ohio but there a bunches here in DC). Like the others said, however, you are extremely young, there #8217;s the possibility of your parents calling the cops on you, and if you cause too much of a disturbance the cops will arrest you and eventually take you home. Especially not that it #8217;s #CoronaTime, idk if your state is on lockdown but being out and about could get you in serious trouble. That being said, when this whole thing is over, you absolutely do not have to stay in a household with parents who are emotionally or mentally abusing you. If you can wait it out until around August or whenever this pandemic is over, get yourself some cash, a better plan, and some friends that may be able to help you. Also look into r/lgbthavens or any other lgbt subreddit, and most of the time there are people there willing to assist you. Good luck, hun.  lt;3</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The same way Asians and Asian Americans are a part of the same community is the same way that Africans and African Americans are. Also I don #8217;t know how long you #8217;ve been on these subs, but Africans have been treating Asian people like shit recently the same way African Americans have. No I don #8217;t think they #8217;re all the same, but not only are they all black, but they #8217;re also all capable of the same type of racism that everyone else is. Also, as a Tamil person I know about white worshipping in Asia. Trust me. Other South Asians are so into skin bleaching and whitening and it #8217;s sickening, but that has nothing to do with the post is what I #8217;m saying. You #8217;re trying to blame it on white folks instead of saying,  #8220;hey, this Nigerian man did something wrong and his actions should be condemned #8221; and you shouldn #8217;t do that. Yes, white worshipping is prevalent and an unfortunate part of our society but you have to hold people responsible for their own actions at some point.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t know why I felt the need to post this, but it makes me so angry when Asians are trying to promote diversity for themselves and get shut down by blacks and Hispanics who say things like  #8220;Asians are privileged! Asians don #8217;t have gangs! Asian people don #8217;t struggle like we do! #8221; You should never put down your own race and spread false information like that. The only difference between Asians and other POC in America is the fact that Asians don #8217;t wallow in self pity and blame everything on the system. Instead they work hard and push past the people telling them they can #8217;t because they know that in the end they #8217;re the only ones who have control of their lives. They don #8217;t succumb to violence or crime and give up or blame the  #8220;white man #8221; for their issues, but instead help each other out so that they can defeat those same white folks who are trying to stop them. Every POC minus the indigenous people came here the same way, and we all suffered from discrimination the same way. So I hate it when people, especially Asian youth think it #8217;s okay to crap on themselves and call themselves  #8220;privileged #8221; because we #8217;re far from it. We just know how to handle the shit that our modern, racist society throws at us.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>How true are the Westminster stereotypes, and what is it like to live there?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-04-05 21:56:29</DATE>
      <TEXT>[Cross-posted to r/baltimore] Hello all. I am an 18 year old senior from Charles County looking to attend McDaniel College in the near future. I was debating between McDaniel, Hood, and some out of state schools, but so far McDaniel has been so nice to me, wrote me a hand written letter added to my acceptance, and had been showing genuine interest in me as a student, unlike any other college I #8217;ve applied to, which makes me very interested in attending. However, after reading more and more about the town of Westminster, I #8217;m not quite sure if that #8217;s the environment I #8217;d like to spend 2-4 years in. The main things that I #8217;ve heard are that Westminster is 1) Republican, 2) boring, 3) redneck, and is 4) a heroine hotspot. 1) I #8217;m conservative so Westminster being Republican isn #8217;t a huge deal to me. 2) From the looks of it, there are eateries and whatnot in Westminster, so I don #8217;t think I #8217;d get TOO bored. It #8217;s a decent size town, and as long as it #8217;s not completely rural I think I #8217;d be fine. 3) I #8217;m not one to automatically associate the south with racism, but as a non-white individual idk how okay I #8217;d be walking the streets in a so called  #8220;redneck #8221; town. This one is mostly what #8217;s keeping me from 100% committing to this school. 4) I #8217;m not a drug user so I #8217;m not worried about this, but I don #8217;t know if this will make the town less safe. I know that I will be on campus the majority of the time, but if I do plan on going out into the town for a job or shopping or food, I want to know that I can do so in a good area. My other top choice is in NYC, and the fact that I #8217;m even thinking about choosing this town to spend college in over a nice big city is a big deal for me. I just want to make sure that I #8217;m making the correct decision in all of this. Thank you all in advance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Very well said. The first thing I thought of when she mentioned privilege was Affirmative Action and the school systems. There are so many more programs geared towards black and Hispanic students, and celebrations for them within school communities, but never for Asian students unless we bring it up ourselves. There are HBCUs, Tribal Colleges (which are well deserved) and Hispanic Serving institutions, but nothing for Asian students. Heck, the fact that putting that you are of Asian descent on a college application can be used against you is so sickening, yet Asians are privileged? And you #8217;re absolutely right about the connection aspect. There are little to no connections here for Asian Americans to fall back on, and the community that has been here is just now learning to stand up for themselves in 2020. It #8217;s not fair to say that we have it all when we don #8217;t.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for the honest answer. I hate to judge a place or person before seeing it for myself, but in these changing times those topics seemed like something I needed to get a clear on before I jumped into my adulthood. In my head I kept comparing it to Marion, Virginia (don #8217;t know if you #8217;ve heard of it), which from my research looks extremely similar to Westminster. It seemed to be a lovely town with lovely people, but had many underlying social issues. My sister spent two years there and complained so much, and I didn #8217;t want the same thing to happen to me since I #8217;m a bit more naive than her. I greatly appreciate your warnings about the area, and will most definitely take them into consideration. And yes lol. NYC! My parents don #8217;t want me going all the way up there but it #8217;s New York! Plus, I couldn #8217;t get over how nice the people from McDaniel have been to me, but the more I look into it, there #8217;s a possibility that they need things like diversity/more students applying to their school since they #8217;re in a sketchy area. Not to put the school down in any way, as it #8217;s seemingly an amazing institution. Thanks again for the advice! I greatly appreciate it.</TEXT>

The English speaking function of my brain has deteriorated since school closed. And even then, slavery existed everywhere, so no one had it worse than anyone else. Asians had to work on sugar plantations in Hawaii, were segregated from whites in schools and in society, were put into internment camps, were attacked in places like California for simply being Asian, and were even legally excluded from the nation. There #8217;s a lot of Asian American history that involves violence that they don #8217;t teach in schools.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for your response! As someone with ASD and ADD, It #8217;s comforting to hear about their learning accommodations. The main reason I #8217;m even thinking against NYC is because my parents don #8217;t want me to go. That school is great, gave me the most money, and is in an area that looks like something I #8217;m used to. If it wasn #8217;t for my parents #8217;  #8220;go where we want or we #8217;ll cut you off #8221; mentality, I would choose NYC hands down. Internships is something that I didn #8217;t think of initially, and I appreciate you bringing it up, I am a Spanish/Education major, so I #8217;m not too sure if interning will be easy at all in a place like CC. You bring up some really great points, and I appreciate your advice very much!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I agree that it depends on the high school. I went to public for the first time in my entire life in high school, and it was fun until I saw my first bloody fight, I had several classmates die, politics started getting shoved down my throat by teachers, there were two knife attacks, and several shooting threats. Kids of a certain race could get away with bullying other students and it was hard to complain to staff because they were all of the same complexion. Socially, most kids were nice to your face but shady af behind your back, and that #8217;s how most fights started. I also had to go through high school with ADD unmediated, which was extremely hard taking 9 AP classes. Even this past December was my first suicide attempt due to high school being so dang hard. I did, however, meet some amazing teachers and learn a lot about myself and the world around me, but for the most part, high school was scary and more about trying to survive and not get mixed up with the bad kids than straight vibing. Had I stayed at my little white religious school I probably would #8217;ve had a MUCH better experience, but I didn #8217;t unfortunately.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Agreed. In my country, while they #8217;re not the best people, cops are super nice to kids and often do fundraisers in town. They hold a  #8220;prison concert #8221; around the holiday season, too, where people from all over the country come just to vibe with police and prisoners. I feel like cops gets a bad rep here in America because when one cop does something bad, it makes the news and influences the minds of every person out there, which makes people hate ALL cops. The same way that when a plane crashes, it goes viral because of how rare it is, which makes people fear flying. Americans absolutely love to generalize and can #8217;t put beside their bias to look at the good that someone does, which is both understandable and ignorant at the same time. People have their reasons, which I understand, but there are double standards involved in everything, so really the bias in unnecessary.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I agree to an extent. We actually had a conversation in my AP Psych class a few weeks ago about parenting styles and abuse, and I think that many times we forget that mental and emotional abuse ARE a thing (although I do believe that people blow it out of proportion). Destroying a child #8217;s phone is not abuse. It may be a horrible, anger-issue related and money wasting reaction, but it #8217;s not abuse. With spanking your children, many psychologists have said that as long as there is a general understanding between the parent and the child on WHY it is happening, then it is not abuse. If you are beating your child because you had a bad day at work or they said your dress looked a little too tight for you, that would be considered abuse, but if you are hitting your child because she knocked a glass of of the counter in anger when you told her she couldn #8217;t go out with friends and she KNOWS what she did was wrong, that #8217;s not abuse. Speaking from experience, I feel like with mental/emotional/verbal abuse, it starts to become abuse when the child is beginning to feel worthless/suicidal/as if they don #8217;t matter because of the things that your parents are saying to you. It #8217;s not  #8220;my parents broke my phone and that #8217;s emotional abuse because I broke my Snap Streak #8221; or whatever. I do agree that in some ways Reddit blows it out of proportion, but what some people see as a petty thing that #8217;s  #8220;not that bad, #8221; the person experiencing it could have been through much more than we know, which creates some kind of trauma for them, and they should still have the right to vent about things like this to others so they don #8217;t have to keep it pent up, y #8217;know?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I agree with you that you should be able to express your opinion, however if you feel the need to let that define you as a person, then you have some work to do on your personality. For example, you can hate children, but if you constantly talk about hating babies whenever you see one, people aren #8217;t going to like you a lot. You can be an atheist, but if every time someone says  #8220;god #8221; you have a problem, you need a new hobby. You can be a vegan, but if every time you see someone eating meat you rage, it #8217;s going to make people look at you negatively. It #8217;s okay to have an opinion, but constantly feeling the need to say  #8220;I hate dogs/dogs suck #8221; is what people don #8217;t like. Even forcing people to like dogs is annoying. I see more people complaining about how they can #8217;t openly talk about hating dogs than people who say you can #8217;t have an opinion about dogs, so I #8217;m skeptical about if this is a real problem or not.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Parents told me they #8217;re not paying for my college today, which means that after all that work throughout high school I will not be getting the college education that I dreamed of ever since I was little. Looks like I #8217;m going to be homeless soon and I can #8217;t decide whether to off myself or tough out the homeless life. It sucks so bad but others have it worse so I can #8217;t complain.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I have an orange boi and he loves to cuddle next to me when I sleep (which is lowkey annoying but still cute). He comes to me in the middle of the night purring and kneading the blankets and rolls over on his back for tummy rubs. If I turn over and try to sleep, he #8217;ll put his paw on my shoulder as if to say  #8220;Hey! I want attention! Come back! #8221; I absolutely adore him and couldn #8217;t ask for a better breed. The reason I chose him was because during my visit to the human society, I was checking out the kitties and he kept bumping his head on the cage. I put my finger in and he sniffed it, then proceeded to rub his fat little head against my hand. I knew he was the one at that moment. Orange kitties are the superior cat breed and everyone should own one at least once in their lifetime.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for your advice. As of now, I #8217;ve tried applying to small schools last minute in hopes of a full ride or something close, but I doubt there #8217;s much left. I #8217;m already planning to get a job, even if I #8217;m risking going homeless this winter. My dream career requires a college degree, but even then I #8217;m not wasting any time in looking for other options. Thank you for your concern and I really do hope that the days ahead of us will be much better.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for the honesty! I never thought about the availability aspect, so I #8217;m thankful that you mentioned it. It wouldn #8217;t be the end of the world if I didn #8217;t go to NYC, I just thought it #8217;d be best to kill two birds with one stone (Job Corps + Knick our a year). My sister went to Job Corps (which is how I found out about it) and told me all of the horror stories, I #8217;m pretty sure I #8217;ll get toyed with as a big softie and a naive person, but I #8217;m not one to go looking for/get into trouble. Still, I understand you when you say I can #8217;t trust anyone. You really can #8217;t. Two of the girls my sister associated with ended up getting arrested for murder just after she left. Had she not cut them off, she would #8217;ve been in deep sh*t too. Again, thank you for your help! As of now I #8217;m looking for a job instead of job corps, but if I ever decide to do it, I #8217;ll make sure I #8217;ll head these warnings!</TEXT>

You can also ask a friend, or complete odd jobs like car washing, lawn mowing, etc. I wouldn #8217;t suggest you leave at this time depending on where you live because the cops are sure to arrest anyone breaking the curfew/lockdown laws, unless there is a youth shelter near you doing intake.

      <TEXT>I remember in my high school we had an African Students Association and they didn #8217;t allow one girl to join because she was white. Plot twist, she was born and bred in Namibia, and he parents were some kind of NGO workers or smth idk. Then we opened up an Asian Students Club and others thought it was funny to say slurs and disrespect Asian culture. Then we opened up a Latino Student Club and people told us to  #8220;speak English #8221; or thought we were talking about them when we spoke Spanish with them in the room. Instead of celebrating other races it turned into factions real fast because somebody couldn #8217;t fathom why on earth we needed to appreciate diversity of other races at a  #8220;black school. #8221; Then again the vast majority of kids here are racist so I can #8217;t speak for everyone. I understand the desire to find people like you through clubs activities, but if there #8217;s already diversity on campus, there #8217;s really no point in trying to push it on others even more. I #8217;ve seen schools get so political just because someone doesn #8217;t care about your ethnic club #8217;s activities and would rather you keep it to yourself instead of calling people who don #8217;t want anything to do with it  #8220;bigots #8221; or  #8220;racist. #8221; With that being said did it #8217;s to learn about other cultures and celebrate everyone, then it #8217;s fine. Some clubs bring people together and promote unity while others dwell on hating white folks and talking about how superior they are while shutting others out.</TEXT>

I #8217;m not Chinese, but I am Hapa, and it #8217;s so important to acknowledge our cultures and respectfully label us as what we are, not what people assume us to be. It #8217;s very frustrating when people don #8217;t take the time to learn to distinguish us from each other. If you genuinely can #8217;t tell the difference between certain Asian ethnic groups, just say Asian, the same way that if we can #8217;t tell if someone is Irish, Italian, or Polish, we just say white. Or if we can #8217;t tell if someone is Tanzanian, African-American, or Jamaican, we just say black.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Actually, I read somewhere a while ago that one race can #8217;t tell the difference between some ethnicities within other races, so technically speaking you #8217;re not wrong at all. For example, I #8217;m a Pacific Islander (well, half, but still Pasifika). I can tell the difference between someone who is Ni-Vanuatu or a Solomon Islander, or, something that a lot of people outside of our race can #8217;t do, the difference between a black person and a Melanesian person, the difference between a Hispanic/Native American person and a Micronesian, and the difference between a Southeast Asian person and a Polynesian. For someone who isn #8217;t an Islander, it #8217;s harder to do. With that being said, there #8217;s a difference between calling someone Chinese because you don #8217;t know the difference, and doing it because you #8217;re being ignorant. For example, an instance that occurred at my school that caused me to write with a snarky tone (which I do apologize for), is this: a girl in my class went to the restroom, and the teacher asked where she went. One girl said,  #8220;she #8217;s with the Arabic girl #8221; and another student corrected her saying,  #8220;she #8217;s Pakistani. #8221; The girl who was being corrected said,  #8220;I don #8217;t care if she #8217;s Pakistani, Indian, Arab, whatever. She is what I say she is. #8221; If you call an Asian person Chinese because you genuinely think they #8217;re Chinese and don #8217;t know any better then that #8217;s not a bad thing and it #8217;s an innocent mistake. For example, you go to a pan-Asian restaurant and don #8217;t know that the cashier is actually Korean, you say  #8220;Ni-hao #8221; in an attempt to be polite but she #8217;s not actually Chinese. However, if you generalize all East Asian people and call every East Asian looking person you see on the street Chinese or every South Asian person you see Indian, then it wouldn #8217;t hurt to just say  #8220;Asian #8221; if you don #8217;t know. That #8217;s when it becomes offensive because you could #8217;ve avoided being rude by just saying their race and not trying to narrow down their ethnicity. And that doesn #8217;t just go for Asians people, it goes for all races.</TEXT>

Both words come from the Latin ignorare ( #8220;to ignore, be ignorant of #8221;). There are several meanings of ignorant, all of which are concerned with a lack of knowledge in some sense; some of these are more insulting than others, and care should be exercised before applying this word to people who you do not wish to offend. Saying  #8220;They were ignorant of most of the laws of physics #8221; means that the people in question did not have a specific body of learning. Saying  #8220;You are an ignorant person #8221; is possibly describing someone as primitive, crude, or uncivilized.* Edit: Formatting</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-04-13 00:29:11</DATE>
      <TEXT>~ Yet another gap year post woo ~ I know this is more of an A2C type question, but I figured I may find someone here who did something similar (plus I #8217;m pretty sure they #8217;re tired of me asking financial aid questions over there). I got some good scholarships this year but it #8217;s not enough to afford university, and my parents aren #8217;t helpin out. I #8217;ve decided to (sadly) consider taking a gap semester/gap year while studying to retake the SAT and working part time or full time to make some extra money for school, then applying to one of those little schools that give out automatic full rides based on GPA and test scores. It #8217;s just that I don #8217;t know how good of an idea this is, or if it could work anyways. My other option is just not going to college at all, since paying for it would take years in my situation. What do you guys think about this idea? Does it sound decent or should I plan for something else? **Tl;dr** - Refer to title Thanks in advance guys!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While race based bias is still alive and well, don #8217;t fear too much about what you hear from others. Yes, there are places that will discriminate against you because of your appearance, but many others will give you a chance. As someone in this subreddit once said before, legitimate and good quality schools won #8217;t discriminate against you because they #8217;re above that. Do some research and get into one of those organizations, and ignore the ones who try to tell you you #8217;re not good enough because of your race. There are many POC who have had amazing experiences in places like Asia just by joining in with the right place. Don #8217;t listen to the people telling you to  #8220;skip Asia #8221; because of the stereotypes they put on Asian countries. Discrimination can happen literally anywhere. You can be successful if you don #8217;t have a negative attitude and demonstrate your skills. If you #8217;re open to other places however, South America and Oceania are highly overlooked. If you are down with getting lower pay in exchange for amazing hospitality and a semi-carefree lifestyle, I #8217;d recommend those. As a fellow POC ( #8216;Nesian/Latino/Desi) looking to make a career out of teaching, it scares me seeing how many people are afraid of discrimination, but at the same time I feel more motivated to make sure that I work hard enough where they see past my race and instead see what I can bring to the table. And you, OP, should too. Idk if recommendations are allowed here, but if you want to see experiences of POC teaching in Asia, I suggest -Sandhira Chetty (Indo-South African in Korea) -CharlyCheer (Afro-American in Vietnam [on hiatus tho]) -Yo #8217; Homegirl (Latina in Korea) -Silk Road Gal (South/West Asian? in China) -Sisilessthan3 (Afro-American in Korea) -Cornyco (Afro-American in Japan) -Gillian Wong (Asian-American in Vietnam) To OP or any other POC wanting to teach abroad, please don #8217;t be afraid. You are amazing and will do great things, as long as you do your best and don #8217;t let the lowlifes who discriminate against you hold you back. Don #8217;t be afraid to go certain places or try certain things or make new friends because of some stereotypes. You will have it a bit harder but in the end you will meet some amazing people and have some amazing experiences. Good luck OP, and good luck to all.  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

Imagine making straight As for your entire life only for your parents to say that you #8217;re not going to college because you didn #8217;t major in what THEY wanted or apply to the school that THEY wanted you to go to. It #8217;s even worse when they call you a disappointment and show you how much better than you others kids in your school are doing, and putting you down every moment of the day. If I #8217;m being honest, I wanted to live and be happy and prove to my parents that I don #8217;t need them to be successful, but I can #8217;t see myself getting any farther than this. I #8217;m tired, this quarantine is making me depressed, and the suicidal thoughts are returning. Sometimes I think,  #8220;if I can #8217;t go to college or be as good as them, what #8217;s the point? #8221; but also  #8220;what would happen if I really *did* succeed and be happy? #8221; Idk. I just want a redo, whether that be dying or running away and starting a new life. I know others have it worse but sometimes I feel too weak to carry on.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It #8217;s funny that I come across this today. I just learned through Quora about the little boy who was streaking and risked being labeled as a sex offender for life and killed himself. Like, you #8217;re exactly right. Kids will do dumb shit and they have to learn that what they did was wrong, but childhood is all about making mistakes and learning from them. In no way shape or form should a child have their entire life ruined for something they were doing under the age of 18. Unless it #8217;s straight up murder/boarder line serial killer stuff.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>My sweet kitty is pooping outside of the litter box, most likely due to stress. What can I do to retrain him/distress him during this time?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-04-19 01:39:45</DATE>
      <TEXT>So, just to note, I did search the subreddit for threads on this topic, and most of them had to do with keeping the litter clean (which I already do), so I #8217;ve decided to make my own. We took him to get groomed on Tuesday, (and he routinely poops in the cage every time because he #8217;s scared), and he began pooping on the downstairs floor on Thursday, stopped, then did it again this Saturday (caturday lol) morning. From my research, this happens when 1) the litter box isn #8217;t clean, 2) he has health issues, 3) the litter box isn #8217;t hooded, or other reasons. 1) I clean the litter twice a day and change it completely every other week or so. 2) I #8217;d assume that if it was health related, the groomers would #8217;ve noticed something, but it #8217;s still a possibility. 3) The litter is hooded. From my research, I #8217;ve come to the conclusion that my cat is starting to do this because he notices that we are moving, and he #8217;s stressed/scared that we #8217;re going to leave him behind. My parents are threatening to give him away if he does it again (which is why I didn #8217;t tell them the second time he did it), and they refuse to buy anything for him that may calm him down, so it #8217;s up to me to do it from home. My question is, what can I do to stop this behavior, and how can I let him know not to be stressed anymore? I give him endless cuddles during the day and he usually curls up next to me at night. I give him treats nightly and when his lazy butt isn #8217;t sleeping, I #8217;ll play with him. I leave out his favorite blanket and toys, too. Any other moment of the day he is playful and carefree and his behavior doesn #8217;t seem like it #8217;s changed at all, but for some reason during the night is when he starts to do his business, so I #8217;m assuming that he feels alone at night? I #8217;m going to try locking them up with me in my room to see if the behavior changes, but I #8217;m not expert and I don #8217;t want to stress them out even more. Tl;dr - How do I destress a comfortable cat that #8217;s pooping on my floor without meds/buying anything?</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-04-20 20:01:36</DATE>
      <TEXT>On the application, it says to enter the  #8220;Academic End Date, #8221; then goes on to say the following:  gt;The academic period is the date range of the school term(s) for which you #8217;re requesting the loan. If you #8217;re borrowing for multiple academic terms (Ex. Fall and Spring Semester) it is important to list the end date of the latest term being applied for as your Academic Period End Date. The term confusing me is  #8220;latest term. #8221; Does this mean that I don #8217;t put it down for all of the semesters that I need the loan for (meaning covering all four years)? If I need the loan for fall and spring up until 2024, do I put May 2024, or May 2021 (as in the end of my first complete year of college)? Unrelated, but also, when asking the loan amount, do I request for all four years of college, or do I reapply every year? Sorry if I sound ignorant or naive but I #8217;m not financially literate and instead of helping me my parents are just belittling me. I just need 10k for college this year, so I #8217;ve been looking into Navy Federal Private Student Loans. Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Well, I #8217;ve personally been looking at Micronesia (FSM), The Marshall Islands, and Palau, however there are many more that are equally amazing. Palau and Micronesia are connected somehow to the US, so if you #8217;re American, you may have a good chance of getting a job there with government stuff. The Marshall Islands is sinking and not many people go to/live there anymore, but Majuro (the capital) does have a good amount of jobs and I #8217;ve heard the people are absolutely amazing. I #8217;m Fijian so of course I #8217;ll say that it #8217;s a really great country and has one of the best universities (USP) in the Islands, however a lot of jobs there will say  #8220;for Fijian residents only #8221; to make sure that every Fijian has a job. Moving and living there is not impossible though. If you are American and don #8217;t want to have to deal with visas and paperwork but still want to leave the mainland, there are Guam and American Samoa as well, along with Saipan and Tinian a few miles away from Guam. Vanuatu has caught my eye, but the crazy interesting language is a bit intimidating for people looking to work there. The Solomon Islands is interesting too, but I couldn #8217;t find much about it. **Tl;dr** - Micronesia-FSM, Palau, Marshall Islands and Fiji, and if you #8217;re American, Guam, Tinian and Saipan, or American Samoa.

They get Affirmative Action, their month is celebrated in schools and in the media, there are black book sections in the stores and black television series yet Asians are still struggling to get recognition in society just because we make up a smaller portion of the population. Yes we should unite with other minorities but still know that  #8220;POC Solidarity #8221; only exists amongst Asians. No one else cares about it but us, and it #8217;s clear through actions such as these. Yes we must be kind, and understanding towards other minorities, but Asians have been nice for too long. We have to stop covering up for other minorities and saying  #8220;sorry #8221; for what they do wrong, and stop making excuses for them by blaming the white man.</TEXT>

No one is attacking anyone. They #8217;re simply trying to show what the news would not, and if that disturbs some people or makes them feel bad, then it #8217;s no ones fault but theirs. I swear when an Asian person does something controversial, the entirety of the Asian community doesn #8217;t come up acting like they #8217;ve been shot at.

It always confuses me why Asian youth would rather stay in the West rather than reunite with their roots and help build up their own nations. Imagine how amazing Asian societies can become if people were willing to put time and effort into helping their own economies. Aside from just Asian people, those who stand with Asians or are willing to put aside their differences to assist and build up Asian societies should be allowed to do just that. I #8217;m not talking about merchants or English teachers or missionaries, but people in sectors like Media or finance that have enough education to create a better future and community in these countries for Asians youth, but at the same time not try to westernize,diversify or change the conservative culture of said nations.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>You know what? You're right. Those of us here have to support our fellow Asians because it's unlikely that anyone else will. I overlooked that aspect, but for those who can't return, it's beautiful to see them building up the Asian communities where they reside. Great observation!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That's true. I watched a documentary about how much better universities are in Asia than in the West, so I figure that the young people pushed out from the Asian education system are super intelligent and far better off than we would be. Attempting to integrate in a society like that with a very different educational/work background isn't as easy. Good points!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Is there anywhere I can get private, student loans without a co-signer or income?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-05-01 14:08:52</DATE>
      <TEXT>Long story short, my parents won #8217;t let me get a job, and I have 0$ in my name. My dream has been to attend college, and I need to pay 4k$ before the fall deadline, but my parents, because I refused to go to school for pre-med or apply to the school *they* wanted me to, are refusing to help me at all. I tried reasoning with them to co-sign, but they refuse, so I #8217;m on my own now. I #8217;ve read here that Ascent loans has an independent program of some sort which I #8217;m looking into, but are there any other loan sites (besides Sallie Mae) that allow you to take out a loan based on future earnings, without a co-signer or income? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Haha, thanks for cheering me up with this response. Thing is, not only did the deadline already pass, but my SAT score was a 1050 (and ACT 21), but the school has a requirement of almost 1400 and above. I knew I wouldn #8217;t get in, and paying a 75$ app fee would be a waste. Even if I did, the scholarships would go to the smart kids. I did lie to them and say I was going for pre-med, but I didn #8217;t know that colleges put the major you selected on your acceptance letter, and my parents were furious. I am planning to up my SAT and reapply within the next year or so, but seeing all of my peers with supportive families so happy on decision day today is really heartbreaking considering how hard I #8217;ve worked for this day all my life. I really appreciate your advice though. It made me smile. Hope you have an amazing day :)</TEXT>

      <TITLE>My narcissistic parents stopped me from achieving my dream of going to college, and now I'm having a mental breakdown.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-05-01 16:02:21</DATE>
      <TEXT>I don't know what to do at this point but wanted to get this off of my chest. Watching everyone else commit to a college and get to experience that is the most gut wrenching and heartbreaking thing I've ever been through. That could've been me if I wasn't so stupid. Even then, jealousy won't get me anywhere. I just have to figure out what I'm going to do with myself from here on out. After my suicide attempt in December, I told myself that I \*had\* to live. I have painted the perfect picture for my life in my head, and I didn't want to give my parents the satisfaction of knowing that their toxicity has gotten to me, and I'd do exactly what they wanted - either end up broke and miserable, or end of killing myself, like they drove my sisters to. I wanted to be happy and prove to them that I can be successful and live the life I wanted, but it seems so hard now. Today is College Decision Day. I've been waiting for this day for my entire life, made straight As, sacrificed sleep, friendships, and my own mental health just to please them. But because I didn't go to college for what my parents wanted, or apply for the major that \*they\* wanted me to do, here I am, sitting in my room deciding whether I should slit my wrist or my throat, because being called a failure and told to kill myself by the person who's job it is to love her own daughter is just too overwhelming. I just can't do this anymore. She's always comparing me to other kids I used to go to school with, and telling me how much of a disappointment I am compared to them. "I would've rather had \_\_\_ as my kid." "See, \_\_\_\_ didn't like school when she was younger, but look where she is now." "You and \_\_\_\_ used to be such good friends and now she's better than you." I was so freaking close to getting out of here, going to college like I've always wanted, and finally getting the chance to taste freedom. I was even offered a full ride from a school based on my stats, but my parents heard that and called saying I was no longer interested, just out of spite. I even got a great scholarship to my dream college, but can't go since my parents refused to fill out the CSS profile and send their W-2 forms because they didn't want me to go to that school. I received so many opportunities, and my parents destroyed every single one of them because they didn't want to see me succeed. Still, I can't help but blame myself for trusting them, for letting my guard down, and for taking so long. I can't help but hate every little piece of myself because of this shit. I should've known from the beginning that you can't reason with a narcissist. I've thought for so long that I should just kill myself so I could reincarnate into a better family with a better life, but I know my spirit chose this for me, and if I do die, I will just be reborn with the same, or possibly worse issues. I didn't fight for so long to keep myself alive for this, but at the same time death seems so much better than trying to take on the world by myself. On some days I'm ready to take the challenge, and others I just want it all to end. I have plans to run away and never look back. To work my ass off and pay my own damn self through college, get the hell out of this godforsaken country that has failed me in every way possible, maybe move to Taiwan and live the life that \*I\* wanted. But it is so fucking hard to keep going. It's so hard when no one has your back. It is so hard when the world around you is so fucking cruel. Happy CDD to everone, I guess.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t want to get roasted so my answer is going to be in Spanish, but basically, my mother is part Hispanic, and even though she knows Spanish, she never taught it to us because she wanted us to be  #8220;American #8221; (she #8217;s also half Asian, and didn #8217;t teach us that language either). At first I wanted to learn to speak with my relatives, but then I thought about branching out. I initially wanted to stay in the US and assist mostly Asian and Latino children who can #8217;t speak English as an ESL teacher, and thought learning Spanish would help with getting closer to kids and families (same reason I considered learning languages like Hindi, Korean, Tagalog, etc.) Now, I #8217;ve decided that I would one day like to leave the states permanently and live/teach abroad, then eventually settle down in either South America (namely Panam #225; because that #8217;s where my Abuelo if from), the Pacific Islands, Asia, or the Caribbean and knew that speaking Spanish is key for living there. I was always closest to my Spanish teachers in school so I picked up on the language and gained a love for it through my education. It #8217;s a beautiful language with an incredible history and people, and my love for linguistics has drawn me closer over the years.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Leaving an abusive household and unsure about being homeless in DC. What is the safest US city for a tiny female to survive in?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-05-02 18:06:27</DATE>
      <TEXT>\- Also posted to r/homeless \- \[Some background, I turned 18 recently. The reason I call myself "tiny" in the title is because I am 4'11 and still look like I'm 12, and I feel like with trafficking being a huge thing in this country, I don't want to be somewhere where children are a huge target.\] So long story short, I am about to be homeless soon , but I'm wary of staying here in the DC area as a homeless teen. I have already researched and found three youth \[aged 18-24\] shelters in the area (Casa Ruby, N Street Village, and the Latin American Youth Center), but with knowledge of the extremely high numbers of homeless people here, I figured that most youth shelters would have a long waiting list, or no beds available. Plus, it's one of the most dangerous cities in the country, and I know that thousands of people live there and go unharmed daily, but it's not a risk I'm willing to take. So now, I have been looking elsewhere. I've heard some recommend San Diego, then I've heard others advise against it. Same with Portland, Texas, and Florida. At first I was looking at New Orleans, since there are a good number of colleges in the same vicinity as the Covenant House down there, but I've read here on Reddit that it can be very dangerous. and I'm a bit naive. I'm willing to travel to almost anywhere, as long as it is genuinely safe. If the city itself doesn't have homeless/youth shelters, I'm down to go anywhere where sleeping on beaches and in parks is legal, so I can chill during the day in a safe environment and work at night. My goal is to get a part time job (hopefully 15k+) and eventually get myself through college, but I just can't do it from home. (Yes I've considered JobCorps, but I feel like it isn't worth it, and it'll just prolong my homelessness). My main concern is just having a roof over my head/safe place to stay while I work. Any advice is very much appreciated! Edit: I #8217;m also a Pacific Islander/South Asian/Hispanic. I #8217;m not the type of person to associate the South with racism or immediately judge people based on where they live, but I understand that it is something to consider when looking for places to stay.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for your response. I've currently gotten one of those under my belt. I've received both subsidized and unsubsidized and federal loans + scholarships, and I've received work study. My room is technically covered, I just don't have the 4k-5k, and their financial aid isn't necessarily lenient. The in-state schools I've applied to didn't give me as much money, hence why I'm going for the school that only costs 4.5k a semester vs 10k a semester. My parents make too much so I didn't get much on the FAFSA, but I have been looking into taking out a loan. Unfortunately, I need an income or a cosigner, neither of which I have, but I've still been looking for student loan sites that don't require that. I do appreciate your advice!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you! I do have a friend in North Carolina that I may be able to get help from, so I've been considering the area for a while. I also really, truly appreciate the offer! June is a bit too early for me, as I want to make sure I have everything together, and I want to make sure my sister and my pets are safe before I go, but nonetheless, bless your kind soul. West seems like the move so far, and I'm researching places in California right now. Thanks again!</TEXT>

I do know there are safer areas, however, which I am down to check out. Thanks again!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for the response! Long story short my parents are made at me that I didn't go to school for the major they wanted, or apply to the school they wanted me to attend, so they're not allowing me to go to school at all (and I can't afford it on my own). I tried lying to them about it but the truth came in with the acceptance letters and I got busted. College has always been my goal, but now there's no way I can attend this semester. I'm not dumping the idea of attending in the spring though! I'm graduating this year, and will hopefully get my diploma if my parents don't try to withhold it from me. I've looked into loans, but apparently you have to have an income or a cosigner, neither of which I have, but I've still been looking! Unfortunately the school I'm thinking about is a bit small and doesn't have much funds, which is why I've been hesitant to explain my situation. Heck, I even got into my dream college but my parents wouldn't fill out the CSS so I can't afford it. I've thought about bringing up my SAT scores and getting in touch with my state school, or if I do decide to move out West, getting help from a community college there. You didn't come off as criticizing at all! I think you gave some great advice and I appreciate it greatly. My goal was to go to college because I knew that they could help me when it came to my independence and getting away from home, but my parents don't want me to go for some reason. They did the same to my other siblings, all of whom had to run away as well to get out. Again, thank you so much, and I greatly appreciate your detailed advice!</TEXT>

My heart still flutters when I see him, but I #8217;m not as hurt over this as I probably should be. I #8217;m only sensitive because the past few days/weeks have been rough for me. We #8217;ll just see if he decides to one day make his account public like every normal human being who knows they have someone who #8217;s madly in love with them from their  #8220;math #8221; class ;) As for my sister, her dumb self literally UNFOLLOWED HIM by  #8220;accident #8221; so now I can #8217;t look at his page anymore.

I actually live in SoMd, I just said DC because it #8217;s 20-30 minutes away from my house. Morally speaking I avoided the option of the military for a long time because I had a sibling in the military who was killed. Plus, because they left home on a bad note and went into the military without our parents permission, my parents told them that they #8217;d come back home  #8220;in a pine box, #8221; and that #8217;s exactly how they came- in their casket. I #8217;ve been afraid/too angry to go into it at that point, but push come to shove it is still an opportunity that I am willing to take as a last resort. Thank you again, and I appreciate the advice.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As a South Asian person, this was needed so much. I #8217;m always ashamed to see other brown kids talking shit about their own people, each other, or even about other Asians like they aren #8217;t Asian themselves, and then kissing up to the same white folks that colonized and enslaved them for however many years. It isn #8217;t fair to people who are actually proud of their heritage to get stereotyped and made fun of just because a few ignoramuses said it was okay to make fun of someone #8217;s accent or it #8217;s okay to make  #8220;dog eating #8221; jokes. I know sometimes, it stems from the fact that Asians have been abused and discriminated against and made fun of for so long that they try to be lighthearted about the situation. We end up just giving into it because society cares so little about us that our heritage is a joke. It shouldn #8217;t be like this though. Asian youth need to stop the self-hate, and stop the white worship before we end up becoming another hopeless generation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A good chunk of Hispanic/Latino people, like my Abuelo, are Indigenous or Native American, or at least Mestizo. There are Indigenous, black, and Asian Hispanics, who are the minorities, and then there are white Hispanics who are direct descendants of the Spanish (so I #8217;ve been told). Most Puerto Ricans and Cubans don #8217;t look look fully white. Some of them could be Mestizo, and there is an enormous Afro-Latino population in both countries (with a sizeable Asian-Latino population in Cuba). So I would say no, they #8217;re not, but then again the Hispanic side of my family is Panamanian so I wouldn #8217;t know.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Transferring ownership of my pets to a friend. Are there any papers that I 100% need to give them (license, tags, etc.) to ensure that there's no mixups at the vet/other places?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-05-05 22:25:22</DATE>
      <TEXT>Come the end of this month, I am planning to give away my pets to a friend behind my parents' back (for personal reasons). I know where my pets papers are located, but instead of taking them and getting in trouble, I am going to make copies of them to give to the next owner. The drawer is filled with papers though, and I was wondering which \*specific\* papers do I 100% need in order for them to get their shots, boarding, etc. without a problem confirming who the real owner is. I know about vet records and health related stuff, but is that it? Also, are copies allowed when taking your pets to the vet, or do you need to have the original papers? I am planning to eventually pay my parents 470$ to finalize the transfer of ownership, but even then they probably won't hand over the paperwork. I have no idea how anything works regarding paperwork, so pls don't roast me. I just want the transaction to be smooth without my parents being informed of who the animals have been given to. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

They don #8217;t mistreat them in the abusive sense that it #8217;s reportable, but they keep the puppy in a cage all day and yell at him when he tries to come out and play, and they won #8217;t let me put my overweight cats on a diet. They say they #8217;re going to give them back to the humane society when I leave out of spite (which will be this September), but I want to keep them for myself because I was the one who took care of them, and I love them more than anything in the world. I know they #8217;re not mine to give away but if I don #8217;t do this, I may not every see them again.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for your advice...and reality check haha. For some reason I considered them to be more like children than property, but you are right, and I most definitely don #8217;t want my friend to get into any legal trouble. Firstly, all three of them are microchipped and have licenses. My best bet right now is probably to convince my parents to transfer ownership (and put it in writing) so that there #8217;s no way they can legally take them back if they sign a contract of some sort saying they #8217;ll give up ownership? Idk if this will work or not, so please correct me if I #8217;m wrong. Thank you again for your help. I greatly appreciate it!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>JackFroot Segment: https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_34sOal-Kn/?igshid=17nd3ykvz8sq8 The only thing that irks me about this is: 1) Why are their faces blurred? 2) They don #8217;t know if it was racially motivated? A white man attacks a black man and it #8217;s a racist crime. A white man calls a Muslim a terrorist and it #8217;s hate speech. Multiple Asian people get attacked BECAUSE OF COVID and they #8217;re  #8220;not sure if it #8217;s racially motivated? #8221; Bullshit. If the races in this case were any different, faces would be plastered. Still, it is a huge success for us. I #8217;m glad they spoke about the rise of anti-Asian crime during this time. I almost teared up when I heard this. Also, shout out to Padilla, a Hispanic man for giving a crap and showing clear outrage with this incident. It #8217;s not much, but it #8217;s good to see other minorities, namely Latinos share our pain.</TEXT>

Many White and Black Americans do not see Asians as humans and consider us inferior. You #8217;re right. We shouldn #8217;t really blame COVID, but instead see that COVID is just an excuse for people who #8217;ve been racist this entire time to finally exhibit their hatred for Asians without repercussions.

I feel like society doesn #8217;t care about anything where the perpetrator isn #8217;t white and the victim isn #8217;t black. Not that stories like that don #8217;t matter, but those are the only ones that make the news, and the only ones that get attention on social media. A few weeks/months ago a loved store owner was minding her own business when she was murdered in a racist attack by an African American man, and her story didn #8217;t even make the news. People of other races are violently murdered in similar acts all the time in this country and no one bats an eye. So yes, it #8217;s sad, but I would appreciate it if people stop acting like it isn #8217;t the norm on social media, and calling people who don #8217;t care bigots.</TEXT>

My math teacher even told me that math is useless, and I think that once the person who majored in something and dedicated their entire lives to it says that their subject is unnecessary, it means something. Schools nowadays only cater to potential STEM majors, and as someone who wants to be an ESL teacher in the future, I see absolutely no point in learning about geometric proofs.</TEXT>

It may be unappealing to Americans to see 14 year old boys dress up in overalls or makeup or colorful clothes (looking at you, NCT Dream), but for them, it wouldn #8217;t be considered out of place for them to do that, at least in East Asian countries.

      <DATE>2020-05-13 01:08:03</DATE>
      <TEXT>I #8217;ve done some research (including reading through this sub) about appealing for financial aid, and most of the posts seem to say you have to have a good reason/evidence to back up said reason for appealing. For example, you broke your leg or your parents lost their job. I currently owe about 10k (about 8.5k rounded) a year, which is not bad at all compared to what I got from other schools, and I want to bring it down to 5k or less a year. The only problem I have is that my parents are refusing to pay, I can #8217;t take out loans on my own, and I really want to go to this school. I don #8217;t know what exactly I can use to explain why I need more money, besides the fact that I have absolutely no way of paying it out of pocket. It #8217;s also a medium sized private school, so I doubt they #8217;d give me extra money if I asked. I can #8217;t retake my ACT or SAT, my state says fourth quarter doesn #8217;t count, and I have no extra activities to add to my resume (which I already submitted). The only realistic reasons I have is 1) my parents are moving and have to pay for a new house 2) my parents just bought a new car after an accident and have to pay for that 3) my sister is planning to go to college as well (CC) 4) my parents are sending money to family overseas. I was hoping to say something about my dad being an essential worker during COVID in my letter but I doubt that would make them feel any sympathy for me. I was planning to defer my acceptance for a year and work to pay for college myself, but I kind of don #8217;t want to put it off for so long, and want to attend in the fall with my peers. If I ask for an appeal and defer for a year, would they take the extra money back? Should I wait to defer and then appeal? What are y #8217;all #8217;s experiences with appealing for financial aid? What did you tell them and how much did they give you? Did they ask you for proof of any kind? Thank you in advance for any help! Edit: This isn #8217;t a fancy shmancy T20 btw.

If you don #8217;t mind me asking, what exactly (we #8217;ll, not exactly but still) did you say to the school that offered you an extra 10k?

      <TEXT>Next time a black person says  #8220;but I don #8217;t see Asians standing up for our issues #8221; show them this photo right here. Something we *don #8217;t* see is black people standing up for Asian Lives. Not even we stand up for ourselves because we #8217;re too busy caring about what other minorities will think when we protest their anti-Asian sentiment, but I hope what #8217;s happening around the world now is starting to show the Youth what people really think of them.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There have been a lot of trolls coming in here and invading this sub to talk about their own issues, and I think there should be some sort of rule implemented against that. Yes, I know we have the no trolls rule but it doesn #8217;t seem to be enforced considering how often it happens. This is an Asian safe space, and if you #8217;re an ally, that #8217;s fine and they are more than welcome to participate, but I #8217;ve seen too many comments like  #8220;but ___ people go through worse than Asians #8221; or  #8220;Asians are racist towards x group of people #8221; and moderators are allowing those people to come in and ruin proper discussions. Also, there #8217;s a difference between  #8220;senseless bashing of other minorities #8221; and pointing out blatant racism from other minorities, and the latter should not be punishable or a bannable offense.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t know, actually. A Disney Cruise Line ship came in a few days ago, and so did another ship with Vincentians on board. According to the news, they #8217;re trying to return citizens/sailors who are temporarily abroad back home. According to the news, they say that  #8220;Kingstown has also said that it would [not ban flights from Europe ](https://www.iwnsvg.com/2020/03/12/covid-19-in-svg-no-ban-on-european-travellers/) or the United States. #8221; In addition to that, [this news article](https://www.iwnsvg.com/2020/03/14/covid-19-in-svg-gonsalves-proposes-halving-tax-to-urge-intra-regional-travel/) basically explains how our Prime Minister is putting tourism before the people.

      <TEXT>I lived in two places, but the most recent was a small island about 4 hours from the mainland. There was no running water/plumbing, but we did have water tanks provided by the government that collect rain water for us to use for bathing, flushing toilets, washing our hands, etc. The house was a comfortable size, about 4 bedrooms, a living room and kitchen, and underneath the house we had an area where we prepared food sometimes if we felt up to it. We didn #8217;t get WiFi in the house but did on the roof, as there was a government building a few minutes away. The electricity didn #8217;t go out much during the day. We had an enclosed  #8220;garden, #8221; which was really just some bushes, a shed, an outside toilet, clothesline and an outside kitchen. We were about 7 minutes from the beach, and the house was pure concrete.</TEXT>

I know that Americans are so stuck on their children  #8220;expressing creativity #8221; but we don #8217;t realize how much the clothes you wear impact a child #8217;s social life. People judge based on appearance, luxuries, etc., and a lot of people are immediately outcast based on how they dress. Not having to figure out what to wear everyday is also great. I wish that American public schools had uniforms like every other country, but sadly that #8217;s not something that our society would ever come together on.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From one female to another, those are some pretty hasty generalizations you got there and pretty harsh ones at that. Yes, *some* men act violently or in bad ways when it comes to rejection, but so do females. Women have raped and killed many a times too, you just don #8217;t hear about it because the media likes to make us look innocent. Both sexes are equally horrible at taking rejection, and if you #8217;d like educated people to agree with you, you probably should be less sexist in your arguments and try to steer away from nasty stereotyping.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I know you may not want to hear this, but is there any way you can wait until you are 18? You can save up more money in the meantime, and many youth shelters become available to you once you reach 18. If you cannot wait, there is the Sasha Bruce House available to those 17 and younger. As someone who #8217;s also from Maryland, I have looked into the following youth shelters (18-24), and they all appear to be safe and very helpful: -Casa Ruby -Latin American Youth Center (LAYC) -Covenant House If you feel the need to leave right now, I recommend you join Job Corps. They have a program where you can get your GED, as well as job training and possibly placement. They aren #8217;t the safest, cleanest, or happiest option, but they give you free food, shelter, and education, which you can #8217;t really find anywhere else. Dropping out of high school is not the best idea, but if you #8217;re going to do it, make sure you at least get a GED at some point if you want to live a normal life. Job Corps is the place for you to finish out your high school. As far as college goes, a social worker at the shelter will most likely be able to help you get some kind of override when it comes to financial aid if you are fleeing an abusive (whether physical or mental) household. I personally decided to give up on the US education system and save up enough to pay for a college abroad that is  lt;5k a year, which you could also do if you really wanted to. Some colleges might not take someone with a GED in, but there are a good amount that do. Apply to those. Your best bet would be to apply to community college first, and then transfer, but if you don #8217;t like that idea, there #8217;s usually other options. I know you said you want to be under the radar, but at your age and even mine, things like this are extremely hard to do on your own. Job Corps will usually provide transportation to their centers for you if your parents won #8217;t take you. You can also call 211 or visit the United Way website for help. I hope this helped in some way, shape or form. Like the above user said, girls (AND boys), especially young ones are subject to kidnapping, trafficking, etc. In a country as dangerous as the US (especially with you in Baltimore), it #8217;s not good to be out on the streets at such a young age with strangers and no plan, so I beg you to please stay safe.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This is why I #8217;ve been looking into colleges elsewhere. I found about one or two schools that are around 2.5k (?) USD a year and are very good, quality universities. I used to be obsessed with prestige and getting into these amazing schools, but the debt is just not worth it. Unless you want to work for NASA or something, it really does not matter from where you get your degree. As long as you have a quality education, a degree, and some smarts in there somewhere, whether or not you got your degree from an Ivy League just doesn #8217;t matter.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-05-30 22:05:29</DATE>
      <TEXT>To start things off, I am not Native North American, but my mother is part Arawak and my father is an indigenous Pacific Islander. I wholeheartedly apologize in advance if this is in any way, shape, or form rude or disrespectful, but I just wanted to hear your opinions. I am lowkey about to be homeless soon little to no money, but college is my #1 goal right now, and has been my dream for years. My future career (in education) requires a degree, so I've been looking for any and every way to get one. As I was researching some of the cheapest universities in the US, I came across a few Tribal Colleges and noticed that with many of them costing less than 5k a year and providing housing (specifically Din #233; College), they looked more than ideal. I also have a dream of working with Indigenous communities, preferably in Oceania, and thought that seeing life through the lens of Indigenous people here would be a great place to start. I guess I just wanted to know, is it okay for a non-Native American person to attend a Tribal College? If anyone here has, what was your experience, and what is your opinion on attending Tribal Colleges? Is there anything that one should know before attending one? Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My parents are refusing to hand over my documents and a civil standby probably won #8217;t work. I #8217;ve snooped through their papers with no success, so at this point I know I #8217;m just going to need to replace them. Thing is, I have absolutely no cash, and no one to help with the payments, and even if I did, I don #8217;t like taking money from people. Also, my family is moving to another state, so I won #8217;t be able to go to any government buildings in my birth state (where I #8217;m living right now) to get any paperwork. What can I do to get around this? Edit: I found my SSN! Every time I asked my nmom for it for college admissions and whatnot, she #8217;d say she lost it or I don #8217;t need it, etc. I went snooping through her purse and boom, found it. Now I have 2/4 items, which makes me happy for some odd reason!</TEXT>

I #8217;m neutral because innocent people are having their livelihoods and shops destroyed. I #8217;m neutral because cops are being killed and people think it #8217;s a good thing. I #8217;m neutral because liberals keep trying to make it seem as though people are oppressed and Trump is horrible when they #8217;re not. And I #8217;m neutral because BLM has turned into more of a domestic terrorist groupie than a movement. If they think that not generalizing all white people/cops, or not kissing up to the same people that are destroying this country is racist, then screw them.</TEXT>

Like are people not allowed to have opinions and choose to remain quiet anymore? I #8217;m quiet because I don #8217;t care about politics, and I don #8217;t have time to keep up and/or post on social media like my voice matters anyways. Controlling people by saying they #8217;re racist for not speaking up makes me want to remain quiet just to piss people off tbh.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-06-02 23:44:31</DATE>
      <TEXT>**Tl;dr - refer to title** I #8217;ve decided when I want to leave and how, but the problem is, with where I #8217;m going I won #8217;t be able to have pets with me. I tried arranging something with my sister and her boyfriend, but I recently learned that she has been siding with my nmom and telling her all of my plan (for instance, I had to go behind my parents back and steal my ssn because they wouldn #8217;t give it to me, and she told them about it). I love her to death and I know she #8217;s only doing It to get on their good side so she won #8217;t end up homeless too, but she #8217;s very lazy and not good at keeping deadlines. I #8217;m afraid that she #8217;ll forget to send them or something will end up happening, etc. I was also considering putting them with one of my old teachers who I trust 100% with my life and my cats, but out of spite my parents are saying that they #8217;ll call the police on her for theft or have the animals killed if I leave and take them with me. Mind you I #8217;m the one who takes care of, feeds, and holds the cats in my room, yet she wants to keep them for herself. With my dog, they keep threatening to give him away just because he has separation anxiety and cries a lot. I had to go out of my way to train him because they refused, and they get mad when I say they shouldn #8217;t keep him in a cage all day. The thing is, he bites, and if they give him away and he bites someone, they may have him put down. He takes a LONG time to get used to people, and although he #8217;s a baby, I #8217;m scared for what might happen to him. They abused our pug to where he was throwing up every hour of the day and died simply because they didn #8217;t like how he sounded when he breathed, and I #8217;m afraid they #8217;ll hurt my little baby chihuahua. I wanted the peace of mind knowing that they were safe, but with my parents, I never know. At least if they re-homed them in front of me, I #8217;d know that my babies were safe and with a stable, loving family, but now I can #8217;t be sure. I know that there #8217;s no hope in arguing, and I just want to know how to calm myself down and cope with never seeing my beloved fur babies ever again. I thought about buying back pets that looked like them, but the behavior and memories wouldn #8217;t be the same. So as the title states, how do you do it guys? How the heck do I stop bawling my eyes out about never seeing my babies again?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for the help. From what I've heard on this sub before, the police can't do much about getting my documents back since she technically is my mother and has control over me. The most they could do is a civil standby, and even then she could just say they are lost or destroyed. So I'll have to get new ones anyways. Since I'm 18 now, I don't think youth services can help me much anymore. CPS has been called on her multiple times in the past, so I doubt that contacting anyone for help is going to change anything. Plus, I have no direct evidence against her, as she's excellent at manipulating people, and the abuse thus far has only been verbal. Plus, she's recruiting my sister to speak out against me already in return for favors, so I doubt that they'll believe me with another daughter in the house to tell them that what I say isn't true. The only things I have in my room at the moment that could be sold are my cap and gown, a fidget cube, and my cats, but I have been looking into doing odd jobs! My state is soon to reopen anyways so getting a job won't be as difficult in a few weeks. The shelter is actually only 30-40 minutes away by car, but I live in the boonies so it'll take some time to get out to there. The reason why I'm going out of state is because almost all of the shelters in my state require documentation of homelessness or a referral of some sort, which I don't have. In addition to that it's probably the only youth shelter that is still taking in people off the streets at this time, and it takes kids in from all three states in the DMV. If push comes to shove I will call 211 or social services. I also have a teacher who lives nearby, and although she's already having her own troubles and I wouldn't want to bother her, I'd call her up as a last resort. I also plan to enter job corps for temporary housing when it opens back up as I figure out what to do next. Thank you again for the advice! I just hope that things will open up soon so it won't be so difficult getting around.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I plan to take a little  #8220;trip #8221; to another state soon on foot. I don #8217;t have money for a gun/taser/pepper spray, and as a little fat child I don #8217;t think fighting or running is going to work for me. I thought about taking a knife but #1) I don #8217;t want to get killed/arrested, and #2) I heard here on Reddit not to unless you 101% know how to use it. I also thought about making pepper spray at home, but the container I #8217;ll be using is no where near big enough and it wouldn #8217;t be as strong anyways. Still thinking of doing it, tho. Aside from that I #8217;ll probably take a super bright flashlight to temp blind anyone who tries to run up on me. Is there anything else I can do to ensure safety? **Edit: Problem solved!

      <TEXT>Thanks! I don #8217;t know how to explain it, but I #8217;m taking a main road, but that main road is between trees on one side, and a bunch of houses on the other, if that makes sense. Like, I will be near a forest/the woods, but there are always going to be houses or shops on the other side of the street up until I reach the city, if that makes sense. I #8217;ll be going from my city, which is relatively safe and chill to another neighborhood/city that is also extremely safe, but I #8217;ll have to cross into a poorer/underdeveloped area for about three hours, and there #8217;s no way around it. I #8217;m still looking into getting a ride, and since I #8217;ll be crossing by the US Coast Guard place, I #8217;m kinda hoping I #8217;ll get lucky and someone will just drive me the extra 20 minutes. I #8217;m planning to go strictly during the day because I #8217;m crazy but not that crazy, and I don #8217;t know how long this curfew will last. Don #8217;t wanna get caught out late. I currently don #8217;t have a backpack and am planning on bringing a small tote or trash bag with medicine and other products like my toothbrush and whatnot, and I #8217;ll definitely be bringing loads of water considering it #8217;s already in the 90s down here.

I (US) was looking into studying in Denmark since it marketed itself as having English degrees, but after reading into it, the program that I looked at said that your first year only is in English, and after the second year you have to take your remaining courses in Danish. Are there sneaky catches like this that they don #8217;t tell you about when studying in the Netherlands?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello! Okay so, Some basic questions: - Is there financial aid for international students, and how does it work? Here in the US you are automatically considered for aid when you apply, and can receive extra if you fill out the government issued FAFSA and qualify. Is there something similar in the Netherlands? Also, are scholarships usually applied for, or are they applied for? - With the schools I #8217;ve looked at, most don #8217;t have many admissions requirements besides a HS diploma. Is this normal? - How simple is the admissions process, and if you don #8217;t mind, can you go into some detail about the specific aspect of admissions? Ik you won #8217;t know much about international admissions, but do they require things like essays, test scores, recommendation letters, etc.? - Do you happen to know much about NHL Stenden? What #8217;s it like there, how are the teachers, and how helpful is the staff in general? - What are some amenities you have on campus for students (such as a shuttle, IDs, computer labs for students, etc.)? - What has your experience been attending a university in the Netherlands, and what are some pros and cons? Is there anything they don #8217;t mention on the website that we should know? - Do universities there allow transfer students (Students who have completed 2 years of their undergrad at community college)? - Also forgot time add, how hard is it getting an English speaking job there? Do most part time jobs require Dutch? Again, sorry for so many questions, but i appreciate this AMA!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Tl;dr - 1) Not a minor, 2) No turning back, parents are abusive but CPS is useless, 3) I plan to get a case manager, job, and education from the shelter. Long version: Not a minor, I actually just turned 18 a few months ago (and still have zero life skills. Go me.) Making peace with them isn #8217;t really possible since there #8217;s been a lot of verbal, mental, and emotional abuse and I just can #8217;t stay anymore. My mental health is deteriorating rapidly and I #8217;m afraid that I may end up seriously screwing myself over if I don #8217;t leave. I don #8217;t really trust adults all that much since I #8217;ve tried contacting CPS, etc. previously, and I #8217;m still here, so I thought I #8217;d do it on my own. As of now, I #8217;ve been looking into getting a ride-share or somehow, if possible, asking someone from the shelter to pick me up, since I do realize how silly of an idea this would be in the long run. Walking would just be a last resort if I 100% had to leave right then in there, that #8217;s why I #8217;ve been trying to plan in advance, if that makes sense. I #8217;d planned to do 4 hours one day and 4 hours another, but I realized that I would stop the first day in a bad part of town, and didn #8217;t want to spend the night there, so decided that if I absolutely had to, I #8217;d start at about 6am (sun rises here at 5), and continue the entire way. Even if I stop a few times, I #8217;d be there before sundown (8-8:30). From the research I #8217;ve done, once you get to the shelter, they #8217;ll do intake, put me into a program, and I #8217;ll get a case manager to help me with my situation. I #8217;ll also be able to receive mental care, which I desperately need right now. My #1 goal is to get into college, since education is extremely important to me and vital for my dream career. I just needed somewhere to live while I work to afford it, while also getting some kind of mentoring to develop life skills I never learned in school or at home that are necessary for me to survive (finances, etc.). I #8217;m not the type of female that thinks we #8217;re more vulnerable/more of a target than men or anything, but I do understand that females are huge targets for kidnapping, and as someone who #8217;s almost been kidnapped walking home from school once, trust me, walking is the absolute *last* thing I want to do. I just need to plan ahead just in case I have to. Btw, I really do appreciate the help you #8217;re giving me, and the advice. I need every piece I can get before I even think about leaving the house haha.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m so sorry to hear that you #8217;re in this situation. By any chance, can you ask your friend to come pick you up? You can make a deal with him and his parents that when you arrive you will work towards your education, and possibly even get a GED (if that #8217;s a thing in Italy). I #8217;m not sure if this is good advice, but there #8217;s a program here in the US called Job Corps. As much as I hate recommending people to come here, I know a few girls from South America (Honduras) who came here and did the program, got their GEDs, and are now doing job training. I don #8217;t know whether or not the program will come get you from Italy and bring you here, but their rule is that if you are not within about 30 miles of a center they will arrange your transportation. Lastly, I don #8217;t know if you have Google, but from a quick search of  #8220;homeless shelters in Italy, #8221; there are multiple results. You can search by where you are located. I know homeless shelters aren #8217;t the best option and are really scary to think about, but it #8217;s better than doing it on your own, especially if you need mental help or the assistance of social services. For now, I don #8217;t know if Italy is still shut down, but most shelters and resources may be closed. Your best bet is to first ask the friend for assistance and then plan where you want to go from there. I wish you the absolute best of luck, OP.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sorry to hear that you #8217;re going through that, OP. First question, what grade are you in/have you graduated yet? There #8217;s a program in the US called Job Corps, and as much as I hate recommending people to come here, it #8217;s a good choice for anyone looking for job training/a diploma. It gives you a roof over your head, food, and an education completely free. If you want to leave right now before you graduate, you can enter their GED program. More than likely, they #8217;ll arrange your transportation and send you to a center in one of the boarder states, but as of now the country is still on lockdown and the program has been closed. If you are near Mexico City, there is a Covenant House there for abused or homeless youth. When you turn 18 I believe, you can go there and take advantage of their social services. They will be able to help you get back on your feet. There #8217;s always the option of hiking to Canada  #8220;Life is Strange #8221; style, but I highly recommend you don #8217;t do that. Since everywhere is closed right now, I recommend your first step being to get in contact with the Covenant House, and see if they #8217;re still doing intake. If you have any friends you can stay by for free, that #8217;ll be a good option as well until places start to reopen. Wish you the best of luck, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hmm. That #8217;s a tough one. Do you happen to have money or a job? Also, if it #8217;s not too sensitive of a subject, how is your relationship with your dad? If you can ask him to get a job, or start saving up money somehow (legally), then you could afford to move away to a better city, while also putting yourself through school. From what I #8217;ve heard, public universities in Mexico are free. Also, since there are some really great cities in Mexico (boarder towns usually not being one of them), there #8217;s the possibility of moving away from your current town and to a safer and more stable environment. Have you talked to anyone from your school about your situation? Your teachers or counselors could direct you to resources that could be beneficial to you. Lastly, there #8217;s a program called  #8220;United Way #8221; in Mexico. If it works there the same way it does here, all you have to do is contact them, explain where you need help, and they will assist you the best that they can.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ah, that #8217;s reasonable. I don #8217;t think he #8217;d be the right person to talk to about leaving then huh. Here is the link for United Way. I don #8217;t want to give you false hope since I #8217;m not sure if it functions the same way as it does up here, but it #8217;s a good resource nonetheless. https://www.fondounido.org.mx Going back to the shelter thing, from my research, there aren #8217;t many in Mexico. Depending on how close you are to the boarder, and where exactly you are located in proximity to a shelter (since some of them require you to have residency), it is possible to contact a youth organization in Texas/Arizona/New Mexico/LA or wherever you are closest to, and ask them to work with you, and possibly help you cross over into their care. Lastly, you don #8217;t have to be religious, but some churches are good places to get temporary shelter/food, and some are even willing to assist you in exchange for you going to their services. I #8217;m not religious myself and kinda hate the idea of being in a church, but it #8217;s much better than being on the streets. You can either contact them or walk straight into one and ask for help. I #8217;m really sorry if I #8217;m not being of much help to you. I know what #8217;s it #8217;s like to have sucky parents and nowhere to go, so I want to help as much as possible. I also don #8217;t want you to get in trouble, however, since the US is kinda psych when it comes to who enters from the south.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>100% yes! It #8217;s really cute and lighthearted as others have said (and the two main characters are two of my all time favorite actors). Plus, somehow they don #8217;t do the whole soppy love thing but yet portrays a really adorable and happy couple? I don #8217;t know how to explain it, but as someone who #8217;s not a fan of romance, I enjoyed it wayy too much.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I know nobody asked, but to be honest, I was one of the kids who fell for it. I #8217;d never won anything in my entire life despite my efforts. I saw other kids in my grade getting honors from their STEM program, doing things like Destination Imagination, or joining clubs like NHS and NTHS, which I was never able to do. It made me feel shitty to be excluded and despite making good grades, that didn #8217;t seem like enough, since everyone else just seemed automatically better than me. When I received the email, I was so happy that I finally got some recognition, and that I was finally a part of something. I was excited to show my classmates that I too was smart and could be part of an  #8220;honor society, #8221; so I bought everything I could. When i found out it was a scam, my heart literally broke, and I felt stupid because I #8217;ve been wearing that stuff around school. I ended up getting into SHH eventually, so I was overreacting over nothing. It #8217;s my fault for being an idiot/blowing all that money and wanting to fit in when at the end of high school, it doesn #8217;t even matter. So I agree that it is cruel to mess with our desire to feel special, because 10th grade me felt really betrayed when I found out that I wasn #8217;t really cool.</TEXT>

I figure it #8217;s the same for other people as well.

      <TEXT>You can still use their resources, but in my experience it #8217;s better to contact a youth shelter that you #8217;d like to possibly stay at. It all depends on what your goals in life are. A youth shelter can help you get back on your feet with their case management, get you a job, and get you back into school. If you don #8217;t want to stay at a shelter, there is Job Corps, which gives you food, housing, and education for free. If school is not your thing and you #8217;d rather just get a job and you have some cash/a car, coolworks is a great place to start. There #8217;s also 211, which you can contact to get referred to special services such as housing, food, etc.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In shelters, yes they will teach you that stuff, but more often than not you *have* to choose a youth shelter, because they specialize in working with young people, and teaching them this stuff is part of getting them back on their feet. Adult shelters are more or less a space for people to just exist temporarily, and although they can be helpful as well, not as much as youth shelters. You just have to have a good attitude about things and choose the best program. Job Corps can help you with that, but it #8217;s more focused towards job training. 211 doesn #8217;t help with that directly, but it will direct you to a place that can assist you. If you don #8217;t want to share your location, there #8217;s a site called Aunt Bertha where you can type in your information and it will direct you to a place near you: https://www.auntbertha.com</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Depending on the shelter you choose, yes. Most youth shelters are ages 18-24. Do you have a ride or money for transportation? From my research, most of the shelters are in Worcester, but if you can take the 30 minute ride there or are willing to travel on foot for 2 hours, you can reach some. I suggest you google  #8220;youth shelters in Shrewbery, Massachusetts, #8221; then start calling around at those organizations for help. Also, as a last resort, there are some churches that may be able to help you. I don #8217;t know if they are open yet up there, but if there are, I suggest getting in contact with one as well.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>New York has better resources because their homeless population is so high, which is why it may be a good reason to move there. But because the homeless population is so high, there may be limited space at the shelters, which is why it may be good to stay in Massachusetts. It all depends on what you want in life. I haven #8217;t run away yet, but I #8217;m planning to very soon. I know what I want to do in life and what it takes to get there, I just knew I coukdnt do it from home so I #8217;m going elsewhere. You have to figure out what you want in life before you leave, or you #8217;ll end up in a horrible place. Whether it #8217;s an education, a job, etc. From there you can decide what you want to get out from a shelter.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They are homeless shelters, but youth shelters are just homeless shelters for homeless young people. Some places allow you to stay up to 3-6 months, then send you to a transitional living program, where you live for around 18 months. A year and a half is enough time for them to help you get a job/settled back into society. They are completely free, no debt no nothin. You can #8217;t stay there forever but they #8217;ll help you to get back on your feet. United Way/211 New York: https://211nys.org/find-services Here you can search by the city you want to go to.

Do you have any trustworthy people in your life that you could possibly go to? Running is the absolute best idea here, but I don #8217;t want you to end up getting caught and hurt even more.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yea, they provide food for you. They #8217;ll also possibly help you get on a program like food stamps, which will give you food for cheap. You potentially could stay forever by jumping from shelter to shelter, but in order to stay long term many shelters require you to put some type of effort into getting yourself together. For example, the shelter I #8217;m looking into requires you to work 35 hours (I think a week?) towards education/job/personal development if you want to stay in their 18 month program. If they see that someone isn #8217;t making an effort, they will probably kick them out.</TEXT>

I #8217;m not there now, and I #8217;m not sure if you #8217;re still there, but if you need anyone to vent to or just chat with I #8217;m here, as I know how much of a pain living there could be. I love that island to death but the Caribbean is just not the place to be when it comes to being lgbt, just not yet at least. There #8217;s little to no resources down there at all regarding mental health and homelessness as the whole place is super underdeveloped, and I know how much it sucks. I hope you are doing well, and I wish you the best of luck.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Extremely valid question, no hard feelings. I looking into SS a while ago without actually calling, and I found a place called  #8220;Lifestyles #8221; (i think?), but when I checked eligibility they required things like a certificate of homelessness and other documents I don #8217;t have. Also, it sounds like an excuse I know, but I #8217;ve been so sheltered my entire life that I have absolutely no idea how things work. I wanted to go to a youth shelter (18-25) because I feel like it #8217;d be easier on me than getting all of these forms and adult stuff thrown at me. I know I have to grow up at some point, but mentally I feel like a youth program would be of better assistance. I already got in contact with this shelter a while ago, and although they don #8217;t provide transportation, we #8217;ve already started the conversation on what they can do to help me get back on my feet, and I trust them a lot. I know it #8217;s extreme, but I just can #8217;t stay here anymore. Getting in the car with a stranger is the last thing I want to do, so I #8217;m still trying to squeeze as much as I can out of the people around me. This is just a last resort option. I do appreciate you looking out for me, though. I thought this over a lot, and at this point it #8217;s just fingers crossed for me haha.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>- **Missing 9:** Probably the most underrated drama and one of my personal favorites because it somehow pairs disaster/criminal justice/romance all into one, and I really love planes) - **I am Not A Robot:** I went on an AI/Sci-Fi binge and watched this, He is Psychometric, and Are You Human Too back to back. Really cute drama and also very funny. - **Call Me Mother:** This one was *extremely* good, and something that I personally resonated with and wanted to happen to me as a child. Huge trigger warning for this one, but overall an outstanding drama. - **Beautiful World:** Binged this in two days and it was one of the best dramas I #8217;ve ever seen in my life. Everything about it was good, and it was just all around a beautiful drama. - **Witch #8217;s Love:** This one was hilarious, lighthearted and romantic. I loved every minute of it, but barely anyone who I talk to has seen it. It was extremely cute and I would highly recommend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>https://www.jobcorps.gov Is the official Job Corps website. What happens is, you apply on their website, and they #8217;ll get back to you with a placement. The placement is determined by what program you want to join, and it may or may not be in your state. For example, if you choose culinary and they don #8217;t have a culinary program in your state, they may send you to New York or Ohio or somewhere that they have culinary. The program is government sponsored and is 100% free. You get free food, a free room to sleep in (but you have a roommate), and a free education. After the program they help you with job placement in the program that you chose. The age range I believe is ages 16-24, but for some individuals, such as people with disabilities, they *might* allow you in if you #8217;re 25. The cut off is almost always 24 though.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As for your edit,, since you don't know what you want to do yet, do you have an image in mind of what you want your future to look like? College is not for everyone and that is completely okay that you don't want to go. Job Corps is a good program that gives you an education and job training. The shelter can help you find an education program, but they won't give it for you for free, just assist you. If you have a very specific trade in mind that you want to complete and eventually get a job in, whether that be Certified Nursing Assistant, Culinary Arts, Welding, Automotive, etc., Job Corps is the better option for you. If you have no idea what you want to do and just want to get back on your feet, find a job, and figure things out along the way, the shelter is a better option for you.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>**Tl;dr - Does anyone else #8217;s parents get extremely upset when you express appreciation to someone who gives you a gift or something, but never do anything kind for you themselves?** So, I turned 18 a few months ago and my teachers asked what I was doing to celebrate the big day. I told them  #8220;nothing #8221; and they were genuinely shocked. I simply told them that we don #8217;t celebrate birthdays rather than tell them  #8220;my parents don #8217;t necessarily want anything to do with me so of course they #8217;re not going to celebrate the day I was born. #8221; I have one teacher who is like a mother to me, and I love her dearly. She heard my parents weren #8217;t doing anything for my birthday and went out and bought me cupcakes. I almost broke down crying because no one had ever gotten me something like that before. My friend gave me a pop figure for my birthday, and it was the same. Come my graduation week, my parents were angry for some reason. I have no idea why they always get mad, but they had an attitude when my sister graduated high school AND her college program, and made her cry because their behavior sucked. A neighbor of mine who I also love dearly gave me a gift bag and a congratulations card, unlike my parents who were still being immature. They #8217;re response is always,  #8220;if you like ___ so much, go live with them and get out of my house. #8221;  #8220;You always think everyone else is better than us. #8221;  #8220;We don #8217;t owe you anything, we give you food and a place to stay. #8221; Anyone else #8217;s parents do this?</TEXT>

Now come high school, I get  #8220;attracted #8221; to certain people, but not in a way that #8217;s like  #8220;I want to be with you romantically or intimately, #8221; but more like, I just really like your face and enjoying existing in a way that I get to see you every day. #8221; I know I #8217;m bi in some way, I just don #8217;t know whether or not it is romantic. I know I #8217;m not aro, idk I #8217;m just confused is all. I was just wondering if aesthetic attraction is a thing, and can it be intertwined with romantic attraction, or is it a separate category of its own? Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>International student looking to study in Malaysia. How often is English used as a medium for Humanities degrees (USM, UM, UPM)?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-06-19 18:17:48</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I am a student who #8216;s desperately trying to leave their country, and I #8217;ve been looking into getting an education abroad as a start. I #8217;m not planning to go right away, but I #8217;m still planning ahead just in case. I #8217;ve been looking at different countries to get my bachelors in, and I read that contrary to popular belief, many Malaysian universities actually provide students with well recognized and great educations, so I #8217;ve been looking into doing my undergraduate at one of the following universities: - University of Malaya - Universiti Putra Malaysia - Universiti Sains Malaysia And my degree path would be one of the following: - Education Teaching of English as a Second Language - Early Childhood Education - Geography - History I have read the international student guides on each website, and many of them say things like - *The language of instruction for most of the undergraduate courses is Bahasa Malaysia (Malay Language), but special tutorials in English are arranged specially for international students.* [Link](https://www.admissions.usm.my/index.php/undergraduate-international-student/fees/45-admission/undergraduate/international-student/69-fast-facts) - *The medium of instruction is in English (for science based courses). Social Science based programmes however may use the Malay Language as a medium of instruction.* [Link](https://e-application.um.edu.my/index.php/createaccount/program_structure) - *MOSTof the courses otlered at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) will be taught in English beginning 2005, in line with the Government's policy to teach mathematics and science based courses in the lan- guage. Bahasa Malaysia will remain as the medium of instruction for all other courses and correspondence with students," he said, clarifying reports in the local press that UPM was switching to English as the main medium of instruction. #8221;* [Link](http://psasir.upm.edu.my/id/eprint/2111/1/0245.pdf) I am 100% willing to start learning the Malaysian language if needed, as I love language learning, but I #8217;m afraid that there are not many resources here in the US, and I don #8217;t know if 2 years will be enough to learn at a university level. I know that English is used for maths and science based courses, but how about for humanities and arts courses? What level of English is usually used, and how much Malaysian will I need to know before attending one of these universities? Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for the explanation! I tend to desire to have company and hugs, but not much more than that, so I guess that could count as aromantic? Like, I would look for a relationship, but by relationship I mean existing together and enjoying each other #8217;s company rather than doing all that couple stuff if that makes sense. I #8217;ll definitely read more about aromanticism and see what the spectrum looks like. I appreciate the help!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Parents keep moving states to avoid child abuse investigations. Anything I can do to turn my mother in?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-06-19 22:02:35</DATE>
      <TEXT>Location: Maryland/Virginia. I #8217;d first like to admit that I don #8217;t know much about the situation, but I know enough to ask anyone here who does know. A few years ago, my parents had CPS contacted against them by our school under suspected child abuse. Mind you, CPS here never really does their job, so they never talked to us or investigated anything properly, just saw that we had food on the table and a roof over our heads and decided abuse wasn #8217;t happening in the house. After that incident, my parents up and left the state, as people were now watching them and suspecting them of being abusive (which they were). We move to a new state and the same thing recently happened. CPS called by school, doesn #8217;t do shit, school is watching parents because of suspected abuse, parents want to get up and leave. The thing here is that my mother sent her other two kids (adopted kids, not my real siblings) overseas once, and they claimed they were being abused while over there (which wasn #8217;t true, but still). The school told my mother and complained, and she stated that they can #8217;t tell her what to do with her kids. Fair enough. A few years later my mother sends them back over there, and the school is questioning where the kids went. Mind you, abuse *has* been going on in our house for years, but we have absolutely no evidence for it. My parents are now trying to move to avoid getting the police called on them by the school. I overheard my mother saying that the school here in America has been contacting the ministry of education in our country asking about the kids and where they are, and my mother, who has connections over there, is trying to get her people to shut them up so they don #8217;t say anything to the school system here in America. I don #8217;t know what the school here is able to do without specific evidence of abuse, as we have no physical evidence besides our own stories, and my mother has tried manipulating us saying that we need to take her side, as well as have her friends who know nothing about what #8217;s going on in our home vouching for her as a  #8220;good person. #8221; However, I do have a hidden recording of her on the phone with one of her people overseas telling him about the school investigating her and her confessing that she has been moving to avoid it. Sorry for the long post, but is there anything that I can do to make my parents pay for being abusive without having physical evidence? I thought about contacting the schools here and telling them the situation, giving them the recording and having them figure out what to do from there, but I don #8217;t want to be caught up in any legal issues, or have to come back and face my parents in the end. Should I let it go, or is there a way I can take them down? Tl;dr - School suspects mother of being abusive which she is and tries to investigate her but she keeps dodging them by moving. No evidence, but a hidden voice confession, and I want to turn her in. What can I do?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The abuse was usually physical, but our mother would make us stay home from school and call us in as sick whenever we had a bruise or swollen lip. After that, she switched to other forms of abuse such as not feeding us, making her youngest sleep outside in the garage, and not taking us to the doctor or giving us medical care. We #8217;d usually tell someone at school each time, which would lead to the phone calls home.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hey, don #8217;t feel bad! You #8217;ve come to the right place my friend. I #8217;m a baby ace too, so I #8217;m not the most qualified to answer this question, but here it goes. As cliche as it sounds, you know that awkward time in about 5th grade when girls start looking at boys differently and vice versa? That happened a *lot* around me, probably because I went to a strict school that didn #8217;t even allow the genders to communicate. It was horny overload, but for some reason I wasn #8217;t feeling what the other kids were. As I got older, other girls my age were thinking about inviting boys over to sleepovers for sex and all that junk while I was just...meh. *Now, not all asexuals are sex repulsed, and not all asexuals strictly refrain from sex, just to clarify. That just happens to be how I am. I got into my first relationship in 8th grade, and as much as I truly loved that girl, she was into kissing and touching and all that stuff, and I just wasn #8217;t feeling it. Not because I didn #8217;t like her, but because the notion just didn #8217;t feel right to me. I didn #8217;t feel attracted to her or anyone in a sexual way, and I valued things like cuddling and existing with a person more than sex. As time went on and girls in my high school were bragging about how many times they  #8220;did it, #8221; I didn #8217;t really feel pressured or a desire to have my way with someone in that manner. I #8217;m a slut for romance, hugs, smiles, and existing alongside an amazing individual who makes me happy, but sexy time is the least of my desires. It took me an *extremely* long time to figure it out. I thought it had something to do with my childhood or the fact that I was picky, but in reality I was just ace apparently! Asexuality is one of the least talked about orientations, so it #8217;s a-okay to be confused. Heck, I #8217;m still confused. We #8217;re here to help you and be there for you if you have any questions on the topic. Hope this helped in some way!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They do! I was afraid however that what #8217;s been happening to me isn #8217;t really domestic violence and that I #8217;d get pushed away, so I didn #8217;t contact them. Most of the issue is verbal and emotional abuse, neglect of mental health , and other semi-narcissistic behaviors (like telling me to kms, etc.) Also, this may sound a bit silly, but I #8217;ve been sheltered my entire life and don #8217;t really know how to *adult* even though I #8217;m 18, if that makes sense. I feel like throwing myself into an adult shelter like that would be overwhelming, especially since I #8217;m prone to shutting down easily, and that a youth shelter (18-24) would be a better fit for me as I could be introduced to things in a slower and more  #8220;child friendly (?) way. I #8217;m 100% open to contact the DV shelter if it comes to that though!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m planning to travel in the next few days, and this is my first time going alone. Since I #8217;m a kid (not really but mentally) and visibly vulnerable looking, I was extremely scared. The past week, I #8217;ve been trying to manifest safety for my trip, and peace of mind. I #8217;ve calmed myself down, and planned my route accordingly, etc. I was feeling better and more confident. Today, while we were on the way to the store, I see a giant charter bus. I live in the middle of nowhere, and that definitely isn #8217;t something you see everyday. Ever. While doing my research, I found a bus route, but I didn #8217;t know what the actual bus looked like, or what they were called. I keep my eye on it because I #8217;m intrigued, and while the line we #8217;re in proceeds, I catch a glimpse of the front of the bus. Right there, was the exact route number that I am planning to take. That was possibly the bus that *I* would be going on. I couldn #8217;t help but smile like an idiot, as a feeling of safety and satisfaction washed over me. I don #8217;t know if it was a sign, but it sure did make me feel good, and hopefully this good feeling will ensure me good travels. :)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m not black, but I #8217;m from a country in the West Indies where the majority of people are Afro-Caribbean. I can confirm this. Caribbean people don #8217;t fuck with black Americans, especially those who like to fake being part Caribbean. I have no idea how, but those people are able to tell if you #8217;re African American as soon as you step foot off of the plane. If they don #8217;t hear an accent on you, don #8217;t get near them. If you try to fit in with them, they #8217;ll tell you to stop trying to connect with roots that you were never exposed to. They also hate Nigerians over there but that #8217;s a whole different ballgame.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>First of all, I wanted to say thanks for posting this. I tried to talk about it on subs like r/unpopularopinion yesterday and even this sub, yet it kept removing my post. I really hate how it is socially acceptable to treat every single white person in existence like this just because of the supposed assholes we see in the media. If the statement becomes racist when you replace white with black or any other minority, then it #8217;s racist period. And the fact that they basically said,  #8220;you were racist, and were going to reward you for it #8221; is alarming. I #8217;m not white and even I #8217;m pissed off about things like this, because it shouldn #8217;t be acceptable to treat another human being in this manner *ever.* If this wasn #8217;t racist then I #8217;d assume they #8217;re giving all the white man who were fired recently for saying things on Facebook about minorities their jobs back, right?</TEXT>

      <TITLE>How to survive the night sleeping outside (+ best place to sleep)</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-06-27 13:50:49</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all. I am on my way to a homeless shelter, and but I have to leave the night before in order to catch the bus, because they come so early in the morning. Because of this, I #8217;m am a little scared of sleeping outside where my belongings or me myself could get snatched. My town is relatively safe aside from a few druggies who will usually just leave you alone. The only weapon I have on me is a giant flashlight, and my hard case  #8220;bag #8221; that I could swing at someone. I debated pulling an all night but knowing me I wouldn #8217;t be able to without my phone. Are there any secret tips to staying safe through the night? Also, I #8217;ve been planning my route very specifically and wonder where the best place to sleep is. So far I #8217;ve thought about: - Sleeping by the bus stop, or in the woods by the bus stop (don #8217;t know if the cops will stop me if they see me by the bus stop), - Sleeping in the woods behind the gas station across from the bus stop for bathroom access (although a gas station doesn #8217;t sound the safest), - Sleeping in my neighborhood somewhere hidden since I know the area and it #8217;s safer, then walk the 2 hours to the bus stop at sunrise (around 4:45) in time to catch the last bus, - Sleeping on the sidewalk next to a church that is 17 minutes away from the bus stop, then walking there in the morning (don #8217;t know if criminals lurk around churches but I #8217;m still skeptical, even though this seems like the safest option). Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oh gosh yes. Anyone who says anything that is against their beliefs are automatically banned. And they don #8217;t allow you to join period if you are a man determined by your profile I guess. Just look at the rules for r/PinkPillFeminism. They refer to men as  #8220;XY #8221; and say crap like  #8220;men don #8217;t face issues like women do. #8221; I saw a comment on TheFairerSex [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/f10qkt/found_this_on_rthefairersex_but_yet_we_get/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf) talking about how male suicide rates  #8220;aren #8217;t high enough #8221; and how they want men to perish. At that point, it #8217;s not even feminism, it #8217;s mental illness. The fact that subs based around male issues are quarantined yet subs about hating an entire group of people based on something that they didn #8217;t choose to be is allowed is ridiculous.

      <DATE>2020-06-27 14:41:43</DATE>
      <TEXT>So we #8217;re moving soon, and I #8217;ve been planning to run away to a shelter before we move, since the state I #8217;m in is closer to where the shelter is located than the one I #8217;m moving to. I planned on walking out tomorrow afternoon, but randomly, my nmom started being nice to me. We went on a walk together, she started giving me snacks after weeks of not feeding us, she #8217;s been randomly complimenting me and making jokes with me when just the other day she said she can #8217;t put up with my sister and I and we need to get out of her house. Now, she knows absolutely nothing about my plan to leave, so it can #8217;t be because she wants me to stay. I can #8217;t help but feel bad that I #8217;m planning to run away. I can #8217;t help but think,  #8220;maybe I should just be obedient and stay with them, do what they want, and be their perfect kid. What could go wrong? #8221; I #8217;m so easily manipulated that I don #8217;t know whether to believe her or just walk out. I feel bad that after her being so nice I still betray her like that. I don #8217;t know what to do, and I don #8217;t know how to shake this feeling. Anyone else ever feel like this?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I did. I #8217;m not going to college, but I might make some new friends at work. It #8217;s not really about friendship since I was never friends with them, it #8217;s kinda just me looking at their lives and wishing I had it, but in a more intense way. Like, I can look at a celebrity and not care that they have it better than me, but because I know these people personally and have interacted with them personally, there #8217;s a weird connection there I can #8217;t get rid of iykwim.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-06-27 20:56:06</DATE>
      <TEXT>So, I applied to several colleges (regular decision), all of which I got accepted to, but I #8217;m not going to college for the next 2 years. My parents said that after the despiser deadline passes and they get nothing from you, they #8217;ll just take your name off the list, but I keep getting mail and emails from all of those colleges saying stuff like  #8220;it #8217;s not too late to deposit. #8221; Was I supposed to manually go in there and decline acceptance, because most of those schools I didn #8217;t even get a portal login for. I know this is a dumb question but I didn #8217;t want to just forget about it and then owe an arm and a leg later because they charged me or something. Idk how it works. TIA!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Hello mom, I am running away tomorrow, and never looking back.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-06-27 21:16:49</DATE>
      <TEXT> #9888; #65039; **TRIGGER WARNING**  #9888; #65039; To my bio mom: I #8217;m not good at writing, so I will say this. The past few days, you #8217;ve been super nice to me, like you know I #8217;m going away. I feel extremely guilty leaving you, but this temporary kindness will not make up for the years and years of abuse you put me through. You sexually assaulted me when I was little. You made fun of my scars and told me to kill myself. You compared me to everyone else without realizing that their families were normal and loving. You didn #8217;t listen to the doctor when they told you I was autistic because you didn #8217;t want a  #8220;r*tarded child. #8221; You pushed me so hard in school only to criticize me for not doing as good as the other kids in my class. You neglected my mental health and forced me to act cheerful all the time when on the inside I was dying. You didn #8217;t know that you constantly fat shaming me led me to develop two eating disorders at age 11. You don #8217;t know that I nearly killed someone for taking you away from me at age 10. You don #8217;t know that I #8217;ve been trying to kill myself since age 9 and you don #8217;t know that last December I almost succeeded. You weren #8217;t proud of me when I graduated and you didn #8217;t let me achieve my dream of going to college. You don #8217;t know that despite the days without food and the bruises and the nosebleeds and the days I was forced to sleep on the cold basement floor or the days that I nearly lost my eyesight because you punched me so hard or the mental trauma or the depression and anxiety that you #8217;ve caused me I still loved you. You don #8217;t know how much I wanted to be the perfect daughter and to make you love me. You don #8217;t know how empty I feel now as an adult that I never got that motherly love. So tomorrow, I #8217;m walking out. You told me to leave, and I will. I will walk for hours and never look back. My throat and chest may tighten and my legs may be too shaky to get me to where I #8217;m going but at least I know that I will be safe. I will walk into the arms of someone more loving than you have ever been to me, and that love won #8217;t be fake or temporary. It will be 100% permanent, and 100% genuine. I wish you loved me mom. Maybe we can work it out one day, but until then, I have to leave you behind.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m really sorry to hear about your experience. Moment of 18 is school based, but not much to do with aspects of school aside from highlighting competition for grades among the leads. It #8217;s mostly centered around the love triangle. One of the male leads mess with the other, but it is not severe bullying. If you could tolerate Extracurricular (which was amazing btw), Moment of 18 is much more lighthearted, so I think it #8217;ll be okay.</TEXT>

If I as a female get upset seeing that stuff I can only imagine how bad it makes men feel, especially since male issues are largely ignored in society.

      <TEXT>Online bullying? Male issues are much more than that. It #8217;s not getting custody of your child despite being a good father because a mother is always believed. It #8217;s having to hide your emotions because both men and women alike call you weak or downplay any feelings you may have. It #8217;s committing the same crime as a woman yet getting more time just because you #8217;re seen as a bigger threat. It #8217;s having to stay silent about being raped because society either believes that men can #8217;t be raped or that they enjoyed it. Men #8217;s rights is *so* much more than that. And if all you see men as are space wasters that sit around watching porn and scratching their balls then you #8217;re a huge part of the problem. I #8217;ll feel sympathy for female issues when false rape claims stop ruining lives and men aren #8217;t pushed away by society for coming forward about traumatic issues. You honestly can #8217;t expect men to stand with us when you #8217;re putting them down like that. Come on, grow up.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Generalizing the entirety of the male population like that is quite brutal, y #8217;know. Especially since whenever a generalization is made about females, we automatically pull the misogyny card. To add, many, *many* females have raped and either gotten away with it, or had it downplayed to  #8220;forced to have sex. #8221; Trust me, I #8217;d know. And to be honest, when you say  #8220;legal equality, #8221; it sounds more like  #8220;we want to be favored over men in legal aspects, but we don #8217;t want to have to go through what men go through when it comes to social issues or harsh treatment, nor do we want to have responsibilities like men.

      <TEXT>LThis was under the ban wave post on the Reclassified sub. I would link it but it would notify the subreddit. Here are screenshots from the argument: https://imgur.com/a/8Lx3lLu And of course, she frequents subs like FDS and Gender Critical: https://imgur.com/a/5zeUSqI I commented that hopefully PinkPill and TFS get banned, and she insists that neither are hate subs. As I continue to try and reassure her that men do face issues in society and that we as women shouldn #8217;t think that they owe us something, she goes on to ADMIT that feminism isn #8217;t about equality, and that because men are more violent and apparently  #8220;hate women, #8221; there #8217;s no point in standing up for them or caring about their rights. What an ass. Just wanted to share that as a long term member of this sub and a semi-frequent poster, some of us really do care about you guys, and don #8217;t see men as second class citizens who we can treat like shit yet expect to do everything for us. I #8217;ll continue to fight for men #8217;s rights because I know that what I #8217;m fighting for isn #8217;t one sided and hateful like radical feminism. It #8217;s fighting for basic human rights and visibility for those who aren #8217;t seen. Stay strong, guys.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I think a lot of the people who think it #8217;s selfish don #8217;t actually know what suicidal people go through when they try to get help. I #8217;ve heard the horror stories of inpatient mental health treatment. I #8217;ve heard how poorly some people get treated while locked away and getting therapy. No, those aren #8217;t bad options by any means for people who are struggling, but it could be way better. Those people will get over the sadness eventually and be able to move on and enjoy their lives. They will eventually forget their pain. But my pain seems to be everlasting, and it #8217;s not something that you can just do away with, especially with how horrendously the world is going today. If you think that suicidal people should suffer internally for years just so you won #8217;t feel bad for a few days you #8217;re crazy.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve tried everything to better my relationship with them, but nothing is working. Nothing will ever work and I #8217;m done. I planned to run away but had no way of getting to where I was going. My nmom found out and is now getting more and more verbally abusive, telling me I should kill myself and pulling the  #8220;after all we #8217;ve done for you #8221; card over and over again.

They want to keep me locked up in this house with them and away from the outside world forever, but I won #8217;t let that happen. I #8217;ll kill myself before I have to spend even another week with these people. I just can #8217;t anymore. I #8217;m at my wits end and I just want to die.

      <DATE>2020-07-01 22:52:07</DATE>
      <TEXT>[DMV][18] I am leaving home this weekend, and I have 20$ in my name. I attempted to walk out the other day, but realized that fat people weren #8217;t made to walk for 2 hours carrying three bags worth of stuff, and turned around. Some background: Not only are my parents extremely religious/homophobic, but they #8217;re self hating and racist towards their own people, and they #8217;re also currently involved in some legal bs regarding child abuse charges (not regarding me) and other nonsense that I don #8217;t want to get caught up in. In addition to that, they won #8217;t allow me to get a job, and they won #8217;t allow me to register for college. They don #8217;t take me to the doctor and won #8217;t allow me to get mental help, despite my doctor saying that I need to be psychologically evaluated. The abuse as of lately has been verbal/emotional, but a few years ago it was physical and it was bad, and I still have the scars to prove it. CPS never did their job, so now I #8217;m forced to reach out to strangers on the internet in desperation. I know it #8217;s a lot to ask for, but I #8217;m honestly at my wits end. I need mental help that my family wouldn #8217;t give me, and I #8217;m tired of being gaslit and having my mental health destroyed by my a-hole parents. I have so many goals and aspirations in my life, the biggest one being getting a college education, which my parents don #8217;t want me to do for some reason. I don #8217;t want to be held back anymore, and want to take my life into my own hands, and heal from all of this. I just want to get to a safe space before it #8217;s too late yfm? An Uber the entire way to the shelter would be around $57, and one to my local bus stop would be around $20.50 according to the Uber estimate site (I don #8217;t know how accurate it is). Heck, I #8217;d even appreciate it if you could help me get to the boarder and I #8217;ll go from there, which is about a $30 Uber, or if someone is heading my direction (DC), if they #8217;re let me hitch a ride. My mother figured out that I tried to run away last weekend, so I need to work around her schedule and figure out exactly what time on exactly what day this weekend I #8217;ll be able to go through with this. I just hope it all works out in the end and I don #8217;t have to end up turning around again. I #8217;ve also looked into local services to find free transportation, and I #8217;ve called 211 for assistance, as well as the center itself, to no avail, so I thought I #8217;d come here for help. I have a plan already for when I get to the shelter that will hopefully help me to get back on my feet. I don #8217;t have a bank account, but I do know that we can put someone else #8217;s address in and order the Uber for them. I feel bad taking things from others when I know I can #8217;t return anything, but at this point I #8217;m desperate lol. I #8217;m really scared about the situation, and I just want out of here for the sake of my mental health and physical safety. Thank you all so much in advance, and I really and truly appreciate any help I can get.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ohh okay. That #8217;s really kind of you! I #8217;ve been checking around the cheapest route bc I don #8217;t want you to have to spend too much money (and my city has heavy traffic), but it seems like a gift card will be a great option! Since it doesn #8217;t require the use of a bank account. I do have an account that I created already but I #8217;ll probably have to research how to use a gift card since I #8217;m a newbie too. I truly appreciate your help :)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m very picky, but certainly not an expert at choosing. I find mine on MDL or Viki, and the picture has to catch my eye first, then the plot and the rating. I #8217;m not a fan of romance but if it is implemented into a storyline with crime/thriller/scary aspects (which is my favorite genre), then I #8217;ll watch it. I stay if there #8217;s a lot of action in the first few episodes, or if there #8217;s a some type of comedy that gets me attached to the new characters. Also, if something happens and I #8217;m determined to keep watching to figure it all out. **Spoiler Alert** For example in Go Go Waikiki, the characters were adorable and fun, and the mystery of where the baby came from kept me watching until the end.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yes, also this. If you #8217;re under the age of 18, the police can return you home if your parents report you missing, or if they see you walking alone. I personally was just walking from my house to the bus stop in front of my neighborhood, but even then there were lots of people outside. If you #8217;re going at night though, do everything you can to ensure your safety, and I do mean *everything.* Night is when the creepers crawl, especially if you #8217;re visibly underage.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t know about other kids my age, but I wish they at least made us take a financial literacy course every year starting from, say, middle school like they do semi-useless subjects like language arts.

      <DATE>2020-07-03 18:29:07</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I was blessed enough to have a VanGo/Shuttle Bus stop right outside of my neighborhood, and I #8217;ve been looking to get from there to my local MTA Commuterbus stop a few miles away. The thing is, 1) I have no idea how to read/interpret the schedule for my stop, and 2) according to the website, the shuttle stops at my location every 60 minutes, yet I was out there for nearly two hours the other day and didn #8217;t see one at all. If I'm understanding this correctly, the bus begins at a certain point on the route and travels the entire route stopping at each stop, then turns around and stops at the same stops just in case someone who got on later gets off at one of the previous ones? (If that makes sense.) I'm planning to leave tonight since the bus doesn't run on holidays. I downloaded the app to highlight my route and can see the bus on the app, so I assume it's accurate enough. I guess my question is, how reliable are the small shuttle buses, how do I take the shuttle, and how do I interpret the schedule? Is the "every 60 minutes" time mark accurate? If it helps, here is a link to the schedule I'm trying to figure out: https://www.charlescountymd.gov/home/showdocument?id=3529 Sorry if this is an ignorant question but I appreciate any help in advance!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>This year marks 10 years since my big sister died in the military.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-03 21:21:49</DATE>
      <TEXT>It feels so strange to me. I remember when I was 8 years old, I woke up one morning to some intimidating dudes standing in my foyer, my nmom and my other sister still in their pajamas, crying on the stairs. My dad was at work, and had no idea what was going on. I was never allowed to get close to her, but the moments we shared were unbelievably special. She taught me how to draw and got me into my weird Tinkerbell obsession. She was one of the coolest goths I #8217;ve ever met and as cliche as it sounds, every single room she walked into was illuminated with positivity. She was our hero, and everyone who knew her was in love with her sweet soul. My mother doesn #8217;t like us talking about her though, because she died a free woman. Our mother is the type that wants complete control over everything and everyone, so when my sister decided to leave her grasp in rebellion of the years of mental abuse she put her through, she cursed her, saying that if she joins the military the only way she #8217;ll return to this country is  #8220;in a pine box #8221; (casket). To this day, she still yells at us if we bring up her name because she was  #8220;disobedient #8221; and  #8220;ungrateful, #8221; and says that if she were still alive, she wouldn #8217;t be minding us (like all of my other siblings who had run away from home). She hasn #8217;t kept that poor girl #8217;s name out of her mouth since, and continues to belittle her and talk bad about her even long after she #8217;s dead. And it feels horrible listening to all of it, because I know how amazing of a girl she was, and the impact she had in those around her. Don #8217;t really know where I was going with this, but July 4th is coming up, and she loved the hotdogs, fresh air, lawn chairs, and fireworks. I wish she was here to see me graduate, and help me grow, but she #8217;s doing all of that from above. Happy 10 year, love. Feel free to leave any stories about military family members, gone or alive, that make you happy. I love a good memory, and am in the mood to smile today.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>**TW: Suicide** A friend of mine posted his suicide note on Discord one night, and I made it my priority to face chat him, and stay up all night to make sure he didn #8217;t hurt himself. I loved that kid more than myself, and knowing what he #8217;s been though, I wanted nothing else but for him to be safe and stable. I suggested that he color or listen to his favorite music, which we did, until he eventually had a few drinks and went to sleep. He asked me to tell him a story and I did, and the next day I checked in several times to make sure he was okay. I don #8217;t know what got into me that day, but some kind of instinct washed over me that told me I had to protect that kid. I had to protect him and care for him like no one ever did for me, and that is exactly what I did. Whether it be physical, mental, or emotional, human beings long for protection, or for someone who cares enough to keep them safe from the world around them and from themselves. It #8217;s something we don #8217;t necessarily think about often, yet we can feel that shift in energy that tells us that we need it. It #8217;s a natural instinct to protect oneself, but sometimes, you become stronger and more confident when you know someone is also protecting you. Protection.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>- I could not for the life of me get into Kill Me Heal Me, though everyone I talk to says it #8217;s amazing and a great watch. - I liked Oh My Venus but never finished it, will probably pick it up again later. - I loved the trailer for Prison Playbook but the first few episodes were kinda slow and I couldn #8217;t finish it. I #8217;ll definitely try again in the future but I just couldn #8217;t do it when I started. - Couldn #8217;t finish Suspicious Partner, - Sky Castle seemed to be mostly dialogue and dragged on, so I couldn #8217;t finish that one either. - Couldn #8217;t get into CLOY either, although maybe in the future? Everyone makes it sound good but I was never hooked.</TEXT>

      <TEXT> gt;Instead i'm in a paradoxal state where I don't want to kms but i also don't wanna live. I know exactly how that feels. Like, you have goals and aspirations and things you want to do, but the way society runs and the stuff that you have to do to get there or fulfill those desires is daunting. Then you have to deal with all that extra stuff, like human relationships and mental health and it all goes to ruins. Life is pure torture for those who are dealt bad cards.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for this. Truly. I wanted to ask, does defaulting have an impact on your passport at all? I planned to move somewhere like Panama where they allow you to keep your US passport while obtaining a Panamanian one, although I #8217;m not set on it. I plan to pursue a career that requires you to be a citizen of an English speaking country like the US, and I don #8217;t want my defaulting to negatively impact me in the sense that it takes away my citizenship label or something like that, if this makes sense. Any Advice?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I made a post last week about running away, but it didn #8217;t go as planned. The journey was too long, and my mother ended up finding out about it. I broke down about my mental health issues and instead of comforting me she laughed at me and ridiculed me. Told me that #8217;s what I get for trying to leave her, and that home is the only safe place. It was all  #8220;mother knows best, #8221; like when Rapunzel was caught trying to leave the tower. Mama I #8217;m so close. I #8217;m so very close to getting out of here. I just need a miracle. A miracle from the universe to help me get out of here. I know it will happen, I know it will and I can feel it. But waiting here for the moment to come is agonizing and my heart hurts so much. I need encouragement and strength but everywhere I turn I get let down. I feel so incredibly alone and just want to know that someone is by my side during this. Please keep me in your thoughts. It #8217;s getting tough out here.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>[Help] My dog doesn #8217;t like his food, and my parents won #8217;t change to something he likes. How can I make him eat?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-07 14:23:55</DATE>
      <TEXT>I have a tiny Brussels Griffin/Chihuahua mix, and he #8217;s about 7 pounds, just turned 3 years old. My parents keep changing up his food, and I told them that they can #8217;t do that with animals. They insist that since they bought it he has to eat it, and refuse to buy anything else. My dog has not eaten in 2 days because my parents say that I #8217;m not allowed to feed him anything else, and that if he doesn #8217;t want the food he will just have to starve. I #8217;ve tried putting treats deep into the food, but he #8217;d just dig them out and eat them. I #8217;ve tried spoon feeding it to him, but he #8217;ll just take it off the spoon and put it on the floor. I #8217;ve snuck him dry food several times, and he #8217;ll eat that, but my parents took it away saying he needs to eat the wet food first. He #8217;s already very skinny and I worry about him. He just went to the vet the other day so I know it #8217;s not a health issue, because he will eat the other type of food that he does like, and anything else you give him. Is there absolutely anything I can do to make him eat? Here #8217;s a pic. I #8217;m not quite sure if he #8217;s underweight or if he just looks like that: https://imgur.com/a/ESSF4BL</TEXT>

      <TEXT> gt; People who worry that the dog will starve to death don't get healthy dogs. They get dogs who hold out for days without eating, who "demand" to have their food changed every few days. Remember, you're NOT withholding food from the dog. You're offering him food twice a day. You're giving him the same window of opportunity you give him in any training situation. If the dog is healthy and just "fussy", all he has to do is choose to eat. HIS choice. Noted! Thank you so much!</TEXT>

They keep changing his food based on whatever goes on sale/is cheaper, yet there #8217;s only one type of food he actually likes, and I encourage them to just give that one to him. I only gave him treats after reading about the  #8220;baiting #8221; technique here on Reddit, but I honestly don #8217;t know why I didn #8217;t realize how stupid that was of me haha. Since he is a toy and I #8217;ve heard they can go up to 4 days without eating, I #8217;ll monitor him and see how he does without giving in. Thanks again!</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-07-07 15:36:22</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all. I am 18, and I #8217;ve come to a wall in my life where I don #8217;t want to do anything at all, but I know I have to eventually in order to be successful in life. I have no passions that could pay the bills, but I #8217;ve looked into careers such as marketing, photography, and teaching, and they all appeal to me. The thing is, I don #8217;t want to jump into any of these, then realize it #8217;s not for me and get stuck. - With marketing, I wanted to do fashion marketing in Shanghai, Japan, Malaysia, South American, or wherever else, but I realized how far fetched of a dream that was. I took a class this past year of high school where I was the tech kid, who did excel sheets, made lists, planned things, etc., and I absolutely loved it, which is why I considered this job in the first place. With photography, I wanted to be a photoshoot kid, who works with models or products. That #8217;s it. Just thought it #8217;d be a cool job. - With teaching, I wanted to eventually become a college professor or international school teacher abroad, but there seem to be less teaching jobs abroad than marketing jobs. I #8217;m not a fan of kids but I love working with teens and adults, and loved the idea of researching on the side. I also love the school environment. The thing is I #8217;m extremely introverted and have moments of mixed emotions, where one second I feel the happiest I could ever be and the next I #8217;m at my lowest of lows and I don #8217;t want to be messed with. I don #8217;t want to reflect that onto the kids I #8217;m working with, which is why I shied away from teaching in the first place. The only thing that I really want to do in life is move abroad, and I know that I can do so with teaching/marketing easily, and knowing the country #8217;s language is a plus. I also wanted a job where I could be creative, where what I want, and have a bit more freedom than other jobs. I just don #8217;t know which job would be better/more stable for me, and which I should invest my college education and time into. Any advice? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much! I actually did a program called  #8220;educators rising #8221; in secondary school where we went to the elementary school in on our street and taught for a day. I was 100% for teaching for a while, before realizing that putting on a face and having to act happy all the time is getting harder for me to do now as a kid, and I can only imagine how hard it #8217;ll be as an adult. In addition to that, the subject I have a passion for (humanities) seems to be oversaturated, and I suck at STEM lol. Other than that now to think of it, I wouldn #8217;t mind putting up with it for a few years until I secured my dream job at a college. The only reason I chose marketing is because it seemed a bit more behind the scenes, and the idea of a 9-6 office job is appealing to me. If I go into teaching, I #8217;m definitely planning to get my masters! Thanks again!</TEXT>

Black person gets killed by a white person and it #8217;s  #8220;supremacy. #8221; You can talk all the shit you want to about white people and society agrees, yet if a white person says something bad about a poc, it #8217;s racism. I #8217;m not even white and I can see how dangerous generalizations of white people as a whole is getting in today #8217;s society. Don #8217;t be like that, dude. That #8217;s a really shitty way of thinking.</TEXT>

I #8217;d have to walk almost three hours to my local bus stop, so a ride there would be amazing. I saw Uber Eats so idk if Uber is a choice option as well, but it won #8217;t hurt me to ask lol.

Firstly, we shan #8217;t forget the horrors of Tiger parenting and how you are forced to get good grades and get isolated from the rest of the world because  #8220;yOu ShOuLd Be StUdYiNg! #8221; Since I was around 3 years old, since I started talking early, my mother forced me to do school work every weekend and every afternoon. I wanted to go out and do kid things with my fellow classmates but I wasn #8217;t allowed. Yes I was smart, but I was sad because I couldn #8217;t have friends or do what the other kids did. In high school my home life got significantly worse and the only reason I graduated in the glory I did was because I was working my ass off so I could leave my horrible home. In the end they refused to send me off to college and I lost everything I ever worked for. Now I #8217;m depressed, suicidal, and lost in life.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My uncle married a woman from South Korea, and as someone who already comes from a multicultural background, I wanted to learn more about Korea. She introduced me to old Korean music before she left, and one of the CDs she left for me had the song  #8220;Ave Maria #8221; on it, from 200 Pounds Beauty. I was obsessed with the song and looked up the movie, watched the movie and started looking into other Korean films. I later found out that my TV provider had Mnet America (rip), which showed programs like  #8220;Let #8217;s Eat, #8221;  #8220;Flower Boys Next Door, #8221; and the Reply series, and I watched those religiously until I eventually entered the black hole known as the K-drama community.

      <TEXT>This. I was raised in the church and the whole notion of a  #8220;just and good #8221; god is laughable. Even the teachers at my Christian school seemed less than human. A kid #8217;s getting bullied? God will handle it. Kid #8217;s parent die? God #8217;s will. Living in an abusive home (like myself)? God is testing you. They say the reason god allows us to suffer is because he gave us  #8220;free will, #8221; but as a supposedly omnipotent being, that makes him the creator of free will therefore the creator of evil. I don #8217;t know who this  #8220;god #8221; that all Abrahamic religions swear by, but I don #8217;t think he #8217;s as loving and just as people think he is.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve seen more Asians post in support of BLM than in support of their own communities when their people were getting targeted, harassed, and even killed. Then we have people like her who don #8217;t allow Asians to talk about their own issues and silence them, saying shit like  #8220;Asians are privileged. #8221; It #8217;s so fucking infuriating to see your own people care more about others when their community is suffered so badly.</TEXT>

Asian issues don #8217;t get talked about in this country period, and now when Asians are finally trying to wake up the younger generations and fight back against being silent against all the BS that #8217;s been happening to them for years they get shut down by each other. Boba liberals are a huge problem in the Asian community because they try to warp and downplay the issues that Asians actually face, saying that  #8220;x minority has it worse #8221; when that #8217;s not true if you look at world history and modern statistics. Until they use that same energy to fight for their own people, there will be no progression for Asians, unfortunately.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>[IWantOut] 18F US - gt; Eastern Caribbean/Pacific Islands/Anywhere</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-11 20:33:25</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! First I #8217;d like to make a disclaimer, this isn #8217;t for any time soon, but for the future when I finish college. I have this frustrating obsession with planning out my future, and wanted to make sure I was taking the right steps into the direction to eventually move to one of these places. **Background:** I #8217;d also like to say that I #8217;m not looking to leave the US because of politics or any of that jazz because I don #8217;t understand it nor do I care. I loved my time here but I #8217;ve been homesick for the past 5 years, and my trip back home a few months ago really confirmed my decision to move out. I #8217;m also **not looking to move into any of the island territories** as of now, although Saipan is still on my list. Anyways! I grew up in a tiny and lesser known country in the Caribbean and want to go back to somewhere of the like. Unfortunately there are no opportunities in my country, so I can #8217;t return there. (Also idk if it #8217;s important, but I #8217;m not a citizen there, so no CARICOM benefits for me). **Education/Work:** I plan on going into education/teaching and eventually getting my master #8217;s, and I #8217;ve actually found some job openings in the places that I planned to move to (so I know that there are still opportunities there every now and then). **I am *not* looking into TEFL/English teaching** specifically, more international school teaching and eventually college teaching, but I #8217;m not completely opposed to it push come to shove, especially since many of my options may require me to do remote/online work. I #8217;ve also been eyeing the business/marketing career since it looks like something that really interests me, but idk how likely it is for me to pursue that. **What I #8217;m Looking For** I #8217;m not looking for much in a country, just somewhere laid back and safe. Also no giant centipedes. Surprisingly enough on the island where I grew up, aside from some jack wasps and mosquitoes, I #8217;ve never seen any creepy crawlers in my life. No spiders, beg bugs, roaches, nothing. And I #8217;d like to keep it that way lol. I know there is a lot to consider when moving to poorer countries, but I #8217;d say I #8217;m not looking for luxury at all. I #8217;m from a place where we had to use rain water for plumbing/bathing, boil our water before we drank, hand wash clothes and burn wood for coals, and I loved every moment of it. The first world life isn #8217;t exactly for me, and although I don #8217;t want to be a beach bum, I do appreciate a tight knit community of people and simplicity. **Now on to my choices.** I chose **Barbados** and **Grenada** not only because they are two of the more safer Caribbean countries, but because they are right next to my home country. I would consider places like USVI or Jamaica, but those are far too dangerous for me. I also looked into places like the **Cayman Islands** and **Dominica.** I looked into **Micronesia FSM** and the **Marshall Islands** because of a post a saw here a while ago stating that they have some connection with the US and it #8217;s pretty simple to move there for Americans. I looked into **Panama** because my abuelito was Panamanian and it has the perfect blend of both Caribbean and Latino culture, plus it #8217;s one of the few places in Latin America that #8217;s relatively safe and working towards proper development. I #8217;ve also being looking into places like **Taiwan,** because my country #8217;s government is tied with Taiwan and many of our citizens go over there to study/live, but I think mastering the language would be extremely tough, and I #8217;m not sure how plentiful non TEFL jobs are there. I #8217;m still open to it though. Lastly I #8217;ve looked into places like **Penang, Malaysia,** **Muscat, Oman,** or **Da Nang, Vietnam,** but I #8217;m looking for more of an isolated place. **New Zealand** was on the list as well, but aside from the scary visa processes, and expensive COL, it #8217;s a bit too developed for me. If there are any places that fit my criteria, or any visas that I should look into from the countries that I have listed, please let me know! I #8217;m not at all familiar with how visas work, so if any of you have been to any of these places or similar ones, please let me know how it works there. Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

Also, I #8217;m not sure how it works, but I know that it #8217;s a bit easier for Caribbean nationals to get jobs on other islands, than it would, say, an Australian to get a job there.

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for this! I greatly appreciate it. The part about the test you can take is actually really interesting to me! I may have to look into it. As of now, I #8217;m not really worried about COL as I #8217;m not looking for luxury and the COL is low, but I do realize that prices change and it #8217;s an island, meaning most stuff is imported, so I #8217;ll make sure to note that. Push come to show I will be working online for a better income! It sounds like a lovely place with lovely people, so I #8217;ll be sure to do more research. Thanks again!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>- If you haven #8217;t taken the SAT/ACT yet, study your behind off. Many should #8217;ve taken it already, but I know kids who waited til the last minute. - Plan the crap out of college tours and apply to scholarships until your fingers fall off. Money is probably the #1 reason why some kids end up not going to the schools they want. - Idk how internships work, but I #8217;m assuming you should be looking into those. - Lastly and most importantly, learn to take notes and practice productivity like nobody #8217;s business. They say senior year is easy and it #8217;s not, or at least it wasn #8217;t for me. It #8217;s so freaking hard because you get into this habit of getting too comfortable and then get mentally exhausted trying to keep up after falling behind. Especially to those kids who take hella AP classes senior year (ahem). Senioritis is very, ***very*** real and hits you like mf bullet train. There #8217;s no getting around it, so plan ahead because it #8217;s coming. Good luck!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Are you me? Seriously I felt rage reading this because I #8217;m in the exact same situation. First off, I #8217;m really and truly sorry you #8217;re going through this. I know how much it sucks. Can I ask how much the school is expecting you to pay out of pocket? If it #8217;s a large sum 5-10k+ and your parents don #8217;t want to pay it, there #8217;s not really much you can do unfortunately. If it #8217;s a small sum of money, for example my school was 3k a semester, you could ask for a financial aid appeal and explain in detail your situation. It may not always work, but it #8217;s definitely worth a shot. You could also try making a deal of some sort with your parents, and let them know that you will do  #8220;xyz #8221; if they let you go to university. If you don #8217;t mind me asking, what do you mean when you say you #8217;re only doing prerequisites at a four year school? If you are doing prereqs only, your parents may want you to stay and do community college for two years, then go off (which I know is sucky when you have parents like that but still.) Are they at least letting you do the online courses at the university if it doesn #8217;t reopen in the fall? (Sorry I #8217;m really bad at interpreting things so I apologize if you #8217;ve already explained this). Either way, I wish you the best of luck with this. I know how exhausted and draining it can be, but keep your head high and stay strong. You #8217;ll get to where you need to be eventually.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ahh gatcha. In that case, will the $500 cover books/personal stuff? If not and there is a scholarship that will help, apply for it as soon as possible. Chances are your parents aren #8217;t going to help out in that department. I #8217;m a really bad influence and you probably shouldn #8217;t be taking advice from me but here it goes: - I don #8217;t know how close you are with your parents, but if it #8217;s a bond you #8217;re willing to break for your education then I #8217;d say just pack up and go (if the college is going to be in person in the fall). Find a friend or someone who is willing to either house you temporarily or get you to the college immediately when school starts. Be safe and smart about this though, because there #8217;s a lot that could go wrong. - If you love your parents and can tolerate them for a bit longer, do the two years at community college and then switch into your program. Some schools have an option where you can defer your acceptance temporarily and continue your education after a short period, but there may also be some crazy rules you have to follow under their standards (for example, my school said you can only defer up to a year, some schools say you can #8217;t take classes at another college, etc.) I know that telling someone to leave home like that isn #8217;t the greatest advice but it #8217;s what I #8217;m in the process of doing now, and I know some people have to go that route if the want something that their parents aren #8217;t providing. With that said, if you act have a relationship with your parents and depend on them for anything at all, you may have to tough it out and do as they say until you #8217;re old enough to do things on your own. Emancipation is an option at your age too. Will you be living on campus, and does your scholarship cover housing?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry that I don #8217;t have much advice for you, but how adamant are you about studying in the US, and do you plan to work here after graduating university? I ask this because 1) I have a friend who was offered a full scholarship at a Malaysian university (and there are a few top global universities there), and 2) my country gives full ride scholarships to students to study in Taiwan, and Egypt may possibly be on the list of countries that qualify for that program. You could look into those if they interest you. Best of luck!</TEXT>

I suggest you take a look at r/raisedbynarcissists because there are many stories like yours there, and they #8217;ve given some very solid advice on the topic. See if your school has the option to defer, and read the fine print. If your main reason for wanting to go off is to get away from your parents, it #8217;s best to take the time off to get away from them first, then go back to school on your own. If your main reason is because you #8217;d like to take the opportunity and you really really want to attend school, I #8217;d suggest explaining your situation to the university and asking them what options they have for you, or if they can help.</TEXT>

I was lucky enough to have 3 of those classes be stupid easy, so it wasn #8217;t that difficult, but I also took three classes to calm me down so that I #8217;m not always stressed (which I recommend to anyone not worried about whether all of their classes are honors or not). Whatever you do, don #8217;t slack off in the fall, and make sure that you dedicate every single second of your spare time to college apps so you get them done early! You guys have survived this far so I know you #8217;ll do great. I #8217;m sending good vibes to the entire Class of 2021, especially with all the uncertainty going around.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;ve finally been able to secure a way to get to my youth shelter, and will be going today. I will be arriving super late tonight (around 8pm), so I #8217;m a bit nervous, but I #8217;m excited nonetheless. This place isn #8217;t your normal shelter and is more like a mini family than a place where violent kids go to get their lives together, so I #8217;m not worried about safety, but more of the logistical side of things if that makes sense (like how intake works, how case management works, what day to day life is like, etc.) If there is anything I should know that the internet doesn #8217;t tell you, or just any tips in general, please let me know! Thank you all so much for your help here. I really and truly appreciate you all :)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No problem at all! The benefit of online classes is that you can work at your own pace and google anything you #8217;re having problems with right then and there, so I #8217;d definitely make that decision as well. The AP review videos may still be on YouTube, so those are great guides to help if things get too difficult. Also I stole [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12h6FU2Wi5b2KNUvzzn5E4Av53ZVjHPlplYoP5kvsT3Y/edit) from A2C last summer (I forget from who but if he #8217;s still around be sure to thank him!) and it was really helpful to me.

      <TITLE>How to add a service/data plan to my iPhone?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-15 03:02:12</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I just left home and my parents are threatening to turn off my service, so I want to add a new plan to my phone, preferably one that is cheapest (and unlimited data) as I don #8217;t have a job yet. How exactly do I get a phone plan, how does it work, and how do I manage it? Will any service work with any phone? I currently have an iPhone 6s and am looking at MetroPCS. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for the help! I don #8217;t know exactly what  #8220;turning it off #8221; means, but my nmom says that #8217;s what she #8217;s threatening to do. I assume that means cutting off the celular data, and I need my hotspot since the place I #8217;m at has absolutely no WiFi. Do you know what happens when the person who owns the phone  #8220;turns off #8221; one of them (if that makes sense)? Also, you mentioned that you have to remove the account, so if they don #8217;t do that with the knowledge that I #8217;m trying to change plans, is there no saving my iPhone and I just have to buy another cheaper device? Last question, there are some deals that are  #8220;turn in your old phone and get this new phone for a huge discount. #8221; Since my parents have control over the phone and the account, does that mean I can #8217;t take advantage of that discount and possibly keep my iPhone? I also have an old HTC phone that as much as I love it doesn #8217;t work anymore without WiFi. I think I could possibly turn that in but I #8217;m not sure.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so much for the help! From what you said, it seems that getting a new phone is the only way with it. I already wiped my phone of all photos/numbers in fear that they #8217;d shut it off the night I left, so all I need to do is transfer my passwords and they can have it. I don #8217;t really text much, I contact everyone important on Instagram and Snapchat, so a number is not the problem. I *was* looking into a mobile hotspot, but realized there #8217;s a library down the street from me, so I don #8217;t really need it anymore. As you said, since I have no job or savings, a phone is the last thing I probably need since I #8217;m not social anyways lol. My old HTC still works, but it requires me to update google services, and I have no idea how I do that haha. I #8217;ll most likely use my service-less iPhone with WiFi for contact until it stops working completely. Thank you so much again for the breakdown. I appreciate it!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Next time someone says the A is for ally, ask them: Is a man who supports feminism automatically a woman? Is a non-minority who supports POC rights automatically not white anymore? Is a US citizen who supports immigrant rights all of a sudden stripped of their citizenship and becomes an immigrant themselves? Not to be disrespectful in any way, but supporting something does not automatically make you part of something, especially when it #8217;s something that human beings don #8217;t really have control over, if that makes sense. We love allies and supporters, but we can love them without invalidating people within our own community and ignoring the issues that they face.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello all! As the title states, I #8217;m new to this, and I never learned how phone contracts worked anyways, so I need help. I don #8217;t really know what questions to ask, but I will state what I #8217;m looking for: an unlimited mobile hotspot to use in place of the WiFi I don #8217;t have. I message and call everyone important on Snapchat and Instagram, but if a plan comes with minutes or limited calls I #8217;m fine with that. I have access to a MetroPCS and some plans in Walmart, but I don #8217;t have a source of income or any money, so I #8217;d prefer the dirt cheapest plan out there until I get situated. Any help at all is greatly appreciate! TIA! Tl;dr - need the cheapest unlimited plan with a good hotspot. that is all :)</TEXT>

I also got a reply from a job today, and hopefully I will be getting it. Fingers crossed! The people I live with are nice. I #8217;ve never had anyone call me cute or sweet and be genuinely happy to see me every day. I #8217;ve never had anyone tell me that they love and care about me. I #8217;ve never had anyone go out of their way to do something kind for me just because they want to. And I #8217;ve never had anyone look after me like this, aside from my older sister. I miss my dog and I can #8217;t stop crying because I miss him so much. I plan to volunteer at an animal shelter, but I don #8217;t know if that will numb the pain. I am free but I feel guilty for leaving my sister and making her cry. I am free but I miss my neighborhood, and I never did thank my neighborhood grandma for the graduation cookies. I am free but I miss my dog more than anything else in the world, and it breaks my heart every time I think of him. They #8217;re feeding me too much good Caribbean food up here, but I #8217;ve never felt this much happiness before in my life. I hope this isn #8217;t a honeymoon phase and this happiness is permanent.</TEXT>

It #8217;s good that you recognize this, but instead of feeling  #8220;sick of arguing, #8221; think of it in a positive way, and more like gaining the control and the power to stay silent.

      <DATE>2020-07-22 01:22:47</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all. I recently moved into a homeless shelter/group home, and although super sweet, the people here have somehow planned to make every single one of my trigger noises on a daily basis in the one week that I #8217;ve been. I have ginormous headphones and I turn my music up to the max, yet I can still hear them over it. I also don #8217;t want to 1) damage my hearing, or 2) accidentally miss some important announcement. It #8217;s gotten to the point where I have to leave the house for hours a day or just sit outside all day because the sounds make me want to rage/fight someone and breakdown crying at the same time. I #8217;ve tried exposure therapy, but that just made it worse imo. I #8217;m at my wits end and I really don #8217;t know what to do about this. I read here a while back about something that you can get from an audiologist for blocking out noise but I can #8217;t remember. I also have thought about mediation, but there #8217;s no privacy here, and the nearest quiet space to meditate is by locking myself in the bathroom at the McDonalds down the street. If anyone remembers the name or has a similar device that can help me to block out obnoxious noise without going deaf I #8217;d greatly appreciate any help.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My take is, if we talk about white privilege, we have to talk about other privileges too. Like getting chosen over a more qualified applicant based on the fact that you #8217;re not white. Or never having to worry about being barred from applying to certain scholarships because you #8217;re white. Or never having to sit back and listen to people talk about how your people are subhuman or how your race should go extinct or nobody caring about the statistics of you getting killed or discrimination against you or not being allowed to be proud of who you are and the color of your skin or your history like everyone else because you #8217;re white. I #8217;m not white myself so I don #8217;t know what privilege would feel like, but the things that I personally see in society, white people don #8217;t look privileged at all.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-07-23 20:42:04</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I'm looking to attend Erdiston Teacher's College and eventually UWI Cave Hill in the near future (Spring or Fall of next year), and was wondering about the possibility of getting residency there after graduation. I will most likely do online/remote work, but will possibly look into a local job as well. I chose Barbados because it's very close to home, and although I really want to return to the region, St Vincent doesn't have many job opportunities for me to return there. I've read up on this website, but I just wanted to double check and make sure that I am not missing any other important information: [https://immigration.gov.bb/pages/Permanent\_Residence.aspx](https://immigration.gov.bb/pages/Permanent_Residence.aspx) Is there a requirement of some sort to stay in the country and get a job after graduation? If there is a number of years needed for residency, would attending university there count towards those years? How easy is it to switch from a student visa to a work visa (I know some countries require you to leave immediately after attending school there). Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Vincy-American wanting to leave the States and go home. Is residency by descent still an option for me?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-26 13:34:54</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I'm an 18 year old US citizen who grew up in St Vincent. I was thinking long and hard about this, but I really want to leave the US, and St Vincent is one of the countries on my list, since I have people there and I know how things work down there. I read [this article](https://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_ST_VINCENT_AND_THE_GRENADINES.html) from 2007 that says I could possibly get residency/citizenship through my mother who is from there, but seeing as it's over 10 years old I don't know if it would still apply today. I've also found [various residency requirements](http://uk.highcom.gov.vc/uklondon/index.php/consular/non-nationals/30-residency?showall=1 amp;limitstart=) online, however, they are all seemingly only for UK citizens, and I don't know if the same applies for the US. I will be working online so I don't think jobs would be a problem, I just want to get around the legality of things first so as to not accidentally do something wrong and get kicked out. I also found [this link](https://www.svgconsulate.vc/index.php/explore/non-nationals), but it's for the Republic of Ireland. I'm currently not on good terms with my parents, but I'm working on them letting me go overseas to live with my relatives, so I'm talking things out with them. There's also a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Embassy in my area, so I plan to give them a call sometime soon to ask a few questions. If there is any information online that I may have missed, or any advice you can give me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don't live there now but I grew up there, so I know a thing or two. I lived in both Sandy Bay and out on Mayreau, and I'd say that since you are young, sticking to the mainland is a better option for you, but since you want to remain in a touristy area, the Grenadines would be fine too. Do you know where you will be working, or are you working online? If your job is remote, the islands are pretty nice, slow paced, and have friendly locals as well as tourists. I will warn though, I don't know how it is on other islands, but where I lived on Mayreau, we had no plumbing and had to collect rain water in tanks provided by the government. It wasn't that bad though, and it was probably only because we are one of the poorest of the islands in the Grenadines. Also, everyone, and I mean *everyone* new each other out there. That could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the type of person you are. Lastly, and the thing I hated the most, was the boat rides. Some of the islands are as far out as 4 hours, so if you plan to go to the mainland, you'll have to endure an 8 hour ride out there and back. My recommendation for you would be Bequia or Canouan, as they have grocery stores, markets, and most of the stuff that the mainland does, unlike some of the smaller islands. As for things to look out for, there's not much going on, but just be wary in Town, as there are some bad apples who will steal your stuff, especially with you not looking like a local. Don't try to speak in Twang immediately. You'll pick it up as you go. If you get a car, honk when you turn a corner so you don't hit anyone. That's probably the only traffic law lol. Street food can be cheap and it's really good. Look out for the snowcone guy in Town and do yourself a favor and get one. They're great. Lines are long in eating places. Lines are long everywhere. If you have to go pay your bills on the mainland or go to the bank, take a whole day off for it, because you'll be there for a few hours. Aside from that, learn to bargain, don't mess with people's kids, and don't take fruit from peoples trees. Good luck, and welcome!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The way I see it is that instead of trying to justify the way people say things, try to educate people about why it #8217;s not right. I was taught at a young age not to use those types of generalizations because they *are* offensive, not because people may *find them* offensive. I get it #8217;s a cultural thing but there #8217;s a different between calling someone brown or red, which can be used to describe numerous races, and calling every East Asian person Chinese, or especially  #8220;Chineyman, #8221; which is close to a racist slur that was used to describe Chinese people in history.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I mean, calling someone based on what they look like isn #8217;t disrespectful, it #8217;s calling someone a slur or assuming their ethnicity/generalizing them, even when corrected is what comes off as ignorant. If someone called me Gordita I wouldn #8217;t be mad because it #8217;s a physical trait. But calling a Korean person Chinese just because to you all East Asians look the same is a bit rude. It #8217;s the same as calling all Africans Kenyans, calling all Latinos Mexican, all West Asians Syrians, etc., except the word that is used is known to be a racist one.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m mixed Pasifika, Asian, and Hispanic. I have to say all of the racism that I #8217;ve ever faced or witnessed in the entirety of my childhood has been from black folks. When I first returned to the US, I went to a white school in a white town and nobody had a problem with me. When I moved to a black town for high school the racism there was terrible. Black students got away with calling other minorities slurs, white kids might as well have walked around with a target on their backs. The only thing is they don #8217;t call it racism, and they got away with it because they weren #8217;t white. Scary thing is, information like this will be erased and people will continue to say it #8217;s false because they don #8217;t like to hear the truth.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Is there a possibility that a homeless 18 year old who has never filed taxes can get a stimulus check?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-07-28 22:29:17</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all! I know there's a subreddit for this but they're kinda ruthless with the downvotes over there for people in my situation, so I was hoping to get more advice here. Long story short I'm homeless and I turned 18 a few months ago. I'm kinda sorta independent, as in I depend on the people here at the shelter but not on my parents. I have no income yet, either. I'm not concerned about the homeless part, because most of the kids here at my shelter have gotten theirs. The thing is, they're all in their 20s, and from what I've read, if you're between the ages of 17 and 19, you're basically screwed. I've never had a job before so I have no tax history to show, and despite me tirelessly applying to jobs for the past two weeks, I have not yet received anything. So I guess what I'm asking is, as an 18 year old with no tax history, no job, and no contact with my parents, is there absolutely no way for me to get a stimulus check? I'm going to talk to my case manager tomorrow about everything but I just wanted to see if there's anyone here who has personally done it first. Thank you all in advance!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello all. I'm a recent high school grad and I'm completely new to this job searching stuff. I've been applying to about 5 jobs every day for the past two weeks, and I recently got an interview - my first interview. The thing is, on my applications, I said that I was available whenever (basically 24/7) because I desperately needed this job and I also need the money to sustain myself, as my situation right now isn't the best. Today, I talked with my case manager and she said that it would be good for me to go to college in the fall through one of the schools that are still accepting applications rather than wait until the spring. College is my dream and I really want to go right now, and I also don't want to wait, but I feel like a fraud after telling my potential employer that I'm not currently in school and I'm available at all times. What should I do in this situation?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I #8217;m not a good writer and my thoughts are all over the place so forgive me in advance. All of my goals seem so far away. I have dreams but the extra steps to get there just make me want to forget about it all. I #8217;ll be motivated to do something, but I physically can #8217;t bring myself to start or do anything about it. Every day is the same. I want friends but I hate talking to people my age. The only time I feel happy is around older folks who tell me their life stories and treat my like their child but I #8217;m too young to hang out with them. I want a relationship but I #8217;m too fat and ugly for that, and again, I hate being around people. Whenever I see kids with their happy families it makes me miserable. Whenever I see beautiful girls or boys on the street I start hating myself even more. The people here tell me they love me and that I #8217;m pretty or cute but I don #8217;t see it. Every time I see myself in the mirror I want to shoot myself in the head. I don #8217;t necessarily feel sad, I just feel empty. I feel nothing at all. I don #8217;t feel as depressed as I was when I was living at home. But now that I #8217;m adulting and in the real world I realize I don #8217;t want it anymore. I want to reincarnate as someone else who #8217;s prettier, has better social skills and a loving bio family. I don #8217;t want to live in this boring existence where I have to hear about politics or pay my bills or go to work every single day of my life just to get nothing in the end. Idk I just wanted to vent a bit. I #8217;m moving out of the shelter and getting my own room in the next week or so. I don #8217;t know but I think I might kill myself in there eventually. This life thing just isn #8217;t something I want to do. Not in this body, anyways.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t have any cash and I #8217;ve gone without washing for about 3 weeks now. I live in a shelter so there #8217;s no laundry here, and I #8217;m tired of feeling dirty all the time. There #8217;s a creek/hiking trail a few minutes from the place and I #8217;ve thought about taking my clothes down there and washing them, then letting them dry on the big rocks. Not only would I get my laundry done but I #8217;d also get to experience some good old nature for a few hours while I watch my belongings dry. I #8217;m just not exactly sure the legality of doing my laundry in a creek/lake, but I thought it was too stupid to ask anyone irl.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello all! I'm thinking about working two jobs so that I can save up for personal reasons. One job is a job that I had long since applied for, and the second job is from the lovely lady that I've been volunteering with offering to help me get paid for helping her. I usually volunteer from 9am to 10pm, but I am left to do the rest of the work on my own around 6pm every day (which I am currently trying to plan this part time job around). I have an interview tomorrow, and I don't want to say that I have open availability and then a week later tell them that I need to cut down my hours, but I also don't want to tell them that I can only work from 12pm-4pm and have them not hire me. What should I do in this situation?</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Hair is always dry after deep conditioning. Should I stop, or am I doing something wrong?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-06 13:24:25</DATE>
      <TEXT>My hairstylist says that I don #8217;t need to do any extra stuff to my hair because I already have nice hair. All I need to do is wash it and condition/deep condition (which she does for me). Now, deep conditioning does wonders for my hair, but after two days my hair is extremely dry and I don #8217;t know what to do from there. I used to only use olive oil and Hawaiian silky in my hair then braid it up for moisture, and take it out after a week, and while it usually stretches my hair and keeps it nice and moisturized, it takes away from my curl pattern. I don #8217;t know if I should continue doing that so that my hair can retain moisture or not, because it supposedly clogs up my pores. I guess my question is, what can I do to stop my hair from getting dry after a deep conditioning session? Should I do my moisturizing routine after my hair begins to dry, or before? I don #8217;t know my exact hair type, but I have short and tightly curled Pacific Islander hair if that helps.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>First things first, I don #8217;t have money to see a doctor, which is why I #8217;m asking here. Second, I think it #8217;s important to mention I gained about 20 pounds in quarantine and surpassed 200 pounds (although I may have dropped 5 or so after moving. My naive self hopes to Buddha that it #8217;s early menopause or smth, but the lord isn #8217;t that kind so I doubt it. Also I #8217;m not pregnant. I was also pretty stress free, so I don #8217;t think that #8217;s it. I was tested for STDs, HIV, nothing. I #8217;m obviously not underweight, and this happened long before I changed my portions. I #8217;m planning to make sure I don #8217;t have some type of cancer or anything when I get the chance, but for now, can I celebrate the possibility of early menopause, or should I be extremely concerned about the possibility of something serious?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For starters, I #8217;m Tamil, Fijian, and Arawak/Panamanian. I live in a mostly black city, and idk why, but people here are so extremely disrespectful when they ask what I #8217;m mixed with and I tell them my race. I look mainly Tamil, but because I #8217;m very dark, aside from my hair people tend to think I #8217;m black but I #8217;m not. Today I was doing an intake and the woman asked all the white kids and Hispanic kids what they #8217;re race was. Then she skipped me. When it came my turn to write my information on the paper, I put Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander because that #8217;s what I am. She says  #8220;yeah no I know what your race is #8221; and writes black on the paper. Like, idk if it #8217;s for statistics or whatever why they #8217;re so bent on me identifying as what they want, but I hate having to omit my heritage and not be allowed to identify as myself because people are so rude about it. Maybe I #8217;m overreacting but who knows. Americans have a really weird race obsession and I just want to hurry up and leave at this point.

      <TEXT>So last night I burned myself on a coffee machine and it was the worst pain I #8217;ve ever felt in my life. I #8217;ve burned myself before and it never hurt, but on the fingertips? Pure hell. Anyways, I was making coffee for the group again this morning and it spilled while pouring. It didn #8217;t get on me this time, but when I went to clean it up, the fingertips on my left hand started to feel static-y in the same place I burned myself on my right hand yesterday. When I got closer to the hot part of the now turned off machine to wipe the mess, a shock went through my fingers and my hand started to shake. Kinda like when your foot falls asleep? That type of static. I had coffee grinds on my fingers from the spill so that could be the reason why that happened, but I #8217;m curious as to if it was because my nerves remembered getting burned the night before and I had like.. finger PTSD.</TEXT>

I live at a homeless shelter and every morning along with every time we leave the premises we get our temperature taken for COVID and apparently your race has something to do with it? Idk. My case manager asked me my race and I told her the same thing. She was like  #8220;cool #8221; and then when she left her screen up and went somewhere else I saw that she completely ignored what I said and put something else. That really got me because she hyped me up by asking about my culture and whatnot (since I was raised in the Caribbean) and it #8217;s something I love sharing. I #8217;m just worried that since I #8217;m doing all of these federal applications for like food stamps and insurance or whatnot they #8217;re not going to match and I #8217;m going to get in trouble because these people think they know me better than I know myself, y #8217;know?</TEXT>

Then I said, no, I #8217;m Fijian and Tamil, and showed them a picture of both groups of people. They immediately went to  #8220;well they have dark skin so they #8217;re black #8221; and I tried so hard to give them a mini history lesson, but they insisted that I #8217;ve been brainwashed and I #8217;m self hating? Idk haha. A lot of people I know like to claim the blond hair some islanders have and say  #8220;look these black folks have blond hair and blue eyes #8221; or claim the features or hair of Tamil people and say  #8220;look these are black Asians #8221; like no. Your skin color doesn #8217;t always determine your race, and I wish more people would be taught about Micronesians and Melanesians as well as dark skinned South Asians so to not be ignorant.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I posted about this on r/mixedrace a few days ago, but it happened again today so I #8217;m going to rant a bit. For starters, I #8217;m Tamil, Fijian, and Arawak/Panamanian. I live in a mostly black city, and idk why, but people here are so extremely disrespectful when they ask what I #8217;m mixed with and I tell them my race.

Like, idk if it #8217;s for statistics or whatever why they #8217;re so bent on me identifying as what they want, but I hate having to omit my heritage and not be allowed to identify as myself because people are so rude about it. Today I went to the doctors office and was asked to fill out a form. I put Pacific Islander as my race because with my skin tone it #8217;s easier to explain that I #8217;m Fijian than Asian when the only Asian people here know is East Asian. Anyways, I turn in the paper and the woman, a black woman, laughs in my face and shows her coworker, then when I get my paper back she has changed my race and put black/African American on it, after I had explained to her that I am Tamil/iTaukei. Like, do I have to walk around with my ancestry test these days? Am I genuinely doing something wrong to these people? I don #8217;t understand why it #8217;s so hard for them to listen to what I tell them. For reference, I look like a fat midget version of [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/4e/a6/3b4ea6c3e3c70c031ae5a67f09bb9678.jpg), my skin is about [this](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/6e/d1/d1/6ed1d13781c836740693053c58956c68.jpg) tone, and I #8217;d say I look like an uglier version of [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/5e/42/975e422d5f6d954b0919c7cdf52334c6.jpg).

Like, for college admissions what if I put my actual race and because these people have been changing it behind my back they think I #8217;m lying? I #8217;ve had a rough and very depressing past few days so maybe I #8217;m just over sensitive. Either way, I know many other mixed kids have to deal with things like this, and many other Islanders as well. It really pisses me off and I #8217;m heated so imma just end it like this.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It #8217;s a very poor area so I wouldn #8217;t be surprised if uneducated was the right word for it. The sad thing was that a nurse did this so how could you go through college and nursing school yet not know basic history? Idk. These are the same people who call all of the Latino kids here  #8220;Spanish #8221; or  #8220;Mexican #8221; instead of Hispanic so at this point idk what to think about these people.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you. I should have clarified, but by  #8220;home #8221; I meant back at the shelter. It #8217;s not really a shelter but more of a group home thing where a family keeps taking in more and more kids and helps them back back on their feet. There #8217;s infinite space there so I don #8217;t have to worry about taking someone else #8217;s, but this transitional housing program is taking someone #8217;s place and I want to give it to someone who needs it more.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I am 18 years old, and one month ago I ran away from my abusive mother and went to live in a youth shelter 1 hour away from where I went to high school. I #8217;ve been planning to run away for 5 years, and it took a lot of guts for me to finally make the escape. With the help of the law of attraction and an amazing friend, I was able to leave and start a new, awesome life. Ask me anything!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When I first got there, like in any situation, I was nervous. I #8217;m very shy as it is so I was scared of being yelled at or pushed around but everyone was so unbelievably kind and embraced me immediately. Before I left I asked around on Reddit what it would be like and a lot of people made it seem like a bunch of criminal kids were going to hold me at knifepoint and try to rob me and it was going to be like juvie. Most of the kids here *are* out of jail for petty stuff but they are some of the sweetest people ever. I was very scared that I #8217;d be turned away or bullied but I feel great!</TEXT>

I #8217;m a lot happier though, and I #8217;m a bit more outgoing (as in I #8217;m learning to respond to conversations and any questions).

      <TEXT>Firstly, thank you so much! Trigger warning: I decided that running away would be the best option when I tried to commit suicide back in December, but it goes way back. My mother has been abusive ever since I was around 7 years old, and as I got older, my mental health worsened because of her. She ignored that and made fun of me for claiming that I had depression, and has been extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. I thought about waiting it out and staying around until I finished college or something but after realizing that I needed serious help that she was refusing to get me, I decided to pack up and leave. I had goals I couldn #8217;t accomplish because of her and serious issues because of her. I knew that life couldn #8217;t possibly get any worse, so I went somewhere where I thought I could get the help I needed.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thanks! My mother doesn #8217;t know where I am but she #8217;s been trying to figure it out. Only one person does, and that #8217;s the friend that brought me here. Im extremely careful with who I tell. I #8217;m gonna be honest and say that I have had contact with her and I call her every day BUT it #8217;s only because she pays my phone bill and I desperately need my mobile data lol. The day she turns that off is the day I stop talking to her (mainly because I can #8217;t haha). A day in the life completely depends on the person, but there are some things that are the same for everyone. 8:30am is Rise and Shine. You must get up and put your cot away. I usually wake up at 6am. 5am to 10am and 7pm to 10pm are showers, though this rule isn #8217;t enforced. You can shower at any time of day really, as long as you clean up after yourself. Breakfast is at 8am-10am, lunch is at 12pm, dinner is at 6pm. There are snacks and drinks set out 24/7 though. Check in is at 6pm, meaning you need to return to the premises if you #8217;ve left and write your name on a piece of paper saying that you #8217;re staying the night. You can leave again afterwards. Lights out is at 11pm. You don #8217;t have to be in bed but you have to be in the building unless you have special reasons (such as a job). During the day some kids go out and work, some hang out with friends or smoke weed in the park, others stay at home and watch Tv. I personally wake up around 6am, shower, then go to volunteer here from 9am until around 9pm. Then go to bed around 10pm. There #8217;s a lot to do around here and a mall down the street so some people go there or downtown. It #8217;s pretty chill!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I can #8217;t shut up about it tbh. Before we used to just hug and say good morning/goodnight, and ask about each other #8217;s days. This was different. We talked about spirituality and energy and law of attraction, some things that I really enjoy to look into as a hobby. They told me about their past and what they want to do in the future. They told me they trust me and will protect me if anyone hurts me. They called me beautiful and when one of our other friends called out  #8220;ooohh I think ___ likes [insert my name here] #8221; they just smiled and didn #8217;t say anything. They let me play a game with them on their phone and we talked about old childhood cartoons we loved. It was awesome. I live in a city with a ton of gorgeous females so I #8217;m not banking on this because I honestly feel like I #8217;m not attractive. But I really like this person and their soul is so beautiful, and I feel calm and comfortable around them. I #8217;m trying to push forward without being too clingy or annoying, and I really hope something comes out of it.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Tried to manifest my crush and ended up manifesting an old guy asking me out at the bus stop.</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-22 03:18:15</DATE>
      <TEXT>Success story! Kinda not really lol. I tried to manifest my crush through love affirmations and meditation the other day. I went to the park with my Wiccan friend and while she did her thing I did mine. I ended up writing a little poem that read: * #8221;Two hearts bound, true love found. Cherish love and purity, together for eternity #8221;* ,along with some freehand affirmations about my crush and I. The thing is, I missed a very important step: to include their name. So I was filled with positive energy and light that day, I visualized, manifested, wrote affirmations, and the works. In the affirmations I included their name, but the poem that I burned I had forgotten to, which I think led to this incident. Fast forward to the next day, I was headed to the thrift store and a random guy about twice my age (which is still pretty young since I #8217;m 18 but anyways) started trying to flirt with me at the bus stop and asked for my number. He asked if I had a boyfriend, and I said,  #8220;yes, [insert crush #8217;s name] #8221; because  #10024;manifestation #10024; He was super chill and nice and gave me a pretty little speech, and tbh if he was my type I #8217;m so desperate I probably would #8217;ve went for it. Either that day or the next afternoon my crush did come home happy as ever and gave me a hug as well as a genuine smile (something they don #8217;t do very often because they #8217;re depresso) and they touched my hands like they did the first time we met (which is how I fell in love with him). Idk why I #8217;m sharing this but I thought it was hilarious. Be careful how you manifest ladies and gentlemen. Peace and goodnight!  #9996; #65039;</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don #8217;t know if this is the case for everyone, but I am a 200 pounds, 4 #8217;11 person. There are girls who can pick me up and swing me around like it #8217;s nothing, and these people are usually not muscular at all. Just average human beings. But give that same person a 60 pound box of something to carry and they #8217;ll struggle. Why is it that they can lift me, but not a heavy box? Does it have something to do with density, the perception of how heavy I am (I don #8217;t look 200 pounds, more like 180 because of how I dress), or is it that it #8217;s easier to get a grasp on a human being than a box?</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-23 21:35:29</DATE>
      <TEXT>I have to wait. They explained to me that I needed to wait a few weeks (2 months to be exact) and allow the feelings to develop, as well as allow them to get over what they #8217;re going through right now (which is a lot of stuff), then a relationship or reciprocated feelings is certain. We #8217;ve been talking, giving each other good morning and goodnight hugs, asking the other how their day was, etc. But that #8217;s it. We #8217;ve only ever had one full on conversation with each other (which I detailed in another thread), and that was it. I want to learn how to push forward and...idk communicate with him in a way where we can move past just  #8220;how was your day. #8221; I have issues with conversations, but I do try to initiate as much as possible, I just don #8217;t know how to carry one on. I also want to talk in a way or fashion that gets them to think differently about me (in a positive, attractive way, not a negative way lol). And I don #8217;t want to come off as annoying or bothersome, so I usually walk past them or keep my head down when I have to walk into the same room that they #8217;re in to do something. Oddly enough I can see them looking at me from my peripheral, but I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s  #8220;ugh there she is again please don #8217;t say anything to me #8221; or  #8220;I wonder what she #8217;s up to. #8221; I already tried to switch things up by giving them waist hugs instead of shoulder hugs (mainly because I #8217;m 4 #8217;11 and can #8217;t reach the upper half of their body but whatever), and looking up at them into their eyes when we hug. They tend to say good morning/goodnight to all the girls here and ask them how they #8217;re doing too, but it seems like I #8217;m the only one he hugs (probably because I always do the grabby hands and ask for one tho). I guess what I #8217;m asking is, now that we at least interact with each other on a daily basis, what can I do do get him more interested in me? I #8217;m pretty fat and kinda ugly so I #8217;m not physically attractive, but I want to spice up my personality and appear to be an interesting person to him. I #8217;m genuinely quiet but I talk a little louder when I #8217;m with him. I #8217;m genuinely calm but I act a little playful with my friends when he #8217;s in the same room (and they help a lot thank god). I feel a soul connection to him and I really like to see him smiling (which is pretty rare), and it makes my heart do little flips whenever I see him. I don #8217;t know if I #8217;m his type tho, since he looks like the kind of person to be into Insta baddies and I #8217;m just a saddie/fattie but anyways- I don #8217;t mind initiating anything but if he #8217;s not attracted to me I don #8217;t want to be grabbing his hands or anything weird and he stop being my friend (because he #8217;s a pretty cool friend). I kinda wanted to offer him a shoulder massage since it #8217;s broken, but 1) I don #8217;t want to scare him off, and 2) I #8217;m not a licensed professional :( I don #8217;t know if  #8220;seduction #8221; is the word for it, but idk, can you make someone start to fall in love with you after a while of living together, or if it wasn #8217;t love at first site it #8217;s not meant to be at all?

      <TEXT>Hello all! Just wanted to share one of the many stories I have from hanging here at the shelter.  #9888; #65039; Massive SH TW  #9888; #65039; I begin to SH when I was around 11 years old due to some mental health issues that were brushed off by my parents. When my parents first found out, they called me a  #8220;tiger #8221; with all those  #8220;stripes #8221; on my arm and told me how people will  #8220;look at me like [I #8217;m] r**arded. #8221; I stopped and started again a few years later and my nmom found out again. She saw the scars all over my legs and arms and straight up told me,  #8220;if you #8217;re so unhappy with your life, why don #8217;t you just kill yourself then? #8221; Hearing something like that from your own mother is probably the most painful thing I #8217;ve ever experienced in my life. Fast forward to some years/months later, and I had an accident a while back. I played it off as a kitchen accident (because I actually burned my hand on a coffee pot that same night worst pain ever btw 10/10 would not recommend). One of the staff here (who I look at as my mommy) heard about the burn and asked me to see it. She ended up learning that night that I SHed, and had to tell the director. The director told the security guard (who was assigned to look after me), and I was called into her office. She said sternly  #8220;take your jacket off #8221; and I was afraid because of her tone. I did as she said and she immediately (and gently) took my arms into the palms of her hands, looked me dead in the eyes and said,  #8220;You are *so* precious. #8221; She continued to hold my arms and rub over my wounds and told me again,  #8220;you are so precious, and I don #8217;t want to ever see you hurting your beautiful little self ever again. You are too precious to be in so much pain. There are people here who are very worried about you, and we want you to know that we are here for you and we love you. You are so precious. #8221; Words can #8217;t even describe how I felt in that moment. All my life I was told that I should just die or that I was stupid for having mental health issues. I was told how much of a disappointment I was and how I #8217;ll never be anything in life. I was told how much I #8217;d be hated when people saw my arms. But that woman, this woman who #8217;s only known me for a *month* was able to show me more love than I had ever known, and after that day I continued to trust her more and more. She took me to get my nails done and gave me a new bag for my things, as well as some journals and papers to write my feelings. She calls me pumpkin and always gives me hugs. I adore her. And she #8217;s only one of the many people here who always praise me, tell me how much they appreciate and love me, and shower me with hugs. I #8217;ve never felt so overwhelmed with kindness before in my life, and I will definitely miss these people when I leave here. I just wanted to share this moment with you all. I call my nmom every day and every day she #8217;s telling me things like  #8220;those people don #8217;t really care about you #8221; or  #8220;they #8217;re just pretending to be nice. #8221; She tells me  #8220;don #8217;t go telling those people I did anything to you because I didn #8217;t, #8221; but I don #8217;t need to tell them anything. They say that by looking at me, they can tell I #8217;ve been through hell and back. I even had a Witch approach me on the street and do a tarot reading, and the first thing she asks me is,  #8220;so what #8217;s wrong with mommy? #8221; It seems as though people can tell how horrible she was without me saying a thing, and I hate having to explain it, so I #8217;m glad. This made me smile and I hope it made you all smile too. If you ever feel like you are unloved or you #8217;re going through something horrid, please know that there is someone that you will come across in life who cares about you more than you #8217;ll ever know. It #8217;s hard to feel like such a cliche statement is true, but I promise you, sometimes, the people who care the absolute most about you are found in the strangest places. Hugs and peace  lt;3</TEXT>

I #8217;ll definitely have safety precautions and I #8217;m pretty sure (if I #8217;m not mistaken), the hospitals here in DC have procedures that you have to go through first (at least that #8217;s what happened when I went to get my physical). I #8217;m definitely going to plan it out because I don #8217;t want to randomly show up there and scare them. Thanks again!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thanks for the heads up. I checked the hospital that they are most likely to be at (which is the one they take everyone here to during an emergency), and they are allowed visitors, up to two at a time. He doesn #8217;t have any family (hence why he #8217;s living here) but I do understand and will be sure to check beforehand just in case a close friend or something is visiting. I was honestly afraid of the  #8220;surprising #8221; aspect because I know if I were in the hospital all I #8217;d want to do is sleep the days away, but two weeks is a pretty long time to be in isolation and I thought it was a kind gesture. I will take what you said into account tho! Thanks again.</TEXT>

      <DATE>2020-08-26 01:11:36</DATE>
      <TEXT>Something I never thought about when moving here is all the people who I will grow attached to just for them to leave. People here come and go like crazy, and only now am I seeing how detrimental it is to me. I have abandonment issues and I get attached to people very easily, so when I heard my crush was leaving tomorrow I couldn #8217;t help but break down. He went missing for a whole day and came back tonight claiming that he was moving out of the shelter. I couldn #8217;t hear very well why or what was going on but he is going to discuss it tomorrow with our director. I #8217;m hoping that he #8217;s only leaving temporarily and will come back, but I know that like for many, that #8217;s just not the case. I really felt an emotional and spiritual connection to this person, and although many people here didn #8217;t like her, I felt differently. I felt like the Universe was telling me to look out for them and take care of them, which I did as much as I could when I was here. We shared some amazing moments that I will never forget, and I felt so blessed to have this person in my life for the time that I did. I just wish that all of my manifesting and hard work payed off, and that we #8217;d have developed our relationship into something more. There are still possibilities of what could happen in the next 24 hours. The director could propose a plan that makes him stay longer. They #8217;ll help him even more and pay special attention to him and his case. Maybe he will leave, but will at least come by for meals every day, just so I can see his face. Maybe he will return in two months, which is when I was told in a reading that he would come around emotionally. I #8217;ll miss my good morning and good night hugs from him. I #8217;ll miss making him laugh, seeing him do his little dances, and listening to him pour his beautiful little heart out about what he #8217;s passionate about. I #8217;ll miss playing games with him on his phone. I #8217;ll miss his slow and deep, relaxed voice. Ill miss his cute laugh and the way his light brown eyes look so cheery when he #8217;s happy. I #8217;ll miss his crooked front teeth and messy braids. I #8217;ll miss the feeling of his hands on mine and the sight of his tattoos. Ill miss how funny he was when he came home drunk or high, I #8217;ll miss our serious conversations and our not so serious ones. I #8217;ll miss how he made me feel like a princess. I really hope he #8217;ll come back soon, or he won #8217;t leave at all, because I want to be with him and feel his energy for just a little bit longer. If he does leave for good, this is the end of such a beautiful era in my life. For some reason I feel so calm inside, even though I #8217;m balling my eyes out. My heart doesn #8217;t feel hard and heavy, I just feel calm. I feel like this is a sign that things will go well tomorrow or he will return to me some day, but if not, it was lovely and I #8217;ll never forget them. I want nothing more than for them to be happy and successful in life, and even if I can #8217;t physically see it, the Universe will let me know how he is doing. He will be okay. I know he will. And I hope that he continues to make good choices for himself and that he is well taken care of.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello all. I was supposed to be admitted to the hospital today for psychiatric help, but there were no beds available so I #8217;m being sent home. I signed a form saying I #8217;d be interested in being admitted because I really do want to see the psychiatrist and eventually get on medication, but after spending one night in the hospital I don #8217;t want to spend any more. I hate being alone and I hate being away from my folks. Is there a way to back out of the inpatient program I signed, or am I stuck for the next week?</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Nmom:  #8220;Why is your teacher staying in contact with you? You think she #8217;s better than us right. I know, we #8217;re the worst parents ever. Well I #8217;m reporting her because she #8217;s not supposed to do that and I #8217;ll get her fired. #8221;</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-08-29 18:42:40</DATE>
      <TEXT>Sometimes, my nmom calls asking why I left and why I don #8217;t want to come back, but then says shit like this that just confirms why I left in the first place. I don #8217;t know if funny is the right flair but I #8217;m kinda cracking up right now at how she #8217;s playing herself. I have a teacher who was like my mother and cared about me throughout high school. The same one who brought me a gift for my birthday when I told her my parents never celebrate it. The same one who secretly let me see her friend who #8217;s a therapist behind my parents back after they refused to get me mental help. I love that woman and plan to keep her in my life forever. Well, she wanted to come visit me and take me to dinner now that I #8217;ve moved out and I let her. My sister and I were on the phone and I didn #8217;t know she didn #8217;t have headphones in, and my mom overheard me telling her that my teacher was visiting. Then she goes off.  #8220;Why is she visiting you? You wouldn #8217;t let us visit. Does she know where you are? Why would she want to visit you of all people? Why would she want to visit you in a place like that? Why would you tell her where you are but not us. It #8217;s because we #8217;re the worst parents ever. You keep listening to these people and you #8217;ll never amount to anything in life. Matter of fact, I think I #8217;m going to report her. I #8217;ll do just that because no teachers are allowed to stay in contact with students (I graduated, so yes she is). Then she #8217;ll hate you. It #8217;ll be your fault and I bet she won #8217;t be visiting you again. #8221; I do miss home sometimes because I love my dog, my cats, and my sister, and sometimes my dad. I thought about going back several times but whenever she calls me and goes off like that after I tell her about the people around me who care and how much help I #8217;m getting, I remember why I left, and I know I #8217;ll never return to her ever again. I thought it was hilarious that she would try to play the victim and do the very thing that I keep telling her she did why I left home, yet not hear how ignorant and whiny she sounds. What a woman.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If they are good people who don #8217;t try to mess with us or ask silly questions then sure. Like, there are the tourists who come to pity you and talk about how sorry they are for you, then there are those who genuinely want to learn more about things from a local #8217;s perspective. The only time I don #8217;t like tourists is when they decide to buy up a lot of property on our island and take away from land for the locals. Also there #8217;s a beach where I used to live that #8217;s not private or anything, but it #8217;s exclusively for tourists, and if you look like you #8217;re from there or someone knows that you aren #8217;t a tourist, the beach manager lady will come up to you and tell you that you have to leave (people from Mayreau, you know what I #8217;m talking about). That #8217;s when I have an issue. Other than that, come and enjoy, just don #8217;t be rude and leave our kids alone :)</TEXT>

I don #8217;t know what you #8217;re going through, what #8217;s happening in your life, or where you are, but I miss you more than any emotion can express. I miss your morning hugs, little arm squeezes when you walked by me, and I miss you talking to me about life. I hope you received my gift package and that you adhere to what is on the letter. You are *not* alone. Talk to me like you did that day at 6am. I #8217;m not going to judge you or harm you like the others for spilling out your heart because you #8217;re human and you are allowed to hurt. Don #8217;t hold it all in and get yourself in trouble again. I promise you it #8217;s not worth it. I #8217;m not going to rush you because you #8217;re intelligent and you know what you #8217;re doing. I just ask that you mind your company and *please* stay safe. Please. I #8217;m very worried. So worried that the night you came home saying you may move out I cried for hours. If you were one of the people who got COVID, I want you to get well soon and take good care of yourself. If not and you just felt the need to run away because of something, please don #8217;t hesitate to reach out to someone for help. I really and truly feel as though you are my soul mate after that conversation we had about spirituality. You treat me so well and I care a lot about you. I know the Universe will return you to me within due time. I know you will be back, but until you do come home, stay happy, stay safe, and I love you. I love you more than anything else. I just want to know that you are alright. Be safe, come home, and I love you.  #10084; #65039; #127800;</TEXT>

But KFC? Yikes. So I am definitely alright with Subway because it #8217;s good and I like it, but KFC is a huge heck nah for me. I will say that the breadfruit fries were a nice addition tho.</TEXT>

They were absolutely the most polite person I #8217;ve ever met in my entire life. Always saying please and thank you, asking how my day was, etc. It #8217;s rare people have manners these days, and I #8217;m extremely attracted to manners lol. She was also extremely kind to me and made me feel like a princess the moment we met, from kissing my hand to giving me loving hugs and calling me beautiful every day. It #8217;s rare that someone gives me that type of positive attention so I instantly fell for them.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I did a meditation and it was one of the most powerful ones I #8217;ve done this week. I almost cried from happiness because I felt so much loving energy pouring into my chest like it was coming directly from the universe. It was a beautiful moment and I feel as though something amazing is coming my way regarding what I want. I #8217;m excited.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thanks! And honestly, I don #8217;t want to give you any bad advice, but for me, I just take the time to sit somewhere quiet, and let my thoughts fly. My meditation is more part of a ritual I do for manifestation, so I visualize what I want to receive (in my case a relationship with a specific person) and I allow my emotions to take over. If I #8217;m doing it right, I start to feel myself get extremely light and like a layer is being taken off of me (like tingly all over). As far as I know, meditation is supposed to be you ignoring your thoughts and allowing yourself to embrace the present without being interrupted by other thoughts, but I make my meditations fun and allow myself to visualize and play around a bit, which releases a lot of positive energy!</TEXT>

      <TITLE>I manifested my crush back home!</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-09-05 03:41:00</DATE>
      <TEXT>I #8217;m not sure how to feel about this, but I #8217;m extremely happy right now. I made a post a few days ago that you can probably see in my profile detailing the situation, but to put it short, my crush disappeared about a week or two ago, and I #8217;ve been worried sick, so I tried to manifest them back home. I woke up this morning feeling awkward. I got up at 6am, which has been normal for me up until the past week, when I started waking up super late (around 8am). I did some meditation and was kinda irritated this morning, but I kept telling myself I was going to be happy today. I put on a brand new dress and thought  #8220;I look cute today. I wish ____ could see me in this dress. #8221; Then let everything go. I went about my day as usual. Keep in mind, I #8217;ve been doing ritual upon ritual to manifest this kid back home for about a week and a half now. I went to the park with a friend and came back home a few minutes later. When I got back, the first person I saw was my crush. They immediately got up to hug me which made me through the roof happy. They also immediately told me thank you for the gift bag I #8217;d given them about a week ago, but didn #8217;t mention the letter I gave to them (which may or may not have confessed my feelings but anyways). Apparently they found a job and had been working (which I tried manifesting for them because I know they needed it, but I #8217;m not taking credit for that one haha), and they were supposed to stay the night but hasn #8217;t come back yet. The only thing that made me feel uneasy was how broken they looked. They looked extremely tired, exhausted, and unhappy. When I did the manifestation rituals, I wanted to manifest happiness for them, and safety. I don #8217;t know if they were safe where they were, and they sure as hell don #8217;t look happy, so I can #8217;t help but feel as though I somehow didn #8217;t do good enough with trying to manifest positivity for them. Either way, I struggled a lot with doubt and lack, but they came back to me. I even manifested them talking about the goodie bag and hugging me as soon as they saw me. My heart is happy seeing them back but it hurts seeing them in pain. I hope that they are here to stay permanently, because it seems like the streets wasn #8217;t treating them well. I care a lot about this person and they always take time to pour their heart out to me which I #8217;m so grateful for. For now, I want to continue manifesting them home until they start sleeping here again, and also manifest happiness and light into their life. They have a broken bone so I want to manifest healing. They have depression so I want to manifest joy for them. They have anger issues so I want to manifest peace for them. I love this person more than I can explain in words, and I #8217;m just happy that they #8217;ve come back home. Peace and love you guys. I want to send as much of this positive energy out to you as possible  #9774; #65039;  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ngl I initially really thought she did but I asked a few of their friends who don #8217;t know I like them yet and they all said he doesn #8217;t have anybody. The reason that they were gone for so long was because some people at our facility got COVID and we had to shut down and quarantine for a few days, meaning no one could enter or exit, even if you were a resident, until you got your test, which she didn #8217;t have yet, so they couldn #8217;t come home. They were staying at another shelter down the street until we reopened so they could return. I don #8217;t wanna say they don #8217;t seem like the type to do something like that, but they honestly don #8217;t. And even if they did have a girlfriend I have no right to get mad because I #8217;m just crushing, not their girlfriend yet unfortunately lol</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[This is an actual letter that i wrote and plan to give to her eventually, so sorry it #8217;s extremely long). Dear ____, I know this is weird and kind of sudden, but I wanted to get something off my chest, and it just so happens to concern you (it #8217;s nothing bad I promise. Well I mean maybe for me but anyways). First things first, I know I #8217;m not the most physically attractive person and I may seem a bit suffocating sometimes, but I genuinely would like to at least take care of you and make sure that you #8217;re okay, even if it isn #8217;t in a romantic way. I honestly feel like that #8217;s what the Universe has been telling me to do since I met you, and I can #8217;t overcome the feeling for some reason. Just think of me as someone who you could come to for anything. I #8217;ve said it time and time again, but I promise I #8217;ll always be here if you need anything or anyone to lean on. Always. I don #8217;t know why I feel the way that I do, but my heart is already filled with so much love and kindness that I want to give to others, but sharing it with someone in a more personal manner makes it all the more special, and I can #8217;t help but want to spoil someone and make them my everything. That someone just happens to be you. Congratulations, you #8217;ve won a free token of Kitchen #8217;s affection. Redeem by...idk how long I #8217;m going to be here but you get what I #8217;m saying. I didn #8217;t tell you in person because I didn #8217;t want to ruin our friendship, and wanted to keep enjoying our hugs and conversations and spending time enjoying your energy with you and what we had before making everything terribly awkward. I love how you treat me like a princess and listen to me, make me laugh and smile. I don #8217;t only like you for your physicalities or any of that stuff (even though you #8217;re a very dapper young gentleman with the prettiest eyes I #8217;ve ever seen), but what really drew me to you was that I can tell that underneath  #8220;Messy, #8221; and the mask you put on there #8217;s a beautiful soul and a beautiful heart that I can #8217;t help but get captivated by. I feel your energy whenever you #8217;re around and can #8217;t help but get filled with joy every time I see you doing well. I was able to tell ever since we had that conversation about spirituality that morning, that though you seem troubled, you #8217;re an amazing person and God has many great things coming your way very soon. If you don #8217;t feel the same way, please just pretend you never read this letter because my embarrassment is already through the roof just writing this and I don #8217;t want to spontaneously combust lol. Like I said before, I don #8217;t want to ruin anything and would prefer to keep things the way they are rather than slowly grow apart because of my stupidity. Regardless of what we are to each other, I still care a lot about you. Maybe one day after I get my first paycheck we could go downtown for a smoke together and have another conversation about life? I #8217;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable in any way or if this sounds cringe or embarrassing but I promise I #8217;m being genuine right now. I may be soft spoken but I #8217;m still a human with a personality and the ability to have fun somewhere in here lol. You don #8217;t have to walk on ice around me or be afraid of speaking with me any certain way. My tiny fists can #8217;t do much so you don #8217;t have to worry about me beating you up or anything like that. I already lowkey regret writing this so you have to promise you won #8217;t make fun of me for it, okay? Maybe we #8217;ll create some type of secret sign so I #8217;d know your response. Punch me twice in the arm for No, three times for Yes. Or we can be adults and talk it out in person but that #8217;s no fun :( Also a few weeks ago you came home so drunk you could barely stand and threw a sandwich at us in the parking lot so you owe me an apology for making me laugh so hard you big dumby. Anyways, hope to hear from you soon. Te amo mucho, -Kitchen Also happy cake day mod person! We appreciate you a lot in this sub!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Asked my crush out today with a letter. Although I ran out the house this morning and tried to avoid him all day, he was everywhere I went. I came back from the park, he was there. Came back from a walk with my sister, he was there. I went relax in the cafe, he was there. When we met on the sidewalk he didn #8217;t mention any response, just that he put my letter somewhere safe so nobody could take it and read it, though he was pretty drunk tho and it was really awkward because we bumped into each other so suddenly. We haven #8217;t talked all day and he #8217;s high right now so talking to him would be like talking to a brick wall, but we #8217;re discussing it tomorrow morning. I feel really good about it, did a meditation to get some good vibes going and will try to remain as positive as possible tonight. I really really like this person so I hope they #8217;re at least somewhat interested in me, but if not I know we #8217;ll still be friends anyways so it #8217;s cool. On a different note, I found a really pretty park a few minutes away from my house and it was so gorgeous. I took a two hour walk and vibed, looked at puppies and saw a cat on a leash. I think I found my new workout spot!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[Long Post Ahead] So something weird happened to me the other day. I was coming back from my morning exercise and was waiting for the bus. A bus that said  #8220;Not in Service #8221; opened its doors to pick me up. Red flag number one. When I got on (of course) I was the only person there. Red flag number two. Then, I pulled the thingy to request my stop but the bus kept going. It dropped me off in a strange neighborhood. Red flag number three. As soon as I got off the bus, I was face to face with my crush, the very person who I went to the park to avoid that day, who was going on a walk himself.  #8220;This is normal, #8221; I think to myself. I see people I know on the street all the time. I move on. A few days later, a friend randomly requested we go on a walk. I didn #8217;t want to, but said why not. We go into the store so that she can use the restroom and out of nowhere, my crush walks up to me and gives me a hug. They had come to buy clothes and was waiting for the restroom too. We didn #8217;t see each other go into the store or while we were in the store. Yet they happened to walk up to my exact location and we just so happened to be there at the exact same time that day.  #8220;This is a little less normal, #8221; I think to myself. I see people I know on the street all the time, but rarely in the store like this. I move on. A few days later I feel calm but anxious. I wait until a random time, and suddenly I feel the Universe telling me to go outside. It #8217;s his birthday, they haven #8217;t been home in a few days, and I miss them. A friend and I go for a walk, and I suggest the sketchy neighborhood I saw my crush in. Not the same street, but the general area. I get a bit frustrated that she wanted to stop in the store and look at all the stuff we had no money to buy, but we went and had fun anyways. As we turn into the neighborhood, I see my crush again, high out of her mind, grinning stupidly at the sky and walking back and forth. We see each other and he says hello then starts to laugh. My friend and I continue walking. That was not so normal. Three times. Three times we met, three times he initiated a hug or conversation, and three times we spoke without me having to say anything first. These occurrences were no coincidences. The Universe allowed this to occur so that I would not have to worry. So that I could know they were okay. So that my anxiety about their whereabouts would go away. The Universe allowing this to happen was a sign that I am doing everything right, and my manifestation is coming very soon. In fact, it is already here inside of me. I just need to ignore the world around me and focus on what #8217;s in my head and my heart. Eventually, those will manifest into reality. The Universe does not trouble you with trials and tribulations. The Universe will show you clearly that it sees and hears you. If you open your eyes and see those signs, the blessings will rain on you in no time. These were no coincidences. The Universe was speaking to me directly through signs, and I now know that I need not worry. My manifestation is coming, and it is coming very, *very* soon.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>See, I know I sound stupid, but to me, I #8217;m a pretty sensitive person in the way that I can feel emotions very strongly, and it impacts me very strongly, especially when someone is angry. Like, the other day, I asked them if they were okay and they were like  #8220;yeah, I #8217;m okay. How #8217;re you doing? #8221; and even though they were speaking to me I could feel the frustrated energy coming off of them. They seemed pretty pissed off the other day and they #8217;re known to have anger issues (which we #8217;ve been working on together), so I don #8217;t want to approach them at a time where the pot is about to boil over (because I kid you not I will cry if someone yells at me). Plus, they #8217;re kinda cool with the mean girls and I don #8217;t want them to accidentally find out and then a bunch of rumors get back to the staff. I know I #8217;m overreacting and the worse thing that could happen is they tell me they don #8217;t like me and to go away, but that #8217;s honestly what I #8217;m afraid of. I feel so incomplete without this person I can barely describe it. We were such freaking great friends and I could talk to her about absolutely anything and everything, and I don #8217;t want to ruin the possibility of reviving that relationship more than I already have because I miss it so much, y #8217;know? They leave for work every Friday-Sunday so I have to wait until next week to talk to them, but push come to shove I may just have to be the bigger person and ask them what happened. I don #8217;t really know how to start that conversation tho lmao. We shall see!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you for that! I #8217;ve honestly been trying to figure out ways to fix it, and I already know they #8217;re going through pretty much hell, but I don #8217;t know how to get them out of their head the way I did back then, and calm them down again. I #8217;m trying to continue being kind to them regardless of them avoiding me, and I #8217;ll probably start back with the little flirty stuff I used to do (hugging them, asking them about their day) if they let me. I always tell myself that my life is a really f #8217;ed up K-drama because so far that #8217;s exactly what it #8217;s been like, and I honestly feel as though they #8217;re only not speaking to me because they think I #8217;m mad at them or somebody said something about me, the same way I #8217;m not speaking to them because I think they #8217;re mad at me. I #8217;ll try to fix it best man I can, and if not, I #8217;ll have my best friend ask him about it because she knows how to talk sense into a person lol. The last time he stopped talking to me the Universe ended up pushing us back together and we saw each other in the grocery store randomly. He hugged me and we had a good laugh together. I feel like the same thing may happen again this time, but I have to let go of the negativity I #8217;m holding onto in order for that to happen. It #8217;s just a bit hard but I #8217;m trying my best!</TEXT>

My crush and I shared many beautiful and fun memories but we #8217;re going through a rough patch right now and not speaking.

I #8217;m conflicted as fuck and it doesn #8217;t help that my crush is gone for the weekend, meaning I can #8217;t reach out to him and get an answer sooner.

      <DATE>2020-09-19 13:01:14</DATE>
      <TEXT>Hello all. I #8217;m in a complicated situation rn and have been asking every adult around me for solid advice to no avail. This may be a bit long, so buckle up lol. From the beginning, I #8217;ve been head over heels for my crush for the past two months we #8217;ve known each other. They #8217;ve been super sweet to me, did things like kiss my finger when I sliced it cutting onions (I work in a kitchen), call me beautiful every day, or give me morning hugs and have deep conversations with me. I know a lot about them and I care very deeply about them. From the beginning, it seemed as though they liked me back. But I #8217;m a shy person and I also don #8217;t pick up social cues very well, so I think that it got to a point where they thought I didn #8217;t like them back, or they were told something about me which made us slowly start to grow apart. We barely speak anymore because they #8217;re in a rough patch, and I don #8217;t want to set them off, but I do plan to speak to them tomorrow or Monday when they come home from work about the situation and how I feel. A little background about my crush: They are the hard headed tough one with the attitude and the anger issues, but we have a ton in common and I #8217;m able to calm them down when many others can #8217;t. When they #8217;re not mental they #8217;re super fricken sweet, chill and laidback, and great with kids. We are an energetic match I truly believe, and we get along very well. They don #8217;t get into trouble that often, but it happens every now and then and she usually comes back fine anyways. My crush #8217;s friend on the other hand is the big brother sweetheart type who is always looking out for everyone around him and is super kind. He does have his explosive moments too, and they #8217;re oftentimes worse than my crush #8217;s, but he #8217;ll be fine afterwards too. I #8217;ve only ever met him one other time and that #8217;s when I was hanging out with my crush. When he approached me the day he told me he liked me, he called me  #8220;little sis #8221; and didn #8217;t even remember my name, which I had to end up telling him. Here #8217;s why I think this whole thing is sketchy: He comes to me after a day of seeing me and tells me that he likes me. Off the bat, he begins talking about spirituality and energy, something only my crush and I ever discussed together. He also just randomly started living here again the exact same day my crush left for work for the weekend (and won #8217;t be coming home at all for three days), and my mind just says  #8220;Messy is telling this guy to test her girl while she #8217;s away. I can feel it. #8221; I can #8217;t help but feel like the reason my crush and I grew apart is because his friend said something about liking me, and she either 1) didn #8217;t want to break homie code and thought I didn #8217;t like her anymore, or 2) set him up to ask me out so that she could see if I still had a crush on her (which I think is pretty obvious but idk). My crush #8217;s friend also treats me almost identically to how my crush used to treat me, which I found strange, but also comforting. I almost fell for him because I missed that bond my crush and I had, but then I remember that what I really want is the person, not their little flirty actions. I really, really, *really* still love my crush despite us being  #8220;mad #8221; at each other for the past week now. I was going to tell the friend something along the lines of  #8220;you #8217;re a wonderful guy and all, but there #8217;s someone else who I #8217;ve been head over heels for for the past two months, and despite us going through a rough patch, I can #8217;t seem to get over her right now. I hope you don #8217;t take this the wrong way, but I think my heart is still telling me to go after her. #8221; The thing is, I wanted to wait until my crush came back to speak to her about my feelings for her, but I didn #8217;t want to lead the friend on any longer, and I also didn #8217;t want to drop the friend then have my crush reject me and then I look like an idiot. I express my feelings through letters because I #8217;m not good at conversations, but I don #8217;t like to leave them laying around the building like that for others to accidentally get their hands on. I also think that now I #8217;m older, letters are a bit childish and I should learn to have a big boy conversation but I #8217;m scared lol. I honestly don #8217;t know how to go about this, especially since my crush always comes home in a bad mood and I don #8217;t want to approach her at the wrong time, but I also don #8217;t want to approach her too late. I also don #8217;t want to reject the friend and then have my crush reject me, then start developing feelings for the friend and end up getting f #8217;ed over (idk if that #8217;s how emotions work but I #8217;ll probably still have a crush on her whether she likes me or not lol). I #8217;ve never done this whole dating thing before and it #8217;s complicated and I want it to stop lmao. Any advice from anyone who has been there or just someone who has solid advice in general, please help a sister out because I #8217;m really struggling to figure out what to do here. Thank you so much in advance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yes, which is why I referred to them as such. I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s a DC thing or not, but most of the trans boys I know still call themselves women. Like my  #8220;uncle #8221; (a good friend who I made here) passes unbelievably well as a man, as in I didn #8217;t even believe they were actually trans when someone told me, but when he introduces himself to people he will sometimes say  #8220;I #8217;m a woman #8221; and his loved ones switch between the usage of he and she. I heard someone say that here, people prefer to switch their pronouns after surgery so I #8217;m assuming that #8217;s both my uncle and my crush #8217;s situation. They will say that they #8217;re a boy but they still use she/her pronouns. It #8217;s complicated and I #8217;m still learning lol.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Despite the Universe sending all these signs that we were meant to be together, my SP officially moved out for good today, and I have no way of contacting them. Is it worth it to keep trying to manifest them back, or is now the time to give up?</TITLE>
      <DATE>2020-09-20 01:18:45</DATE>
      <TEXT>I always worried about being too late when it came to my SP, and today was the day my world fell apart. I was supposed to talk to them tomorrow when they came home from work, but they came back today, emptied out their locker, threw all of their stuff in the back of some guy #8217;s car, and left. Someone asked where he was, and a staff member said he was gone for good. I am holding back tears as I write this, because my energy was so positive this weekend, and I truly felt I was doing everything right. Now he #8217;s gone, and I don #8217;t know what to do with myself. I did so many tarot readings and so much research. All the signs were telling me that my manifestation was coming. That we were destined to be in a relationship together. That my feelings of them being my soul mate was true, and that we were going to be together in the long run. I #8217;m continuing to manifest them regardless because there #8217;s always the chance of us meeting outside of the facility and getting closer, but at the same time I #8217;m so broken that all of that hard work I put in protecting my energy is completely gone, and I have to start from the bottom once again. I had trouble with doubt and lack when they were here, and now it #8217;s multiplied a million times. I miss their voice. I miss their smile. I miss their laugh. I miss their hugs. There #8217;s no one in this world who can make me feel the way they did energetically and vibrationally, and I so desperately want them back. Is it worth it continuing to manifest this person? What should I do to protect my energy while in a state of depression? Does anyone have experience with meeting their SP again after some time? Any help is appreciated. Thank you all in advance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you so so much. I feel really calm if I #8217;m being honest, as if I know they #8217;re coming back but I just have to wait. Waiting is what the Universe has been telling me to do, so I #8217;m willing to do it for this person. I think the thing that set me off last night was that we left mad at each other, and I don #8217;t want their last memories of me to be bad ones. I #8217;m definitely taking the next month to myself to breath, deal with my own damage and take care of my mental health so that when they do return, even if it is only briefly, I will be confident and prepared to address the situation. It #8217;s really hard when living in a place like this to find peace and not focus on the lack, especially when all of my greatest memories here involved him and every room I enter my mind replays a moment we shared together.. I #8217;m trying the best I can, and hopefully I will be able to find a positive headspace again. I trust that this happened for a reason, and we will be positively reunited again in the future. Thanks again and I truly appreciate your kindness!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hello all! I #8217;ve been reading up on SATs and I #8217;ve heard that visualizing an end scene is recommended. Thing is, I #8217;m having trouble deciding what I want the  #8220;end #8221; to be for me. I know I want a relationship with my SP, but do I just visualize them coming back home and confessing to me, telling me they couldn #8217;t live without me? Do I visualize us together in a happy relationship as the two young idiots we are now? Or since I desire a long lasting and loving relationship, do I visualize us married, him successfully pursuing his music and me doing whatever I end up falling into as a career? Does being too specific with living in the end negatively impact what happens in the middle? What is the end for you guys, and how has it started to unfold in your reality? TIA!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sunday afternoon you were supposed to come home. Sunday afternoon I was supposed to tell you I loved you. Sunday afternoon is when everything was supposed to fall into place. But Sunday afternoon, you never came home. It was Saturday afternoon that I saw you, empty your locker, throw all of your things into some guy #8217;s car, and ride away. You looked so happy to be out of here. Shoot, I #8217;m happy for you. Nobody should ever have to live in a place like this for so long, but you left so suddenly, and now, I #8217;m afraid of never seeing you again. You have no phone and no socials to contact you, so I just hope that some way I will see you again. I know you will be back soon. I intend for us to reunite before or during the Christmas. It #8217;s just that waiting and not knowing when I #8217;ll get to feel the warmth of your hug or hear the slur of your voice or feel your positive energy dance with mine is painful. I don #8217;t have anyone to wake up to anymore. I have no one to pour my heart out to anymore. I have no one to treat me like a princess, and no one to look forward to coming home every day. I loved you more than you probably thought, and I #8217;m sorry I didn #8217;t jump on the chance to ask you out when you were reciprocating those feelings. I was dumb and didn #8217;t pick up the cues until it was too late and I #8217;m so very sorry. I know you #8217;re coming back. I know that when you do, I #8217;ll be here waiting with open arms to see you walk through that door. Until then, I hope that you are safe, happy, and successful. Don #8217;t let people walk over you anymore or take your money or push you to do the wrong thing. You #8217;re intelligent, you are kind, and you will do great things now that you have left this wicked place. Love you, and I can #8217;t wait to see your face again.</TEXT>

I was asked to lead someone to a donation room to get some clothes today, and I initially didn #8217;t want to do it because the person I was supposed to be helping had a bad attitude and I didn #8217;t like her, but I did it anyways to be nice. As I was leaving the room I saw a pillow, and I was immediately filled with so much joy. The pillow belonged to someone who I love very much who moved out about 2 weeks ago, and who I miss very dearly. I feel like the Universe placed the pillow in my sight and put me in that situation as to tell me that my loved one is safe and returning to me soon, so I needn #8217;t worry anymore. I got to take the pillow with me, and now I have a part of them with me all the time. I #8217;ll hug that pillow close to me every single night until my angel is back in my arms to take its place  lt;3</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Tomorrow marks a month since you #8217;ve moved out and for some odd reason I #8217;ve been calm the whole time. Yes it hurt seeing you leave, but considering all the stuff that #8217;s gone down since you #8217;ve left it was probably for the better lol. I #8217;d rather have you gone from here than have stayed behind and gotten into a fight with these annoying and hostile new kids then banned from the property. Aside from all that, I #8217;ve been receiving signs about your wellbeing, and I #8217;m glad you #8217;re doing okay. The Universe has been helping me throughout this time, and I #8217;ve learned a lot being away from you. I #8217;ve learned self-love, I #8217;ve learned to control my anger (which you better start doing too before I kick you in the back of the kneecaps again), and I #8217;ve learned to ground myself and deepen my meditations. I also learned to roll my own j lmao so look out bc I #8217;m about to surprise the crap out of y #8217;all when you get back. I #8217;m excited to see you again in the winter, and to hear your voice and feel your warm embrace again. I think I #8217;m looking forward to seeing you more than to Christmas haha. You are my Christmas tbh,  #8216;cause that #8217;s your nickname in my phone. Y #8217;know, bc you love Jesus and stuff. Like a lot. ~~It #8217;s a little bit scary sometimes.~~ But anyways, I hope you are doing as well as I #8217;m being told and I can #8217;t wait to see you again! Love and miss you!
