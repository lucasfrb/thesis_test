    <TEXT>But on a serious note, probably a lot of things, it just depends on the number, imagine a dude who has like several hundred phone chargers lying around, that would seem pretty weird to me, but I believe that would be different for every item. Edit: it may also depend on your occupation, if you are a professional cook it would probably more likely to be perceived as normal if you have a lot of kitchen stuff, but if you are a normal guy it could be weird if you have a shitload of knieves lying around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why would it be? Metal is not for everyone, so it #8217;s understandable if for others other genres are better, e.g. I can #8217;t listen to Rap, because for me personally it sounds terrible, so I would say that Disturbed is by far better than any Lil you can think of, but that doesn #8217;t mean others can #8217;t have a different point of view, and it #8217;s very counterproductive for a conversation if you become unreasonably emotional about every little thing .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;ve just spend about ten minutes formulating an answer to the guy that said that the holocaust didn #8217;t happen, seeing as you cannot see the comment anymore I try to summarize his argument: The Nazis could have just shot the Jews, and he made an argument that all those bodies couldn #8217;t have been burned because it would take to long. Now for those who at interested here is my answer: First, Why waste ammo, if you can kill a bunch of people at the same time with gas (in Auschwitz the Gas-Chambers has a capacity of about 8500 people at the same time) furthermore if you would have done your research you would know that people also have been shot (e.g. in Sachsenhausen, you might have also heard about the black wall in Auschwitz). And the cremation halls were able to burn about 4500 within 24 hours (there were five crematoria and three additional places that were used to burn bodies, those three had almost unlimited capacity) the second crematorium was run for 600 days straight the third for about 550 days the fourth was run for 527 days and the fifth for about 300, and the first was run from 1940-1944 (but it had a smaller capacity) so if you do the math you can roughly say they could have been burning 4500 a day bodies for about 500 days (which they did not, but could have) that puts us at over 2,25 Million bodies in Auschwitz alone, and the same or similar techniques were used in all other death camps, and in the concentration camps (see: Treblinka, Mauthausen, Ravensbr #252;ck, Dachau, Auschwitz etc.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But I think there is a difference between playing a mental illness because it makes you unique and actually believing that you have one. But from experience I can say that most people that actually do have issues normally don #8217;t like to talk about them (or at least the people I know don #8217;t like to) so it #8217;s easy to tell people who think they have a problem but don #8217;t from people who have one, this could probably be solved by using educational systems to inform about the  #8222;more common #8220; issues so people stop self diagnosing. But I still don #8217;t get why people would pretend to have an issue to be unique, if someone wants to be unique than they can learn a fu***** instrument or something.

    <TEXT>I know that a lot of European countries also have had terrible periods during their history, e.g. colonialism, and the Holocaust in Germany, but in comparison to at least the colonialism the American Mistakes are much more recent (Korean War 1950-1953; Vietnam War 1955-1975; Gulf War 1990-1991; Cold War 1947-1991) so there are a lot more people that have first hand memories about it, and we have a lot more information about them.</TEXT>

So in bible logic, everything that happens was always destined to happen, and you could call that a sort of plan for everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first few seasons were awesome, because they were something exceptional, something epic, then it got a little worse (not bad but not as good as the first four/five seasons), and at the end of season six it took a turn upwards again (the last two episodes of season six were fucking awesome) season seven was not as good as the ones before, but it could have been a lot worse, and then in season eight D amp;D basically trashed everything fans loved about the series, and every character development and generally everything that happens in the first six seasons was just thrown away. So yes, it was that terrible.</TEXT>

So it #8217;s not that people hate you, people just ask themselves when the US is going to get their shit together, because for a first world nation they seem pretty underdeveloped.

    <TEXT>Which system is better always depends on how it #8217;s interpreted, there is no absolute communism and no absolute capitalism, and I personally believe that if we were able to do it right communism (or socialism) would be far better for our society than capitalism (but this is my personal belief, I may be right, I may be wrong). But even if you believe that capitalism is worth defending, you can surely agree that it does not justify supporting an anti democratic dictatorship, launching an invasion against a largely peaceful nation, and killing thousands of innocents. And i believe that doing all the above, while claiming to fight for democracy and peace, is definitely hypocrisy, no matter which viewpoint you have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here in Germany it #8217;s quite normal, sometimes a waiter comes by if they see that everyone has closed their menus, but usually one person at the table gives the weiter a sign, he/she comes over, we tell them we would like to order, and, depending on what they #8217;re currently doing, they will take your order or send someone to take your order. And it #8217;s the same if you need refills or something like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please read the post carefully before you make uninformed statements like that, the point of getting money for returning those bottles is to implement a stable recycling system, where glass and plastic bottles are constantly reused, that is not dependable on the good will of the people, but rather provides them a motivation to support the recycling systems. The fact that homeless are collecting these bottles (and cans) is a separate development that has nothing to do with the premise of the system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me explain it to you, here in Germany we also have a system such as the one described by OP, when we go to the grocery store and we buy beverages we pay the normal price AND an additional 9-25 cents, upon then later emptying the bottles, acquired beforehand, we do not throw them away, but we keep them, and the next time we visit the grocery store we take them with us to return the bottles we #8216;ve kept, and upon returning them we get a little piece of paper, on which is written the amount of money we #8216;ve got back (we get back the 9-25 cents, which we have payed extra) and when we leave the store we can chose to either buy something with that money, or to just cash it in with the cashier. Now regarding the fact that homeless are collecting these, when you #8217;re out walking around or doing whatever, sometimes the 9-25 Cents are just not worth it, so instead of carrying the empty bottle around all day, we place it visibly next to e.g. a garbage can, so that someone who can use this money may collect them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all this is purely hypothetical, secondly if I was (alongside a few others of course, because a single person democracy would be pretty useless) to set up a democratic nation it would be up to us to determine the rules and laws of cette nation (age you get to vote, who gets to vote, if it #8217;s an absolut or parliamentary democracy etc.), thirdly everyone is a private citizen, so everyone is free to interpret the rules as far as they #8217;re allowing it (which does not mean everyone else (e.g. court or police) have to agree with you. As you may see you #8217;re argument doesn #8217;t make any sense, since I am a private citizen and as are you), fourth as I said this is hypothetical and I was referring to the concept of democracy, and not an existing democracy, when saying that the interpreter of the concept democracy would be free to determine the rules, as opposed to religion, because they are not a concept, they are catalogue of rules you have to obey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I described something hypothetical, if I HYPOTHETICALLY was to set up a democratic state along side others and so on. To your next question, any religion (e.g. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism) comes with rules which followers of their respective religion must follow, as opposed to democracy (or any form of government e.g. dictatorship, monarchy, aristocracy, meritocracy, gerontocracy etc.), which is a concept that does not have any specific rules you have to obey, you are free to interpret the concept of democracy (or any other form of government e.g. see the ones formerly mentioned) however you want.</TEXT>
