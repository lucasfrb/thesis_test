    <TITLE>TIFU by walking out a different door</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-07-28 00:18:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I went and parked in the parking garage where I work and used that as free parking to go do things elsewhere. To exit the garage you go out through a glassed in area. Usually people go out the side that points towards the main entrance. Today I went out the other door that opens up to the perpendicular street A couple seconds after opening that door, the alarm for the building went off and the whole building had to be evacuated. The door isn't marked as a fire door or anything. It was probably bad timing but then it's impeccably bad timing. I kept walking away, only stopping to look back and see a flood of people walking out the front doors. TLDR: left a parking garage a little different than usual and may have caused the whole building be evacuated</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mood flipped and my boss noticed. What excuses should I try to use to explain it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-01 08:01:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story short we had a slightly stressful period (I work in retail) and he snapped at me a little, unintentionally. It's something that wouldn't affect a normal person but I've been a bit anxious for a while and my meds haven't been working well so I started getting depressed. Well, a couple of sharp words were enough to shut me down a bit. So I got quiet instead of being perky and talkative plus my face shows everything so he knew. He kind of found out that it was because of him and tried asking me about it. He's an incredibly nice guy, he wanted to know so he could apologize or just say something to make me feel better. I tried saying I woke up not feeling well and I was tired, neither of which are lies, but of course he didn't buy it. I'm not sure what to say when things get rough again while I'm at work. If I say something then whenever a mood thing happens they'll blame it on that or think they have to tiptoe around me or treat me differently. But I can't have him thinking I'm this passive aggressive person that's hiding something. I told him he didn't do anything because he really didn't. I'm overly sensitive and I can't blame him for that in this situations. I could really use help figuring out how to handle these situations. I'm used to being around people that'll either not say anything or ask if things are ok and when I say yeah they drop it even if they know I'm lying. I'm so lucky to have a boss that cares so much. But it's making me lie and hide things. If he knows then everybody will know and they'll treat me differently. I just want to be looked at like I'm a normal person.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Told a teacher my diagnosis, she spread it to another teacher. Is that allowed?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-05 17:31:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>This was a few months ago. Basically what happened was I was desperate and going through a really tough time so I emailed one of my profs to let them know what was going on. She then, without my permission, forwarded that email to the prof in charge of me within my program. I'm with the second person till I graduate. I didn't want to tell her, I wanted to keep it as quiet as possible. Now I'm having conflicts with that second teacher unrelated to my diagnosis but I'm so uncomfortable around her after a few stunts she pulled. I can't get a new coordinator, she's the one I have and that's that. I guess that last part is irrelevant but was the first teacher allowed to just forward my email like that?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm sick of it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-18 05:39:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm sick of it. I'm sick of counting out 7 pills every night. I'm sick of my boyfriend getting angry at me for being irrational. I'm sick of every fight relating back to my illness. Why can't some of my concerns be valid? I'm sick of having to duck out of plans and let other people down because my mood flips. I'm sick of putting on my happy face when I go to work every day and have everyone know I'm lying when I say "I'm just tired." They see that I'm hiding something, but I guess that's better than knowing the truth. I'm sick of knowing that I'm sick. That I'll never get better. That I'm not me. I'm sick of not remembering things. It's nice to forget fights and the bad times but it leads to the same fights happening again and again because I had no idea the same one happened before. I'm sick of crying in bed at night and not having anyone to talk to because nobody can understand what I go through. I don't even understand it sometimes. How can you expect me to explain something I don't understand? I'm sick of having a temper. I never used to get angry. Only when I was fighting with my little brother. Not when I was being bullied or picked on in school. But now every little thing has the capacity to set me off. I'm sick of the drugs not working well enough and not being able to get to a doctor to adjust them. Obamacare hurt some people. I'm one of them. I now have some of the worst insurance on the market when I used to have the best. I'm sick of being stuck in all the red tape and not being given the opportunity to get better. Most of all, I'm sick of not being my old self. I don't know who I am anymore. No matter who is around me I'll always be alone in this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Roommate has me at my wit's end</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-20 15:34:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm the bp one here but long story short she has her own issues, probably nothing to be diagnosed but that doesn't mean she doesn't have stuff that intense therapy could help. She grew up basically neglected middle child in a VERY rich family but she doesn't fit that lifestyle at all. She resents it. That probably bred insecurities from her mother criticizing her and control issues from not being in control or seeing her older and younger brothers make stupid life choices and mistakes so if she doesn't do it she thinks it'll never be right. Anyway, aside from control issues, I'm not even sure exactly what to call this but I'll explain. Every time she hears me leave my room, even if just for a glass of water, she comes out. Then I'm trapped. She rants about everything from how her mother vents to her about stuff she ' shouldn't have to be bothered with.' Then why do I have to hear about it to?!? She goes on hour long rants about sports she knows I don't care about. These "talks"are all a minimum of an hour and a half and I can't escape. We're in the same college organization and she's spent years trying to get this position and bitching about losing out and now she won't stop bitching about the like three things that have gone wrong with it so far before the semester even started. Yesterday I told her a valid reason for why I'm not behind a policy change she wants to make and she made all kinds of jabs about me at how I don't go to meetings and I didn't meat the full requirements last semester so I don't get a voice. She can't handle stress or opposition. She doesn't care or see how she affects me. I've told her "I have to do homework, it's going to take all night" "I have a lot of studying to do, I have two tests tomorrow" even "I have to pee" but that doesn't stop her. If I back into my room and start shutting my door, there was a time where she kept inching forward as I inched back and ended up actually in my room. I'm getting so stressed out that I can't leave my room. I don't often engage in these conversations (like no eye contact, being on my phone, mhm's and yeah's as my only answers). And if I do interject she either ignores what I say or attacks me. I want to go cook. It makes makes happy. It helps me eat well and be stable. For the first time in a long time I actually want to cook. She was gone all summer so it was peaceful and I could do what I want but now she's back and I feel trapped in my room. Talking to her won't help, getting a different apartment isn't an option. I get that she's rarely had real friends but that doesn't mean she can latch on to me because I tolerate her and I'm usually perfectly nice to her (except during her 'ambushes'). Please tell me someone has advice. I've already lived with her for a year, we have one year left. I can feel a massive depressive swing coming from the stress and I just got over a mixed episode. Not what I need with classes and student teaching starting. I can't take it. TLDR: overbearing inconsiderate roommate that leaves her room whenever she hears me leave mine so she can bitch about the same things over and over, none of which I give a flying f*ck about. I can't leave my room and it's getting me all kinds of stressed and unstable having to listen to it and deal with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ran out of Lamictal and Wellbutrin, haven't been able to make it to the pharmacy to pick up more and I couldn't until maybe lunchtime tomorrow. I'm at work all day, luckily doing some stuff in the back but if it gets busy I have to go be with customers and I can barely stop crying when I'm just by myself. I already said some terrible things to my boyfriend which he says may have ended our relationship, and tomorrow I have to go to school (college) and work with kids and I don't think I can handle doing that. I can't keep it together. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to have intrusive thoughts but I doubt I'd act on them so it's more of an annoyance than a worry. I don't even have a psychiatrist right now so I can't call them or anything, I'm on my own.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My opinion on mental health reform (vs gun control laws)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-10 06:30:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Plain and simple, access to mental health care should be as available or easier than prenatal care and care for babies. That's just a comparison to how accessible I think it should be, not trying to pin one against the other. It's the hardest for us to do the work to get help and nearly impossible for some. I'm a white middle class American working on a college education. Both of my parents are college educated. I got help in the beginning though my school's mental health center but they kicked me out and there's no doctors in or nearby my city that will take me. I started my search in May, 5 months ago. Why is it so hard? Why is it so expensive? But if I got knocked up there's a hundred places I could go for support. The government would help me if I was poor. I know little to nothing about the topic but that's my perception of how it is for pregnant women. Churches will help, you'll get whatever the modern version of food stamps is if necessary. But mental health? Nope. It absolutely must be accessible. The homeless and uninsured are some of the people that desperately need it and by not having it available the cycle is just being perpetuated. If someone wants a gun they'll get it, regardless of the laws. We desperately need mental health reform, whether it's to prevent violence or not. The world considers me "privileged" for what I am yet I can't find a damn doctor to give me drugs and keep me stable. If that's what a "privileged" person gets then how bad is it for everyone else? Something needs to change. Soapbox over.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Today I messed up the school's laminator...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-14 00:02:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I went to laminate something. New teacher, coincidentally haven't been around when the machine wasn't already set up and ready to go. Well, another teacher went to replace the roll. They said "I'll be back in 15 minutes when it's heated up to run this cardboard through then you can use it." An hour and a half later the machine was radiating heat like the wonderful machine should but the cardboard was still sitting there with the ends of the plastic sticking out, not yet fed through. I was impatient and wanted to get my anchor chart finished up so silly me presses "go" since that's all the other teacher implied needed to be done. The cardboard almost got out but all of the plastic on the sides of it got all wrapped up. The cardboard was only about 8" long. Oh no! So I spent most of my free period trying to get the darn thing unstuck. Eventually I was able to get all of the plastic and the piece of cardboard out. I cut the messed up stuff from the roll so I had some to work with so I could push or pull whatever tried to go through. So I took the base guide off and unscrewed the top roll of laminate. No big deal, got it all screwed back together but the machine didn't turn on. I didn't test the switch on the back so that's probably why. An e-mail went out to all of the staff saying not to try to set up the machine unless you've been trained (other teacher was merely guessing at what to do) and not to use metal objects to get the jam out. I used scissors to cut the plastic, I didn't stick them in there.... A seasoned teacher was telling me that everyone has a laminator story at some point. She accidentally left it running one time and all behind it was this looooong roll of the plastic that just kept coming and coming. I think she said she got it all wrapped up also. What's your best laminator story?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Student teacher getting bullied by students</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-28 18:28:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>5th grade. The kids won't quiet down as a class or even individually when I call them out. They've recently started making fun of my shoes. All I've worn this week was black flats and black ankle boots, the ankle boots were under my slacks. No strange outfits. They keep making fun of me for not knowing all of their slang. I can't believe I'm officially an adult. We have "stops" in the halls for the kids so they can get caught up and make sure they're in quiet lines, all that stuff, one of which is outside. Stupid me had the idea of making the kids be quiet, like they're supposed to, at this stop on a chilly (50 degrees, really windy) afternoon. It's not like I stopped them in a random spot. Well, they were literally screaming. It was awful. They wouldn't stay on the sidewalk, yelled, no matter how much I yelled that we could go in when they were in a quiet line, calling out individual kids. Then they start screaming "this is child abuse!" Which really really isn't funny. They don't care. The mentor teacher had yet another talk with them today with little impact. She really is wonderful and I don't blame her for it. But I really don't know what to do. She told them not to be so disrespectful, to listen to me, ask them why they do what they do. One of them said "she's not as strict as you" which I don't really agree with, I try to be strict but like I said, they do not listen. Making them stand in silence doesn't work. I've had to do that for minutes before and it does not get them to behave the way they should. I'm a mess, I dread going in every morning, and it's really taking a toll on me. It's a title 1 school. While I'm still trying to muddle through classroom management I don't feel that that where they're from is an excuse for them to act the way they do. I'm sick of yelling out their names, sick of them lying about misbehaving and talking, I'm sick of feeling so helpless. The mentor teacher is typically in the room, these events often happen as we're going to or from specials or lunch.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Coworker that takes her anxiety issues out on me plus rough student teaching situation is getting to be too much to handle. Need help finding ways to make things better</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-31 03:31:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll start with the student teaching and get that part out of the way. The coworker has me so worked up right now it's ridiculous. Long story short, I'm in a title 1 (low income) school teaching 5th grade. I've been with the kids at least twice a week since the start of school in August so they know me. Now I'm there all week. They don't respect me, they won't behave at all, they make fun of me. They're out of control and nothing has any lasting impact. I have a couple ideas for how to try controlling them but I'm so stressed after how awful this past week was. They screamed "child abuse" when I made them wait outside to be quiet and in a line before we went inside and it was chilly (50's) and windy. It's a normal spot to stop and get caught up, I did nothing wrong but it still felt awful and I was never able to get them under control. The coworker. She has anxiety problems, which many of us can relate to. After Thanksgiving she had to take almost 2 months off to leave and learn to meditate or some crap and came back in mid January talking about how she was so anxious her head hurt and she spent over $720 on this meditation stuff. Then she went on a rant denouncing western medicine and the use of drugs for all psychiatric conditions since they don't help, all they do is mask things and make problems worse. I hate people like her. Anyway, she was nasty to me before she left on her vacation. I started working there (part time retail) in May or June. She started in September. She came in acting like she owned the place and knew everything. She tells customers the wrong info, wrings things up wrong, just does stuff wrong. Yes I can easily admit that she always pisses me off so I give her crap in my mind for even small things but I can be objective about it too. I told her she did something wrong one time and I got in trouble because she felt that I made her look stupid in front of a customer. So I can't tell her when she does things wrong that need to be changed, I can't offer advice because then I'm treating her like she's stupid (even if she is factually wrong or actually doesn't know anything). She does this thing where if I'm standing behind one set of registers she won't stand near me. She'll move to the other set. If I happen to be over there she moves to the opposite side of the store. It's not coincidental, I've tested it quite a few times. So after she came back which is only like two or three weeks ago she started disappearing for very long stretches of time multiple times a day. I mentioned this to the manager only after he asked me about how we were getting along, to which I told him that she still won't talk to me but I'm trying and I can be fine working with her, she won't work with me. She probably left to meditate. Once she was over two hours late to work then took 2 or 3 almost hour long breaks. Another time she took the first hour to make a phone call then still took a few very long breaks later. We don't "do" breaks like that. We have our lunch breaks and that's pretty much it. He said to keep him informed. In that convoy I even told him that for one of the breaks I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said maybe she was picking up some stuff to bring downstairs because she did bring down a few things. I know she wasted most of that time. But I was honest with him and did tell him where I felt she was straight up wrong in how she acted and where I didn't think much thought should be put into it. I was surprisingly lenient. There are plenty of other stories for things she did wrong. Today, though, was different. I can be amazing with words when I'm careful. As I mentioned I'm with 5th graders that have too many emotions and changing bodies. I can communicate with them one on one pretty well. So as I talked to her I was very careful with not only what I said but how I said it. We have this display table that's sometimes put towards the front of the store but it has to be dragged out of the way when we shut the doors overnight. This table has to do with a big temporary exhibit we have in the museum (I'm in the gift shop). Well she takes it upon herself to put the table way inside the store where I know it shouldn't go. I would have told a normal person "what are you doing, the table stays at the front" but instead I asked if something happened to where the table was supposed to be inside now. She said that it was going to go inside now because it's annoying to have to move and the exhibit will be there for a while so it's dumb to have to move it all the time. I said that typically when we have these exhibits we have a table with books about it out there and it stays there for the whole exhibit. I was using a softer voice that wasn't accusatory at all. She snapped, and I mean snapped with the nastiest tone about how it's getting moved and if someone wants it changed they can move it back monday (when the typical staff is here) and for now it's staying. I'm sensitive to yelling and people snapping so I get all upset. I texted the manager how I'm sick of her attitude and how she treats me, tell him what happens and he said move the table back. It needs to go out there. He wants a 3 way convo about how me and her get along. That's tomorrow. I told him I was so careful to try not to step on her toes. She got frustrated pulling the table, I provided the absolute nicest opposition possible without any definitive statements or demanding her to act a certain way and she was so mean. Who knows what crap she says about me. She makes me out to be this awful person. After that she left for about 50 min, no doubt to meditate. On my side I just got a phenomenal performance review and a merit based raise. I don't like her but that's no reason we shouldn't be able to work together. I was not mean to her today but even before the store opened she attacked me. I'm still anxious from that. I spent the next 8 hours alone while the 3rd girl working stuck next to the crazy one. They both trained together so they're work besties. Tomorrow we are having a 3 way talk with the manager and I'm dreading it so much. What am I going to be criticized for? I feel like I'm going to be attacked for the entire thing even though I treat her with kid gloves and still get lashed out at. I set her off. She refuses to take meds and clearly her meditation isn't working well enough. I need to calm down before this talk. I don't want it to happen, I don't want to see her tomorrow. My heart rate is insane. I hate her. I hate what she does to me. I can't tell her what to do, I can't correct her, I basically can't talk to her or I get talked to about treating her poorly. I don't treat her even close to how everyone else is treated. Others don't bite my head off at even overly sensitized comments. I know in both the classroom and work I'm not perfect. Nobody is perfect. But I also don't feel like I'm terribly wrong or misguided. I try so hard not to push her buttons. I don't have to try to act any way with anyone else. I feel like I'm being beaten from every side and I just want to cry. It feels like there's no escape. Everything is going to keep piling up and get worse. TLDR treated like shit by 5th graders all week, treated worse than shit by a coworker all weekend, having problems coping.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Had my first experience having to leave the room and cry</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-24 02:00:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a student teacher for a particularly difficult class in a title 1 school. The kids are good when they want to be. Well, my mentor teacher was there in the morning then had a leadership meeting from 12-2. The kids have lunch at noon then recess till 1. The sub came around noon, an older (late 60's) guy who said he was retired. From teaching? I'm not sure. Anyway, my mentor teacher told me not to do any work, it's the sub's job since I've had a lot of problems already with subs being lazy and refusing to work because I'm there. He took them out for recess and they were monsters there. They get back inside and I immediately go into firm "sit down and be quiet" mode. After raising my voice initially I backed off and did the whole bit where you're quiet till they're quiet. It mostly worked but not completely. The kids would not stay quiet or on task. It took us over half an hour to do the first question on their science homework that we were reviewing and it should have taken a couple minutes, if that. The kids were so terrible during that half hour. Disrespectful, blaming me for a girl crying because I told her to stop talking, kids acting out more because they know they're already in trouble and they can't get in any more trouble. The sub should have intervened and of course done his job in the first place. I should have called the office for backup but I still don't know their extension. So I got angry enough that I did the dramatic thing and stormed out, with the intention of simply showing them the level they'd gotten to and how bad they were. So I got outside, sat down, and started crying and it didn't stop. A couple people stopped by and of course all I had to say was "They're being that terrible" and they knew. It's known for being a rough group of kids. Finally the mentor teacher gets back. As she's walking up the hall she was kinda like what the hell are you doing on the floor but then she saw I was crying and she asked what happened and she was pissed. She got in there and let the kids have it. She got a kid to bring me my backpack and stuff from inside the room and she told me to go home early and that if she were me she wouldn't want to go back in and see the kids. It was so bad that she even said she hopes I come back at all. They said stuff like you're not a real teacher so I don't have to listen to you, you'll never make us be quiet, do what you want I don't care what you say, your going to make the whole class cry (one girl started crying because she was talking and I told her to stop and she didn't like that). A girl threw her stuff off her desk then when I asked her to pick it up she kicked it across the room. Complete disrespect all across the board and I had no help at all. They were, in just about every way, out of control. I have to go back tomorrow but I'm still on the verge of tears over how awful today was. I don't want to see them, I don't want to have to deal with them, but that's the job. I try to have a fresh slate for everyone every morning but I can't get past this overnight. Everyone has these stories. I know it's my first of many but I still need to be able to handle these kids. Anytime the teacher isn't there, even with a sub, they get out of control. She has talks with them about respect and making them feel bad and lecturing them but it doesn't stick, which seriously is the kids and not her. She's wonderful. Teacher of the year runner up every year (they won't give it to her again because she's already won it). I love her, I just don't love her students. One person can only take so much. I know it doesn't sound that bad from how I described it but I've had problems with them before and it was NOTHING like this. If you'd care to share your similar stories I'd love to hear them. I know I'm not alone but it does make me feel so powerless.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My CT asked if the kids made me cry when she was out. No, the counselor did.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-11 13:34:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my class, behaviorally, can be somewhat of a nightmare. I know there are worse classes out there but nobody I personally know has had one like this. My CT was out all this week because her mom passed away. And the kids knew this. They always treat me like crap, even with subs in the room. They see the disrespect towards me clearly. Everyone does. Well, apparently not everyone... While the kids were in specials I went to find the counselor so she could have a talk with them. This turned into a 33 minute bitch fest on both sides, hers and theirs, in the hall after specials. They were bad for me in the morning then bad for the specials teacher. Mind you, he got them at 9:30. This all happened that early in the day. So she's telling them how their behavior is unacceptable, it's been this way for years, it needs to change, they're in the 5th grade so they need to know how to act by now. Then kids raise their hands in the middle of her talking. And she answered them. Some of the kids flat out lied. "Miss Jibberjabbery called me a bad kid and said I'm in a group of bad kids so she said she'd never do anything but yell at me because I'm always bad no matter what." From the same one, "whenever I go up to her in class and I want to talk to her she says 'how are you supposed to get my attention' instead of sit down or whatever but she lets everyone else get up (not true. Recently I say that to everyone, even those that just call my name out when I'm walking around. I won't help them till they're in their seats with their hands up. I've gotten commended for doing that) and that she told me that she don't care about me or my problems and she says 'sit down, I will not hear from you. Your problems don't matter.'" (Real story, she hasn't gotten up to tell me her problems in weeks. But her problems are like my best friend is being mean to me, someone took someone else's pencil, stuff that doesn't matter. But I still listened *when there was time* and the only person I talk to is the new girl that is a train wreck and has so many problems with everyone in school, both with being bullied and bullying herself. She's only been in our class 2 weeks after being switched out from another 5th grade class for being too bad over there). She said how I only pick on her and tell her to be quiet in a nasty way (partially true. She's always taking, more than anyone else, sometimes just to herself. Please stop talking has no impact but I always start there and it turns into 'just stop talking!' pretty quickly. She gets called out for taking the most because she is talking the most). Another boy had the same sentiment about me only picking on him. Same thing, always talking. So the counselor IN FRONT OF THE KIDS keeps telling me how I need to be more fair and I need to work on being fair and I'm mean to students and I need to be more respectful. She said over and over how I need to learn to be more fair. She wouldn't hear my side, not once. She said if enough kids have the same story that they must be true and any side I have, untrue. When I got a chance I asked who I had to ask to be quiet just that morning. The work was supposed to be silent. 14 of 24 hands shot up. Yet I only pick on two kids. I check with other teachers, over 5th grade teachers, the pop in special ed teacher, every sub we have and they all say that those kids are full of crap and I'm completely right. Every single one said I don't call them out enough for the crap they pull. I'm all upset. And after that big talk they still wouldn't get quiet. This is with a strict sub in the room. He said he's never seen a class like this. At lunch I mention it to the other 5th grade teachers and before I'm even done talking one of them is on his phone calling the counselor for a 4 way meeting, me, the two teammates, and her. They know the kids were lying. They've seen what I do. Plus they say even if it was true you do not say what she said to me in front of the kids. I was so thankful that they were so active about setting her straight. I didn't expect anything further to happen but they wanted to make sure she knew that nothing in the class was my fault, or at least not what the kids said. She didn't answer so he texted her that we need a 4 way meeting. Later on she came down to our wing of the school and the 4 of us went out in the hall. The guy teacher spoke for me at first (and asked if it was ok and he wasn't overstepping and I nodded yes because I was still on the verge of crying. I had been crying in the hall earlier) and she listened to him. He's the kind of guy you always listen to and respect, even adults. The second teacher who is in the adjoining room said how she hears everything and that I'm right about all of that and I am fair. The class gets out of control and the school's methods of getting control don't work when I do them. Those kids are the ones talking the most. They do need to be told, as a class and as individuals, to be quiet. And I told her how I've been checking with multiple staff members about my actions. The other two teaches agreed. By the end the counselor felt bad and apologized a few times but nothing can truly make that up. During the kids she was watching them through the window and saw for herself that those kids didn't tell the truth. She went in there and told them that they were untruthful and mean to me and that the blame goes on them. She had a long little bitching to throw at them. I'm just so glad that next week is spring break. When I told my CT about the whole thing she was livid. She was upset with the counselor, kids, and teammates because she felt they overstepped a little but I kept telling her no not at all. They were there to defend me and say they've seen that the kids aren't telling the truth and also tell her how wrong she was to address the apparent issues with me the way she did. TLDR: kids threw me under the bus to the counselor saying I'm unfair, disrespectful, and call kids out for no reason. Counselor calls me out on it in front of the kids. Tell 5th grade teammates and they actively back me up and call her out on how she talked to me. Counselor learns the kids didn't tell the truth. Counselor turns it around on the kid but still, a little too late. I cried a bunch during the day, CT was pissed when she found out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know how to explain it but it's like I was (am) distant and can't snap out of it. Even driving I wasn't all the way there. I know, shouldn't have been driving. But being able to drive and pick up food without doing any work in the kitchen wad all I could do for nourishment. I didn't want to eat at all but I knew I had to. Still, it's like everything is cloudy and foggy and not much is going on in my brain besides it feeling kinda numb. I've had a lot of stress with my student teaching (5th grade) recently. Thursday the kids threw me under the bus to the counselor and the counselor pretty much bitched me out in front of the kids invalidating even more of what I say to them in the future. The teacher I'm with was out this past week so that's how it got to the point it was at. No control. They don't listen to me, they don't respect me, they don't care about my feelings. The other 5th grade teachers jumped to my side and stood up for me and eventually the counselor realized how wrong she was and that the kids were complete liars and I hadn't done a single thing wrong. A normal person would be upset by all of this. I think the only thing being crazy has made worse is that I can't shake it off like I should be able to. Maybe that and my boyfriend being a dumbass and going on a vacation during my spring break without me (he works full time so this is just a week he chose to take off, it's my only week off all semester) is too much stress and now that my stability (the boyfriend) isn't there it's too much. I hate being crazy. I hate that there's something so wrong with me and nothing I do can make it all better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Happy birthday to me I'm finally 23 The world would think I'm crazy If they knew I'm BP I have a history of crappy birthdays. But I think this one will be better! I'm getting over a mild psychotic swing and my boyfriend stopped fighting with me and he's working on making it up to me. I have a lousy schedule for my actual birthday with student teaching and meetings from 7:30-7:30 but then I'm grabbing the boyfriend for a nice but not fancy birthday dinner. Thursday we'll go out either swing dancing or two stepping since dancing is our thing. Friday stay in, bake my cake (Italian cream cake) since I haven't had a cake since I was probably 18, and Saturday go out to a nice Italian dinner and eat the cake at a table under some nice outside lights strung across an area by the restaurant. Here's to another year. If this week can go well hopefully the new year full of everything from college graduation to finding a full time job and setting up my very own classroom will go well. I'm so glad things are going well, even if it's just for right now. I deserve a good birthday and dammit I'm going to try to make this week go smoothly! I'm not going to drink or party, that's not really my thing anyway, so I don't feel like I'm missing out. Feeling like things could end up being ok is such a great change of pace. Just wanted to share a good time amidst all of the bad ones.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Got in trouble for not being able to keep my crying and emotions in check</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-03-25 11:51:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a student teacher for a rough class, but recently it feels like it's admin against me and I'm getting myself and other staff members in trouble who try to stand up and help me. So I got called into the principal's office and lectured for picking on a kid which nobody says is true but the parent. I defended myself which apparently is a bad thing. Yeah, I stated crying and got way too emotional but in my defence the allegations didn't seem fair. Yes the kid gets called out a lot because he talks a lot. But I have asked around to see if other staff think I need to change my actions and they said no. I did my part to check and see what I can improve on, not just with this but with the class as a whole to both principal and assistant principal. Principal called my college coordinator and now I'm on this action plan that I have to go through with or I won't graduate. One of the things is having lunch with the kids which sometimes I'm not emotionally stable enough to do. I got in trouble for being so defensive to the principal and for going to other staff members when my teacher was out for help. What I see the most here is that I couldn't find the help I needed and now it's like this extreme situation because things couldn't get under control weeks ago. So yeah, I'm crying a lot when this comes up and getting in trouble for that too because having an even demeanor is specifically mentioned in a lost of guidelines. Well, I can't do that but I need to. Everything turned into a shit show and I need to make it look like I can keep it together. Do I talk about my bipolar with my coordinator? She was told about it like a year ago through another teacher. But maybe I need to so we can see how to better handle tough situations. But she could also say that I'm not cut out for the job and not let me pass my student teaching. Now I wish I handed in my damn disability letter back at the beginning of the year.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-03 23:43:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm student teaching in a title 1 school and doing my two weeks of total teach. That's where I do all the plans and everything. Well, I'm also supplying the stuff for the rest of the grade which adds so much stress. I can make my own copies late and not care but they need everything together. And things have been tough at school aside from that. The principal and university got involved and now I just feel so overwhelmed like I can't handle a real job and I'm failing at everything. There's a private school that one of my college instructors has a connection with so if I asked her for a letter of recommendation I might get the job. It has teaching fellow position that sounds like it would flow into a lead teacher position if I wanted it in the future. It would be a way to work with kids and be in the classroom with less stress. And the health insurance is amazing and I'm not fully stable yet. At the same time I need to apply all over and can't put all my eggs in one basket and it needs to pay ok. What do you think of not going for the full job right away? It could be me being anxious and unstable making me say this. So idk and I don't have anyone I'm comfortable talking with in person. I feel like such a failure. My room is a disaster and despite having over a month's worth of socks and underwear I can't find almost any of it. I can never find an outfit for school. My clothes are mostly too big because I lost weight. I feel like everyone is saying awful things about me in regards to my attempts at teaching. As a bipolar person I'm trying to hold it together and make it to the next day in mostly one piece. As a student teacher everything is falling apart and I'm struggling to keep all the pieces together at all. But I can't explain that to anyone. Or maybe I should. Or maybe it's better for everyone to see me as incompetent than know the truth. This whole thing just sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Student teaching, rough 5th grade title 1 class, blah blah blah. Posted here way too many times before and I know it's gotten old. Disregarding everything else for right now we have this one boy that's awful. Insubordinate, gets kicked out of everything for bad behavior, sent home from school a few times, straight up out of control sometimes (most of the time) when it's just me in the room. Today he crossed the line, even for him. Yeah he was up out of his seat and dropping a beat banging his hands and pencils on his desk but nothing will stop that. Verbal commands mean nothing from me. Well one of the times when he was out of his seat he came up to me, clenched fists, eyes rolled back in his head, shaking going "I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna KILL you. I'm gonna kill you." He was 'joking.' I told him that it was incredibly disrespectful and you never ever joke about that. And he continued to growl and say I'm gonna kill you and eventually break that, return to being whatever about everything, and went to go walk around more and distract people. Teacher and vice principal know, he'll miss the 5th grade dance and get a call home from admin. Again. I don't feel like I'm in any danger or unsafe but I still feel like there could be more that could be done about this. Someone told me to call the cops since it was a threat, even if he can play it off as joking, but that seems rather rash. How do y'all think I should handle this? Should I drop it? I'm not planning on bringing it up again but people are telling me I should take action.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-04-16 14:22:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>This happened Wednesday. The kid is very often out of control so this was in line with his normal disrespect and insubordination, just using different words, those words being "I'm gonna kill you" with clenched fists over and over. I handled it calmly and kept going. It didn't stand out from all of the other stuff he was pulling. I told the AP at the end of the day and he said he'd call dad. Thursday nothing had happened so after school I talked to the principal. She told me to go with my cooperating teacher (I'm a student teacher) and write up an incident report and that she and the AP would figure out a punishment for first thing in the morning since it was too late to suspend him. At the end of Friday the principal had forgotten about it and I had to remind her. When I asked what the progress was she said the AP is working on it and that's it. My university coordinator is in on this. I contacted her that afternoon so she could give me guidance and step in if needed. The incident is in the system but I'm pretty sure the kid is going to get away with a death threat that he said over and over. He wasn't serious but that's not an excuse. He's an extreme behavior problem. Absolutely insubordinate. What else can I or my university do? Is there anything the school can do to the kid at this point? Edit: this is in a 5th grade classroom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My current boyfriend and I started off as friends that became dance partners when I took a dance class and that led to dating. We haven't been dancing much at all, especially in the past year. Whenever Thursday night rolls around (both swing dancing and country dancing are available on Thursdays) it would flip to being kinda bad or we'd want to stay in or forgot or any number of excuses. But tonight we went. It was so much fun. Things started to flip and get bad but I stayed inside with the loud music and staying with all of that stimulation helped to bring me back and make things feel ok again. It's never worked like that before but tonight I had a genuinely good night for the first time I can remember. I forgot what it felt like. The past two weeks have been so stressful and intense that I'm surprised I had it in me to keep it together. I hope I'll remember what this feeling is the next time I get down, which will inevitably be soon since my meds are wrong and I'm still searching for a pdoc. I love all y'all and the support you give one another. Amidst all of the awful seemingly hopeless times we can get that occasional gem that brings us back to who we are. It took me months and months to get there for a night but I made it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in Austin, TX. I don't specifically want to teach in Austin but I would like some of the suburbs. I've gotten interest from districts around Houston and closer to Galveston (the coast) which pay much better but are far away from the place I'm familiar with. I do have a boyfriend that I would stop seeing if I moved. I tried long distance before when that boy moved away and it didn't work in the end. So giving that up would be tough. The distance between the schools interested in me and Austin are about 4 hours of driving, 200ish miles. I told myself that I wouldn't let my relationship hold me back but I get too upset when I think about leaving everything I know here. I'm from out of state and have no family in Texas.

I happened to take a 5th year. But I am not '16. Why did I take the extra year? Why did I change my major? The real reason? Because I got so depressed I almost killed myself. I fell so far behind in my major sequence in one semester that my choices were to either change my major or drop out. I'm alive right now. I was alive for my college graduation. That alone is enough to make me really emotional. I did fight back tears during my ceremony due to that thought alone. I can say that I took an extra year for changing my major. I can tell the world that it was because I found a passion in teaching and knew that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. But almost nobody knows that it's really because I was so suicidal it's amazing I made it out the other side. By calling me a 2016 graduate it's in my face that I was suicidal. That I was so depressed I couldn't function. That it's amazing that I'm alive right now. I graduated college in 5 years. But I am not the class of 2016. I do not need that number as a constant reminder of the absolute hell I went through. And he doesn't understand that and this is the only place I can open up about that. I graduated from a great school. I signed for my job and found an awesome apartment before my actual graduation ceremony. I am so fortunate for everything I've accomplished. But I am not class of 2016. I doubt this will make sense to anyone. Maybe it's another irrational crazy thing.</TEXT>

He swears I interrupt him, I swear he interrupts me at every turn. It doesn't last too long before I start getting way too upset and just say stop. That means stop arguing, drop it, I can't do it, I'm about to have serious anxiety problems or some sort of breakdown. He takes this as me not being able to accept that I'm wrong (admission of guilt) or that I simply don't want to hear him out. That's not exactly it. I can't handle even my side. Well, that happened yesterday. He was talking in circles about something I said as a statement, not a conversation and he misunderstood what was behind what I said and now we're really upset with each other and he won't let it go till I apologize. He showed up at my place in a bad mood because he ran late, which was fine with me. I tried calming him down but he wouldn't. We get in the car, the argument starts, he won't stop, I yelled at him first. Then he yelled back. I'm not at all upset that he yelled back since I did it first. Am I happy that it happened? No, but it's hypocritical if I hold that against him. I've told him countless times that stop means I'm getting too upset and we need to stop.

    <TEXT>I had a head injury in high school that led to chronic migraines. They got better when I entered college but they were still there here and there. For those of you that don't know, meds for epilepsy are commonly used to prevent migraines. I'd been on Lamictal for two years and didn't think much of it. It made me dumb and lessened the severity of the swings but they never went away. I don't have access to a pdoc and I got too lazy to call my primary care doc (who HATES refilling my Lamictal and Wellbutrin) so I simply stopped my Lamictal. No bad side effects. Now, a couple weeks later, I noticed I'm getting mild migraines starting almost every day. Looks like the Lamictal was helping my migraines! So I found an old bottle of 150mg pills and my pill cutter, cut them in 4, and I'll titrate up again. Hopefully it won't be as hellish as it was the first time. I'm moving in a few weeks to an area that has pdocs that take my insurance so I'll get under their care asap, I just can't right now.</TEXT>

I officially start all my training next week but I've already had to do a few things. What I'm going through now is almost definitely being triggered by stress. I haven't unpacked a box in two days. I just can't bring myself to do it. So my place is a disaster, but at least the mess is all in boxes. The other teachers I'm immediately working with all have their classroom supplies and themes picked out. I have a couple things but not much and they look at me like "you need to get on that" but I can't get to my room till next week to even see it then I only have like two days to set it up right before school starts. Nobody has been inside yet, they're still working on the construction. The school is brand spankin' new. My mind is telling me I'm not going to be able to set up my room in time and my kids will see that I can't get my shit together. My apartment is just overwhelming to set up. I don't have all my furniture assembled yet, I don't have a couch or coffee table yet, my downstairs neighbors already put in a noise complaint about me for putting together furniture from 8:30-9 one night (quiet hours start at 10)... My boyfriend is coming next weekend to visit me and he'll make sure stuff gets done, but until then I feel so worthless. The other teachers have done so much prep work and they're giving it all to me but I just sit there not knowing what's going on. What if they start seeing me as incompetent soon? I can't handle this. My apartment isn't put together, my classroom isn't even started yet. School starts in two and a half weeks. I just...can't handle it all. I'm so stressed I feel physically sick.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>First year teacher, tips for setting up classroom?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-06 21:52:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>My school is still under construction but I do get to see it for half a day on Monday. Everyone I've talked to is a veteran teacher so they at least have their supplies from their previous schools. I have...well, boxes for supplies for 6 tables and 6 3'ish high drawer towers, one for each table. And some stuff for my desk, but that's about it. I may or may not have had my first meltdown already just thinking about it all. What supplies should I try to get this weekend? I don't know how much border I'll need. I got 10 packs of markers and some pencils but I don't know what other supplies to have for the kids and what the school will give me. I don't know what decorations are suitable and how full my room should be at the start of the year because of anchor charts later on. I'm doing 5th grade science. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm still trying to get my mind wrapped around everything. Oh, and I only have the two days before the kids get there to set up my entire room since I have training nonstop for two weeks before that. Fun! *cries*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-08-09 04:47:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I moved cities recently. I tried for over a year in my last place and couldn't find a pdoc. The new city has more options and I'll be getting new insurance through my job. The plan doesn't cover as much of the costs but the network is much larger. I was looking through doctors in my area that take my old insurance and I found one a mile away, right next to my grocery store. He looked great! And he was accepting new patients! I called up and was told that the earliest I could get in is late September. Hey, better than nothing, so I said sure. Then the receptionist told me that he will only take new patients at 2 or 2:30, 3 at the latest. Here's the thing. I'm starting a job as a first year teacher. I can't get off for that. So the receptionist said that they will not take me and all but hung up on me. I even said how I've gone over a year without a pdoc. Didn't care. Next closest pdoc is 16 miles away from my apartment, which is 25 miles from where I work. *sigh* in a few weeks I'll have new insurance and a new world of pdocs to pick from. One day I'll get a psychiatrist and a desperately needed med change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After some searches I think I might actually have a hoarding problem. I keep napkins from restaurants and old receipts. I don't throw away old clothes, but then again I haven't grown since middle school so I don't outgrow stuff, I just don't like the style or fit anymore. I have expired food but won't get rid of it because I swear it's still fine, but I'm not going to end up eating it because I simply don't eat meals like a normal person or like I should. I rarely have to take trash out. I just moved and had so much more stuff than I thought. Those helping me saw it as a lot of trash and threw away a lot of things (what they threw away I still don't know). My place is always cluttered and messy. I didn't grow up in a neat house and when I get depressed everything gets so much worse. Does anyone else have a problem with clutter and messes at least? How do you work on it?</TEXT>

The student is medicated with very supportive parents from what I was told. I'm bipolar myself, and knowing there's another one in the room is oddly comforting and gives me strength. If I can make it to this point they can make it through 5th grade with some support in one piece. I already get to be there for a student and understand their needs like nobody else can.

    <TITLE>Tips for first ever day of teaching?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-24 00:39:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought I was fine. Everything was going to be easy. Then it was finally the day before the first day of school, which is today, and I started freaking out. I'm not worried about the kids liking me. That'll happen. I'm 5th grade science, by the way. 4 classes of kids with absolutely no prep time between classes. What if I give them the wrong info? What if they don't listen to me when I try redirecting? What about seating? I haven't made a seating chart. I don't have the roster for 2 of my 4 classes. I was thinking of directing kids to tables 1-7 as I greet them at the door (hi! I'm Ms subject932! Please find a seat at table 3." This eliminates some of the intimidating "sit anywhere" phrase. Thursday I'll find a different way to seat them, maybe alphabetical, then Friday a third way so they don't fall into a seating routine just yet. Monday I'm going to go full on with following through with the incentive routine we have (it'll be explained this week) and having a system for seating. Is it bad of me to treat these three days this week as a cushion to learn the ropes and get everyone's feet wet then set the routine in stone on Monday? I will be firm and set my expectations from the start. It's things like seating and the timing getting to lunch and specials and dismissal that I'm the most nervous about. Sorry for the rambling. There's some things college and student teaching simply can't prepare you for or! It doesn't help that I have an IEP that nobody knows how to meet (district curriculum specialist is going to work with me) and my homeroom has the most behavior and RTI kids of any of the 8 homerooms. And I have two sped kids that shouldn't be with me but might show up. They haven't told me yet. And getting supplies handed in and labeled and sorted will be a hassle. I'm already unable to eat from the stress and I'm not going to get much sleep tonight. I might make cookies to get my mind off stuff.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tips for keeping up with IEP accommodations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-28 21:23:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I only have one student in four of my classes that needs accommodations. He gets every accommodation checked all the way down the list but I can't get access to any data on him. He can answer questions when I talk to him just fine but he takes a long time to write. His IEP calls for adjusted learning objectives, large print, extra time to write, test questions read aloud. He has an aide with him in the class and I have a paraprofessional who literally does nothing. I'm a first year teacher. I know in the end all responsibility is on me but what can I expect the aide and the para to cover? How can I give one student extra time to write in a class of 26? Do I have to retype everything I give out? All worksheets are given to me in hard copy, I don't have any virtual copies so I would literally be retyping everything. Obviously I'll do whatever is best, I just don't know how to go about it and I'm having a hard time remembering to make accommodations for one student and figuring out the original lessons and everything else at one time. That's not an excuse, I know. Any tips for working with IEPs like that? I talked to our district curriculum specialist for my grade/subject and they said that giving altered tests really isn't an option since it's preparing for the state test and every learning objective has to be covered so those accommodations aren't reasonable for me to address.</TEXT>

Tbh I'm still learning my kids and don't know which one she is besides she's a good kid and quiet. I responded giving her a shorter amount of time than my planning actually is, asked if she wants to meet her other teachers too, and referenced a handout that went home about our open house where they'll meet all of us. What should I talk about in a meeting like that? Other than saying she seems to be doing well, should I ask how she feels about the class? I don't know the girl yet! I'm already pushing up against the infamous first breakdown and I'm worried that any interaction would push it too much. We've had a rough week with the kids and had a kid make suicidal comments and I got a student with autism who is setting off my behavior kids...

    <TITLE>It's the third week of school and I finally had the infamous new teacher breakdown</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-09-08 02:11:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>What brought it on? A few things. I'm already getting worn by kids that won't do their work. Today I had an entire class give me a hard time and fail to write a sentence with a sentence stem that was supposed to be yesterday's closing. I'm 5th grade science, by the way. I have a behavior girl that's sped without accommodations or paperwork. She is on a first grade reading level. We were reading a short little list of things and she was dying to read. So eventually I called on her and she refused to read. The district has no opt-out. So I got in a very unfortunate power struggle and ended up marking it on her behavior chart. She's also one of my two RTI behavior kids in that class. So she's off with the behavior coach for the rest of the week. Now they're on my case for trying to make her read. Apparently she feels unwelcomed in my class, when I pick her about half the time she volunteers to pass something out (kids fight over it) which is more than most others. We have a paraprofessional in the room who should be working with her but the para does nothing at all. She stands on the side after getting there an hour into a 90 min class. My autistic kid had a very rough morning so I had to send him off to a room where they could work with him. My classes won't shut up. They're quieter for me than the other teachers and for the most part they're relatively good but too many are inattentive. I know that's on me as a teacher but literally all of their teachers have problems with it so it's not just me. It's so much at one time and it's just been the same crap every day. Kids won't follow the directions in lab so I gave them textbooks after they screwed up, and I'm talking straight up ruined my setup for the rest of the day or started throwing pencils around and almost hitting people. I kept them out for 5-10 min then let them go back. I had a boy burn himself doing a lab and not following directions at all. It was completely his fault for not following safety guidelines but it still happened and I had to call home. Mom didn't care, she was like "ok, bye" but it still bugs me that it happened. I'm still worried about it for some reason. Sorry for the rant. I feel like I have no solid support at my school, which is also my fault for not reaching out enough, but everyone is so busy I feel like they don't have time for my little problems. And now tomorrow I have to talk with the girl that was insubordinate about how I should have handled it better and how we are both going to move on. Oh, and my principal told me not to go to a mandatory training so now the district is going to get on her case about that and I'll have to awkwardly go to a makeup one later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You just might not know it yet. I'm a brand new teacher and bp2. So far, in the past 3 weeks, I've had two suicidal students and one that has major adjustment issues with bad thoughts of being hopeless and pointless. I teach 5th grade. The third student, the one with adjustment issues, crawled under a table one day and I had to get down there with her. She asked why she even existed. She told me how I'd be better off without her and I wouldn't miss her if she was gone. Guys, this girl is 10. I felt that way in college. Now that I have my own class I see my purpose. So far most of the kids love me. One of them wrote on their homework that they think I'm awesome. I touched at least a couple of lives. I helped three students who are having a very rough time. The kids are more open with me than other adults. I wonder if they can sense that I can truly understand anything they go through. You have a purpose. I was as hopeless as hopeless could be for a very long time and now I see that there is a reason why I'm still here. Your reason is out there too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got diagnosed in college and saw a pdoc at my school. I basically picked my own meds and doses to a large extent. Went a year and a half without a pdoc because I couldn't find one. Finally got one and idk if it's going how it's supposed to. I'm type 2. I have problems with depression and anxiety after the drugs do their thing to lessen the severity. I also worry about memory and cognition. My new pdoc doesn't listen to me about the memory stuff and blames the depression when I know for a fact it's because my Lamictal is too high. I'm also on Wellbutrin. He threw Zoloft at me and I had awful introductory side effects which he was indifferent to. I lost weight from not being able to eat and started having suicidal thoughts. His response was to just eat. Not tips for controlling the nausea or throwing up, he just told me to eat more and that was that. He ignored the suicidal part. Then he prescribed haldol, haloperidol, whatever and told me it was for anxiety. It's a first gen antipsychotic. I'm not psychotic and he didn't even give me options or talk about it, he just threw that at me. I don't feel like he listens to me. It feels like he's just throwing meds at me left and right instead of trying to limit the number of drugs. I haven't taken the haldol yet but theoretically I went from two drugs to four in a week. Sorry for the rant. I don't have anyone to talk to this stuff about and I don't know how the relationship with my pdoc should look.

    <DATE>2016-12-24 02:35:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yes, for some patients it's because they're finally lifted out of the depression enough to act on their previous feelings. That isn't always the case. Not all antidepressants or mood stabilizers are as likely to cause these thoughts. Why do some antidepressants have a risk of suicidal ideation and not others? Edit - looking for answers other than patients finally having the motivation to do it. That isn't always the case. I'm bipolar on mood stabilizers and one antidepressant and I wasn't suicidal but had mild to moderate depression, added an SSRI and started having suicidal thoughts for the first time in a few years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Posted about how dangerously suicidal zoloft made me. It was awful over the weekend. I had to be restrained by my boyfriend and send him home with some of my knives. I felt out of control. No withdrawal, or at least not yet. But now on just Lamictal and Wellbutrin I'm back to being constantly moderately depressed and moderately to severely anxious, paranoid, and irrational. At first I thought anything would be better than being that suicidal. Now I wish I had that back because I felt more normal than I had in years aside from feeling like I needed to be locked up. Did anyone ever have suicidal thoughts as a side effect go away? I'm not under doctor supervision which I know is bad but he's a jackass that ignores the suicidal thoughts and tells me they're not a big deal. Fuck this. I don't know what the lesser of two evils is. I think I'm going to take my zoloft again...but then I'll be suicidal....but....ugh....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First year teacher. My principal and mentor know, I told them about a month and a half ago. Just got off Zoloft after an awful reaction to it and even worse withdrawals. Principal recommended I tell my team about overall what I'm going through so they can understand my struggles. The other teachers had a shocked look (hard to hide) and said things to the effect of why didn't you tell us sooner then pretty much ignored the fact that I said it. I feel kinda judged and like they aren't sympathetic at all. They thought I hated them because they took me taking time to myself personally. I told them it was never about them, it's about me working on being stable. I don't think anything in our relationship will change in a positive way. I feel like they're going to keep hating me and nothing I do will matter because I'll always be the person that doesn't have their shit together. At least my mentor and principal are still good about it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Getting started on abilify</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-20 02:26:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got started on abilify a couple days ago and I don't have too many side effects yet. I'm on half a 5mg pill for 5 days then 5mg after that. Currently on day 4, haven't bumped up the dose yet. I have increased appetite, weight gain and major bloating, which has to be water weight since it's 6 lbs, trouble sleeping through the night, feeling a little restless, muscle weakness and muscles getting tired/sore easily. Really dizzy when I wake up but it goes away as I'm getting ready for the day. Nothing is that bad. With almost all other drugs I've tried the side effects were there from the first or second pill, and by now I'd definitely see major side effects. How long might it take for abilify side effects to show? What were your experiences on abilify? Also on Lamictal and Wellbutrin</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-02-26 20:40:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's not like I have awful side effects right now but I feel like Neville Longbottom with his remembrall. I know I forget stuff but I can still function, so it's not the worst I've had. Went grocery shopping today and forgot I picked up oranges until I found them at the bottom of the cart. They said abilify wouldn't give me anymore cognative deficits. They were wrong. There's still a little humor in comparing myself to Neville. Hey, he gets super hot by the 7th movie. The abilify isn't enough. SSRI's made me go completely nuts. Can't add more anticonvulsants because of memory stuff. Already on Wellbutrin. Lithium apparently doesn't help much with depression and I don't have enough self control to be able to keep my diet, water intake, sodium levels, eating habits, or anything else stable enough to be on it plus the side effects sound bad and cognative defecits. I'm a teacher and my kids are starting to notice my memory problems. Repeating the same phrases a lot, forgetting words, and this is nothing yet. I'm sick of doctors telling me that I don't have memory problems from the drugs, it's just because I'm depressed. I know it's from the drugs. I know it for a fact. They don't believe me or listen to me. I tell them I'm having suicidal thoughts and they brush over it because I'm high functioning. Fuck being high functioning. I'm still sick. I have nobody to talk to about this. My boyfriend is a little depressed and I don't want to add to it. Parents don't get it. I was telling my principal and another teacher at school because I trust them but I still feel awful for unloading on them when I was psychotic from the zoloft and should have been hospitalized. I can't go put this on them too. Plus this is nothing compared to what I was going through. What the hell and I supposed to try next. I can't have side effects and school. I can't go back to just the mood stabilizer because then I'm too unstable. Just tried two pdocs and they both suck. One ignored suicidal thoughts and told me lithium was for depression and lamictal for mania. The other told me Wellbutrin is the worst thing I can be on (ha) and he wants me to go off of it, even though I said it's what made me functional. He told me he'll never refill my ativan because he's anti benzos. I almost never use it, only a few times a year, but when I need it I need it. He says no. I have no history of drug use or abuse. They both tell me the lamictal isn't causing any memory loss. Yes, it is. I've known this for two years. I'm depressed and I feel crazy because the pdocs treat me like I'm crazy. I need a new one but it'll be another month or two until I'm off the 6th month waiting list at a new place. Part of me wants to quit meds, quit my job, and stay in bed forever. I want a combo that fucking works. I want to be treated like I'm competent. I'm sure nobody will read this far and if you do I'm sorry for wasting your time. There are two words that can describe how i feel...defeated and helpless.</TEXT>

I've never told anyone in person I was severely depressed as I was that depressed, I've only texted it to people. I don't want to say it out loud. I don't know how to say it.

    <TITLE>"Those" (suicidal) thoughts are back</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-11 04:16:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I guess it's been almost 3 years since being diagnosed and started on meds. In that time...rarely thought of suicide. NEVER thought of self harm...until zoloft a couple months ago. Quit that cold turkey. Nasty withdrawal. Went to the pdoc yesterday and started thinking about where I wanted to cut and how I wanted to kill myself. In the waiting room. He finally called in and I wanted to tell him how suddenly depressed I got and he didn't give me a chance. He didn't take it seriously. He told me to keep on the same track, raising my trileptal, which is what I was already working on. I fully believe the trileptal is what's giving me the harmful thoughts. It's like I was told my depression isn't guaranteed to get better anytime soon and there's nothing I can do to change that. My birthday is in a week and a half. 24. Maybe that's the day. I would have made it to 24. I would have made it just shy of 3 years before my symptoms showed up and I got diagnosed and medicated. Maybe that's the day. There's stories of over the counter sleeping pills and alcohol doing the trick. I've never been this close to a plan before. I'm not manic like last time. I'm super depressed. I don't think I'll act on it right now but I don't like how far the thoughts are getting. I had to stop myself from stopping at the store after work to get first aid supplies and razor blades. Maybe my 24th birthday is the day. I didn't quit yet. But being told there's no sure way my depression will get stabilized since I can't take antidepressants sucks. Going into a psychiatrist's office actively suicidal and not being able to talk about it sucks. Hurting myself sounds like a good release. Killing myself makes a lot of sense. I don't want to keep dealing with this awful mental illness. What the fuck did I do to deserve this? TLDR suicidal. Maybe rx related. Maybe my birthday in week and a half will be the day.</TEXT>

I'm really really bad in the morning but especially at night, much higher functioning during the day but still not great. Psychiatrist wouldn't listen to me when I tried telling him.

    <TEXT>All I want is for everyone at school to remember and wish me happy birthday. From my 115 kids to the other teachers, I want the same recognition everyone else got on their birthdays. I want a cake or cookie cake or brownies or whatever from my teaching team. They always get stuff for each other. So far everyone has gotten a treat on their birthday. I want to be included in that but I'm afraid I'll be forgotten. I told myself a little over a week ago when I was having some ugly thoughts of taking a couple bottles of pills that I won't do it before my birthday. I told myself I won't have the papers say "she was almost 24." I wanted to have that accomplishment of being 24. Please don't let those thoughts and feelings come back. Please let it be a good day. Please don't let me go by the wayside again. I'm always forgotten or disregarded on my birthday. I want this one to be different. I want to be like everyone else. I hope that's not too much to ask. Thank you all for being here for me through the good times and the bad. You're my strongest supporters. Thank you. Update: nobody knew it was my birthday until they checked Facebook a few hours into the school day but after that everyone was super great about it. Even if they forgot at first they still tried after they knew so I'll take it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-23 10:52:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Going to try to keep it short Lamictal, wellbutrin for almost 3 years Found a pdoc after a long search in the winter. Tried zoloft, sent me into mixed or manic state, suicidal, self harmed, it was ugly. Quit cold turkey without a doctor. Before the crazy I felt genuinely normal on zoloft. Abilify, made me shaky, nothing for mood, quit without a problem. Trileptal, been on it for a month or so. Getting really suicidal. First time I had a solid plan and started typing up notes and set a timeframe for it. It's good I had a spring break trip last week and my birthday yesterday or I would have done it before the trip. Couldn't mess up the room reservations or do it right before my birthday. I had to at least make it to the next year instead of almost making it there. Trip was a good distraction but now the low side is starting to come back and I know it'll get ugly. I think I might have to come off the trileptal. Raising Lamictal or wellbutrin isn't an option because of side effects. Pdoc said after trileptal there isn't anything to try anytime soon. I told him I was suicidal on the zoloft and almost had to go inpatient. He blew me off and didn't even write it down. He kept forgetting I wasn't on it anymore. I need ideas or things to suggest since he has nothing to offer. I'm sick of being severely depressed and suicidal on and off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I need the depression to get better. Other recent attempts at meds made me suicidal or feeling completely sick. I'm so sensitive to side effects. Now it's time to try adding lithium to my lamictal and wellbutrin. He's starting me at 300mg and says add a pill every 3 days till I hit 900mg. No blood tests. He said it should make me nauseous but that's it, nothing else. Does it help depression? Give memory problems? What was it like for you? Is 900 the kind of dose that needs blood tests? What's considered a low/high dose for lithium? My pdoc doesn't tell me shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for another lithium post. I know it's about blood levels and not actual doses but I started off at 300mg, a little thirstier than normal, slight headache, no other side effects. Woke up throwing up this morning but it was probably over some nasty anxiety. Upped it to 600mg a couple hours ago and I'm so thirsty! No amount of water helps. Anyway, got nauseous yesterday after taking it. I guess a brownie and a glass of milk isn't enough to take it with then like I said threw up this morning. Feeling nauseous tonight. What was your nausea like? Just that night? Night and the following morning? All the time? Gotta be on my feet all day tomorrow and I can't take breaks easily to go hang out with my head over a toilet if I'm feeling really lousy. It's a big day and I can't miss school.

    <TEXT>Worthless pdoc said no blood tests. Yes, I found a new one finally but the appointment isn't until May. Today I was SUPER nauseous. I could smell every little tiny thing. In a room full of 10/11 year olds that's basically the worst thing ever. I tried to go home but they couldn't find a sub. Even sips of water were too much. Got a massive headache in the middle of the night last night. I took 3 Tylenol and eventually it helped. Somewhat unsteady/dizzy today. Hands were shaky on and off. Tired. I haven't been this nauseous the entire time I've been on lithium which is like 2 weeks. Normally I wake up, throw up, and I'm good. I'm on 900mg. No idea what my blood levels are because I was told no blood tests. What do you think, possibly toxicity? How I feel doesn't match how I've felt before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long story short two teachers in my block of 4 treat me like shit sometimes. I'm a first year teacher, I'm sure that's why they think they can get away with it. One has snapped at me, questioned my judgement, or argued with what I said in front of entire classes before. Yesterday it was 3 classes during dismissal when I said make sure everyone is in line, which is the expectation and we tell them that all the time. She didn't like it. The other teacher shoved her hand in my face and told me something to the effect of not to talk to her in front of a class. She told me again later in different words not to talk to her when we passed each other in the teacher's lounge and I tried to say something. The second one will take kids out of my class or out of line to/from lunch to talk to them about their bad behavior then if I mention it refuse to tell me what it was about saying it's none of my business. This week was especially bad and I have no idea why. I haven't talked about them, I haven't said anything about their classes besides that all of my classes have been acting up, which isn't unusual. It's a difficult bunch for everyone. I guess I should say we switch classes so we see each other's kids. 5th grade, not that it should matter. I'm so incredibly upset feeling like they're going behind my back for things and talking about me. I'm sure the principal already knows their side. I'm so close to texting her to say I want to be on a different team next year and leaving it at that. Admin cares about me a lot. Some of the 6th grade teachers look out for me. But now I'm not even comfortable eating in the lounge with my grade level and I'm the only one not there sometimes. I need some advice.</TEXT>

I lowered my dose when I got to what I'm pretty sure was toxic and now I'm slowly bringing it back up to 900 mg which was the original prescription. 900 gives me an upset stomach, I've been so tired all week, and so many headaches. I don't know if lithium is going to end up working out. I don't know what meds to ask for next. Already on Lamictal and Wellbutrin, already tried quite a handful of others on top of that with no luck. I feel defeated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been on here plenty saying how my kids are difficult. That's especially true now but this story is about other teachers. There are 4 of us that make up a pod. We share the same kids. Two of them are bitches, one tries to stay out of it. We're a new campus so none of us knew each other before this year. It's my first year and they've each done 5-8ish years. The two bitches have yelled at me in front of our kids, one put her hand in my face and told me to stop talking to her. The hand in the face one told all of her homeroom to go straight to her if I send them to the office, not to go to the office. Shit hit the fan this week after the two bitches, mainly the second one, went to the principal to complain about how I was writing little notes to parents in agendas which we all do. Principal told both of them to mind their own business and stop trying to run my classroom. The next day they did more stuff which the principal found out about and she was pissed. She called all four of us into a meeting mainly to lecture the one but also other one that's yelled at me. Principal kept saying how they don't support me and they need to stop messing with me and about how I'm a first year teacher and they need to remember that and accept that none of us are perfect and they can't judge anyone else for what they do. She was so amazing. I'm still blown away. I never talked to her about this or asked for it but she saw those two for what they are. Now admin keeps comforting me (I'm still upset) and saying I'm doing a great job. TLDR two teachers were mega bitches to me (first year), principal saw it, had enough, and pulled us all together to lecture them and stand up for me without me even bringing it to her attention.

    <TEXT>Some of what's been going on in the past couple weeks Recent med change trying to fix depression. Not stabilized yet. My "normal" was becoming mild to moderate depression. It's been 3 years since my symptoms started. I was bummed about that. Went out dancing, which is a hobby, got sexually harassed at what used to feel like a safe place. Bitch teammates fucked with me so bad the principal saw it and got involved and bitched them out. This part did the biggest number on me. Right now I'm really depressed, blaming myself for the mistreatment, thinking about how I've been treated like shit my entire life. Tomorrow I'm going to chat with the principal about how things are going as a followup, which she asked for last week. She knows all about my bipolar. I figure I should tell her that I'm depressed now and I think it's more than just getting over what happened in a day or two. Idk what to tell her or how to explain it. And if I get distracted I'm relatively ok then if something little happens I'm almost crying and shut down. I don't know how to talk about it if I look ok at that moment. I'm sure the principal will understand the triggered thing but I don't think either of us will know how to help it going forward.

    <TEXT>5th. They're mentally checked out. I cannot get two of my four classes under control ever and one is iffy. One is awesome. Yelling doesn't work so I try not to as much. Sending them to the office doesn't work, calling home doesn't work, writing in their planners doesn't work. This week I've tried the strategy of waiting until they're quiet. One class took 37 min. The second was still going between almost quiet and screaming at each other for 45 min. At that point we had to leave for lunch. After lunch they were only quiet because there was another adult in the room. When she left they got loud again. I cannot get them under control. I've done conduct marks. I've done commending the tables and people and sometimes even parts of the room that are doing great. I've done starting each class saying how I believe we can have a great day. Nothing. Admin talked to one of the classes earlier this week after I left almost crying and switched with another teacher so I taught her class. Very little change in behavior. I don't know what to do. They won't listen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know many bipolar people. Those that I do know of are people's moms, aunts, or siblings. Most of them are violent and beat the people I know. None of them were med compliant. I'm med compliant, I don't get manic, mostly depressed and withdrawn around those I'm not perfectly comfortable around. I'm not violent in any way. I don't blame others for my mental illness. I don't fit the bipolar image. It popped up 3 years ago so I haven't had it long and I've been treated since I noticed it. I graduated from college, I'm a teacher, I have a boyfriend. I appear normal. I don't appear sick. I'm bipolar but I feel like I don't fit the mold everyone else is familiar with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of my classes of 5th graders could not get under control. Out of their seats, talking, yelling, having an attitude like I can't tell them what to do so they do whatever they want anyway. We never even got class started. It lasted over 20 min. I texted my principal saying I needed help and she found someone to come in. The other teacher saw them still awful but so much better than they were before. The kids had a short assembly in the middle of class so I stepped out. Principal hugged me and asked how she could help. I stayed out for the rest of their time with me and returned for the next class. I cried the whole time I was out. The classes after that were pretty bad too. Why are they so awful sometimes?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>5th graders. One girl started feeling suicidal and talking about it in the past couple weeks. Today she wasn't doing her project and I got on her case. At the end of class I got her alone (we've had talks before so there's a relationship) and I started by telling her I know what she's going through because I've been there. I didn't describe anything. I said I was a little older than her the first time and it's happened a few times and I'm still here. I said how she's strong because even if it sucks she's getting through it. She felt alone, like she's the only one with those thoughts, and I gave her a connection and the idea that a future that looks normal is totally possible. She has no idea about my mental illness. Just that I've been through some stuff. What she doesn't know is that at one point this year I almost slit my wrists, another time I made a plan to OD on sleeping pills, last night cutting my wrists for no reason sounded fun. But I got to use my pain to help someone else. And it made me reevaluate my own suicidal intents that pop up. Makes me a lot more grounded. You got this. If I can do it I know you can too. It means you're strong too. We got this.</TEXT>

She's wonderful and so supportive of bipolar so she is a great person and it makes me hate this perceived disappointment even more. I'm getting super depressed and suicidal. I woke up from a nap yesterday depressed. I was fine before. I have something uncontrollable incurable. I am on meds, missed a few days last week but I'm back on them but I hate them because I hate the physical feeling of taking lithium. It makes me gag and feels weird. The mood swings are going to keep happening and it isn't fair. What did I do to make me so sick. Why does this have to happen to me. I feel so helpless and it all feels hopeless. I hate this. I don't know how to cope. I don't have any short term commitments to keep me on track. I don't have to leave my apartment or see anyone if I don't want to. Or shower. Or change my clothes.

    <TEXT>I'm bipolar myself but high functioning. His cousin who I never met and he had little contact with killed herself after she got out of jail, where she unsuccessfully tried to kill herself. I see this in a pretty matter of fact way. She wasn't properly medicated, from the stories I'm guessing type 1, she had nothing but financial trouble and stealing and screwing over her dad who is the only one there for her. No support system. Lived in rural southeastern US which means conservative and not open minded. I told him how it isn't the most unexpected and there's nothing anybody could have done so don't doubt himself. 50% attempt, 20% succeed. It isn't always the most preventable. He had a hard time hearing all of that. I wanted to show him it wasn't anyone's fault. I don't know how to comfort him. It's tough when it's what I have and I'm so desensitized to the reality of the illness.</TEXT>

The moderator was a sub so idk what it's normally like. She posed some basic questions, someone would talk, then she'd ask another person how they can relate to that or what they have to add or a new question, just depends. It was helpful to feel connected to someone else and totally understand what they went through. I think I'll go back and see what it's like next week. It was a little over an hour long. I searched here and /r/bipolarreddit for experiences with support groups and didn't find much in terms of what it's actually like so I wanted to share some details. Oh also one of the people hadn't been there in a few months and popped back in like it was whatever. They were very welcoming of me being new. It wasn't scary being there at all even though I was ridiculously nervous on my way there.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-06-10 00:42:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Are you ok can have a different meaning depending on who it's coming from. There's a huge gray area when it comes to answering that question. They could be wondering if you're feeling a little down. They could be asking if you're having a really rough time. They could be asking if you're in control. They could be asking if you're going to hurt yourself. If I say no then to me that means I need help and I can't get by. If I'm depressed I'm not at rock bottom. I'm not inclined to say that I'm not ok because I can still get by, even if it's struggling. Please don't ask me if I'm ok. It's too vague, in that I can usually get by with saying yes and moving on. Next time please ask something more specific. How is your mood today? Are you feeling anxious? Do you feel in control? If you're asking if I'm ok there's probably something about me that's making you question that. Don't be afraid to address it. "You look a little down. Are you feeling upset?" Would be great. It's much harder to evade that than asking a general are you ok. Right now I'm depressed. I'm a little anxious. I'm irritable. I have passing thoughts of hurting myself. But if you asked me if I'm ok I'd say yes because things are still under control. Am I actually ok? No. And other questioning would determine that quite easily. Sometimes we're also not in tune with how we're doing. I might not realize how depressed I am or realize I'm hypo unless someone tells me. In those cases asking are you ok would absolutely fail. Or maybe that's just me and I'm wrong about everything I think...</TEXT>

Then they did great on their standardized test. My scores beat the district average by a decent margin. Even if my kids didn't like me I still did enough things right that they left me knowing middle school science. Next year I can focus on building relationships but I can see that my actual teaching must be pretty decent. I finally feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm so pumped for year 2 now.</TEXT>

I want to change my flight. Last night I got home late after being out with a friend to my dad venting about how my mom uses him as a whipping boy and he's a crutch to her and how she either can't or won't do anything for herself and he went on and on. That hit me pretty hard. One, don't rant to a parent about your kid. I have a much better relationship with mom than dad. Two, I need a high level of support from my significant other so his talking like that makes me feel so worthless. I didn't argue with him, I pretty much just nodded and said mhmm and yup. I'm supposed to be here for 2 more weeks but I'm already feeling unstable. If I mention moving my flight (which wouldn't cost anything) there would be so much drama and so much fighting. Now I remember why I really moved so far away. I hate that they triggered something so ugly so fast.</TEXT>

My problems are depression, anxiety, I have a stressful job, live alone, problems with interpersonal relationship and I don't have many friends. Do I just go for therapy in general or focus on dbt? There's only one that does dbt around me and it's a guy. I think I want a girl. How do I approach the first appointment? I don't know what I want out of it, I just feel like it's something I should start doing. How do I know what to talk about in each appointment? I don't want to just bitch about whatever's going on. That doesn't sound productive. And anything else you can think of that comes to mind when you think of therapy. I'm nervous about trying it and knowing how to get started.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zoloft made me nuts. Wellbutrin is good but I can't raise the dose without getting too stimulated and anxious. Lithium I didn't like. Too fickle. No blood tests from my pdoc. Trileptal made me depressed and suicidal. Abilify and haloperidol did nothing for depression. I'm thinking of going back to my shitty old pdoc because it's so easy to get appointments with him and takes two months with my prospective pdoc. I think I want to try latuda next. I'm pretty confident that that's what I want. Wondering what drugs worked for others that I could consider. My old pdoc is bad at educating me and giving options. That's how I ended up manic on Zoloft and he said to stick it out...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grandfather will pass away probably tonight or tomorrow. It was sudden... within about two weeks. I want to take ativan to calm me down. Even if I am calm I want to take it. It isn't doing anything. I want to take more and more until I feel it. Maybe I'll take 225 Lamixtal instead of 150 so my memory gets fucked. My pdoc is halfway across the country. I'm on a trip to see my family. I'm physically with him and my aunts, uncles, and cousins all day. Normal family drama comes out here and there but it's more at bay than I've ever seen it. Maybe I should get a bunch of sleeping pills and take a handful so I can fall asleep instead of laying awake</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My grandfather died over the weekend. We saw it coming. My mom and aunts are being so awful to each other and I'm caught in the middle listening to all of it. It's ugly. So here I am dealing with shit drama, losing someone I'm close to, and still stable. So glad my meds are fucking working. Mom has depression, one aunt constantly says she has ADD (what the hell does that have to do with anything), and that aunt and my other aunt are just bitches. Moving my flight up so I leave the day after the funeral instead of after the weekend. Let's hope I stay stable amidst triggers everywhere I look.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Awful at keeping it short. I'm normally halfway across the country. Moved far away for college to get away from a verbally and emotionally abusive father. Back for a few weeks over the summer. Grandfather passed away this past weekend so I'm glad I happened to be home to see him. Tensions are high between my mom and her sisters. Today my two bitch aunts who know like more than what I have and the fact that I'm on meds decided to have an intervention and tell me I need therapy and a diet change and vitamins and I shouldn't be on meds because they only make things work. I'm very pro western medicine. Tonight dad showed an old habit. He got frustrated at something small and started cursing up a storm, slamming things, stomping around... I'm very sensitive to that kind of stuff because I was faced with that all the time growing up. I want alone time. I want to be back in my own apartment. But tomorrow is the wake, Thursday the funeral, I fly back Friday after 4 long weeks. I keep getting really anxious and I'm slipping into depressed. I can't get an ativan refill from my new pdoc because he thinks I'm just seeking out drugs so I hate taking what I have even if I have about 20 pills left. One .5 mg pill doesn't do anything. I have absolutely no support right now. I have no kind words coming my way. My boyfriend is staying out of it and won't tell me how he feels about this whole thing and our schedules don't match up so we barely talk when I'm away like this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-26 08:09:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Another pdoc appointment today with my shitty pdoc, another time I left feeling hopeless. We're going to try depakote now. I asked for Latuda and he told me that it would be bad for me because I don't have psychosis and it doesn't help depression so it would do more harm than good. This from the man that told me no blood tests on lithium, stay on Zoloft and trileptal (separate times) after I said I was so suicidal I thought about going inpatient. He said after depakote we're pretty much out of options because he doesn't know how to treat the depression. Why keep fighting. Why. It's never going to go away. Sure, meds might make it better but in the end it's chronic. It'll never end. It'll always be a worry. There will always be more suffering. What's the point when I'm always going to revert back to being miserable. I don't want to reach out to the people that were my support system during the school year. We're teachers. They're enjoying the time off with their families. I see it on Facebook. I bring others down. I cause fights that shouldn't happen. I feel like a burden if I bring it up to anyone so I haven't aside from this. I even feel awful bugging you guys again. I'm always posting and it feels like everyone should be sick of it and annoyed by it... and here's just another time to add to all of those. I've never cut but I want to. I know I won't. A handful of sleeping pills sounds nice. Not enough to kill me but enough to knock me out for a while so I don't have to deal with all of this for a while. I just don't see the point in fighting a losing battle. I'm running low on treatment options.</TEXT>

Made me more depressed Lexapro - new to diagnosis at the time, less than a week from extreme dizziness Haldol - like two weeks because there was no reason for it. Did nothing Abilify - same time and reason as haldol I want to quit depakote after only a week. Cognitive side effects haven't gone away in my experience. 2 or 3 months on a higher dose of Lamictal and a year on a higher than I want proved that. Wellbutrin at a higher dose took a day or two to go down to the dose I was on Is a week too short for the depakote? My Lamictal dose wasn't lowered to compensate for the depakote.</TEXT>

I was depressed soon after starting (suicidal thoughts I lied about) but then at my support group I was depressed but talking crazy fast but I swear I do that when I'm anxious not just hypo. Crazy anxious for a couple days. Few days later I went to an event with some friends and I was energized and super motivated. That lasted all night. Then today I got crazy depressed again. Then super happy, insightful, felt awesome, then that slipped very quickly into depressed, helpless, and wanting to self harm which I've never seriously done. I dug my nail into my arm hard instead. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I don't have control over things. I have no appetite so I don't want to eat and I'm struggling to get anything down. This sucks. Pdoc is useless. He said I'm out of options after depakote which is crap. Screw all of this, it's not fair and I can tell it's gotten worse over the past year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was pretty stable but now hopelessness and why keep going when it's never going to go away type thoughts are peeping in. I don't know how bad the thoughts could get. I almost hospitalized myself on two different occasions last year for wanting to go through with it. I've talked a lot on here about how awful my pdoc was and I found a new one. She's much better. Prescribed latuda but the pharmacy is still trying to get with aetna to get it covered. She won't label my rescue kitty as an ESA even though she does help me SO MUCH. Pdoc doesn't believe in emotional support animals. $300 pet deposit and $20 a month on top of latuda costs is going to suck. And I have to get my sweet kitty her shots and get her fixed even though I'm the 3rd one to have her. I'm her forever home. I really want her labeled as an ESA but nobody will do it. Old pdoc said no well before this cat was in the picture and again after I got her. She cuddles, she's quiet, she doesn't scratch or bite, she's perfect. Calm, will let me pet her as long as I like. And I'm good so far at making sure she has lots of food and her litter box is cleaned twice a day. It makes me shower and eat. If she's doing it then I should too. That could be contributing to the stress, and it being the start of the school year. Going into my second year of teaching. Kids come back next week. I'm going to be a hot mess when the kids get here and suicidal thoughts ain't fun for nobody.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The new school year is getting ready to start. I'm a second year teacher now. Last week we started our training and next week kids come. My depression was triggered by a new pdoc pressuring me to talk about old suicidal thoughts in detail and had me go through all failed drugs and why. It's gotten worse since Tuesday. My constant anxiety is through the roof. I can barely eat, sleeping is hard, and it's even feeling hard to breathe. I'm frazzled. I can't organize ideas. It's bad. My face looks anxious. I'm on Lamictal and wellbutrin and I'm supposed to start Latuda but the pdoc won't authorize it because she simply is awful at communicating. I can't find my ativan and nobody will write me more. How do you handle constant anxiety? Any anxiety I had over the summer was nothing compared to this. Like drugs feel like the only way with how bad this is. I can't tolerate ssri's. Benzos aren't a long term solution. I can't function properly right now and I don't know how to break the cycle. It's only going to get worse as the year gets going</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Old pdoc was negligent at best. He was awful. Terrible combos, didn't listen, demeaning, but he was all I could find after I graduated college and moved to a different city. Next one was also demeaning and seemed a little incompetent. He didn't want to work with my current regimen. Didn't go back a second time. Spent a while with Dr. Negligent because he was the best I could do although very unsafe. High dose of lithium without blood test unsafe. Suicidal on Zoloft and told me to keep going on it unsafe despite almost hospitalizing myself. Found a new person last week and I liked her. Hate the practice. I've been trying to get my new Latuda rx for a week. Insurance wants prior authorization, the practice won't answer their phones or return a call. It goes to a call center and they won't get back to me. I'm trying so hard and can't get my prescription. A week is ridiculous. Insurance and pharmacy are both waiting on the doctor, I've talked to both and they're being nice but their hands are tied until the doctor gives them a call. So that won't work. School started this week so as a teacher it's hard to do initial appointments because they're usually during the day. I talked to my principal today and she told me to go to the first available appointment and they'd get someone to cover my class. So this Friday morning I'm seeing someone at a practice I've been waiting almost a year to get into. Can I just say, how amazing is my principal? She goes out of her way to help me. She really looks out for me. Sorry for all the ranting I've done on here about my old pdoc and always posting about my problems. Thank you all for helping me to see how bad he was. Hopefully the new one later this week works out and I can finally try Latuda!</TEXT>

If I was a college student my accommodations would be flexible attendance, extra time to complete assignments, extended time on tests, testing in a different location, copy of class notes. I don't see teachers getting accommodations. I don't see how my workload could be lessened. Reminders is the only realistic thing I can think of. My principal is awesome and she knows about the TBI but we haven't talked about what that will look like. Maybe it'll be fine by the 11th (when we get back after Hurricane Harvey cleanup), maybe it won't. This isn't my first concussion and the last one took years to heal so I have good reason to be concerned.

    <DATE>2017-09-10 15:30:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Got a concussion last weekend and the chronic migraines are setting in. Got a head injury in 2009 that went pretty much the same way except I was in high school and it was easy to slack off. Now I'm a teacher and also bipolar so I'm on an anticonvulsant (lamictal) for that along with two other meds. I can't handle any sort of antidepressant or it makes me go into a nasty mixed manic episode. I have to worry how any drug will affect my mood and how it'll interact with the other meds since it's such a sensitive balance. We tried like 8 or 9 different preventative meds in high school. I don't remember all of them but I do know amitriptyline was the best but it kept wearing off and made me suicidal. Topamax made me straight up couldn't talk in full sentences stupid. Propranolol made my blood pressure so low I passed out. Zoloft didn't do anything but make me suicidal. I don't remember the others I just know nothing worked and we gave up. About 2 years later the headaches mostly went away. I went to the emergency room where they gave me something that was tylenol, caffeine, and something that starts with a b. It made my brain super numb but it only masked the pain, it didn't take it away. Went to urgent care and they gave me an NSAID which isn't that effective. Yesterday I took 2 extra strength acetaminophen and 2 ibuprofen and didn't get relief. Excedrin migraine makes me feel high and doesn't always take away the pain. It's a constant mild to moderate pain in and behind my eyes and at the base of my skull with ringing in my ears and light sensitivity. It isn't a typical migraine but that's what my former neurologists called it. I don't know what to do for quick relief. I've been really depressed and now having suicidal thoughts after the head injury and I don't want those thoughts to be there, but like the headache isn't not super severe so nobody will do anything about it.</TEXT>

I want to keep hurting myself but I feel like I'm going to have to work to stop later even if it sounds fine for now. I don't want to fight the urges, I want to roll with it. And I have nobody to talk about this with. Is it that slippery of a slope?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think latuda stopped working</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-16 18:03:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started 40 mg latuda on top of my other meds like a month ago and it was great but eventually I could tell I needed something stronger so we went to 60 mg. Yesterday it's like a switch flipped and I went from fine, personable, normal to depressed and hopeless. What the hell. I've been on the 60 for a little over a week and taken it with food. Idk maybe I'm just not used to having to raise the dose of drugs because they usually make me sick at starting doses. I love latuda, hate that it was $930 this month, but it's worth it. Sooner or later I'll hit my out of pocket max and it'll be free. God I hope it'll keep working and doesn't keep fizzling off a week after each dose increase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I teach 5th and 6th. This scenario is from one of my 6th grade classes. These two girls have a-t-t-i-t-u-d-e-s. They'll both openly say how dumb they think something is or how they don't want to do it. Others pick up on this. Then I have a boy that was retained. He's capable but chooses not to do the work. He asks why and refuses to do work. So this is all going on and it takes away a lot of the positive energy and I have to fight to get them excited and it isn't working. Talks don't work. Notes home don't work. I don't have their info in the computer yet so I can't easily call home. Past teachers said there's no point in calling besides documentation. I don't know how to tackle the middle school too cool for school slump. I'm taking away their next lab for sure after they bombed the one today. One class didn't even get to it because they didn't get their notebooks set up for it. I need tips. I'm getting a relationship with the attitude girls but they think that makes us buddies. The perks of being young and shorter than them.... no amount of stern talking makes them stop.</TEXT>

I don't know if it's normal to hate it after your first session but I was having a surprisingly good day until I saw her. Now fuck everything.

I wonder if this means raise the latuda again or give it more time. I wonder if this twisted logic means I need an antipsychotic. I wonder if giving up trying to get better is an acceptable option. Just two days ago I was going on about how I don't have as many bad days and the lows aren't as low, then this happens. I crash. It won't last but a few days but those few days are enough to fuck me up. I want to die. I don't want to kill myself yet but I want the release of hurting myself and I want to be dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suicidal mentions. Was doing fine on Latuda then I crashed and now I'm suicidal. Still on the Latuda and lamictal and wellbutrin. Maybe I need a higher dose. Maybe it isn't the drug for me and it isn't potent enough. Then what will be right. I'm stuck in the loop of hopelessness with what's the point when I'll never be cured. What's the point when I'll always need med adjustments. What's the point when I'll always go back to miserable at one point or another. It's never going to stop. Yeah it'll become more manageable and it may become less severe but it won't go away. I shouldn't have to cope with it. I have the meds to go through with it and it wouldn't be painful. I texted a crisis line last night and it was worthless. I was told I need a therapist and I'm strong. Yeah, ok, doesn't help my loop of eternal negativity. The therapist I tried didn't have much to say about it besides that I'd have to keep dealing with it and I didn't have a choice not to. That doesn't help change my thought pattern. So I'm waiting on a new therapist who seems amazing but she's expensive and doesn't like my insurance. Giving into the thoughts still feels rational. I hate this. Does it sound like a med adjustment would fix it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm bipolar. I'm on meds for it. I'm still working on finding the right meds. I thought we had it but then I crashed. I'm stuck in an infinite negative loop. I can't be cured. It's not a temporary problem. The depression, the irrational thoughts will always come back. Why not end it? Why keep going when I'm going to keep having the same problem over and over? Treatment may make me more stable. It may make things not as severe. But it won't take away the bad completely. I'll always need med adjustments. I'll never truly be stable or normal. I saw a therapist who basically told me that I'm right but I'd have to learn to deal with the thoughts. I texted the crisis line 741-741 (just type the word start and they set you up with someone to text) and they told me I'm strong and all that but couldn't turn my thoughts around. I want help. I need help. It's almost two weeks until I can see my psychiatrist for a med adjustment and in the meantime I'm a teacher... I have to look normal. I have to function on a high level. I have a way to kill myself that wouldn't be painful and would do the trick. I'm fighting the urges. I don't think I'd do it today but the thoughts are there and I hate it.

My reason for not doing it isn't that I'd regret it. It isn't that others would be sad. It's that others would feel guilty they didn't see it coming or guilty they didn't stop it. A few people know about my very deep struggles and I know they'd always ask themselves what else they could have done or why they didn't see it this time. They care about me so much, I couldn't leave them with that guilt and uncertainty. Thought I'd share my reason. There have been times where this wouldn't have stopped me but for some reason it's helping me know that suicide isn't an option, even if my stupid head is telling me that's what it wants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like my pdoc a lot. We've only been together about a month and a half. We haven't had any real med changes, just raising my latuda. I love latuda but it wears off after a few weeks. I'm afraid we're going to have to dive into antipsychotics and I'm scared of them. I hear horror stories of weight gain and being foggy and sleeping all the time. I'm not psychotic. I'm depressed and anxious. I'm type 2. I'm on Latuda, Lamictal, wellbutrin, ativan as needed. I've tried lithium, trileptal, Zoloft, lexapro, haldol, abilify, depakote. Abilify and depakote didn't get long chances. I switched pdocs right after starting each and the new ones told me not to take them. I can't have brain fog. I just can't. I can't be sleeping all the time or a zombie in the morning. I'm a teacher. I need to be close to 100% at 7 every day. I want to mentally prepare myself. I want to know what I may be told in the appointment. What med options might be thrown at me? Seroquel and abilify? What are they like? I've heard seroquel a lot from pdocs wanting to try it. I've heard bad things on here about it so it didn't feel worth trying. Especially since I don't have problems with mania. I'm scared of the unknown. I'm scared of how sick I'm going to be in a few days from whatever meds happen. I know I shouldn't be but I'm on the verge of crying and I hate this. I hate how awful it's going to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By rapid cycling I mean multiple times a day. I saw my pdoc yesterday and he said lower my latuda and wait it out. We can't raise my lamictal because of memory problems but that did come up. I posted on here about possibly going inpatient and since I was doing better we left it up in the air. We discussed it and he said he wasn't going to tell me to go but he wasn't going to discourage me either. He said if it got bad again to go for sure. He took away my remaining refill for the meds I was going to use to kill myself. Apparently he can cancel all non-essential drugs. So even if I have the thoughts I have no way to do it. I don't know how to keep handling the rapid cycling besides rolling with it and curling up in a ball on the couch for most of the day. I'm not alone tonight and I see why that's important now. Keeps me more tied to reality. They let me ball up in my soft blanket and stay on the couch without bugging me which was perfect. The suicidal thoughts are back but like I said I have no way of acting on them. I'm not in danger. I don't know if I should still consider inpatient since I'm not in danger and the thoughts go when my mood switches. It's only there sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn't depressed. I just had the random drive to do it. I usually tell a certain person when I get the thoughts but I didn't say anything. I would have mentioned that we needed to cancel our weekend plans but nothing more. She hopefully would have asked why and it would have come out. I fell asleep on the couch before I could go out and get the pills I needed. I woke up fine like it never happened. But yeah, I almost killed myself last night.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2017 was brutal</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-01 06:26:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>All of my recent med changes were on 2017. Zoloft made me mixed and totally insane, I got lithium poisoning, akathisia from abilify, suicidal from trileptal, suicidal on latuda, depakote didn't work out, haldol wasn't right, too much wellbutrin made me unstable. It's been an almost nonstop joyride. I almost hospitalized myself a few times. I've never been before so it's a big deal. I legitimately almost killed myself on 3 occasions. I dabbled in self harm. I had a very rough year. Professionally I didn't get along with my old teaching team and they turned our kids against me. Principal got involved and was on my side, it was ugly. So I finished my first year of teaching and now my second year is going much better but the end of that first year was miserable. 2017 was not my friend. I saw an idea on Facebook to put a note in a jar each week that has one good thing that happened that week on each note then at the end of the year look at all of the great things that happened. I love that idea. Here's to hoping everyone has a better 2018. It can't be worse than 2017, that's for sure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came close to overdosing. I wanted to. I could picture it. I reached out to my top person and told them it was either take a sleeping pill to fall asleep and get away from the thoughts or overdose so... sleep won. I told her I'd send her my address and let her know if I did go to overdose. Closest I've come to an attempt. Going to an emergency room crossed my mind, and I know that's what I'm supposed to do, but I went to sleep instead and it was much better in the morning. That was two nights ago. Yesterday felt like borrowed time. Today should feel more normal. I'm going to give the pills to my person to hold onto. I really almost had my first attempt...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I should go. I know I should go. I started Celexa, an SSRI, and I'm pretty sure that's what's causing my suicidal thoughts. Yes, I'm also on a mood stabilizer. Anyway, I seriously considered overdosing. I almost did it. Gave someone my pills to keep myself safe. Once they were gone the idea of hanging myself came into play. Well, last night I practiced how I would hang myself. That brought me to a whole new level of not ok. I should be hospitalized. I know that. But I can't make myself go. I feel rational. I don't feel out of control. I don't feel like I've hit the last straw.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Upset stomach on lithium</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-06 10:49:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just started extended release lithium and I'm getting an upset stomach. The reason that worries me is because we tried regular lithium carbonate last year and I couldn't tolerate it, partly because of a painfully upset stomach to where I couldn't eat or drink anything, partly because of lithium toxicity because my pdoc said no blood tests. Anyway, the nausea last time got worse over time so that's my concern here. I take it with food since I need to eat with my Latuda. The upset stomach lasts well over 12 hours. It's still there when I wake up in the morning...and this is only on 300mg. I'm assuming it'll only get worse from here. Is there any hope the upset stomach will get better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't been on here much recently so I'm missing my bipolar connectedness. My therapist doesn't get me, my psychiatrist doesn't get me, the people I'm closest to don't get me. Nobody gets me. I'm so upset. I can't put my finger on what "it" is but nobody gets it. I'm on 5 drugs and I'll never be any less medicated. If I'm not stable now how can we take drugs away. I'm suicidal on and off, mostly on, so we tried haldol to get rid of those thoughts and it's working some but it's leaving me so tired. It feels so awful needing a strong antipsychotic when I'm not psychotic. I'm type 2. My real problem is depression. My pdoc thought I was borderline so he asked me all of those questions today but he was wrong. I knew he would be. 3 of 9 markers, you need 5 markers to get classified BPD. I'm not that. So he doesn't get me. My therapist (new) has an attitude that if I change my attitude the thoughts will go away. Both of them are like oh if you distract yourself then the thoughts won't be there. They're acting like it's easy. I feel so alone. Help me not feel alone. This wouldn't be a problem if I killed myself when I wanted to.</TEXT>

My boyfriend says my face just looks sad and I get quiet and that's how he can tell. I just want to hear if this is normal or not.

I've tried 20 drugs. Current combo 150 lamictal 150 wellbutrin 80 latuda 20 cymbalta (new) .5 ativan as needed I can't go higher on the first 3. I've tried lithium, trileptal, depakote, Zoloft, Prozac, haldol, abilify, celexa, lexapro, effexor, among others. I've tried so much. Nothing gets rid of the suicidal thoughts long term. Nothing keeps the depression gone. I wish I was dead.</TEXT>

I'm suffering so much. Last weekend my rapid cycling was so bad I had over 20 moods in the same day last Sunday. I don't have control over this. I've tried 20 meds, I'm currently on a combo of 4, and clearly that's not enough. I've been trying hard with this whole med change thing for a year and a half. There's been some luck, like latuda, but it's not enough to fix things. Maybe I should stop trying, quit my job, go off all my meds, and end up homeless. Who cares. I can't do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I swear it's once or twice a week I'm suicidal these days and in between I'm not. Recently started lithium so hopefully that will help. It's tough because as I discovered with my therapist, depressed is what's comfortable for me and anything else is uncomfortable. When I got suicidal earlier it was so so so comfortable. It was familiar. I got the details of my plan figured out, down to communication after the fact. I have all but one thing to make a med interaction happen. It's what I want right now and I feel like it's going to happen in the next month after school gets out. My principal is my main support person. We text about it and she talks me down and talks me through things and tells me to call a hotline when I need it. She checks on me. Today she asked in person after my performance review what else she can do to support me. She wants to help but I don't know what to tell her. I mean really have her answer more like she used to. She hasn't been responding half as much recently but it may be on purpose, may be because she's busy, but I feel too selfish saying something about that. She's talking to me at all. Yes, I need to talk to her more, like we used to, but I feel bad saying that. I feel bad taking up her time. She checked on me on days where I hadn't texted her and I said I liked that. I said I like how she will tell me to stop and refocus me and talk me down and say it like it is. She said she's not perfect and wants to know what else she can do. I went through some risky self harm last week and now with the on and off suicidal thoughts I think I have her worried and she wants to make sure she's done everything she can to make sure that doesn't happen. She's had me hang out with her a few times when things were bad. She came to my therapist to see how she could best support me. She cares and I don't know what to tell her about how she can help. I am a little worried I'll kill myself and it'll hurt her and she won't get over it. She says she wouldn't get over it. I say she would, she says she wouldn't, and I usually give up. She's an amazing person.</TEXT>

I'm going to call the suicide hotline later (I had good luck the two times I've called) but I don't know what to do if that doesn't work. I don't want to go inpatient because I'll be fine in a couple days. This is so hard. I'm worrying myself. Maybe I'll get away with risky self harm instead but that didn't work last time. I want to overdose. I want to kill myself. I want to be dead. Maybe I'll be too depressed to try. I bet I'll be too depressed. I feel so empty and awful and low. So, so low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today was our last day of school. Yesterday and today my 5th graders (I teach 5th and 6th) were off the walls insane. Running, pushing each other, saying mean things, making weird noises, making fun of each other, yelling, talking, going directly against what I said. Today add splashing water everywhere and throwing marbles (we did one of those activities where you get Styrofoam cups, foil, tape, and straws and you have to build a boat that holds the most marbles) and my room wad a DISASTER. Some of the kids in one of my classes came in at the end of the day to say bye and a bunch yelled "we won't miss you." We had yearbook signing with all of 5th grade and only one kid asked me to sign their yearbook out of my 40ish. I have another 40ish 6th graders, some of which got me to sign theirs at the end of the day. But the behavior was so awful, they didn't want me signing their yearbooks, they even said they won't miss me... I'm legitimately sad and tbh thinking of overdosing on something. At least there's a rational reason. I don't feel loved and I can't see anything changing that anytime soon.</TEXT>

I guess my perception is skewed because I'm telling myself people don't care enough because they're not trying to talk me down from things like they used to. I took a baby step towards killing myself, taking a little action, expecting a response, and all I got was people saying they're worried. Nobody tried to prevent it or tried to make sure I was safe after. They care but in my twisted mind it doesn't feel like it. I want attention from those in my life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you think something is off with someone reach out to them. They very well may not have the power to reach out to you. Reaching out is incredibly difficult and as thoughtful as it is for others to post about being there if someone needs to talk, those posts may not make anyone any more likely to get help. They've never made me feel any more cared for, even in the times where I've needed that extra help and support. Hi, I'm one of those people that needs that extra level of help. I'm being treated for a mental illness. I have a support system and I appreciate the hell out of them. I have to work hard to maintain a job and relationships. Most people have no idea what it takes, but let me tell you, it's no cakewalk. Something I never thought I'd open up about. A few months ago I went to get inpatient treatment because I almost killed myself. I reached out to my support system and one or two others, but it was hard. Going inpatient is still one of the toughest decisions I've made. It wasn't easy. Honestly, it was scary. But once I got there it was fine. I went in, I got more stable, but when I got out the thoughts came back again. Just because someone gets treatment doesn't mean they're better for good. The biggest piece of advice I have is to check in with the person in a funk and keep checking in. Make sure they know you're really there. Even if they don't want to talk, try again later. Even if they do talk, try again later. Don't stop being there.</TEXT>

Not the healthiest since it's fruit loops, but it could be worse. During the week eating isn't as much of an issue. I eat two granola bars in the morning, a modest lunch, and something not too big for supper. Being a teacher makes it easier to avoid snacking. I'm so worried about gaining weight since I'm already 20 lbs more than I'd like to be and overweight for the first time in my life. I don't know how to make it so I don't balloon up. Exercise is not an option due to getting too dizzy after a head injury. I'm trying to keeping mind CICO but that's hard when I'm so hungry all the time. Help!</TEXT>

My principal says I'm doing a great job but I don't feel like I am. I just hit overweight and here I ate fast food because I was down and that's going to contribute to more weight gain because I was too lazy to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for supper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It feels like everything is wrong even though only a few minor things are wrong. That's what happens when my pdoc cuts my number of prescriptions in half. I was amazing on lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel xr, and latuda. But she wants me off latuda so I'm trying it but hot damn I miss latuda even though it's only been a couple days. My anxiety is nuts and little things are pissing me off. I hope at my appointment Friday she concedes and says latuda is ok. It was my wonderdrug.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My pdoc said don't take it with food. I asked a pharmacist and she said take it 3-4 hours after I eat it. I'm having problems getting to school on time, I was late 3 times this week and that's a HUGE problem as a teacher. I tried taking it as early as 8 and I overslept. I was taking it 2 hours after I ate. Recently I'm not able to fall asleep on it but I can't wake up in the morning. I don't get home till after 5 some days and that means not eating till after that. Or what about taking it before I eat? How much is recommended for that?</TEXT>

Be said no, then my place gets stuffy and smelly. I don't believe this to be true but whatever. So he said turn it on low. I said no, I hate the moving air, I want it off. He said on and that's a compromise. I said having it on at all is his way. So he talked down to me and threatened to leave and do the 3 hour drive home and get home at midnight. So he's sleeping on my daybed that has cat puke on it because I keep forgetting to wash the sheets. I honestly bet he'll be gone before I wake up in the morning. All because of the stupid fan. It's my apartment! If I want it off it should be off! I hate being cold. So now I'm upset because he was mean to me and stormed off. I hate being set off by little things...</TEXT>

And I gained 4 lbs in a week. I just upped my dose from 300-400mg xr. I've been on it for about 5 weeks. It's made me late to work about 6 times. I weigh more than I ever have and even the bigger clothes I just got are getting tight. Not fair. I feel like all I can do is stop eating. It doesn't make me insanely hungry and I stopped getting weird cravings so that's not the problem. I need to lose about 40 lbs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started seroquel about 5 weeks ago. It's helping a lot but I need more than just lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel. I need Latuda back. Pdoc says no two antipsychotics and she doesn't want to change things. On latuda and the others I'm stable. Better than I've been in years. Without it I'm irritable, angry, depressed, an all around mess. I'm taking a half dose of latuda with my other meds and it makes a pretty huge difference. My pdoc says absolutely no latuda. But you know what? Her way I'm unstable and it makes my job and communicating and relationships hard. With it I'm fine. So I'm going to keep taking half a dose and lie at my next appointment. I've been fighting for latuda and she says no every time. I think I know my body. She's a brand new resident who isn't sure of herself. The only way I can see me being stable and me getting her to say yes to latuda is for me to lie. I've seen others on both seroquel and latuda so it's not this huge no-no so I'm not worried about any bad effects. I just wish she'd see things my way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm doing pretty ok. I could use a seroquel increase but my combo of lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel xr, and latuda is going pretty damn well. Well enough for my therapist to push our appointments from every week to every other week. But there's a problem. My pdoc said absolutely no latuda. I wasn't ok on just lamictal, wellbutrin, seroquel. I begged her for a change of some sort and she said no. So I had to take action on my own, for my own sanity, safety, and for the sake of my job and students. I tried telling her I can't be "off" as a teacher and she didn't care. I'm worried about what she'll say when I tell her I've been on Latuda. I'm going to say that I didn't have any other choice since she wouldn't listen to me between appointments. I have this weird feeling like she's going to drop me since I won't listen to her. I've already told her that I feel like I'm not being heard, that was about a month and a half ago. She's a very inexperienced resident. I'm going to talk to the attending when he's in the room about my concerns about going too long (a full month) without a med adjustment when I KNOW within that time that I need one. I need more frequent appointments. I'm doing almost normal. Pretty stable, all things considered. But she won't like hearing I'm on latuda and may tell me to go off of it. Finding a new pdoc isn't an option. Very very few in my area take my insurance and I've already tried some of the others. The rest that take my insurance are too far. I like the office, I just don't like this doctor. I called and asked about switching and they said it had to go through my current doctor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She didn't want to change my meds at all. I know I need an adjustment. She said because I added latuda two weeks ago it's too soon to tell what it's doing to my mood and we "only" upped my seroquel dose a month ago so it's still soon to tell. My body says otherwise. I messaged her begging for a dose increase a couple weeks ago and that's when I said fuck it and added latuda. I couldn't do my job. I'm a teacher. Kinda important I can do my job. So today she didn't want to make a change, I fought her on it, then when she went to get the attending I started crying. Ugly crying. I told her I was at about 70% functioning and she said that's all I can expect and the best I'm going to get and she may not ever make more changes. I can't be with someone that doesn't listen to me when I say I need an adjustment. I know my body. I can't be with someone that doesn't believe I'll get any better than I am now. She said nobody gets better than 70-80% is crap, and I know that from y'all. It's not unreasonable to want to get to be like normal. Maybe not perfect but why not at least try to get there. Why not have close to perfect as a goal. I shouldn't have to have thoughts of hurting myself every couple weeks. I shouldn't have to get anxious every night. The new pdoc I'm going to try for is out of network which sucks but I've heard good things from more than one person. Probably worth it. We'll see.

My anxiety last night got so bad I felt like I was going to be sick. I couldn't breathe right. Controlled breathing did nothing. I didn't take ativan because I didn't want it to mess with me having a hard time waking up in the morning. I woke up just as anxious. That doesn't seem normal. Took ativan in the morning and it helped take the edge off. Now that it's night again I'm back to severely anxious and I'm having trouble coping. Taking all my seroquel would be a lethal dose and would stop all of this. I need it to stop. Waiting it out is miserable. It makes me want to die. I have no control over anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dropped Latuda 9 days ago. Pdoc has been demanding it for about two months and I finally gave in. Horrifically suicidal this weekend. Anxiety so bad I feel physically sick. No appetite (even on seroquel). Sleep is unaffected because seroquel. How long is this supposed to last? I didn't really taper, I did half a dose one day then cold turkey the next. That's what my pdoc wanted. I see a new pdoc November 21 that may decide latuda is ok again. Could latuda withdrawal be causing the intense suicidal thoughts? I haven't been this bad in a very long time. I'm debating if I should stick with it and stay off latuda or go back on it to be more stable. I know y'all aren't doctors and can't tell me what to do. My doctor says stay off of it but I don't feel like that's in my best interest. Anyone else have experience with latuda withdrawal?</TEXT>

She said I couldn't expect to get any better than 70% on drugs and therapy did the rest. She didn't want to keep adjusting my meds, she saw 70% functioning as good enough. She didn't want me to be on both seroquel and latuda even though dropping latuda was a disaster. She told me not to take ativan when I was anxious or it would make it worse. She didn't listen to me.

He doesn't like that I'm on both seroquel and latuda but he believes that he shouldn't go changing things up like crazy when he doesn't even know me and especially when it seems to be working. If it ain't broke don't fix it. He eventually wants to get me off of probably the seroquel but not yet. I see him again in about 5 weeks. I'm ok with this. He seems to want smooth transitions and cares about me being stable. I didn't mention everything I had wrong with my old pdoc, I just said we didn't get along and he accepted it. I did have to say why he was my 6th pdoc and explain the story of each. He was appalled at one of them and didn't seem to like the idea that at my last place I was getting a new resident every year. Not a very engaging first appointment but it was only $35. Say what?! That's not my insurance's copay. I don't have a copay, I have a high deductible. Old place it was around $100.

    <TEXT>Ok not all morons but enough of them. Today we took an open notes assessment (18 questions, call it a quiz, call it a test, it really doesn't matter). One of my kids wasn't in class but he's in the behavior program. So I called the behavior coach and asked if she had "Freddy." She said yes. I said Freddy needs to go on this program and take an open notes assessment. Well, after school she tells me she told him to use the internet for this. Instantly pissed. Kid got a 40something so it's not like he aced it so that helped the anger from boiling over. Tonight I sent her an email explaining why notes specifically and said please let me know before changing the directions I give. She has a large caseload but I still expect my work to be done as it was assigned. Went to a store after this all happened and picked up a few ceramic plates. Part of a Christmas present for someone. The cashier didn't wrap them at all and put them all in one giant plastic bag and handed it to me. Wrap them up! Somehow! I believe this store has wrapping stuff. Difficult parent that's a very long story but twists my words, blames me for not accepting the insanely (month or more) late assignments after today. Mom told her to miss specials to do the work at school. Not allowed. Mom got so mad when she heard I told the girl no. She did NO work last night. She didn't finish her classwork today. The missing papers? Additional copies I went way out of my way to make. Didn't do them. Told them I'll take it till the morning of the 24th and they have to scan it to me. No response yet. The girl is so damn lazy. So all of this at the same time. Lowering my seroquel currently. I feel like that has something to do with the irritability and sensitivity to people acting differently than I'd expect. Maybe my feelings are reasonable, maybe they're not. I don't know TLDR people doing things that piss me off. Overreaction? Justified? Reaction to lowering seroquel?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm nomally in Texas but now I'm back with my family on the east coast. Bad childhood memories are coming back. Being beaten for no good reason, brother trying to kill me. They've been fine so far but my boyfriend is driving me up the wall he's so frustrating (back in Texas, we're long distance) being stupid. And I'm dropping a med. Hopefully tomorrow will go well. I'm sure it will. But today is full of bad memories and the seasonal depression is getting to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got prescribed trazodone but I forgot it when I traveled. I'm asking for more to be sent to my current state but I don't have it for tonight. Last night was my first night without Seroquel. I took this all broken up but it ended up equalling 5 unisom pills, two doses of ativan, and two 15 mg temazepam pills. Didn't fall asleep till 4 am. It was awful. Any tips for tonight? Last night I did no tv, limited phone time. I'm all worked up from misplaced guilt and I feel sick to my stomach from it. I just want to sleep.</TEXT>

I haven't had a full meal in days. I feel awful. Please don't let this last much longer or please let me go back on seroquel. I'll deal with the weight gain if it means I feel ok.

    <TEXT>I finally made it back to my apartment so I finally have all my odds and ends of pills. Low and behold, right in my nightstand was 8 zofran tablets! I took one two hours ago and it's not working. I have trazodone for sleep and I've also tried temazepam. Need more than the minimum dose to get to sleep and even then it's just for a couple of hours. Not even consecutively if it's the trazodone. The temazepam works better. Seroquel withdrawal sucks. I've lost at 5-7 lbs in the two weeks I've been unable to eat properly. I feel awful. I can't believe zofran isn't working. I can't eat or drink. Last night I threw everything up. Tomorrow I go back to work (teacher) and I'm thankful we have the first day without kids. Principal is fully aware of everything. Even aware that the suicidal thoughts are coming back with how horrible and helpless I feel. Medication isn't fixing the withdrawal effects.</TEXT>

I've been sending him emails for a week and a half. I've sent three, the most recent being last night. No responses whatsoever. I'm crashing hard and I can't get help. My gp won't prescribe anything because it's seroquel related. Can't sleep, can't eat. Can't get help. I desperately need a med adjustment. He just took me off seroquel and left me with 3 drugs. I've been on just those three multiple times and it isn't enough. Seroquel is the only thing that made me stable. But he took me off of it. Tried 22 drugs, finally had a winning combo, and he changed it. He says no latuda and seroquel together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Texas, 6th grade science. I can't get my kids to work. I just can't. I can't get them to focus. Science so we do labs. To them, it means nonserious work. I get horrible answers on everything. I have tried simplifying things for them since getting back. Reteaching the unit from before break, the rock cycle. They learned one rock type in 5th, relearned it in 6th before break, heard it again after break, and here's what happened. Doing a reading where they're supposed to be following along. Paraphrasing. "Fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Ok, so, what type of rocks has fossils in them?" Answer #1 "igneous" answer #2 "igneous" answer #3 "metamorphic." I have never made it that simple. I have never given the answer then asked a question immediately after unless it was basically rhetorical. Today we did the reflection and conclusion for the lab and some answered maybe one question and it was incorrect. No motivation. Failing doesn't work. Contacting parents doesn't work. Giving packets of missing work doesn't work. Extra credit doesn't work. I'm meeting with my principal tomorrow to come up with idea. Y'all, I'm only on year 3. I'm too new for this. I'm bordering wanting to give up. They're going to fail no matter what I do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wrong meds. I need need need seroquel back. I was out of control before school. My principal is the most forgiving person ever, I was not nice to her about something that happened with a kid yesterday. I'm eating under 500 cal a day and that much only because of latuda. I'm finally almost sleeping ok. (Edit...not sleeping ok) My kids are already mostly failing. Seriously. I give them an answer then put it in question form and they can't answer it. I give them work and they don't do it. Forget sending something home, I get it back from less than half. Contacting parents does nothing. I feel like I have absolutely no worth. Like nothing I do matters. That I don't matter. Pdoc responded saying I need an appointment for med changes and I said ok any day preferably after 4 and no response whatsoever. I can't wait until February. My appointment is a month away. I need something now. I needed something two weeks ago. Almost wondering if I need to go inpatient to get the help I need. I don't have the time or the money for that. I feel so sick from everything. Physically sick. I'm dehydrated, I'm malnourished, I'm on the wrong meds. I have nothing going right. Therapy Monday can't come fast enough. Oh and I've lost 7-10 lbs in the past two or so weeks from not being able to eat. Not the way I wanted to lose weight. Edit the feeling like shit should be my seroquel withdrawal. Yay 600 mg to 0 in one week. Happened right before Christmas</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not self harm or hurting myself in any way. For side effects, for lack of a better term. Posted about helpless, hopeless, whatever the title was. Lost 7-10 lbs in two weeks, trouble sleeping, seroquel withdrawal. Can't get a hold of my pdoc and may have to wait until February for an appointment that I already have scheduled. I'm emotionally volatile. Angry at times, crying multiple times a day, going off on people. I can't handle all of that at once. My kids aren't working to an extreme and it feels like everything is wrong and I have no control over anything and I'm starting to cry just thinking about it. I'm malnourished and dehydrated. Yesterday ate maybe 300 cal since I threw up what was my latuda calories at night. Day before maybe 500. Day before probably 400. I can't eat. I can't drink. Not water, not ginger ale, not ensure or things along those lines. I can't. I need seroquel and in the meantime I need lots and lots of zofran or something. Is the hospital my only option at this point? Not a psych hospital, a regular hospital. Would they treat me or ship me to a psych hospital? I'm not at all having self harm or self injury thoughts and I've never had thoughts of hurting others (besides the kid I seriously wanted to slap for beyond horrible behavior and disrespect that would have resulted in me being beaten if it was me and my parents didn't hit) but I don't think that's what they're thinking of when they say thoughts of harming others. I feel out of options. I would do urgent care but I doubt that would help. Oh, on seroquel and before this like 3-4 weeks ago I was totally stable. More stable than I've been in five years. He took that away. Now I'm not stable at all in any way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Went to urgent care for my seroquel withdrawal and got told to go to the emergency room for a psych eval because I yelled at the doctor because she went from giving me 10 days of zofran to 2 for no good reason so I lost it. My GP already told me she wouldn't help and my pdoc is refusing to answer or help so I'm out of options, urgent care should have helped. I ended up getting it but not from that doctor. Emailed my pdoc which apparently goes to an answering service over the weekend and they told me go to a psych er because I said I'm having mood swings and I need care for my withdrawal symptoms and I'm not getting it. Non clinical person was answering, or so they said. As I told the urgent care doctor, I'm not self harming, I'm not suicidal, I don't need a psych eval. Mood swings do not automatically mean psych hospital. I can't fucking get help. I'm not in immediate danger but I do need help sooner than February 4 when my appointment is. I keep getting passed off and yeah, I lost it. But if a normal person loses it it's all fine and dandy. I don't need inpatient. I do need a med adjustment. That doesn't mean right this second.

    <TEXT>It would be an attempted overdose. On what I won't say. My kids (teacher, 6th grade) won't do their work. I had to send something home because they refused to work in class and we don't have the class time to complete it next week. They won't turn it in and it'll be all 0's. Realistically at least half. I sent an email to parents about this work and our test Wednesday and some online resources to study. They won't. Last test only 15% passed. I thought it was easy. They won't try. They're so low academically. I had a talk with my principal after school and I got the vibe she wants our relationship to be more personal than professional in terms of communication. That she doesn't like how I talk to her about school. I could be wrong. I restarted seroquel without my pdoc because he refuses to answer me even after my therapist talked to him. Still have to wait over two weeks until my next appointment. Sucks. It was either try seroquel again or be hospitalized because of how unstable and suicidal I was. Well, suicidal has gotten worse. My therapist says I'm extremely rapid cycling. Would make sense. I'm not telling any professional how suicidal I am because I know what they'd do. Send me inpatient. Everything about this screams hospitalization but I don't want to go. I'm not going. I've been through worse. Maybe if I give the seroquel more time. This is only my second day back on it. Can I continue to go day after day like this? When will it stop? It's only been getting worse. Edit. And now I'm absolutely fine. Same day, a couple hours later. This stupidly fast rapid cycling is getting the best of me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm very very rapid cycling. I almost overdosed last night but somehow decided not to. I see my therapist tonight, she's staying extra late to see me which is so nice of her. Her idea, not mine. I worry that if I tell the truth I'll be forced to go inpatient, which is what I don't want. Principal knows everything. I wish I could stay at her house for a few days but her husband would hate it. Another teacher offered to let me stay with them but she has two daughters and I don't know how she would tell them there's someone staying with them for a little while. What reason would she give? I'm not super worried about her husband. Principal I'm worried about her husband and her college aged son being uncomfortable. I'm still debating about whether or not I'm going to hand over the pills I'd use for overdosing. My principal has other pills of mine I've wanted to overdose with in the past. She lives in the same town as my therapist so it would be easy to swing by her house tonight to drop them off. I don't want to though. My life, it should be my choice how I end it. I don't understand why others can't get on board with that. My principal said she'd always feel responsible if I killed myself. I don't understand how and nobody is explaining that to me. I appear fine. Talking to me I'm smiling and totally normal. Boyfriend was here over the weekend and couldn't tell at all. Yet I've told you what's going on inside. What to do, what to do.

    <TEXT>I've only seen the guy twice. Between my last appointment and now shit went down. He took me off seroquel in a number of days and I had God awful withdrawal. There ended up being a duplicate prescription that was never filled from a few months ago and I was able to get that. I restarted seroquel after getting dangerously suicidal and seeing no other option. I knew seroquel would fix it and inpatient would be stupidly expensive and include missing work. No thanks. So with the advice of my principal and my therapist I restarted seroquel. Obviously not official advice but it was their opinion that they shared with me. I'm doing so so so so so much better now. I feel normal. I'm worried he'll say he won't treat me anymore since I went behind his back and did this. I'm worried he'll have justification for why he ignored most of my emails and someone with access to his email account told me to stop emailing them. I'm worried he'll try to take away seroquel again. I'm worried if he has me keep seroquel he tries to take away latuda, which would also be horrible. I'm so worried about the whole thing. I hate confrontation but I absolutely need to discuss the horrible communication and lack of care I got from him for the past almost month and a half. It's unacceptable how I've been treated and mishandled. I reached out for help from him multiple times and got blocked. I shouldn't need an emergency room or a psych hospital to get treated at all. He does video chats, why didn't he offer that? If email didn't work why not a phone call? Why did I get turned away every time I asked for help, if I got an answer at all? Everyone else says great things about him but my experience has been awful. I'm worried about Monday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On a kid. She's a bitch, her mom is a bitch, and I don't say that lightly. Mom refuses to buy the girl school supplies and I stupidly said something to the girl about not being prepared and it turned into a huge thing. I said some things I shouldn't have said. I didn't mean what I said, it just happened. I had no control at all. Rage and anxiety took over. Everyone is telling me not to beat myself up about it, it happens. The principal is dealing with the mom now but the principal has been nice to me about it. I recognized that I was wrong and admitted it so she's not harping on me for that. She hasn't gotten mad at me at all, which I'm thankful for. Hopefully in a day or two this will all have gone away. The girl is making up stuff that I would never ever say (I would NEVER call a kid or a family poor) so the principal knows the mom isn't getting the real story. She's going to call mama tomorrow to stand up to her. I gotta say, if she gets switched out of my class I would not shed a single tear. I would give a heads up to the next teacher. Mom has mega twisted my words before and been horrible to me in the past so I see where the daughter gets it from. I had severe anxiety for the whole rest of the day due to that one event. It happened in the morning. 100% a bipolar outburst. That's definitely what it was. I hate when that happens. It's not an excuse but it is the reason.</TEXT>

By lunch I was mostly normal, end of the school day fine, and now I'm starting to slip just thinking about it all. Such extremes in such a short period of time. Pdoc didn't say anything about it when I saw him yesterday because overall I'm getting back on track since getting back on seroquel. There are just some very major bumps in the road that I'm having a hard time handling. I don't know how to cope with the idea that I go to such extremes and back with no control over it at all.

Her telling me I had to go inpatient. She made me give her my principal's number and those two talked and the whole back and forth thing was a mess. She finally stepped down a little and said I could spend the night with someone which I was also against because I felt it would be extremely awkward. So eventually quite a few calls later and a bunch of promises I get to stay home by myself tonight, but nobody is happy about it. I was literally shaking from all of this. I was certain she was going to make it involuntary. I'm still upset about the whole thing and mad at the person that made me email her in the first place. I hate being made so upset. I get that I have symptoms that align with someone that goes inpatient, I get that. But I also know I'm not in danger of dying. I got rid of all of the means. I don't have a way to kill myself right now and I tried telling my therapist that but she didn't believe me. I'm so upset right now. Ended up having the cops called on me as a precaution.

The facilities at this place are sooo much better than they were at the last place. Worlds better. Major medication change already. Going from 150 lamictal 150 wellbutrin 80 latuda 600 seroquel to 75 lamictal 500 depakote 80 latuda 300 seroquel so we'll see how that goes. The rapid cycling within the same day is insane. I'm suicidal even inpatient which I'm having a hard time beleiving since last time as soon as I went inpatient I was fine. It feels like I'll never not be suicidal. So, I'll check comments when I get time tomorrow and respond to what I can. Love y'all so much!  #8203; Edit, doubled depakote already so 1000. Taking away seroquel, already getting mild withdrawals again so I'm super not happy about that since I already had a few hellish weeks of seroquel withdrawal in late December and early January. At least where I am I can get drugs immediately for the nausea and sleep issues.</TEXT>

Pdoc here is amazing and said they work on the same brain receptor so in theory it should help. Halved lamictal, added a bunch of depakote, wellbutrin hasn't changed. No idea what my rameron dose is but otherwise 1000 depakote, 75 lamictal, 150 wellbutrin, as needed zofran for nausea and as needed vistaril for sleep.

The author said she wrote the beginning, boy wakes up to find someone is gone, and she thought of who would do that and she immediately thought bipolar. Let me repeat that for those in the back. She thought of who would do that and she immediately thought bipolar. Book Summary End of summer vacation. Boy goes camping, finds out mom is gone and took all the stuff, has to find his way home a few states away without telling anyone because he doesn't want to get his mom in trouble. Spoiler. Grandma has been wanting to help him for years but mom called her bad. No, mom was nuts. Bipolar References They only mention one depressive episode where she couldn't get out of bed to take care of him. The rest are manic "spinning" episodes. She gets super focused on one thing or makes a public scene in a train station and the cops take her away or she disappears for days at a time. In the book turns out she took a ship to the Bahamas with some captain she just met in a bar. How it made me feel Well, they never used the word bipolar. I doubt the kids caught on. We read it to the classes. I'm a teacher. Sorry, thoughts are out of order tonight. But the outburst in the train station where she got detained by cops and held in a psych ward for a few days got to me. Her being unable to take care of her son and the son not seeing it got to me. Mom convincing the son that all other adults are bad and want to take him away got to me. A reply to a post tonight, not my post or comment, made me think of all of this. We did a Skype session with the author to ask questions about the book. One question was why did the mom have a mental illness. The author said she wrote the beginning, boy wakes up to find someone is gone, and she thought of who would do that and she immediately thought bipolar. Let me repeat that for those in the back. She thought of who would do that and she immediately thought bipolar. Our reputation is that bad that they think we would leave a child behind unattended with nothing more than the tent he is in and his backpack. Our reputation is so bad they wonder who could do this to a child and people jump to bipolar. I had to stand in the cafeteria as we Skyped with her as a school and not show any emotion so my kids didn't notice. PM me if you want to know the name of the book.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-03-09 15:26:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I finally found the word for what I was feeling. Nothing felt good. Nothing made me happy. Nothing held my interest. I would get home from work and lay in complete silence for hours not bored at all. I couldn't make myself go for walks or watch tv or do much at all. Nothing sounded good. Everything was empty and my mind was blank. There weren't thoughts. I didn't want to talk to people I normally talked to every day. Brain fog fit a little but not totally. Apathy kinda fit. Anhedonia makes the most sense. I got no pleasure out of anything. No highs, no depression, nothing. Just nothing. I wanted to self harm so I could feel anything at all. I didn't end up hurting myself. There was so much nothing I was almost driven to an extreme. I don't know if it's mediation related or due to coming out of inpatient or what but it's weird.</TEXT>

This is following a therapy session where she mentioned my abusive father and how he treated me so terribly, so I think these feelings are linked to that. I can't even keep a reasonably neat place to live. Every room is a mess and I don't care. I wished my boyfriend good night yesterday and he asked over and over what was wrong because he said I'm usually cold and distant. I had spring break this week (teacher) and I did nothing but lay around doing nothing. I'm not worth the air I breathe. I started self harming again so there's that.

    <TEXT>At first I dreaded the day I would turn 26. Now that it's just about here I'm looking forward to it. That little bit of attention always feels good. Boyfriend is coming into town and bringing me lunch at school, being sure to avoid all kids so they don't see him or us together. He'll find a way to spend the day and I'll see him that night so we can go out to eat for my birthday dinner. I haven't really seen or talked to him much in the past month so it'll be nice. For a while I had thoughts that I think only you guys could understand. How did I make it to the next year? Am I supposed to still be here? And it didn't feel right, it felt like 25 should have been it. I don't know anyone else that could even remotely relate so I'm reaching out here. Here's to 26 and hopefully many more. It is so nice having a decent med combo going on right now. It makes the day a lot easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't want to sleep with my boyfriend hardly ever. Well, yesterday was my birthday. He came to see me (long distance) and before bed stuff started happening and I thought it was my birthday so it was a one way street. Then he turned it into a two way street. I didn't want it and it was so uncomfortable and I just wanted it to end. I almost never want sex. When I do I lose interest well before it's over. I feel like I owe it to him to let him finish. I feel like it's my job as the girlfriend to give him sex. Sounds messed up when I put it like that. I'm so upset from last night. It was forced. He said something like since I finished it was his turn and I had to pet him, something like that. Meanwhile it was late and I had school in the morning and all I wanted was to go to bed. I can't stop crying and I have to pick my kids up from specials soon. Talking to him is the logical thing to do but I feel like I'm the one that's wrong. I feel like I do owe it to him and I do need to give it to him because I am his girlfriend. I don't know if the lack of desire is med related or what.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>App that helps you clean</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-26 01:36:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>My apartment is about as messy as it gets. I'm not a hoarder but it's almost that level of messy. Cleaning doesn't happen. I found this app and I really think it's going to help. It's called Tody. You pick tasks for each room in your house, set a frequency for how often you want to do it, then select if it's good, due, or overdue and it fills a bar. If the bar is empty it's good. As it fills up you get closer to when you have to do that chore. It tells you, green yellow or red, how that area is. Mine is almost all red from being overdue. Laundry is yellow! Yay! Something yellow! You can make it a checklist by overall chore, you can do it by room, you can sort by what's the most urgent by what's the most overdue, and it keeps track of when you do each thing and makes charts which I doubt I use. Cleaning my bedroom is overwhelming but just picking up dirty clothes is doable. You can create custom tasks and/or choose from a list. I really think this is going to help me. I can set goals to a certain number a day until it's all clean. I'm so optimistic about this. I wanted to share because I know a lot of us share this struggle at times</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Therapist is distancing herself</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-03 00:26:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>My therapist has been saying for months to email her if I need anything. Well, I got a bipolar book and started reading it and it said when you get suicidal to reach out to your pdoc/therapist/support system. So here's what happened. I got BAD on Sunday. I reached out to my support person after the worst wave passed because I was ready to act on the urges and didn't want to be stopped. I told her, she asked if I needed a wellness check, I ended up getting calmed down. Monday morning I emailed my therapist to tell her what happened. At the time I said in my mind suicide was still an option. Logically she said inpatient. I said let's see how the day goes and how I am after school. She said go or I'm calling someone on you. I took it as a threat. I sent her a message about why I was upset with her (feeling threatened, feeling like she went around me to talk to my support person when I was trying to leave her out of it, feeling like I wasn't being heard when I told her multiple times I was doing better and she insisted on going to a hospital or she'd call them to come get me) and I guess that's what did it. I cancelled our appointment for today. So since I didn't see her I emailed her today one more time that my psychiatrist wasn't worried that I got bad Sunday and I told her my meds are staying similar but that I'd like to talk about future adjustments with her. I had my appointment with him today. Her response was no more email communication. I feel hurt by this. Ok, I got bad and emailed her a bunch in one day, but we'd had a bunch of messages before that that went fine and she did say during our sessions that I knew how to reach her so I'm not taking it super great and I want to cancel all of my sessions and never go back. I feel like a screw up. I guess reaching out when I was/after I was bad was a mistake and next time I shouldn't say anything, which goes against what everyone says. I feel like I'm being punished for doing what I was told.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have another post where my therapist said no more email communication. So she's not happy with me. Just had a spat with my boyfriend because he brought up therapy and I hate talking about therapy with others, including him, and he doesn't respect that boundary. It's the end of the year so my 6th graders are extra horrible and vocal about how much they hate my class. Principal just told me she doesn't think 6th is the right fit for me so I'm feeling so inadequate and I think I'm trying to push her away but she's not letting it happen. She's the only one left but she's part of why I'm upset about school. Inconsistent discipline, or a complete lack of discipline, is the main thing. I'd be better off dead. I say that any other time and it's fine. I say that this time and everyone jumps to tell me I need to go to a hospital. I don't know why I'm getting treated differently but that's another thing that makes me feel like relationships are ruined. They don't want to hear it from me.</TEXT>

None of it is perfect but the difference is huge! I can function in my kitchen again! It took four loads of dishes (maybe 3, I forget) but I did it! No more sink piled up super high. No more running out of dishes and silverware. No more not having a place to put down my hairbrush. Finally some sense of organization. Y'all, this is huge.

This is the person I normally trust most in the world and now I feel like I can't go to them. I've lost my "person." Depressive swing starting? I don't currently have a pdoc and won't for another couple weeks, and that's if things work out. I'm still medicated. I do see my therapist today, thankfully.  #8203; It doesn't help that I'm a teacher and it's the end of the year. Standardized testing was this week and next week is the last week of school so the kids are brats. I'm sure that plays a role.  #8203; Side question, if I run out of meds and my primary care doc won't prescribe any should I go to the emergency room for a refill? I know it's not meant for that but I really don't want to run out of meds and I want a backup plan. I'd only need at most another week or two of meds. This wouldn't be an ongoing thing.</TEXT>

My old pdoc closed his practice and I'm going to be starting the process of getting a new one on Tuesday. It's taking so long because multiple appointments are necessary to get to the point where I see a pdoc at the new place and it's first come first serve so I need to get there early in the morning and be ready to potentially spend the day there. I didn't want to miss school during testing season and the end of the year. I messaged my primary care doc but I'm not optimistic she'll say yes. The old one with the closed practice rarely answered my emails even when he was my doctor, I doubt he will now. I shouldn't need to go to a hospital to get more and I don't even know if they'll give me more. I have 11 days left. 10 after today. I need advice about what to do. I'm going to a long distance conference in a couple weeks so I'm worried I won't be medicated for that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you communicate your needs when it feels like no one listens?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-03 19:25:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Examples, I had a weekend with my boyfriend, we're long distance, and he pushed me well past my social limits again and again and made fun of me for it. I ended up sleeping in past noon the last day I was with him when before the trip I had been getting up around 9 at the latest. I asked him how much longer we had to stay at a game night and he said one more game. We left two games later which was over an hour later and I was literally curled up falling asleep on the couch because I could not stay awake. Maybe because I had already taken my latuda with supper. My parents want me to fly home for part of the summer. I don't want to. They won't accept no. If I don't they may end up coming to me which is worse. I have issues with control, we've pinpointed that. This past weekend I had little control over where and what I ate, where I was, when I got alone time, how late I was out. Fortunately I got to sleep in but otherwise there was very little control and it led to some pretty intense suicidal thoughts which have calmed down a lot since I got home and back to being alone. I need to be alone so I can get the right balance of active/inactive. Being with others is too stressful. I don't know how to communicate this. I've tried in the past and it led to a lot of hurt feelings because people felt like they should have been able to help me. It's going to end up being my next therapy topic. My boyfriend is an ass when he wants to be but no, we're not going to break up. He was an extreme ass this weekend and didn't listen to or care about my needs. We have good times too.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-22 18:54:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a week of professional development this past week and the week before. Very well put together. The days were long and this past week was in a hotel where I shared a room and it took 7 hours of driving to get home. Now I'm curled up on the couch crying wanting so badly to kill myself. Maybe I'm overwhelmed from how much was done. Maybe I saw that I can't live a full life like others. No matter what that's what I want and it's what's on my mind. I see both my therapist and pdoc on Wednesday but I don't want to tell them. My boyfriend is with me this weekend and I don't want to tell him (I usually don't). I did get a ton of sleep last night but I'm still exhausted today. I don't know exactly why I'm suicidal but if my boyfriend wasn't here today I'd consider doing it today. I reached out to the person I'm closest to but I doubt they'll engage in that conversation. Feels like they don't want to be bothered with me. I'm sure you'll all feel the same way. Nobody should care about me. I'm damaged. I'm broken. I don't belong on this earth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So idk if this is relevant but I'm bipolar. I am on psych meds. I plan on starting infusions next week. Is there a chance that I will need fewer medications over time? Is there a chance ketamine may totally replace my other medications? How long after the infusion do you feel well enough to drive? To go to work? To eat? Can you converse during the infusion if someone comes with you? Sorry for all the questions.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-25 21:35:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm talking therapeutic experiences, not recreational. I priced a couple of places and found one that's $1325 for the first 6 infusions which happen over two weeks then $375 per infusion after that and the maintenance doses should be around once a month. School people are willing to help me with transportation. If that doesn't work out there's somewhere that does it at $400 an infusion. It just depends if my pdoc is on board. She wouldn't be the one doing it. The esketamine location is a lot farther away and harder to get to even if it might be covered. My first appointment is for next Monday. I don't know if my infusion would be the same day as the consultation but I scheduled it for the morning in case it can be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just had an appointment and I hate how it went. I want ketamine and found a place to do it. She said no. I want to get off depakote because of side effects. She said no. I don't want to raise my wellbutrin because I hate how it makes me feel. She doesn't care and is making me increase my wellbutrin. I already had problems with anxiety so sure, let's increase something that we know increases anxiety. I'm waiting for a call back from the practice that does ketamine. I would switch my pdoc to someone in their practice. This is a separate place from where could do the ketamine without pdoc approval. That place is cheaper but I'd be stuck with the pdoc I don't like anymore. Why can't I find a psychiatrist I like? Why does this have to be so difficult? Currently crying over all of this.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-29 22:42:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was set on the idea, priced out different places, made appointments. But here's the thing. I'm not really depressed right now. Bipolar and medicated. I've tried 27 different drugs but right now surprisingly ok. I don't feel an immediate need for ketamine but this is the only time until next summer I can get it done. I'm a teacher so I can't miss every other day of school for two weeks. The hope is that I can get off of some of my meds or lower them. I've gained almost 60 lbs, I have hair loss, joint pain, haven't had a period since February, no sex drive. The weight and hair loss are the two big ones bugging me. Maybe with ketamine I can go on a different mood stabilizer and be ok. Is it worth it to go on ketamine when I'm ok then go change my meds? It's a lot of money to possibly waste.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-02 00:27:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I forgot my wellbutrin so that may have contributed. I hit all the hypomanic symptoms except risky behavior for a good chunk of today. My therapist says she's never seen me like this. I know you need to have the symptoms for multiple days for it to be considered hypo. My pdoc situation is complicated and I don't really have one to go to at the moment yet I'm still being covered med wise, it's really weird, so this is kinda the only place I can ask. I'm going to return to taking my wellbutrin at night since daytime already isn't working out. We just doubled the dose which has had bad results in the past but most recent pdoc who I've only seen three times doesn't believe me and had to try it again. Currently so anxious I wish there was a tranquilizer gun to knock me out on the spot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last night I heard what sounded like muffled talking. It happened at least one other set of times months ago. We recently tried doubling my wellbutrin and that led to anxiety and not being able to sleep right. Last night I was up till 4 simply because I couldn't sleep. Is there any point in telling my therapist? She can't do anything. I'm not going back to the same pdoc so I don't really have one I can tell. I see the new one next Friday. I lowered my wellbutrin back down to the dose I was on for roughly 5 years. I can't help but worry that mania or psychosis is coming or worse already here.</TEXT>

I'm bipolar but only really deal with depression. I've tried 27 meds. Right now I'm dealing with weight gain, joint pain, hair loss (26F so it should not be happening), but my mood is reasonable. I know you're not doctors. I have to decide in the next couple of days or I can't get it done until next summer due to my teacher schedule. My psychiatrist doesn't like ketamine so I don't know if she'd continue seeing me if I started it. It was all going to work out and now I don't know...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The office I was going to go to called and said they're not going to do ketamine anymore. I was finally used to the idea and accepted that I it was going to happen. Now I don't know what my future treatment will look like. I have depakote side effects (weight gain, hair loss, joint pain) so I want to switch back to lamictal but depakote works better. Remeron may be making me gain weight, I don't know. Lexapro was fine but that would be a 5th drug, unless we take remeron away. My current pdoc is meh at best. I've only seen her three times. My last pdoc closed his practice. So I'm having inconsistent treatment. At least I'm staying medicated but my med changes aren't as useful as they could be. So ketamine or no ketamine? The place I'd be going to now isn't a doctors office. It's a medispa. I hate this. It was all set but then no.</TEXT>

I was a little scared of the dissociation but the trip was fine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. They did my dose based off of my weight and they said the dose doesn't change, so they will never raise it. It took an hour for the infusion and now I'm just waiting until I'm not so dizzy so I can go home. They gave me zofran and something to make me kinda out of it to make it a more pleasant experience.

    <TEXT>I've read on here about people leaving in a bad mood and that bad mood sticking around. My infusion was yesterday and I'm worse off than I was before this infusion. I'll still be going back for 3-6. It may have been due to external factors. Do I have to wait until my next infusion to be pulled out of this funk? Update: two days after the infusion I felt fine. I've been productive since then and got a lot of cleaning done around my apartment...stuff I thought would never get done. So yay! Did a post about #3. Less vivid, still felt movement sensations. Didn't leave depressed after #3. We'll see how tomorrow goes. My sleep is shit but I don't know if that's related to ketamine.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-18 22:38:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new to getting my nails done. I used to do gels at home but they always peeled off within the week. I got the dip powder about a month ago and it was fine! Lasted about three weeks then it was so overgrown I had to get it done again. I tried somewhere new. The first time it was thick in the middle and thin on the cuticle side and free edge and I was hoping for something more even. Enter nail salon 2. Within 5 days two fingers had serious lifting and overall 7 had some degree of lifting. I went back and they fixed them. The two major lifts got redone and the others got refilled. That was Sunday. Today, Thursday, two started lifting. Ugh! So do I go back? I hate to have paid so much to have only had the nails for two weeks. I love the color. Right now the lifting is very minor and a refill on those two nails would fix it. They did buff and dehydrate, they did not drill or push down the cuticles when they redid them. TLDR: got my nails done, dip powder. Lifted within 5 days. Got them redone by same nail tech (wasn't given an option). Now two are lifting again four days later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, I did it one time and it got approved by the credit card company so they're ok with it and it fell under their terms. Had they said no then ok. I only did it because they had unsatisfactory service as a valid reason and gave clear examples as to what would not count (therapy/counseling sessions going poorly is an example that comes to mind). Here's what I quoted from https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/purchase-protection-benefits.php In my original post I was referring to return protection as one of the perks. I read multiple sites and didn't get the post information from any one place in particular so I can't quote each individual part without going through my search history and doing a lot of rereading. If it wasn't right then it shouldn't have been approved. They asked for dollar amounts, the service that it was, the reasoning, and they made the decision to do a permanent credit on my account. They asked if it fell under certain categories, again counseling comes to mind, and mine did not fall under their omitted categories. If they don't want people doing it then they shouldn't have it as an option. I'm returning things to stores that I bought and never used per the terms of each store. For example, kohls has no limits on how long you have to return things so clothes I've never worn can go back if they still have the tags. A pair of shorts where I accidentally got the wrong size and washed them they'd probably take back but I won't because that was my mistake. Bought a bunch of frames at Hobby Lobby to do a craft and never did it. Brought those back today with receipts. I'm not the type to send my food back at a restaurant if I simply don't like it or it's lukewarm. Give me cold food or burnt food then yeah but if it's reasonable that's fine. I'm not going to intentionally abuse any system.</TEXT>

The lights were dimmed and this time had music. I'm going to ask for no music next time. I like being lost in time.

    <TEXT>I agree with telling him to stop in writing. I guess my question is are you willing to lose him as a mentor? If so then you can tell him that you want a strictly professional relationship. You can talk about wanting to maintain boundaries as he is faculty and you are a student. Reporting him would likely get him fired or disciplined severely as college staff sign paperwork saying they will not become involved with students. He is taking advantage of you. He is doing this because he feels like he can. He does know it's wrong. I get it, I'm super close with my principal and she supports me more than anyone. The main difference is we're both girls. She thinks of me like a daughter and a friend. She doesn't expect anything in return and doesn't even accept apologies after my mood swings and poor behavior.

    <TEXT>I've tried 27 meds. I've had 2 hospital stays in 2 years. I finally decided to try ketamine and wow. I'm less depressed and I can function. You start by getting 6 IV infusions over 2-3 weeks then getting boosters about every 4-8 weeks. I'm on that first set, just did infusion 4 of 6 this morning. It's expensive and not covered by insurance but it works. I'm having a hard time finding a pdoc that's willing to treat me while I get ketamine. In my case it isn't done by a doctor, it's done at a wellness clinic for housewives with too much money that go in there for botox and vitamin shots. I'm still on meds but hoping to get it down to two instead of four. My motivation is unlike anything it's ever been. My bathroom and closet are totally picked up. It wasn't unpacked from moving last February and now it's perfect. My room is almost clean. I cooked a couple times. The ketamine is really something. There's hope for the depression. It's just expensive. Cheaper than latuda though so at least there's that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first med I tried was lamictal. When I still had problems with depression we added wellbutrin. I've been on them for the majority of the past five years. I like it. It helps cut down on the depression some and helps my attention span. It's what allowed me to get through college.</TEXT>

I just don't have extra costs like a house (I rent an apartment) or kids or anyone else to support (boyfriend is long distance), so I can swing the ketamine payments. I'm meeting a new pdoc tomorrow who said she'd consider letting ketamime be part of my treatment plan but she's not sure yet. Otherwise I may lie to my current one and tell her I'm not on it because I'm fairly sure she'd drop me if she finds out.</TEXT>

Example is the clinic I was going to go to that was a psych office. They stopped doing K for whatever reason and I asked if they could treat me anyway while I started ketamine at the medspa and they said no. What the hell, they used to do the infusions themselves.

The latest in the day they'll do it is 1 and that would mean missing an entire school day and making someone else miss a day to drive me because the combined uber there and back would be like $70. It doesn't work for me so ketamine, which they can administer at 3:30 and I'd only have to leave school 15 min early, works better even though it costs so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One thing I have to say is that when you're hurting if you reach out to someone and they can pick up on you needing help, if they care about you at all they'll do what they can to help you. Don't feel like you'd be a burden. I spent too much time thinking that and I've relatively recently gotten over it. My life is so much better now that I have people I can go to because they understand. Even just having people knowing makes it better for me. Reach out. You're already doing that on here and that's a big step for some people. Reach out to the people in your life too. Maybe ask if they can grab dinner, it's a way to get you to eat. Ask if they want to catch a movie, you don't have to do a lot of talking. I personally liked Toy Story 4. I second GoodRX.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I didn't exactly get it prescribed. I found a clinic that does ketamine, they did a consultation, I have no history of mania/psychosis and I was depressed most of the time and I'm treatment resistant so they said I was perfect for it. The clinic handles everything. I just had to find a pdoc that was willing to treat me for my other meds while I was getting ketamine. The pdoc I found doesn't want anything to do with prescribing ketamine (it can come as a nasal spray, the clinic does IV) since they can't control the environment or the dosage you actually take. At the clinic they monitor you closely and if something goes wrong they can handle it. I haven't had anything bad happen whatsoever. I have had four infusions so far, my next two are this Monday and Wednesday, then it'll go to about once a month for maintenance. I'm already noticing a big difference. I lowered my meds on my own (haven't really seen new pdoc for more than an initial visit) which I know everyone on here wouldn't recommend, but I need to find out how much the ketamine is helping somehow. Overall, very expensive but for me, worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had bad cognitive effects on depakote but that's because I was on lamictal at the time and there's an interaction. The second time I tried depakote I had cognitive problems but once we lowered the dose it got way better, so maybe the dose was too high. 1000 mg is the standard starting dose from what I've heard (you work up to 1000 over a couple of days) but I needed to be on 750 and that made a big difference. Just my experience with depakote. Lamictal is my mood stabilizer, but I see he got the rash. Seroquel was great for me, it really helped my depression. I don't get mania so I can't help with that part. But he's on geodon and that's an antipsychotic and they don't like you on two antipsychotics together if it can be avoided. I'm not being very helpful, I'm sorry. Just trying to give my experiences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Late and I doubt anyone will read this, but... When I was 9 my mom left to go fight in Iraq. This was at the very beginning of the war. She came back a few weeks later (she was still in the states with her inprocessing) and surprised me on my 10th birthday. Special, but not the best part. She was gone for 13 months. She was formerly a stay at home mom, team mom, cheerleading mom, girl scout leader, she did everything she could with us. Anyway, we missed her like crazy and this was before facetime and before international calling was an easy thing so we barely got to talk or communicate. One day, about a year after she came home for my birthday, I was in my reading class at school. The desks were scattered because there was a test earlier in the day. I was thinking about how much I hated the class. I looked up and there at the front of the room was my mom, still in her uniform. I couldn't believe it. She picked me up from class and as we walked through the school we ended up with a crowd because she was a hero. She was in the first bunch to return. This is back when it was a huge deal, so 2004. We got my brother out of his class and the principal told us to get our things and go home. Then we went to surprise my grandparents. They were shocked too. Everyone was so so so happy to see her. But still, to this day, over 15 years later, I remember her standing at the front of that 5th grade classroom. I love my mom.</TEXT>

This time was different, there wasn't as much of a sense that my body was moving but my mind was moving between scenes. I barely slept last night (med change) so I wonder if that has something to do with it. I'm thinking of getting into card making and I spent a lot of time (and money) on stuff for that yesterday and throughout the night so I saw a lot of that kinda stuff. Like I was a part of the materials, not I was making something. I don't remember as much of this trip as I do the past ones but I enjoyed this one the most. Yay! My mood is definitely better. I noticed a difference between 2 and 3 and it's gotten better after each infusion. So...ketamine is definitely working for me. Worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm bipolar 2, have tried 27 meds, and had very stubborn depression. I turned to ketamine partially due to timing since I'm a teacher and had a few weeks off between trainings and the timing of the first 6 infusions just worked. My mom flew in to drive me to and from since you can't drive those days. You'd go in for a consultation and they'd see if you're a good fit. From my understanding basically do you have treatment resistant depression and do you have a history of mania/psychosis (they're looking for yes depression and no psychosis). You get 6 initial infusions, typically done MWF for two weeks. Seems like most places work you up to a higher dose over time but my place does one dose based on weight and it stays that and never increases. Anyway, for me, and it varies person to person, I'm out of it during the whole infusion with my eyes closed and I have a psychedelic trip. They gave me zofran for possible nausea and versed for possible anxiety but during infusion 3 we tried it without those two and it went fine so I don't need them at all. I come out of it pretty fast. Less than 5 minutes after it ends I'm awake but very dizzy, about 15 minutes later I can walk out, and about 15 minutes after that I'm perfectly fine. Most take longer to come out of it and many are out of it for the rest of the day and need a full night's sleep to feel normal. I guess I metabolize it well or something. I noticed a gradual lessening of my depression between 2 and 3 and now I feel mostly normal. I'm lowering my psych meds to see if I really need them since I don't know what the ketamine is making up for. So far I dropped one of my four meds. My goal is to drop one more and stay on the last two. If you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer them. You can search my history to see my past experiences after each infusion. I know this is super long but I remember researching it and I loved reading the details.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even when I had catatonic depression my eyes were open. I barely got up but I did do the bare minimum essentials (eat a little, bathroom). Call her doctor at the very very least. She may need a hospitalization. Being hospitalized isn't a bad thing. From what my therapist said it's when you don't have the means to be able to cope safely. That's where she's at. They can adjust meds quickly and in a controlled environment. I've been hospitalized twice for suicidal depression and the hospital stays made a world of difference. You have way more rights if you go in voluntarily vs involuntary so try to get her to go in voluntarily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first stint inpatient didn't teach me a thing. It changed my meds and got me not suicidal but it didn't do anything to help my coping skills. My second experience inpatient was somewhere else and it was so different and they have an amazing program. They have actual occupational therapists, they had a super friendly and caring nursing staff, the doctors were much better, and I didn't hate it or want to get out asap like I did at the other place. At the other place I requested to leave and they granted it. They didn't exactly release me. I think that was 3 days. My second a year later was 8 and I don't regret going one bit. I did at the time and on and off after but now I see that it was part of my journey towards stability and it showed me that stability is a possibility. Sorry for the rambling. TLDR different inpatient hospitals can give you totally different experiences and they don't all suck</TEXT>

The person I'm closest to says it's made me more self aware and she's noticed a difference. I'm able to cope better with what comes up. I'm better able to identify what's going on. I've been in therapy for over a year. Proud of you for taking this step! Just remember that whatever you're going through, they've heard it before so it won't shock them.

    <TEXT>No music, I don't know what my dose is but it was exactly the same as it had been. I asked the nurse that did it what was different between this and last Wednesday and she said it was exactly the same, down to how long it took me to come out of it. The room was silent instead of having extra noises so maybe that was part of it? I've never used music. They also turn the lights down in my room and I feel like that may help. The only thing I can think of is that I didn't sleep the night before. Due to my med change I couldn't sleep.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had no effects coming off effexor. But I had a miserable time coming off zoloft. I felt like absolute hell. I did it cold turkey because I was a danger to myself, that's why I got off of it. I halved the dose of my remeron (different type of antidepressant) and two days ago cut it out completely and I don't notice a mood change at all. Tonight I'm going to half my latuda. I'll know real fast if I need latuda back. I tried cutting it back before and right away my mood did not do well. Mood wise you may be fine dropping the effecor. Side effect wise you may be miserable. I remember some people saying they open up the capsules (if this is the drug I'm thinking of) and remove a small number of the little beads every few days. Check /r/bipolarreddit for people's experiences coming off of it. That community is about as nice as this one but some don't take kindly to someone saying they're not bipolar. Most people don't mention their diagnosis and it goes fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Other than my boyfriends and my parents nobody knew. It was my first year of teaching and I was trying different med combos and one made me so sick people were worried about me. I didn't see a choice but to tell my principal so she wouldn't have to worry. I was shaking I was so nervous. I told her, unsure of what her reaction would be, and the first words out of her mouth were "I don't judge." She proceeded to tell me that her mom had bipolar and she wanted me to keep her in the loop with things so she could look after me. She told me to tell the assistant principal. Quite a different experience, but not bad. She told me to get therapy (not in a condescending way, she was trying to be helpful) but clearly didn't know hardly anything about bipolar disorder. I eventually opened up to a couple of teachers. One has anxiety problems and her sister has a mood disorder so she handled it super well and told me to please go to her if I needed anything, even just someone to talk to. Much later I told another teacher I work closely with and he said he was diagnosed as bipolar during his young party days. I don't think he has it, I think he was just reckless in his 20's. I texted it to another teacher and she responded saying thanks for trusting her enough to tell her and her daughter is bipolar. My mom didn't react well at all. She denied it and told me no, I don't have it. It got so heated we didn't talk for three months. I don't think I technically told my dad. He made comments about my mom being "mentally unstable" when she had PTSD after being in Iraq. I still don't know what he thinks of me. So other than my mom I've had all great experiences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Teachers see lots of things because of all the students they have. Kids with anxiety, depression, on medication, it's not uncommon and they don't judge the kids so I think that helps when it comes to their coworkers. I got lucky. My principal created an amazing supporting environment full of great people. Not all schools will be like that. I couldn't see myself telling certain people. I told my principal in December so it wasn't right away. I'd already had some struggles due to the lows and irritability. My last bit inpatient the principal kinda made me go. I was on my way to school and she told me I was going. I had a bag in my car already. We knew I was going, it was just when. She had the counselor drive me and we spent the day together in the ER. Those two and my subject's academic coach visited me while I was there. I called the principal while I was in and she kept me up on all the gossip and ranted about a few kids. It's always funny when your principal calls a horrible kid a iackass. She's super super supportive of the kids but it was funny to hear her say her true opinion that one time. The teachers say that kinda stuff to each other but to hear admin say it was gold. I find teaching to be a surprisingly ok job given my diagnosis. I do the same thing 4 times. I see the day as having chunks and I just need to get through one chunk at a time. Keeping up with grading is hard when my meds are off. Being irritable makes it hard to handle conflict with the kids. But now that I'm way more stable than I was year 1 I'm doing such a better job and doing great. Good meds make it possible. Therapy helps too. I only started it a year and a half ago and it was a good choice. A good therapist makes such a difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously not legal, you don't know what others have done to them, but it sucks that I picked up a whole month of latuda and I'm going to try getting off of it so I may not even touch it. That's $1300 of pills (free for me because I met my out of pocket maximum after my hospital stay that billed insurance $37k for 8 days) that may never get opened. I threw away about 100 lithium pills. An entire bottle of zoloft. Most of a month of celexa. Most of a month of effexor. It's such a waste when some people could really use those meds. I had a bunch of wellbutrin that was the wrong type of extended release that I didn't react well to so that was trash. When you've tried 27 meds a lot goes to waste. I have a whole bottle of depakote I didn't touch, filled to the top. It's such a waste when there are so many people struggling to get their meds. I just wish there was some way to help each other. There never will be when it comes to meds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure most of this sub is people with depression but I do know there's bipolar people. How has it affected your meds? I was on lamictal, wellbutrin, latuda, remeron. I dropped remeron and haven't noticed a difference. Now I'm going to try dropping latuda. I read somewhere that we still need a mood stabilizer since ketamine only helps the depression side. I'm fine with being on lamictal. I'm fine with wellbutrin because it curbs appetite, increases sex drive (which my relationship desperately needs), and can cause weight loss. My psych meds made me gain 60 lbs. I need to lose the weight. I hate being this heavy. Without latuda I won't need the nighttime calories. If I'm not hungry I simply won't eat. I'm between doctors and both the new and old one have no experience with patients on ketamine from my understanding so I get pretty much all my info from reddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! It's super helpful. I took myself off remeron, which causes weight gain. They put me on that in February when I was hospitalized. It replaced seroquel. Long story short at first we tried lamictal, it wasn't enough, added wellbutrin, it was kinda ok. Went a long time without a psychiatrist but my PCP was willing to write refills but not change the doses so I was on that for a year and a half but I was struggling. Moved after college graduation, got a psychiatrist, we played around with adding a 3rd drug. After a LOT of trial and error I ended up on latuda. Helped a lot but over time it wasn't enough so we played with adding a fourth. In essence my "base" was lamictal, wellbutrin, latuda. They all did great but weren't enough. Eventually I was on 7 meds. Pdoc changed and they immediately cut out the last 3 and put me on seroquel. Two antipsychotics is a no no so they told me to stop latuda but it was too hard and I was finally stable. Eventually they said fine, then give up seroquel. Trying to get off that landed me in the hospital for being a danger to myself. Added remeron and depakote, took away lamictal just to try. Hated depakote, just added lamictal back in but my dose is 125 instead of 150. Just to try. Cutting the remeron I didn't notice any difference at all. My goal is to lose the 60 lbs I gained mostly from lithium and seroquel and depakote. Latuda is fine really but if I can be on fewer meds that's what I want. You have to eat with latuda at night and from a weight loss perspective if I'm not hungry at night I don't want to be forced to eat. Those 350 calories after 11ish days is a 1lb difference, and it's never just a straight 350. My wellbutrin dose is fine. It helps me concentrate and be more alert. If I can get my lamictal down to 100 I may try that but not for a little while. I was doing so good on ketamine that I was perfectly fine and wasn't sure I needed all the meds anymore. Overall 27 meds and 8 or 9 psychiatrists is what I've been through, with two hospitalizations. The first one was on just lamictal, wellbutrin, latuda so being on just those three down already proves that ketamine is making a huge difference.</TEXT>

Ok, 60, doing great, until I wasn't and I needed 80. 80, finally, this is it. Until it wasn't and we tried 120. Akathesia. Went back down to 80. Played around with adding a 4th med. Sometimes the good is temporary, sometimes it lasts. When we added seroquel I was good for months until my doctor demanded I get off of it. That led to a hospitalization.

    <TEXT>Once when I was sick with a med withdrawal I went to urgent care for zofran and something to help me sleep. I couldn't even get water down. I could live without the sleep stuff, I just desperately needed zofran for the extreme nausea. The doctor said ok and I was so relieved. Then she came back and said only for 10 days. I said I needed longer because I'd already been dealing with it for weeks and it was BAD. She took it back and said she wouldn't give me any. I told her that was unfair because she had already offered it then she took it away and it makes no sense. It ended with me crying and due to the crying and being so emotional because I was so sick and my doctor was ghosting me my voice kinda got raised. She left and came back with the nurse so she had backup, both of them saying I needed to go to the emergency room and be committed. I said no, I don't need that, I don't have any intention of harming myself I just need some relief from feeling so sick I was surely dehydrated and couldn't have felt any worse. They eventually left and the nurse came back in feeling really bad for me and I asked for another doctor and the other doctor prescribed like 30 zofran (I could be remembering wrong) without even seeing me. She just said ok because it was perfectly reasonable. Horrible experience. it made me really worry that I couldn't have normal reactions due to being bipolar and people would think I'm crazy and need to be locked up. No, I was understandably upset after the doctor even wrote the prescription then refused to give it to me. Talk to your pdoc about what happened and explain your side. Maybe that'll help. When I explained it to the nurse things got better.</TEXT>

I tried lithium twice, the regular stuff made me terribly nauseous and gain weight. The extended release I tried a year or two after that and it didn't make me nauseous but I gained a lot of weight and I didn't like how I felt on it. Even if the lamictal messes with the ketamine some the ketamine is still helping me and no other mood stabilizer has been ok for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been there. For me it was not even Eating 200 or 300 calories a day. Someone on here a couple years ago suggested frozen waffles to me and I swear by it. Easy on the tummy, easy to eat dry if you get flavored ones (chocolate chip is good, strawberry is my favorite) and each is 200 calories. Ensure has some nutrition shakes that are 350 calories. I think it's ensure plus. I've never gotten name brand and Kroger is the only store I've found that carries it in store brand. The chocolate isn't awful. When my diet was the worst I tried to drink juice to get some nutrients and if I could get down a multivitamin I did that. Not the juices with corn syrup, like real orange juice. I would also get whole milk and drink chocolate milk. A big glass with chocolate syrup is around 300 calories I think. I did whatever I could to get calories. Maybe try the waffles, they're easy on the stomach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was pretty much forced inpatient last time I went. I knew I had to go to the hospital but I didn't want to go. Someone didn't give me an option eventually and had someone else drive me there. Ended up being a great decision. I was in for eight days and they totally changed my meds and I got out doing significantly better. It's what I needed to get out of it. Research the hospitals in the area, call her doctor and ask for recommendations, and pack a bag for her if she can't do it herself. I can help you figure out what to bring if you get to that point. Certain things aren't allowed. You can't handle this on your own. This is at the point where she needs professional help and there's nothing wrong with that. Lots of us have been there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wellbutrin, lexapro, remeron have been fine. Zoloft and prozac made me super suicidal. Celexa and effexor didn't help and gave me side effects. Just because one makes you manic doesn't mean they all will. That's what I learned. Being on them without a mood stabilizer is a big no no.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I couldn't tolerate IR. Nausea so bad I couldn't function. I didn't have that on ER but I did have other side effects that were minor but I didn't like how it made me feel so I went off of it. I started off on just lamictal and when I was still depressed and mentally dumbed down we added wellbutrin and that helped me to think a bit clearer and helped my concentration a lot. If you want to try ER I think it's worth a shot. But wellbutrin may help too. Edit: someone mentioned depakote. It did help my mood but there's an interaction between depakote and lamictal. Depakote basically doubles the lamictal in your body so you have to half it. The two together can make the brain fog so much worse. I had no thoughts when I was on both at once. My mind was totally blank. If you asked me what I was thinking the answer really was... nothing. So we dropped lamictal and tried just depakote. It worked well but we had to lower the dose some for cognitive reasons. It did well but I had awful joint pain, weight gain (had massive weight gain on lithium too), and some hair loss so I went back to lamictal. Depakote isn't bad to try, just realize that depakote+lamictal will probably make your problems worse. Lowering my lamictal helped my cognitive issues. At 200 I had zero short term memory. Couldn't even talk in full sentences because I'd forget what I was saying halfway through. 150 is much better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I cringe so hard for how I was back in January and February. I was hospitalized in February. I was so suicidal that others lost sleep worrying about me. Now I'm relatively fine like that never happened. I hate that I did that to them. I hate that so many (ok about 7) people knew. I was BAD. Even aside from that for months going back about two years I would talk to the person I was closest to about being suicidal. I can't imagine how stressful that must have been for them. We're still insanely close and I don't know how she does it but she doesn't judge me, or is very very good at hiding it. I hate that I was that way to others and negatively impacted their lives. One of the things I cringe the most about is that I self harmed and sent someone a picture of it. I don't know why I did it. They knew I was doing it, I don't know why I had to show them. There was no blood, it wasn't cutting. I think part of why I did it was to show them the mark going away after a few minutes and it was a before and after to show that it really didn't do any damage. Still, I cringe that I hurt them by doing that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was diagnosed at 21 and graduated college at 23 so I totally get where you're at. Basically I didn't party and lost out on a social life. Part of it was that I was too depressed to go out. Part of it knowing that when I drank I got drunk super super fast and was affected for about 3 days before I got back to normal. Never smoked weed so I can't help you with that one. Like someone said, it's not that you can't, it's that your consequences will be very different. Sometimes a great party with 2 or 3 drinks was worth it for the crap I felt like afterwards. Most of the time it wasn't. I get where your parents are coming from but it's also not like you're 16 and it's underage drinking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure this is going to get way downvoted to high hell but I'm trying to see Trump's side. Not saying I agree but trying to see what he may have meant. I would *like* to translate it as saying we need better mental healthcare and if someone has expressed homicidal tendencies that they need more intense help and need to be held and assessed to see if they are a risk. I don't believe he's talking about the typical mentally ill individual. He says a lot of crap but I think this one was not knowing how to express his thoughts. Maybe it was word vomit. Maybe he didn't have a fully thought out idea and said what first popped into his head without a filter or refinement. I agree with getting more people help who have done things like write manifestos or make hit lists or express homicidal tendencies. People agree that there were signs and something should have been done and I think that's what Trump is trying to get at. I think locking away isn't necessarily the answer but I do think there should be more evaluations in the extreme cases or if there is enough concern about a person's behavior. Edit: the evaluations would be for anyone with a red flag, regardless of diagnosed mental illness or not. Think El Paso. Could have been evaluated and they found a threat. Mental illness had nothing to do with it. Hate did.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-07 05:14:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>People on here and in my regular life have said it before, I should break up with my boyfriend because of how he treats me. I'm going to focus on one thing here, not the dozen that are on my mind. He holds my actions against me no matter how much time has passed. Example, about a year ago (he remembers the exact date) he came to my place, turned the temperature down, and turned the fan on. This had been a recurring thing when he visited and I brought up that it was too cold for me and he didn't care. One night he went to do that again and apparently I flipped out saying it was my place and he shouldn't be touching my air. He brought that up because I said I thought I was pretty stable last year from September-December. This happened last September. Ok maybe I snapped at him. Ok maybe I was irritable. Ok maybe I was impatient. Bipolar or not sometimes people snap. And he won't let it go. This is just one example. He holds it against me that when he would visit I didn't always have his space cleaned up and I wouldn't offer him food or drinks and I didn't get up to greet him. Ok well the depression is why the place was a mess. The depression is why I was stuck on the couch and not hyped up to see him. We've also been together for 4.5 years and I feel like we don't need to be overly affectionate just because the other walks in the room. I go out and get drinks for him since he doesn't like what I like. I always ask him where he wants to go to eat or if I can get him anything so the food and drink part confuses me. The others are due to bipolar symptoms but he doesn't see it that way. He sees it as me not caring. That's only true to an extent. I don't care *because* I'm depressed. I'm doing relatively better now but that doesn't matter to him because of how I've acted in the past. Maybe my issue is that I don't have the capacity to care enough about others the way I should be able to. I'm thinking about breaking up with him but I feel like if I do I'll be alone forever and I won't find someone else who will put up with any of my crap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Clothes without strings or underwire, slippers, a comfy sweatshirt and sweatpants, they'll have toiletries but they suck so ask if you can bring your own, entertainment (books), if you have a journal they'll let you bring it and probably let you borrow a pencil to write in it in a common area. Be prepared to be bored. The groups take up some time but there's also a lot of down time. Have an open mind. There will likely be people there that are worse than you. There may be people with different levels of functioning. Your meds will definitely change. Ask questions when you have some. Oh, phone numbers. Write down phone numbers of people you'll want to call on a piece of paper or index card. I spent a lot of time on the phone with people when I was there. Phones are generally only allowed outside of group times and not in the middle of the night. Not your cell phone, one hooked up to a wall. One place allowed me to have my own blanket, one didn't.

    <TEXT>Out of pocket. Those closest to me say they noticed a difference. Teacher ending summer break so I haven't seen a ton of people so I don't have a ton of feedback. The way someone put it I seen more "natural" whereas before everything I said was a little more reserved and a little more calculated like I was a little on edge. The suicidal thoughts went away which for me is huge. They're starting to peep back but I think that's extreme stress (fight with boyfriend and school starting) but still totally manageable and I can shut them down pretty easily which I typically can't do. I'm still on meds. Lamictal (there's an interaction with ketamine, makes it less effectice), wellbutrin, and latuda. Getting on a different mood stabilizer is ideal but none of the others worked for me without major side effects. You do still have to be on meds with ketamine. The way I heard it put is that it's not a mood stabilizer, it helps depression. One if their questions for me was if I ever had psychosis because there is that risk if you have a history of it. I'm not doing super great right now, a week and a half after my first set of 6 infusions. My first maintenance dose hasn't happened yet. I don't know yet if the effects will stick around. I'm going to ask my pdoc to add lexapro to help with the extreme anxiety I'm having at the moment and maybe get off of it in the future when the situations are over. It's my 4th year of teaching but the anxiety matches year 1. That's independent of the ketamine. I'm also in therapy which helps some. My therapist said there's a difference. I used to be a couch potato but thanks to ketamine I was able to get up and do things. Now I'm a couch potato again. Hopefully the maintenance dose fixes that. It worked so well at first but it's wearing off. I'm optimistic that over time it'll keep building up in my system and things will even out. If you have questions about the infusions themselves let me know. I'm happy to answer any questions about anything. I hope this covered some of what you were wondering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I posted on here about each of my first 6 infusions. Now a week and a half after they ended I'm so anxious I want to puke and I can't sleep. It's situational, nasty fight with the boyfriend and school starting. 4th year teaching but I still get the jitters I guess. That's with sleep meds. My depression is somewhat back and my productivity is gone. I'm back to being a couch potato. My first maintenance dose is a month after the end of my first set of 6. I don't know if that'll be a magic fix or if the effects of that infusion will last. I don't know if me slipping is because of my big change in routine. I'm going to ask my doctor to add lexapro next time I see them, at least for now. I've been on it before and it went well from what I remember. *Sigh* I felt like I was so close to the magic cure.</TEXT>

Cogentin can also be used for akathesia. It does so much to help me that I guess I can't go without it. Did you cold turkey or taper down? Try tapering down over the course of weeks. For me at a lower dose the akathesia disappeared. Maybe it will for you and a lower dose can be effective. Just a thought. I'm sorry you're going through this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This belongs on /r/teachers but they can be really mean there. My kids are so low. So so so low. I basically give them the answer to something, or literally give them the answer, and they still can't do it. One class's behavior is already out of control. I can't. I cried in my principal's office today. I've been crying on and off since getting home. I'm barely eating, I'm not drinking, my sleep sucks. I'm such a mess. I can't do this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're soooooo low. They can't even fill in sentence stems. 6th graders. How can I work with that without giving them every answer? Even when I give them the answers they sometimes get it wrong or do it wrong. They can't answer simple questions (what is the variable here even after I say multiple times what a variable is and that the wing span is the one thing we're changing, multiple times) and I'm at such a loss. I used to go to the other teachers in my grade level about it but they both left. They always made me feel better because their kids couldn't do the stuff too. The difference is I changed how I'm teaching it so it's more engaging and less just copying notes, doing a reading, maybe a lab that's way too hard for them, test. What I gave them this week was meant to be easy and merely to grade how long it takes them to do labs. 4 days for what should be one day and we're only doing half of it. I get meeting them at their level but when I give them super structured sentence stems and they still can't do it what am I supposed to do?</TEXT>

I want to give in to the thoughts. I want to let them win. Why not? They're just going to keep coming back. They'll never go away for good. Why keep fighting a losing battle?

    <TEXT>With the start of a new school year and teaching 6th graders comes a lot of anxiety, especially when one class won't behave or listen to a word I say. I'm only sleeping a few interrupted hours a night, I'm not able to eat, and I keep clenching my jaw. It's anxiety. I've already lost 6 lbs which I'm totally cool with because you know, former seroquel weight and 60 lb weight gain between that, lithium, remeron, and depakote. I fell asleep around 8 and woke up before midnight. I was only able to get down around 500 calories all day. Suicidal thoughts are coming back because I feel so helpless. I did have a med change recently where we dropped remeron for lexapro so that could be a part of it. I go for more ketamine next week which may help the anxiety. I reached out to a teacher I used to work with who knows about my bp and anxiety and has anxiety herself. She had a totally awful class last year with no support from admin so I'm asking her for advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have a choice but to work with this other teacher. We teach the same content. We have a bad history but that's not why I can't work with her. She has an incredibly sharp tone and she's loud and being around her for too long makes me so anxious I want to, and sometimes do, cry. I talked to my principal about this and she said I really don't have a choice. I don't know how to make it work. We say cut toxic people out of your life but this isn't an option. I need help figuring out how to make this work. I'll be talking about this with my therapist tomorrow but I honestly don't see a solution. This other teacher is cocky. I'm the only one that's taught this content before but she swears she knows everything even though she's never even read through the learning objectives, not like I have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the problem with that is our history. I'm the science teacher and my first year teaching 3 years ago she was the math teacher. She told the kids I treated them badly, said I need to change my attitude, told them not to listen to what I said. She would have conversations with the other team members in her room and they stopped talking when I walked in. Then when I left they'd shut the door and continue talking. She's a very abrasive person. People say she's nice but I haven't seen that. Her tone won't change. I can almost guarantee her answer would be "well I'm sorry but this is how I talk and I can't change that. You know what I'm saying?" I don't think she does it on purpose but I also don't think she could ever change that. I'm very uncomfortable talking to her.</TEXT>

I don't want to take my meds. I don't want to get off the couch. I don't want to get better. I don't want to do laundry even if it's been almost 2 months. I don't have the energy to self harm. I don't want to watch tv. I don't want to do my hobby. I don't want to give my cat attention. I tried telling someone and they said tell my therapist. Well I last week when I told my therapist more than once that I feel like I belong dead she brushed it off and didn't address it at all. What the fuck am I supposed to do. I feel like I have no purpose in life. I feel like I've tried telling a couple of people and nobody is trying to help me. It's not that they don't care, I guess because I've been to such extremes before they don't see this as a big deal. I'm suffering and I feel like I can't get help.

    <TEXT>My principal just informed me that if I self harm or come up with a suicide plan that she has to report it to the district and the district creates a safety plan. Has anyone had this happen? What could they even do for a safety plan? I live alone. They can't take away any supplies. I don't know how they would control medication. What's the scope of what they could control? What if I break my safety contract repeatedly? What if I can't stop self harming? I'm not currently but I plan on starting again soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've burned before but it was in a way that didn't leave a mark. I've strangled myself before but not to the point of passing out. It's been months and months and months since I've harmed. Yesterday I cut for the first time. I meant to scratch myself but it was sharper than I realized and did a little cut. There are three tiny cuts on the side of my arm. A bandaid can cover it. I reached out for help. I tried four hotlines and they were all info based, not for talking. I texted the crisis line twice and they were no help. I emailed my therapist and she never responded. I was supposed to have an appointment but it got cancelled because of bad weather and I really needed to see her. The people in my life don't know how to handle it or what to say. I have someone saying I need to be hospitalized. At this point I'm not suicidal. I've been hospitalized twice before. I don't want to go back. I am bipolar. I am going through med changes. I am on my period for the first time in seven months. I'm sure those are contributing factors. What's wrong with me? Why am I doing this? Why don't those in my life have anything to say? Why can't I get help when I'm trying so hard to get it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm 26. I feel like I'm too old to be starting my self harm journey but, bipolar, so crazy is what I am. I cut for the first time two days ago. Tiny, very tiny, not noticable, I don't see why everyone freaked out. I'm generally very open about my struggles with certain people so people knew because I told them. The person I'm the closest to is my principal. She made me sign a safety contract and now the district is involved. I'm not mad about it. I thought I would be but I'm not. The problem is I find the safety contract bullshit and a CYA piece of paper that means nothing to me and I don't want to follow it. What if I don't follow it? I want to keep cutting. I want to try it again. It didn't hurt at all. I'm realizing places that can be hidden and I could still wear shorts and short sleeves. But that would mean not telling anyone and that's so unlike me. There's also a network of people talking behind my back and I don't want it getting back to my mom who would fly to where I live and cause more harm than good. I'm thinking about going back to burning. I would rather cut. I know how to burn without it leaving a mark. It would be a less harmful replacement but people would still hate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sent this to my mom This is really hard for me to say but here it goes. It's really hard for me to go to you about things because of how things were handled in the past. They first noticed something was wrong with me in 2nd grade. When I asked you why I was getting pulled out of class you said because I wasn't smiling as much as the other kids. So if I smiled more I wouldn't get taken out of class. So that's what I did. I faked the smiles even if it felt stupid and I stopped getting pulled out of class. That's when I learned I had to fake it and hide things from people. You never brought it up again. I remember getting depressed starting in 6th or 7th grade and by 9th I was depressed all the time. You never got me help. When I had my concussion and we saw Dr (neurologist) and he suggested I was depressed and I said yes you said no when I really did need the help and you called him a quack. When the psychologist did the report on my functioning senior year he noted I was depressed and anxious and you didn't get me help. There were so many times where I needed help and you didn't get me help. It all lessened when I moved away to college. The semester I almost dropped out of school it's because I was so depressed I couldn't function. I was catatonic. But I had the attitude that I didn't need help since I'd been through it all before and never got help. When I was diagnosed bipolar you told me I wasn't and we fought and didn't talk for months. You belittled me and told me I was wrong and denied what was wrong with me for two years before you admitted to accepting it. I have never been able to go to you with my problems because you were never there for me. Yes you're trying now but it's too late. That relationship is so broken it can't be fixed while I'm going through this, if ever. I'm not comfortable talking to you about things and I don't think I ever will be. I don't want to have a conversation about it. But that's why I don't want you coming. It's more stressful than it is helpful. I started self harming recently and she found out so she wants to fly to see me and I keep saying no. She isn't accepting no so I sent this. We had a very honest conversation about my past struggles. She had no idea I was depressed and anxious for years. Her hearing I was bipolar was out of the blue. She was so depressed herself she didn't recognize it in me. She thought I was simply ridiculously shy. At times I'm shy, at times I'm outgoing. TLDR mom didn't know I was depressed and just found out I self harm and overreacted wanting to help and I was like no.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-23 22:06:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was doing pretty ok over the summer. A little depressed but manageable. I started getting ketamine and was doing great. Then I got an IUD. Cue rage, irritability, more extreme self harm than ever before, incredibly suicidal, angry, problems sleeping and eating, problems with hygiene, wicked depression. It was the IUD. I was getting almost daily migraines and stabbing cramps. So today I'm getting it taken out. I'm kinda terrified of the after effects while my body adjusts to producing its own hormones again. A lot of people get mood swings and they're people without a mental illness. I won't be surprised if I have to be hospitalized until my hormones even out. I wish I could just stay with someone for a week or two but I was told no by the person I'd rather stay with and I'm closest with. Depakote totally gets rid of my period which is apparently unhealthy in the long run. I went 7 months without one. So I need something to help with the uterine lining. Hormones are a big no no apparently so I don't know what my options are. All I know is fuck hormones.</TEXT>

According to two doctors the remeron affects the brain similarly to how seroquel does. Seroquel was great for my sleep but they don't like you being on two antipsychotics together so that's why we switched me from seroquel to remeron. I'm on 15 mg remeron now and it isn't enough. Seroquel was great aside from the weight gain and high cholesterol. It was great for my mood. But I couldn't drop latuda safely. The withdrawal was too much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First stay was last March. Second stay was this February. Here comes the third. My goal is to get ECT. Clearly meds aren't the answer for me and I need an extra boost or reset or whatever. I'll have reddit access while I'm in, we get computers once or twice a day. Hopefully it goes well and I can get some things sorted out. I'm back at the place where I had my second stay. It was good enough for me to come back. It didn't send me running as far and as fast as I could when they let me out the doors. ECT stories appreciated. I got a couple of responses on my last post that mentioned it. And yes I've tried ketamine.</TEXT>

Best parts are it's for young adults (I'm 26) and happens at night so I won't have to miss school. Unfortunately it's about 50 miles away but I'm ok with that if it helps. Perks of living next to one of the biggest cities in the country. ECT didn't pan out because the doctor is on vacation and today they told me he isn't even taking new patients so I'll have to ask if they can make an exception, but I don't know why they would.

    <TEXT>Pre diagnosis I always did things at the last minute. I got things done but barely. When I was diagnosed I couldn't focus and do my work at all. They prescribed wellbutrin to help with this and some depression and it helped immensely. Jump ahead 5 years and they took away wellbutrin when they cut my meds down in the hospital. Now I can't grade student work or put in lesson plans. I don't have an ADD diagnosis but it's suspected. I've never been tested. I did have a concerta and adderall prescription (totally legal) in college and it's what allowed me to study and pass. I only took it when I desperately needed to because it made me so sick. Problem is it made me horribly sick and too wired. How do y'all treat or cope with the inattention? I don't want to say "I have ADD" since there's no diagnosis but I do have those tendencies, as noted by a doctor, and I have been somewhat medicated for it in the past, but now that I'm bipolar I'm afraid of stimulants and increased anxiety/irritability/potential mania.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I don't know for sure if I'm on the right meds but I've had quite the journey. 27 or 28 meds over 5 years. Most I was on at one time was 7, usually 4 plus ativan as needed. Most recently they tried taking me off of most of my meds and surprisingly it helped. Now I'm only on latuda and remeron. We raised the latuda dose a little and like magic I'm fine. Historically the latuda stops working so well after a few weeks so I am nervous. When they decreased all my meds I was so bad before that happened that I was willing to try ECT. Now I'm looking into targeted TMS. I've already tried ketamine. It helped a lot but the effects didn't last, even with the boosters every month. So now I'm only on two meds and it's so much better than when I was on 3 or 4. I guess the wellbutrin and lamictal together made me more unstable and dropping wellbutrin was a good thing. Go figure. Right now I don't get as angry, my anxiety is there but within an acceptable range, my depression isn't killer.</TEXT>

In case the language didn't tip it off I'm a teacher and deal with behavior all the time. Kids need to know what to expect in order to know how to act. Things won't change overnight but I do believe you should give him more structure before his mom gets home. He isn't developing good work habits by his mom doing his homework for him. Just my two cents from a teacher perspective. We all have days where we're more irritable and we explode. You're human. Don't be too hard on yourself but do recognize that it happened. I've exploded on entire classes before. My worst was over a stolen highlighter. Ugly ugly ugly. Yours sounds much more justified.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Think about it this way. You have symptoms that lessen your quality of life. It was bar enough for you to warrant getting help. Now you're getting help and things are getting better. Does the label truly matter? Eventually you'll realize that how you felt before lamictal isn't normal and you do have a mental illness that needs to be treated and you're better off now. It'll all be ok. Also bipolar 2 and lamictal was also my first med. I've tried something like 27 or 28 meds total so don't be surprised if lamictal isn't "the one" and you need to add a second or third or they take you off lamictal to try something else. I've been trying to find the right meds for over 5 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't mean for it to be intimidating. I wished I knew it could be a long journey but I didn't have any resources like this when I was diagnosed. I thought lamictal was "the one" and I'd only need one med. Having to add a second was rough. By now trying a new one doesn't bother me at all and gives me hope that there are still options and things could still get better. Some people only need to be on one or two. Some people need to be on a few. Some people only need to try a couple to get to a good combo, but the reality is that many need more BUT you should always keep trying because there are always still options. I was told a long time ago that I was out of options. That was literally 20 meds ago. The ones I'm on now that are helping a lot weren't considered options by that doctor but are literally lifesavers now. Another thing, needing to switch doctors happens. I've seen more than I'm going to admit on this thread, and I've switched for a variety of reasons. You must have a good relationship with your pdoc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! Not normally but it has happened. I've even posted on Facebook about it but always later edited it out. When I get into self harm and suicidal I tell a circle of people, which is odd, you'd think I'd hide it. Not family. But some coworkers and certain friends. I have no idea why I told so many people I was self harming. Some because I wanted help, others because I just wanted to update them since they know about my bipolar and say to let them know if I need anything. I guess it doesn't really make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We had training on how kids respond to trauma yesterday and I learned that my childhood was full of trauma. I'm not handling it well. Lots of crying and therapy isn't until Thursday. All I want is to be alone but I can't be because my mom is visiting, who is one of the people that inflicted the trauma. I had to go home from the training and see her. I stayed in my car for a very long time crying before going up to my apartment. She has no return flight but I need her gone. I got suicidal this morning and the person I talk to the most told me to tell her but I refuse. She denied my diagnosis for years. That relationship isn't there. I don't want it to be there. She's here because she knows I was hospitalized but she thinks I simply went in for a quick med adjustment. Not a total lie but not the whole truth either. I regret letting her come and I don't know how to tell her to leave. Now I feel like everyone would be better off without me.</TEXT>

I'm the same way when I get home and on the weekends. What helped me is when my therapist told me I can't take Saturday and Sunday off, I have to be productive one of those days. Meal prep, grocery shop, maybe do laundry, force yourself to do essential things once you identify what the essential things are. Make a routine for yourself for after work, even if it's as simple as cooking and putting the dishes in the sink and setting your clothes out for the next day. Routine, routine, routine. I suck at this so I'm the last person that should be giving advice but it's what others and my therapist have told me. Therapist is a good place to start getting better if you don't have one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why not go to the hospital? The second time I went I was BAD. I was there for 8 days doing a huge med change. They can make med changes way faster in a controlled setting. I fought it a lot but ultimately I'm glad I went. I went to the hospital a few weeks ago out of frustration that I felt out of options treatment wise and I had no control and I was suicidal and self harming. I was only there for 3 days. I stabilized very quickly. My first hospitalization was only 3 days too. Each time I left with new meds and so much more stable. Today was my first time getting suicidal since being in there and it already somewhat passed. A good hospital makes a world of difference. It sounds like you'd really benefit from a rapid med change in a controlled setting instesd of spending weeks and months getting to where you could get in days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lamictal was my first med and it helped a lot at the time. We worked up to 200mg but it was too much side effect wise so we settled on 125. 50mg is nothing. Your body may adjust to the 25 then the 50 and while it's helping now it may not always help. I was worried I'd get the rash and thought I did but it was nothing. Side effects seem scary until you've gotten so many side effects from so many meds you almost lost count. Trust me when I say there are scarier side effects than the rash once you've been playing the med game long enough given how rare the rash is and how common mania and suicidal thoughts are with other meds. You're going slow enough that personally I wouldn't worry about the rash. I went on lamictal the second time I was on it way faster than you are and no problems at all.</TEXT>

I swear I did better my first year. I did 5th at first then they moved me to 6th. I'm k-6 certified currently just teaching science. I've only ever taught science. I'm thinking about switching to high school where they have things to work for (no pass no play, have to get course credit). I know high school would have its own problems but I don't know what they would be. I'd be able to find a job since I'd test for science and they can always use science teachers. Some are telling me to go down to 4th grade but I'm not an ooey gooey people pleaser let's all be friends so I may have to test up instead of going down. I've never done below 5th. I liked 5th curriculum a lot but the problems are probably too similar to 6th. All I know is I can't keep doing 6th. I'm not a special enough type of person to handle middle school. I don't know what my next steps are. Long term I want to go get my masters in curriculum and instruction and be in charge of curriculum somewhere but I don't feel ready for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like the lows aren't portrayed enough and people just think of mania. I was diagnosed after walking in knowing I was bipolar. I had a history with depression but when I developed a temper I knew something was wrong. Some research told me it was bipolar. I went to my university's mental health center and they made me go to a couple of counseling sessions before I could meet with a psychiatrist so they could say yes, you have a severe enough problem that needs medication. I did a questionnaire and was diagnosed right then and there at the first appointment with a pdoc and got started on medication. The med journey has been rough. Seeing a depiction of a hospitalization that isn't a horror story would be nice. I've never gone from being manic. I've only gone for being suicidal and self harming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I'm not manic. This is according to both my therapist and the person I'm closest to that keeps tabs on me. Then why do I still have mood swings? Why do I still have no motivation? Why do I still get suicidal and depressed? So I'm told not to change anything yet I don't feel stable but people are telling me I've never been this stable. I don't see my pdoc again until January because I thought things were fine. Then why did I almost start crying in public today? Why did it take me 3 hours to get out of bed this morning? They wanted me on fewer meds so I'm on fewer meds. So what, I never get to go on more than 2 again or I end up the same mess I was when I was on 7? I don't know what to do. Living seems like such a waste. Spending time until you die with no point in any of it. I feel lost and like I can't be helped. If I had a way to kill myself I would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a young adult DBT group they told me about at my last hospitalization. It's far but it's supposed to be good. My therapist isn't trained in DBT but she wants to try some of it to get me started. Routine wise I already go to bed at the same time every day. Weekends I sleep in a little later because there's no way I'm going to choose to wake up at 6 on a Saturday for no reason. So I wake up around 8ish. Eating at all is difficult so eating healthy is out of the question. Let's get two meals a day down and I'll be happy. Exercise always makes my mood flip and I get really depressed while I'm doing it, even just going for a walk. Bad experience the last time I tried going to a support group so I refuse to go back. They turned me and the person I went with away and we were put in the caregiver group where we got to hear how terrible bipolar people are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Melatonin before going to sleep the first time? When I had serious sleep issues nothing kept me asleep but different things would put me to sleep. Melatonin and unisom both helped as far as over the counter goes, but sometimes I did have to take two unisom. Temazepam is what they prescribed me for sleep and that worked. Atarax also helped, that's a prescription. Try melatonin first. Heck, even two benadryl can be helpful in times like that. Worth a shot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone around me that I'm close to says I'm doing a lot better. Today my mood flipped enough for me to recognize it but still function perfectly fine. That's when it hit me. My mood hasn't been flipping constantly like it used to. I'm so much more stable. I don't lose my shit at my students, even when they deserve it, I have my lesson plans in for this week on time, I did an online training I needed to before the deadline, I made twice baked potatoes from scratch yesterday and cleaned up, I'm at least thinking about unloading the dishwasher which I never do, I'm bathing regularly, I'm down 10 lbs but that's because I'm skipping both breakfast and lunch since I'm not hungry, despite not being hungry I can still eat supper regularly, I did my makeup today, I had my first not bad weekend in a long time, things are going right. What changed? Fewer meds. Most I've ever been on at one time is 7 and I still wasn't stable. Now I'm on 2 and getting ketamine and doing fine. We raised the latuda dose to 100 since 120 gave me intolerable side effects and I was at 80 for a very long time and it's made all the difference. I'm finally at a place where we can focus on my past trauma in therapy. And I'm on remeron to help me sleep. I never would have thought that I'd be stable without all the other meds or that I'd be able to concentrate without wellbutrin. Well here I am. My concentration is iffy but as long as I'm not depressed I can do what I need to, sex drive sucks but it's a little better, memory sucks, but otherwise no side effects. Fewer meds can be the answer. Go figure. Thinking about doing targeted TMS, neurostar, after the new year but can't currently afford it. It would be close to $2000 after insurance. Targeted TMS is supposed to be better than regular TMS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did genesight, the genetic test, and it wasn't helpful for me. Most meds were "green" (there's green, yellow, and red), even meds that had given me horrific side effects. It's about whether you'd metabolize them well, it doesn't say if it would work or not or give you bad side effects. I was shocked that my worst meds were all green. Go figure. Do your research. Know your options. More meds doesn't always mean more stable. I'm oddly stable on fewer meds. I've tried 27 or 28 meds in mostly 3 years and it's been rough. Don't be against a hospital stay for a rapid med change if you're really unstable and a danger to yourself. It's how I stabilized so fast this time. Did the change in days instesd of months. That's my biggest piece of advice. Hospitals can be a good place to change meds rapidly and safely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's possible he's just trying to be a hard ass and is saying shit. I have a student from another state and the parents were neglectful so she lives with her grandparents now. They threatened to send her back to the other state if she didn't get her act together just to threaten her since no number of talks or punishments worked but they had no intention of sending her back. Just my thought when I read this. Also on latuda. I've been struggling to take it with food but it's essentially my only med now and I NEED it to function so I eat even when I really don't want to and recently I haven't been wanting to. You have to, it's that simple. Frozen waffles are a good meal for latuda. Light and easy to get down while being calorie dense. Each one is around 200 cal so two waffles and you're good. Tonight my calories were cookies and a coke. I get how hard it can be to eat with latuda sometimes but it really doesn't work well when you don't eat with it and since raising my dose to 100mg I'm the most stable I've ever been. Latuda is easily the best med I've ever been on, and I've been on like 27 or 28 so that's saying something. We do impact others a lot when we don't take our meds properly. Think, of course our mood goes nuts but others see more than we realize. The snapping, depression, lack of energy, it's hard for us but also hard for them. I honestly doubt he would hate you, but I don't doubt that he would be frustrated. He was probably trying to make a point and it came across as far harsher than he meant it. Maybe have a talk with him about how that particular phrase hurt you. I need to have a similar talk with my boyfriend about a comment he told me so I get it being hard. But it may be necessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At probably my worst I was self harming (strangling and burning) and very suicidal. Like probably shouldn't have been left alone. One particular night I was strangling myself and talking to people about it. I'm oddly open about my struggles with select people. One offered to have me come over and stay with them but I refused. I later regretted that after learning how upset that made them. My principal called me into her office one day and talked to me about what was going on. She's one of the ones I'm open with. She said how she worried and was losing sleep and was at a loss since I was turning down her help and she told me I needed to go to the hospital. I finally agreed that the hospital was on the horizon. I went home and eventually packed a bag and put it in my car but it took a couple days to go in. The day I went in I was on my way to school and texted her that I was still suicidal. She called me up and said as my boss she was making me go. Another staff member brought me to the hospital. I was in for 8 days. They did an overhaul of my meds. It took all that time to stabilize. I still wanted to kill myself while in the hospital and thought of ways to try. Eventually I calmed down and things were ok. I desperately needed that hospitalization. I easily could have died without it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do regular ketamine. Expensive but it's only once a month after the initial set of 6. No insurance for it. So maybe that could be more of an option than esketamine. The ketamine wears off and doesn't work well if you're on lamictal. It has done wonders for me but the effects don't last. A higher dose of latuda made an enormous difference so right now I'm not sure what to attribute my good mood to. Meds make a huge difference. I've tried 27 or 28 and thought all was lost but now I'm reasonably stable, all things considered. It's thanks to raising my latuda dose. All hope isn't lost. Seroquel was great for me. Latuda is amazing. Many others not so much but I liked those. Just my two cents.</TEXT>

If you can consider checking out /r/therapeuticketamine. Don't give up until you've truly exhausted all options. The right combo of stuff is out there somewhere. Also consider looking into a DBT program. That could help as well. I found one but haven't started it yet. I believe there's the potential for you to get better.

    <TEXT>You may need more than one med. If you get brain fog your lamictal dose is too high. I had it at 200mg. I ended up on 150 with another 150 wellbutrin for a long time. Overall I've tried something like 27 meds and I think I finally found something that works. It's taken quite a few years and I've had a few hospitalizations along the way but I'm in a much better place now. Therapy also helps so consider adding that if you haven't already. Your journey may not be as complicated as mine, I'm just sharing my story. There were times where doctors told me I was out of options or I'd never get better. But I kept trying and I'm glad I did because I'm in such a better place now than I was when they told me that. Not all doctors are good, you may need to try a couple before you get one you work well with. There's nothing wrong with needing to switch doctors.</TEXT>

Turns out what I needed wasn't more meds, it was a higher dose of latuda. Being on 5+ meds at a time wasn't the answer. Go figure. Don't give up completely, find a different combo and keep trying! Had I given up trying I wouldn't be where I am today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meds that have helped me sleep are remeron (weak antidepressant), seroquel (antipsychotic), atarax (antihistamine), and temazepam (benzo). Currently on remeron, works as well as seroquel did for sleep. Seroquel helped my mood a lot but it did make me gain weight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could latuda cause those things? I guess that's the cost of being stable. I'm losing weight which, woohoo, but it's because I'm barely eating and that's not healthy. The memory loss sucks but I've had it before. This is the most stable I've been in years so med change isn't really an option. Any tips for getting latuda calories with no appetite?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a GP do my refills but he refused to change my doses. It's worth a shot. A GP that's in an independent place is probably more likely to be "allowed" to prescribe them, whereas if they're part of a big chain they'll have more rules about what they can and can't prescribe. Just my experience. Going to your last pdoc and asking for refills is what I'd try first. Or ask if you can have appointments with them over the phone and explain your situation. I've done video chat with a pdoc before. Good luck! I haven't seen it mentioned but without insurance check good rx for prices. They'll show you what each pharmacy charges and some have coupons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to be terrified of antipsychotics but now I see them as just another option. I've been on latuda for a few years and it helps so much that I'm not scared of long term side effects, I'm thankful it allows me to do so well after having tried 27 or 28 meds. Would I rather have long term side effects that may or may not happen or be dead from being suicidal? Being miserable on different meds would be guaranteed. Potential brain shrinkage, well, I already have brain damage from head injuries so what's a little more? FWIW from what I've read lithium can help to heal your brain and restore gray matter.</TEXT>

Yeah it's another prescription but it doesn't really do anything for your mood since it's a weak antidepressant and the lower the dose the better it helps you sleep. I went days without sleep when I was going through seroquel withdrawal and remeron solved it. I could probably try going without it but it's not doing any harm so I don't have a problem taking it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have accidents regularly. Like sometimes multiple times a week. It has to be the higher dose of latuda. But I'm soooooooooooooooooooo much more stable now. 28 meds and I'm finally mostly stable. But I'm 26 and peeing myself like a toddler potty training. And I'm a teacher so I can't get up and go whenever I need to. Fortunately I haven't had an accident at school yet but I feel like it's only a matter of time. Is the stability worth this? It's the most stable I've been since getting diagnosed like 5 or 6 years ago. My suicidal thoughts lasted like 10 seconds today and I was fine. My pants are too tight to wear a poise pad so that's not an option and I don't have accidents every day so it would feel like a waste.</TEXT>

But I figured it would strengthen our relationship and that's not a bad thing. The house should be ready for me to move over the summer. Boyfriend is upset about it. We don't live together and we're long distance but he's not as mad as he was. I'm finally stable enough to make this decision. It's within my price range and in a very modest area. I'm not so depressed I can't make the meetings and the idea of moving is overwhelming, I'm not manic and trying to do this by February when my lease is up. I got a 6 month lease to carry me over to the summer when I don't have school and I can move at my leisure. It feels good. I guess I really am stable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What are some really easy food ideas? Appetite issues.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-13 03:19:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm having appetite problems and I think based on my hunger level this would be a good place to get ideas from. I am looking to continue losing weight. So far I've lost 10lbs simply from eating around at most 1000 but usually closer to 500 cal per day because I'm simply not hungry. I want to get it closer to 1200 cal. I struggle with mental health problems so motivation is an issue. I usually don't have breakfast, maybe a granola bar as a morning snack, I have no motivation to pack a lunch, and I only eat supper because I have to eat 350 cal for a drug I take (latuda) and I usually end up eating around a 400 cal snack, like a muffin or a couple pieces of leftover frozen pizza. I allow myself to eat out once or twice a week, but my goal is once a week, and that meal is usually about 1000 cal right there which is all of my calories for the day. Any tips for someone with no appetite? Any tips for things that are super easy to put together? No cottage cheese or hummus, I think those are the biggies. Trader Joe's is a drive but could be worth it if I want enough stuff.</TEXT>

My therapist thinks it's like a backswing from the weight gain but that doesn't make sense to me physiologically. The decreased appetite is listed as a rare latuda side effect and my latuda dose did go up recently so I'm guessing it's that. I'm not starving, I eat when I'm hungry but I've been eating a lot less fast food trying to be healthier. My body is used to fast food 3-4 times a week and now I'm down to fast food 1-2 times a week which is still a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do understand. I'm sleeping ok. I'll grab some almonds on my way home today. I have granola to add to the yogurt. My doctor and therapist both believe that I'm stable. My last hospitalization took me off lamictal and wellbutrin and left me on latuda and remeron. Oddly enough taking me off most of my meds and raising the latuda a little is what I needed. My anxiety is way down, I'm functioning better, I can make it through the whole school day without shutting down towards the end, the higher dose of latuda is why I'm not hungry. It's a side effect, not a mood thing. But I do recognize that typically it's a mood thing so without seeing all the ways where I'm doing so much better I see how it could look like I'm not doing well. This is the best I've been since pre diagnosis and everyone agrees with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried 27 or 28 meds and I'm finally pretty stable. Turns out what I needed was fewer meds but a higher dose of latuda. 80 helped but not all the way and 120 gave me akathesia. After a couple years and a few different doctors one thought to try 100 mg of latuda and wow. World of difference. Now I'm living, on a scale of -10 to +10, at a -1 which is pretty damn good considering where I used to be. I'm also on remeron for sleep. So overall, fewer meds was better for me. I was on 7 at once at one point and it still didn't feel like enough. I was on what I thought was the highest doses I could handle for some and moderate doses for others. Higher dose of latuda is all I needed. It took way too long to figure that out but at least we figured it out eventually.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got my first set of 6 in July or August. I've been getting monthly infusions since. My most recent was on Monday. It's now Thursday. I'm suicidal and want to self harm. I was stable for months, since October, thanks to a hospitalization and med adjustment, but now it's all gone to crap. If I'm like this the same week I got ketamine then what's the point? I'm diagnosed bipolar 2.</TEXT>

My psychiatrist is ok with me doing ketamine but doesn't really believe in it. She says the data isn't good. So she asks how it's going but doesn't want anything to do with it herself. She wants me to do TMS instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My pdoc wants me to do targeted TMS. Apparently it's better than regular TMS. No memory issues, you can drive the same day, way less risk. It uses similar to MRI magnets to target certain areas of the brain. I don't know a ton about it and haven't gotten it done yet but I have gotten the process started.</TEXT>

Not in a depressing what's the point of living way, in an I can figure this out way. Sleep is controlled by remeron so that hasn't changed. Appetite is gone.

    <TEXT>In the past two weeks I had a therapy session that didn't go how I would have liked me to and sent me into a tailspin, had a minor med change that screwed things up for a few days, my grandma died so I took a few days off and flew across the country for her funeral, returned and my 6th graders were horrible, and all of that made me kinda depressed. I appear fine but eating is a struggle, showering regularly isn't happening, getting dressed is hard, waking up in the morning is so difficult, I'm behind in grading and lesson plans, and I feel slowed down. By those measures I guess I'm depressed. I don't care about anything at all. My therapist pretty much said to ride it out. She didn't make a goal of figuring out coping skills to use to get better. She said I'll get better eventually. Idk maybe she sees it as a super temporary thing and since I have been doing well she thinks I'll do well again soon. It doesn't feel great for her to not even tell me to try certain things. Maybe she's being realistic. Maybe she's being optimistic. But really what happened is she wasn't helpful and that makes me more depressed. The person I go to for support isn't responding to me about any of my mood stuff. I don't feel like I have any support at all right now. Hoping for some sort of responses on here so I can feel like some people care.</TEXT>

This past session she said don't bother trying to use coping skills this time, the time before I brought up issues (why do I always get sexually harrassed) and she said "because you're cute" and that was it. I wanted a discussion. So I told her I don't think I'm cute and I have low self esteem and she said no I don't and left it at that. No making me understand her side or "reality" I guess you could call it. I still don't understand why people are always sexually harassing me. Other people are attractive and it doesn't happen to them. I feel totally dismissed. She thinks the answer is simple but I don't. I should tell her all of that? I don't want to hurt her feelings.

    <DATE>2020-02-16 03:21:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm talking all kinds of relationships. Family, friends, coworkers, romantic, all of them. I teach middle school and I have a hard time forming relationships with my kids. I focus on content. Growing up I didn't have many friends. With my boyfriend I give very little affection and don't really care very much about him anymore. Does anyone else have problems with all sorts of relationships or is it just me? I've had friends a few times in my life, when I was with like minded people in AP classes and a little bit in college. I'm incredibly smart and can't relate to an average extroverted person. I don't have that "it" factor that makes people want to be around me. I don't know why I'm odd and people don't like me. I really don't know why I am and always have been so different than everyone else. Someone recently told me im so smart they're intimidated to have a conversation with me. Why would being intelligent change anything? I know random crap but my bipolar makes me dumb. I've been told that even on my worst days I'm smarter than most people on their best days. How can anyone know that? I work as a middle school teacher with an elementary certification. It's not like I'm an engineer or have a job that requires actually being smart. I never know what to talk about with people. I don't know how to start a conversation. I wonder if crappy parental relationships and childhood trauma and emotional abuse has to do with this. If you read this thank you. It got away from me. I don't know why I can't make relationships and long rambling posts don't help.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-22 02:08:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>We raised my latuda to the max dose and added cogentin since last time my latuda was this high I had akathesia. Now I'm thirsty all the time and super nauseous at night after taking my meds and all morning. I can't pack a lunch because I'm nauseous at any time I might pack it. I have no appetite. I have dry mouth but drinking makes me nauseous so I can't quench the thirst. I'm barely eating and drinking. Well under 1000 calories total. My sleep is fine now so I've stopped the remeron because by the time it's time to take it I'm deliriously tired and fall asleep fine. I feel intoxicated when these meds kick in. No other pill has made me feel drunk and I've tried now close to 30 different meds. Has nausea ever gotten better for anyone over time? Do you think it's the cogentin or the latuda? If I skip my cogentin one night would taking it later at night or in the morning be ok if I do get akathesia? I'm nauseous for too long so if I were to take zofran I'd have to take it multiple times a day and that's not practical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A package of pop tarts is 400 cal. Two frozen waffles, my old go-to, is 400 cal. Each waffle is 200 cal. A small glass of milk is 100ish. So if you do a frozen chocolate chip or strawberry waffle (my two faves) and a big glass of whole milk you're at your calorie limit without it being a ton of food. I know the struggle. I've had plenty of days where even that felt like too much. Sometimes I'd do a grilled cheese at sonic or chicken nuggets and a junior frostie from wendy's and that worked without feeling like a lot. I'm in a place now where even waffles and milk feels like too much so believe me, I get it.</TEXT>

Lamictal can absolutely cause brain fog. When I stopped lamictal they had me do it cold turkey after being on it for years and I was fine. Later I was on it for a few months and stopped suddenly again and was fine again. Just my experience.

    <TEXT>I don't feel as nauseous as I felt on lithium. That was terrible. I was on 100 of latuda and that had me stable for a few months. Then I started getting super depressed and started getting intrusive thoughts. My motivation was lacking. Every time I raised my latuda dose it would work for a while then stop working and we'd need to raise the dose, then I'd be better until we had to raise the dose again. I was at 80 for probably a couple years along with a few other meds. Most I've been on at one time is 7. My most recent hospitalization in October took me off of most of my meds. I think I was on four at the time. Even those four weren't enough. So we tried going off of them, surprise surprise I was still depressed, so since 120 latuda was too much for me in the past we decided to try 100 and that's the most stable I've ever been. So raising the latuda again when I got worse is the most logical thing. A lower dose wouldn't be effective.</TEXT>

I'm losing weight which I'm ok with but it's not in a healthy way. I was hungry earlier today and did some great meal planning and grocery shopping for the week but now I don't want any of it. Add in mild depression and there's no motivation to cook or eat. I don't know what to do. What meds other than benzos have helped your anxiety? Buspar has a super short half life. I react terribly to most antidepressants. Benzos have an interaction with ketamine. It doesn't sound like there's anything left. I don't know how to solve my appetite issues.</TEXT>

The pdoc in the hospital says it works on the same A2 brain receptor even though it's a (weak) antidepressant. It's the only reason I could get off seroquel. It totally negated the withdrawal effects and helps me sleep. Just an idea. Wouldn't hurt to try. A low dose of remeron may be all you need instead of seroquel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are test corrections a thing everywhere? My district does corrections on all failing papers, at teacher's discretion, to get the grade up to a 70. I'm being told to do test corrections with the kids so all kids get a 70 in the gradebook for their test and I disagree with this. I had been giving half credit for corrected answers but if the kid gets a 20 and still doesn't understand the material why should I give them a 70 when they still don't get it? If they could correct and justify their answers on their own, fine. I'll give some credit. But if you failed bad and still don't understand any of the material why should 45% of your average be a 70? Tests are weighted at 45%. I teach middle school science in Texas. Can someone maybe explain to me the logic of giving all kids a 70? The scantron data would not change, only the gradebook data which doesn't get analyzed so it's not a data thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a very irregular period. We tried an IUD and holy hell no. I went insane and got hospitalized. Got that shit taken out. I'm afraid of getting hormones now. My last period was in early December and it's early March now. When I saw the OB a few months ago when the IUD thing was going on they said they'd give me a couple days of hormones to start my period. But I'm terrified of what the couple days of hormones might do to me. I'm not on lamictal anymore so that interaction isn't a worry. We tried loestrin birth control pills but I bled for three months straight so that's not an option. They said I have a higher risk of uterine cancer because of the irregular periods since the lining of my uterus isn't being shed. Anyone else have irregular periods? Any treatment for it?</TEXT>

Fortunately no shopping sprees or desire to spend a bunch of money. I haven't been hypo in so long. I doubt it'll last long. Should I take that adventure and drive somewhere far or should I repress it and do the status quo?</TEXT>

They don't know how unstable I am. We live halfway across the country from each other so it's easy to keep them at arm's length. My childhood was rough so I don't have the best relationship with my parents. My brother knows but we've never talked about it so I don't know his stance. They don't know how often I'm suicidal or that I get suicidal. They don't know that I'm depressed and anxious most of the time and if I say I am they blame it on teaching middle school and not bipolar. They are supportive but they also don't really get it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like that. 7 minutes is a surprisingly long yet short time. You can get a lot done. Then sometimes you want to keep going and that's ok. I have an Alexa in my living room and bathroom (so I can listen to music while I shower) which are the two rooms that need the most work so I could set times on alexa. Someone gave me the idea, maybe my therapist, to do a task and time how long it takes so you see that doing the undesirable task (dishes, laundry, taking out the trash) really doesn't take that long and so just do it and get it over with. I still haven't done that but it's not a bad idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I start TMS on Monday. I'm diagnosed bipolar 2 and I'm on latuda and remeron and get ketamine infusions monthly. What can I expect from TMS in terms of side effects? I've read that when people get relief varies so I know there won't be a consensus on that. I'm prone to headaches so I'm not looking forward to that. Do the headaches go away over time? Does advil make them go away? Is the pain while it's being done or afterwards? I'm mostly going in blind. My provider isn't experienced with this at all. She's very new at it but says it's easy and hard to screw up.</TEXT>

I read some people respond quickly and some don't respond at all. I don't know hardly anything about it. But when you've tried something like 29 meds you start looking for alternative options and that's kinda where I'm at. TMS experiences? What's it like? How long did the good effects last? Did you do more than 36 treatments? How much did it hurt? How long did the pain last? Any other side effects?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ketamine has helped me a lot. It doesn't necessarily last for the full month but functioning for half the month is better than not functioning at all. It's in IV form. They mix it with saline or whatever's normally in an IV bag and they hook it up to your arm and you sit in a chair with a nurse watching you until it's done. You can't drive after because it makes you dizzy. /r/theraputicketamine is a great sub, feel free to check it out.</TEXT>

Some of the activities are short, like a minute long, and some are longer, like half an hour. There are different categories too depending on your mood. Best of all it's free! It's called calmharm. Fantastic free app that's dozens and dozens of coping skills and little activities to distract you. It could totally also be a boredom buster. I hope people read this and download it and give it a try! It's definitely helped me in the past. TLDR free app called calmharm is full of coping skills</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your response! I work as a middle school science teacher and everyone, including my principal, is telling me to leave. Not because I'm doing a bad job, because I could be better appreciated elsewhere. I had an entire class fail this past grading period. Half of them had below a 50. I had a kid with 9 missing assignments. They don't try. Nothing I do can make them try. They say I need a younger grade where the kids follow directions. I'm k-6 certified. TMS may make me realize how shitty my work situation is and make me want to leave, but I worry that wouldn't happen until after this school year is over since I don't think we're going back at all, and it would be into my next contract and too late to back out. Like you, the whole having a job and a schedule that's not just my own keeps me on top of things and keeps me stable. I've been doing much better since my last hospitalization and ketamine has been helping, I'm doing TMS so my lows when the ketamine wears off aren't so low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We didn't even start my first treatment. It was awful. They couldn't find the right spot to find the right pressure or whatever and when they did get a twitch in my fingers the force was so high that when they did the 10 second trial it was excruciating pain though my head and into my eye. Two hours in they eventually gave up and sent me home saying to come back next week and try again. I don't want to go back, ever. It was such a terrible experience.</TEXT>

They couldn't find the right spot to make my fingers twitch then when they finally did twitch a little the force needed was so high that when they did the little 10 second trials it was horrible pain that went through my head and into my eye. I couldn't tolerate it. They told me to go home and reschedule. I don't think I'm going back. That pain was ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few things are holding me back from getting a 4th grade position. The elementary schools get out later. Now I only have to leave about 15 min early to make ketamine and pdoc appointments. If I switched to elementary I'd have to leave over an hour early and that would cause the school hardship. I also have so many resources for what I teach now and going to a lower grade would mean wasted money since some resources would go unused and I'd have nobody to pass them along to. Third reason is my principal. She's the person I go to with everything personal. She's the one that told me about ketamine, she knows all about my bipolar, she's even been with me to my pdoc and therapist. I'd be leaving her for someone unknown. We're actually close, not just work close. But I fear that not being around each other would make us drift apart. I'm comfortable content wise with where I am. I like every part of my job but the kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They couldn't find the right spot. We never even did the first treatment. They had to have the force at over 1.7 which they said they've never had that high. When they did the 10 second trials the pain went from the tapping into my eye and it was excruciating. After two hours of trying they gave up and sent me home. They were inexperienced and it showed. That was yesterday. Someone called me today saying they're bringing in a regional manager with 10 years of experience for my next measurement session or whatever it's called. They're starting over. They said they've never had this happen and they're taking it seriously. My head hurts even though we didn't do a full session and advil isn't helping at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you tried ketamine? I haven't tried ECT and I haven't started rTMS yet but I have tried like 29 different meds and ketamine made a huge difference for me. It's expensive but when nothing else works it's worth it. I went from too depressed to function to only occasionally suicidal and depressed. I get a monthly booster and it makes things immediately better when I do get it. If you want more info on ketamine let me know or check out /r/theraputicketamine. I'm still on meds. Ketamine isn't enough to control my bp on its own. I was BAD last October and ended up in the hospital where they slashed my meds in half and it made a huge difference. Turns out what I needed was more latuda. 80 helped but not all the way and 120 was too much. My pdoc tried 100, an 80 and a 20, and wow. I have some remeron too and I'm so much better now. Before I was on lamictal, wellbutrin, remeron, and latuda. Most I've been on at once is 7 meds. It felt hopeless. They cut out the lamictal and wellbutrin and raised the latuda and amazingly it made me so much better. Now I'm not perfect and I wouldn't stay truly stable but every day isn't a crisis anymore. The crisis moments are much fewer and farther between. There is hope. I learned that. Even after 29 meds I know there's still hope.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What about getting a job at a grocery store to get out? All of the ones by me are hiring. I didn't get along with my dysfunctional family that well and chose a college half the country away so I could have a fresh start. Going home for more than two weeks at a time was hard and made me super depressed. Find shows that you can binge watch. For me in high school playing piano was my escape. I would get lost in the music and play well into the night. Music has helped my life so much. More recently I'm into photography. Editing pictures is something that can be done safely in your room. But the cameras are expensive and that may not be something you have an interest in. Before I went home for Christmas (I've since graduated and started my career in the same state I went to college in) my therapist suggested putting up boundaries. She said they would hate it but I had to do it for me. When one parent would try to bash the other I was told to tell them no and walk away. I was the glue that would keep the peace. I had to learn that it wasn't my job and to let them deal with their own issues and stay out of it. I recommend finding a therapist even if you can only do teletherapy. If your family isn't supportive that would be very difficult. I don't discuss my mental health with my family. They know but they didn't react well when I was first diagnosed so I'm still very distrusting. You need to find something you can do on your own to shut the world out. For me it was Netflix on my laptop throughout college with a good pair of headphones. You need an escape. That's the easiest one I can think of. I understand rough family situations very well. I went through one myself and I'm a teacher so I've heard about rough home lives from plenty of my kids. I'm always willing to listen if you need to talk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Text start to 741741. It's the crisis text line. Check out the app calmharm when you feel a crisis moment coming on and you need a distraction. Get back with your therapist. See if they can do it over a webcam so you can stay home. My therapist is only seeing patients that way for now. It's surprisingly comfortable. You're 16. You need a trusted adult. 16 year olds aren't capable of handling the same type of situations as an adult. I understand not wanting to go to your parents. Is there a teacher you can go to? I can almost guarantee your teacher has heard it before. I've only been teaching for 4 years and I've already had kids open up to me about being suicidal. It's surprisingly common. Your school counselor may be able to set you up with some resources. I reach out to my principal the most. After that there are a couple of other teachers I go to. I almost never tell my parents what's really going on. I wish I had the type of relationship where I could go to them. See if you can develop that kind of relationship while you're still young enough. I'm assuming they care enough since they took you to doctors to get diagnosed and took you to therapy. I rarely talk to my boyfriend about my episodes because he doesn't get it. The other adults I talk to do get it. At least better than he does. Why? They've seen it before and they've heard it from others. It isn't new to them. They aren't shocked by anything I say. This is the first experience your boyfriend has had with this. It's understandable that he doesn't know how to cope. You need a trusted adult. Not another teenager. In college I had a friend I told everything to. They did the same thing as your boyfriend but they didn't say to talk to them again in two weeks. We never talked again. It was rough. For the sake of your relationship you need a therapist to unload the heavy stuff on. Now that I tell my therapist the serious stuff I'm not telling my principal as much. She never told me to back off but our relationship is better since I did. I can still go to her when things are really bad but she doesn't hear EVERYTHING like she used to. Believe it or not I am here for you and I am willing to listen. I'm sorry if I sound too harsh. I've been where you are. I know how it feels. I wish someone sat me down when I was newly diagnosed and told me what I'm telling you. I probably would have opened up to my mom back in high school if I knew then what I know now. It took a long time for my parents to accept my diagnosis and they threatened not to pay for any of my treatment. I was diagnosed in college after I moved out. You're not in the same boat I'm in. You have a chance at a relationship with your parents that I didn't have. Please please take that chance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Check out the app calmharm. It can really help in those crisis moments and distract you. It's stopped me from harming before. Text start to 741741, the crisis text line, when things are bad. That's also helped me. In the first aid section I picked up gel packs that can be heated up or cooled down for injuries. I use the extreme temperature when I want to hurt myself. If you use heat make sure you only heat it up for as long as it says to. It's enough to ease the urge. Much more is too much. My therapist is fine with that since it's not burning or cutting. Holding ice to where I want to cut also works but I don't have an ice maker in my freezer. Weird, I know.</TEXT>

She really really pissed me off a couple sessions in a row because I felt super dismissed but I figure it's really that she feels comfortable enough with me to say it like it is instead of comforting me. By now I've forgotten what I was so mad about. I never told her the issues I had with her but I know if I did we could have had an adult conversation about it. It isn't a pattern of feeling dismissed, it just happened a couple times, so I stick it out and I think you should too. Or find a new therapist. No matter what try to do therapy.</TEXT>

Parts of your post sounded more like borderline personality disorder but I don't have all the info about your life from one reddit post. Think about getting set up with a therapist, they can help keep track of your moods. I like the app emoods for mood tracking. It's quick and easy. A lot of people like daylio but I don't feel that it collects enough data points. There's no way for us to tell you what you may or may not have, but if you have questions going to a therapist or psychiatrist (therapist is the one you talk it out with, psychiatrist is the MD who handles your diagnosis and medication). A GP isn't specially trained to diagnosis and treat more complex mental illnesses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was an education major! After I was a neuroscience major. Getting diagnosed forced me to switch to something easier or drop out. It wasn't a difficulty thing as much as it was a scheduling thing. Anyway, now I'm in my 4th year of teaching and I love it. My principal is my biggest support person, but we have an atypical relationship. We're super super close on a personal level. It just kinda happened. Other teachers have generally been understanding and helpful. We see it in kids without judging the kids, so we can see it in each other and see past it. That's true for many but there will always be exceptions. My college professors were some of the most understanding people I've come across. Definitely get set up with your college's disability services. 100%. Do it. It's better to have accommodations and not need them than to need them and not have them. Bipolar does count as a disability. Having a consistent schedule has been good for me. 6th grade shitty students have not been. I recommend younger than 6th. I've heard great things about 4th. The grade makes a huge difference. Leaving school at school and not taking stuff home has helped. Summers off is amazing. You'll have some trainings to go to so it's not like you're totally out for three months. Having Christmas and Thanksgiving and spring breaks is very much needed. It is a stressful job. You need people you can talk to and vent to and rely on. Having meds mostly figured out has been huge. I've tried I think 29. Latuda is my favorite. I get ketamine infusions for my residual depression. I'm also on remeron, a weak antidepressant. Overall my treatment is super expensive but it's working so it's worth it. Hopefully you won't have to try 29 meds like I have. Open up to a few adults you trust. You're in a great field full of people who want nothing more than to help others have the best life they can. Don't tell too many people and be careful before telling new people. But do tell some people. I need therapy to vent about school. It's been so helpful. Definitely definitely have a therapist because some days the kids make you feel so shitty with their awful behavior. It's not you. They're like that for others too. Always here to talk and give advice! From one teacher to another and one bipolar to another  #10084; /r/teachers isn't the most supportive sub. If you post there beware of jaded comments from people who are disillusioned with the profession. Some people are supportive but you're always going to get mixed responses there. Schedule, schedule, schedule. Set goals for getting your work done early with a super early soft deadline, a hopeful deadline, and a hard deadline, all before the true due date so even if you slip up your work gets done. If you have to schedule each half hour then do that. But seriously, make a schedule that includes lots of breaks. 20 min episodes, not 40 min episodes while you're trying to be productive. It's easier to watch one 20 min episode and stop than it is to watch half of a 40 min episode and stop. You'll always say one more scene or I'll just finish this episode. No. You don't have time for that. 20 min episodes when you have other things to do. Also, join a club. I was in a service organization and that kept me going between classes. We had requirements and I always went above and beyond and tried to get over 100 service hours per semester. I took a dance class later in college, fantastic decision. I took photography. I still love photography. Don't forget to have fun and discover other passions.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-28 01:05:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been up since 4 am. I took two unisom and melatonin last night and still woke up every hour. I. Can't. Fucking. Sleep. Through. The. Night. It's been two weeks. The only change I can think of, besides no more stressful job teaching, is that we raised my remeron which makes it less sedating. Sleep issues started about a week after we raised the remeron. I haven't slept through the night without something for sleep, either seroquel or remeron, in over a year and a half. At the lower remeron dose I couldn't eat. Zero appetite. I was also mildly depressed. I feel better on the higher dose but I can't sleep! I've tried temazepam and atarax/vistaril for sleep in the past. I'd rather not a benzo like temazepam because it interacts with ketamine and makes the ketamine not work and I just got an infusion. If I remember correctly atarax didn't keep me asleep. I am open for other sleep med suggestions. Seroquel made it hard to wake up in the morning but I wasn't drowsy during the day. Nothing so far has made me drowsy during the day, and I was up to 900mg seroquel. I want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly, all in one place. I just want sleep! Pdoc appointment is Monday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had an infusion yesterday and came out of it depressed. Today I'm definitely depressed. After my last infusion I got depressed that weekend. I don't understand why. Does this happen to anyone else? I had a decent month, but we also haven't had school (I'm a teacher) so I haven't had the normal stress I usually have and that could have something to do with why I'm better. Last month I was depressed right after but the overall month was fine so it's not like I needed a booster. I didn't enjoy k-holing this time. I don't know why. I didn't like the alternate reality I guess. Normally I love it and want more but this time I was glad when it was over. I have little interest in getting more infusions due to disliking the k-hole experience. I still will but I don't like it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been getting ketamine since the summer. I get boosters every 4-5 weeks. I'm jealous you get to go 8-10! I still get depressed from time to time. I got hospitalized for being suicidal in October and that was while I was getting ketamine. Had a major med change then and I haven't been perfect since but I've been much better. I wouldn't do ketamine for fun after this experience. I never have and don't think I ever will. The infusions used to make me crave wanting to try doing drugs of any type but that's long gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get ketamine and for me it's worth it. I get boosters once a month. Some months I'm good all month, some months it lasts 2-3 weeks, but I feel that it's worth it. Latuda works better for me and my depression than any other med has. 80mg wasn't enough and 120 was too much. It took a few years for someone to think to do 100 mg. Wow. So much better. I'm also on remeron. I've tried close to 30 meds and finally found something not perfect but not bad. Better than I had been. I had been on up to 7 meds at once and still wasn't stable. I know the struggle. You haven't found the right meds....yet. Meds + ketamine + therapy keeps me relatively stable. I'm not perfect but I can function. I can live. It's possible for you too. Have you thought about rTMS?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Check out the app calmharm. It's nothing but coping skills, some longer than others, and sorted into different categories. I love it. It's super helpful. You could get a cricut and make vinyl decals or cards or tshirts. Cards would be the easiest thing to get supplies for. Hobby Lobby is open and has paper sheets 4/$1. Michael's usually has sales on cardstock and other papercraft supplies. You'd need glue sticks, cardstock, optional stickers, optional scrapbook paper, and a fiskars cutting thing with a ruler on it for cutting out the cardstock and paper. Making cards brings me a lot of joy and it would be a great way to connect with others now. Cricuts are expensive though. It depends how invested you wanna get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went away to college. Far away. To get away from the mistreatment I experienced growing up from parents and peers. I got a concussion in high school and the neurologists tried saying I was depressed but my mom denied it. She said they were quacks. I didn't get bipolar symptoms until I was 21, the same year I was diagnosed. Mom denied it. She said I was exaggerating. We didn't talk for like 3 months and for the next few years she belittled my diagnosis and said I didn't really have it. I got myself help through my university. Could I have been helped for my depression sooner? Yes. Would it have prevented some pretty serious hardships? Yes. But in the end does it matter? I don't go to my parents with my problems. Ever. They don't know my bipolar symptoms or triggers or the real reasons for my hospitalizations. They invalidated me for so long that the relationship is broken and I don't know that I want to fix it.</TEXT>

And why wouldn't they? The behaviors got you validation, which is something we all need and want." Wow. That makes so much sense. It's saying invalidation leads to that because the person wants to feel validated. I can think of times where that was true. We spent my therapy session today talking about why that quote resonated with me. For so much of my life I was invalidated. After hanging up the video call I realized all of the clubs I did, all of the instruments I played, the constant stream of boyfriends, the leadership roles, all point to wanting validation. My whole life is about craving validation because I was denied it growing up. Go figure. Daddy issues are real.</TEXT>

Some meds, nightmare. But you have to keep trying until you find the right combo. Then everything will click and life will be so much easier. Life doesn't have to be this much of a struggle.

    <TEXT>It's the depression but it could be linked to your medication. Are you on meds? I notice that when I'm on certain medications I cannot make myself eat, but I have to eat something to get calories for latuda. Frozen waffles work really well. They're light, I get strawberries or chocolate so there's flavor but not too much flavor, and they're super easy to get down. Two frozen waffles are 400 cal. I would put chocolate syrup on the chocolate chip waffles or nutella on the strawberry waffles to add calories. Yum. Even without an appetite I could usually force myself to eat that, if nothing else. Consider nutrition shakes like ensure or boost to get some nutrients. In my opinion fast food is better than not eating at all. Drive thrus are still open. See if some chicken nuggets and a frostie is something you can get down.</TEXT>

And why wouldn't they? The behaviors got you validation, which is something we all need and want." Wow. That makes so much sense. It's saying invalidation leads to that because the person wants to feel validated. I can think of times where that was true. I told that to my boyfriend and his response was to play devil's advocate. He asked about someone saying the person was only doing it for attention. He asked about how about when the person never acts on it and it's boy who cried wolf. I got upset at this and said bye and hung up. This was after talking about my abusive childhood and how my dad invalidated me for years to an extreme. I told him that my therapist made me come to the conclusion that he makes me feel invalidated at times. I told him he invalidated me talking about feeling invalidated. I said how he's my significant other and I should be able to go to him first but instead I can't go to him at all and he's the only person that makes me upset like that when I talk to them so he talks to me wrong. He said I was blaming him for me not being able to control my own emotions and I attacked him. It's a real problem. For years I couldn't go to him with my issues. I go to someone else. We've been dating for 5 years. He should be the first person I go to. He's telling me I'm twisting the truth and blaming him for my instability. In my eyes I tried telling him about a problem which is him communicating wrong. He's not taking any responsibility. I don't get upset like that when anybody else talks to me. Who plays devil's advocate when a person is talking about their abusive childhood? Sorry for the rambling. I have nobody to talk to about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few weeks ago I talked to my therapist about my relationship with him and she said don't break up with him right now. He's ok for now but don't marry him. She said with how I'm doing don't make a bunch of life changes, aside from building a house and she really wants me to switch grades I'm teaching, but she's finally saying I can stay for one more year with all that's going on. At this point I'm not opposed to breaking up with him but being with him for 5 years has to mean something. I've been with him since I was about 22. I was in another long term relationship with someone before that. I haven't been single for an appreciable amount of time since high school. My theory is that I have a childhood of validation issues so I seek validation. I didn't get it from my dad so I seek it from boyfriends.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw them last Monday and I see them again next week. Virtually, of course. I had a panic attack last night and another one tonight. The one last night only lasted a few minutes but the anxiety didn't go away for hours. I didn't take anything for it. Tonight it wasn't as bad but I didn't want the hours of anxiety so I took ativan. It didn't do anything. So I took a second. It didn't do anything either. I'm thinking if I have a panic attack tomorrow that's 3 days in a row and maybe it needs intervention. Contributing factors: in therapy on Wednesday we really dove into some of my childhood trauma and abuse. Normally we don't talk about heavy stuff. This week we did. I called my boyfriend after to process what we talked about in therapy and it started a fight. Last time I'll be that open with him for a while. Lesson learned. Things are still cold between us. I know that's why I was so depressed today and I wouldn't be surprised if it contributed to being more likely to have a panic attack. I started TMS this week, I don't know if that would make a difference. What happened at the time of each panic attack: first one I was ironing the ties to make fabric masks for a nursing home. I couldn't finish. I tried to finish ironing today and I couldn't. It made me too anxious. Second panic attack was when I was stuck on if I wanted waffles or chick fil a for supper. I feel like such a loser. I have the skills, I have the materials, I have the desire to help people, by all means I should be making a couple dozen masks. But I can't and I am so upset about that. I'm giving my materials to the friend that told me about the project. I feel terrible that my anxiety got in the way. I can't follow through on anything. I'm taking it hard. I have the skills and materials, I should be helping people. But I can't. I'm such a failure. Should I call? Should I not call since I see them next week? What could they even do that's not benzos?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've tried close to 30 meds. It's taken that long to get close to the right combo. We're close but not quite there yet. You've only tried about 4. Trust me when I say all of the pain you go through trying the wrong drugs is worth it to find the right ones. So worth it. Life is livable now. I can function. We can finally talk about my trauma and abuse in therapy. We can finally make progress. Keep on trying to find the right meds and stick with them. Adjust them as needed. If you feel that a month between appointments is too long then request every 2 weeks. Nothing says you have to wait months after making a med change. Hell, maybe even ask for every week when you're starting out. You need those check ins so you feel heard and can get needed changes quickly. Best of luck to you. I'm happy you're giving it another shot!</TEXT>

I was told by multiple pdocs that I was almost out of med options or I was out of med options or I couldn't expect to get any better. Now I'm with someone who sees that I still have options and believes I can get better. Had I stayed with the old pdocs I might have given up and killed myself, but I kept trying. Sometimes the pdoc is wrong. Sometimes the pdoc is the wrong fit. Keep reaching out on here. That's where my hope comes from. You're never out of options. There are always other doses and combos to try.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My therapist said all good things. That I have what it takes to manage my disorder, that I have the skills I need to be successful, but when our session ended and the video call stopped I just started crying. I don't feel like she's lying. But I also don't feel like it's true. I don't have what it takes to manage my disorder. She told me to look at the evidence. I see someone that still gets depressed and wants to kill themselves at times and wants to self harm at times and doesn't eat right and is in a relationship that should be over and is in a job they should leave. Yes, I usually talk about my feelings before doing anything. There are a couple of people I'm open with. Yes, last time I saw the need to hospitalize myself and it wasn't a huge fight between me and my care team. But I still get bad. I still have the bad thoughts. My therapist could tell I was upset when we ended our session and ended up calling me to check on me after and reiterated that she was saying good things, not things that should make me upset. I told her I was fine but I'm still upset. I reached out to the person I normally go to but she didn't have much to say. She hasn't been responding nearly as much since school has been closed. I feel like I'm not being heard. I wish I could see my therapist twice a week instead of once a week. Oh, and the relationship I have with my boyfriend might be over. We haven't seriously talked since our fight a week ago.</TEXT>

When I stopped it I was so nauseous and couldn't sleep at all. I miss seroquel but I did gain a little weight on it. When I went off seroquel they put me on remeron since they act similarly and it took away the nasty withdrawal. The remeron is great. It has me less medicated and still reasonably stable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>No period since soon after IUD removal</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-10 02:10:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I only had mirena for a month, it made me totally crazy and I had to be hospitalized for being a danger to myself. I had it taken out at the end of September and my last period was in December, so I've gone 5 months without one. Is it normal for your period to be gone that long after IUD removal? I'm typically irregular but that means skipping one month at a time, not five. Hormonal birth control isn't an option long term. I tried loestrin and bled for 3 months straight. I'm bipolar and after having the IUD I fear the hormones would really mess with my mood and I'd end up hospitalized again for self harming and being suicidal. I guess I should contact a doctor but I'm afraid of the hormones they'd give me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got an IUD in August and it made me cray cray. I was hospitalized. I got it taken out in September and was hospitalized in October. I understandably fear hormonal birth control after that nightmare. But here's the problem. I haven't had a period since December. I guess what I'm wondering is what's your experience with hormonal birth control? I was on a tri phasic pill in college before my diagnosis and it was fine. I worry that changing hormones now would mean my mood also changes. We tries lowestrin, a low estrogen pill, and I bled for 3 months straight. I don't remember it affecting my mood but I wasn't stable at the time anyway so it's hard to know if it helped or hurt or did nothing. I'm not going through that again. The bleeding only stopped because I stopped taking the pill. Doctors generally aren't well versed in how birth control affects bipolar mood swings. Pdocs aren't trained in it and ob's only know statistics and typical cases. So I need to know what worked for real bipolar patients. I'm not on lamictal anymore so hormones won't interfere with that. I'm on lamictal and remeron and get ketamine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've messed with my meds before, probably more than I should have. I stayed on seroquel and latuda when they told me to quit them (separate occasions), I recently raised my remeron back up to what it was on due to side effects, but I'm sure they'll be fine with that. I just didn't ask. I've taken extra of sleep meds while staying within the max recommended dose. I've taken extra ativan on rare occasions. I've taken haldol as needed. My therapist said it comes down to not trusting my prescribers. I've also stopped meds against their advice when I got dangerous side effects. Like when I'm pretty sure I got lithium toxicity and they refused to do any blood tests. I think I just lowered the dose then. Or when zoloft made me dangerously suicidal. Some of the pdocs were awful. Some weren't terrible but didn't listen to me. Some were decent but left their position so I couldn't see them anymore. I've had like 8 pdocs. I like mine now but the appointment times are difficult so I may switch when the next school year starts. I don't know who I'll go to next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My kitchen counters are always full of crap. Half unpacked bags of groceries, 12 packs, bread products, clean dishes I didn't finish putting away, receipts, cookies, chips, you get the picture. Well today I got the motivation to clean it off. Now, I didn't clean clean the kitchen. My stove still has food stuck to it, floors need to be swept, sink is dirty, but I put all clean dishes away and sorted most of the clutter. That's a super big deal for me. I even cooked supper and cleaned up after! And I made iced tea instead of buying it. It's a small thing but something I haven't done in years. A few days ago I picked up all the clothes that were on the floor in my bathroom. The day before that I did laundry and even folded the clothes when they were dry. I didn't put them away but at least they're folded. My living room doesn't have a huge pile of stuff from hypo amazon clothes shopping anymore. Not put away but at least near my closet. Tomorrow I may put away the clothes that are on the floor in my room after I do some more grading. I did some grading today. Is it the higher remeron dose kicking in? Is it the TMS working? Is it the fact that I started taking a multivitamin, vitamin D, and B12? Do I really care what it is? Here it is, the middle of the night, I took the max dose of atarax/vistaril, and I'm still awake. Shit. I would clean but I'm dizzy from the sleep meds. This is reminding me of when I was diagnosed before meds.</TEXT>

Does trazodone affect weight/appetite? What dose did you need for sleep? Did it help your depression at all? She talked about starting with 50 and working up to 150. Now I'm seriously bummed.

    <TEXT>I had brain fog, nausea, I was shaky, can't remember what other lithium side effects, but switching to extended release from regular lithium made a huge difference side effect wise. In the end it wasn't for me. I did better on lamictal. Make sure to drink lots of water, maybe that would help some of the side effects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ketamine given via IV. It helps depression. It's not covered by insurance. I don't know if it helps my anxiety but I know it helps my depression a ton. What helps my anxiety is a high dose of latuda. When we raised it I was anxious at first but haven't had severe or even moderate anxiety in months. The insurance approved brother to ketamine is esketamine and is called spravato and is a nasal spray. Ketamine can also be given as a lozenge and as a nasal spray from a compounding pharmacy but IV gives you the most benefit and the fastest.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sorry, another trazodone post. Feeling and almost getting sick whenever I try to eat</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-18 01:48:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is two nights in a row I couldn't finish my supper. I'll be fine then I'll have a mouth full of food and be chewing and start gagging and can't swallow. That's since I started trazodone. I see that it can cause nausea but the nausea is only when I'm eating and after I finish eating. I haven't thrown up yet because I stop eating when I get that nauseous. I googled trazodone and gagging and found that it happens in dogs but I havent heard of it happening to people. I'm not sleeping much, I can't eat properly, I'm more depressed, all of my interests and cares are gone, I'm more tired during the day, I'm starting to get suicidal, I think it's safe to say I hate trazodone. I called my doctor yesterday about the insomnia but she never called me back. I'll call again for sure on Monday. I hate how I feel. I was stable. I was finally reasonably stable. Not perfect but pretty damn good. But I wasn't sleeping. We lowered the dose of what I was on but then I couldn't eat. Why can't we find the right medicine? My pdoc is willing to put me on seroquel and latuda together and I know I'd be stable on that because I was pretty good on it before but both of them together leads to high cholesterol and weight gain and possibly diabetes according to an old pdoc. So maybe it's not a good choice even if I'd be stable. I just want to be stable and able to sleep and able to eat and able to lose weight. Those are perfectly reasonable wants. Unless you're bipolar I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't turn very far to the left. Sleeping is painful because of my neck hurting. It's hard to drive. I had joint pain as a depakote side effect and it never got better when I was on the med so I worry the neck pain won't get better either as long as I'm on trazodone. Should I call my pdoc now or wait until my appointment next week? My back is starting to hurt too. I don't have experience with this pdoc and med changes. I'm finally sleeping and not as crazy depressed so the trazodone is doing something. If this doesn't work I don't know what comes next. I fear what another med change may bring. I really wanted to die with this one. What if another is worse? I also get nauseous anytime I eat. I'm not eating much because of that and I also don't really get hungry.

Lowering the dose helped. If you start noticing that you can't remember stuff, in my experience, it doesn't go away and lowering the dose is the only way to combat it. Give it a good shot. I found that 150 worked well for me. At 200 Dory had a much better memory than I did. It was bad. But I see people that are on 400 and fine so it's really person to person.</TEXT>

Things don't have a direction they're going in? You don't have a lot of things to look forward to? All guesses. But I could see her lumping those things in with the idea of being bored. I understand being frustrated with what she said. You didn't feel validated. She oversimplified your problem and you feel that it didn't get the attention it deserved. It comes down to validation. I would feel insulted too. I don't think what she said was out of line but I do think she could have put it in a much better way. It could have worked. It may have been more of a problem because it was over the phone and not in person or a video. Having the face to face feels way different than a phone call to me.

    <TEXT>Those meds are insane. Hydroxyzine did nothing for my anxiety, it just made me sleep. Trazodone does very little for my depression, it mostly makes me sleep. Neither of them are strong for psych issues. I was on both lamictal and lithium and still not stable so that doesn't strike me as too terribly odd but two atipsychotics on top of that? They don't like you on two antipsychotics at the same time period. Have you tried others? Seroquel is a strong med and could replace them. Or latuda, it's fantastic for bipolar depression and a high dose of latuda got me off of most of my other meds. Why antipsychotics on top of two mood stabilizers? That's telling me your mood stabilizers aren't working. There's a chance some of your drugs are working against each other and you'd be better off on less. I went from lamictal wellbutrin latuda and various fourths and fifths and even a sixth at times to latuda and remeron which I did better on than any of the other combos to now latuda and trazodone because I wasn't sleeping on the dose of remeron that helped and I may switch to latuda and seroquel. Your meds are a mess. I've tried almost 30 meds and I do far better on fewer. Latuda is a lifesaver. I was on 80 for the longest time and 120 was too much but finally someone thought to try 100 and wow. What a difference. I need a little something extra to be mostly stable but I'm so much better than I was when I was on 6 or 7 meds. Benzos are far better for anxiety than anything else I've tried. I have a prescription for ativan as needed. On 80mg latuda I had a lot of anxiety still. 100 took care of most of my generalized anxiety and I haven't been nearly as anxious since raising it. It's expensive but for me it's worth it. Buspar could be something to try for anxiety. That's meant for anxiety way more than hydroxyzine is and it's not an antidepressant or benzo. The therapist sounds bad. I would switch asap. You know what good therapy feels like so you really know when something is wrong. Wishing you luck finding someone new at a different practice.</TEXT>

Right now I'm at a -2. Hard time showering, hard time brushing my teeth, hard time getting out of bed, don't feel happy, but also don't feel super depressed. It doesn't sound like you're at a 0. At a 0 you'd be able to do your homework earlier and you'd go outside and you'd want to help with the food. It sounds like you're at a negative something, but not that bad. Like a -2 or so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zoloft. Depressed and suicidal on it, depressed, suicidal, and nauseous coming off of it. I went on and off if for a week or two before enough was enough and I sucked it up and dealt with the withdrawal. It lasted a few weeks. Seroquel withdrawal was awful. That ended in a hospitalization where the only way I got off of it was to add something that acted similarly. Nauseous, insomnia, no appetite, depressed, I can't remember what else but I went to urgent care for it and they were no help. Eventually I was so suicidal a hospitalization was necessary. I should have been hospitalized after zoloft but I had never been before and nobody pushed me in that direction so I didn't see it as an option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I was hospitalized for being suicidal which was due to the withdrawal. They changed my meds and prescribed things for the withdrawal effects like something for sleep. I had a very smart doctor who knew that seroquel and remeron both work on the A2 receptor and both meds have similar side effects (increased appetite, sedation) so it should have, in theory, been a solution. It helped immediately. Within a day or two the withdrawal was over and I could eat and sleep. Had I gone for zoloft withdrawal I really don't know what they would have done. Probably put me on an antipsychotic because I wasn't on one at the time. Every time I've been hospitalized I was on suicide watch.</TEXT>

I found a different doctor after that. I never went back to him. He didn't listen to anything I said and only prescribed stuff 3 months at a time and refused to give me ativan. No bueno.

    <TEXT>I started trazodone about two weeks ago. Since then my neck has been sore, I can't turn my head all the way, I'm more depressed, I have no appetite, I'm nauseous anytime I eat, and nauseous all morning. I want to stop it for the appetite issues. But it's only been two weeks. But I'm eating like 600 calories a day and even that is hard. My therapist made a comment that I go through an awful lot of meds in short periods of time. Maybe I don't stick it out long enough. Idk. Going off of them always feels justified. Is switching trazodone for seroquel in this case justified or am I switching too fast? I just got done with a med I couldn't sleep on and before that a med I couldn't eat on so I'm sensitive to both issues. Seroquel would solve both issues. I've been on it before but went off because no two antipsychotics together and I'm also on latuda. I worry that my next pdoc would take me off the seroquel and I'd have to go through the withdrawal again like I did a year and a half ago. It was hell. But I don't know what else to try. Edit: oh and I'm way more depressed than I've been in months on this med combo. It's the meds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was on remeron before the trazodone. At 15mg I slept great but couldn't eat. At 30mg I couldn't sleep but I could finally eat. My doc decided it wasn't the med for me because of the side effects. It worked great. My mood was fantastic. On a scale from -10 to +10 on 15mg I was living at a -1. Not bad but could be better. I could do what I needed to but I couldn't cook and clean and do extra stuff. At 30mg I was at a 0 or +1. Huge difference. I cooked regularly, I cleaned, I did all of my work, I was great! But I couldn't sleep at all. The thing with remeron is the higher the dose the less sedating it is so if you go up look out for not sleeping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's still a low dose. I didn't notice any difference at 20, some differences at 40, way more differences at 60, and even more differences at 80. Now I'm at 100 and wow. I never would have guessed this is what it would be like if I compared it to how I was on 20. If you're not getting bad side effects keep going up on the dose to see if it does help. Once you hit 60 or 80 if it's still not working then I'd say you can really say it's not working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was originally on /r/bipolar but I like this sub better. Overall I came for information and to have a place to ask questions. It gives me so much knowledge. I know so much about different meds and I love that. It's given me the knowledge to talk to my doctor about options and feel like I'm making more informed decisions. I can't remember if this sub is why I started therapy but I think it played a role. Honestly I would probably be dead without this sub. It gave me the knowledge to go to a hospital when I needed to and the confidence that it would be ok. It makes me feel not so alone. It does give me a place to ask questions and share experiences and ask for other people's experiences and I love that. I don't plan on leaving this sub anytime soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going back on remeron! My doctor decided no more trazodone due to the appetite issues and since I was doing so much better on remeron to go back on that but since I wasn't sleeping on it to add lunests since atarax wasn't enough for sleep when I was on remeron. So they're adding lunesta to help with the sleep when I'm back on remeron. Any experiences with it? I don't know anything about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm nauseous anytime I eat and I can only eat a little at a time and I have zero appetite. When I picked up the trazodone I asked the pharmacist if it had appetite side effects and she said no. I can't find anything on this sub about anyone else having this issue with trazodone so it's rare. Atarax/vistaril/hydroxyzine helped but I kept waking up during the night. Temazepam worked great but it's a benzo and I can't be on a benzo with ketamine, it makes the ketamine less effective. Trazodone made me sleep normally but gave me a sore, stiff neck and the appetite problems. I'm losing weight from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Monday I got told by the doctor at the center that TMS probably wouldn't work for me. That day was my 19th of 36 treatments and she said I should have responded by then but I had only gotten worse. Tuesday my pdoc wanted to lower my latuda. I haven't had a major episode since we raised it. They clearly don't understand me. They had to call in another doctor to figure out how to treat me. I was that much of a mystery and that misunderstood. Tuesday night into Wednesday I questioned the medication change that would happen the next week and wondered if I should take the Lunesta like they said or quit ketamime and take temazepam for sleep. Temazepam has worked before. Lunesta is new and scary. Wednesday my therapist said she doesn't think she helps me at all which made me wonder if she wants to stop treating me. She also said to stop relying on medication to fix things and to look in other places. She clearly doesn't understand my issues then. After therapy all of that was too much. The tms not working, the possibly losing ketamine, thinking my therapist wanted to leave me, my therapist not understanding my relationship with medication, my psychiatrist not understanding my relationship with medication, yet another med change, I felt very alone and misunderstood and like everything had been thrown up into the air at once. I reached out to the person I'm closest to about this and they said something that made me feel like even they didn't understand. That literally nobody in this world understood me. After that I started looking up suicide methods, but no luck. I cried. It felt like I lost everything in a matter of days. I'm fine now but after the last person I count on made me feel misunderstood that's where I was. Is therapy for everyone? Are there some people that therapy just doesn't help? I really thought I got along with my therapist well and she understood me and we were a match. We talk about the present, not the past, so we don't get to the root of issues. I could always talk to her about her approach. I tried out a couple therapists before her but it went so much better with her than with the others. I hate the idea of her saying no more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lamictal helped some. It's the first med I tried. I was on it for about 5 years. It wasn't enough by itself and I needed other meds on top of it. At higher doses it can cause memory problems and in my experience it doesn't go away the longer you stay on it. The only way to help it is to lower the dose. The rash you can get from it is very rare so it's not something I would worry about. I think it's a good starting place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last weekend I had all of the depression symptoms at once. Not eating, no interest in anything, no concentration, not showering or brushing my teeth or changing for days, I lost 6-8 lbs, it was sad. Luckily I had a pdoc appointment in a few days. They dropped trazodone and put me back on remeron, which I was on right before trazodone and did great on, and in two days things were fine! Eating, still sleeping, cooking, some cleaning, I can function! After trying close to 30 meds and being on combos of up to 6+ at a time, here's what makes me stable. 100mg latuda 15mg remeron I don't see a lot of posts about remeron/mirtazapine around here so I'm going to give a little info on it. It's an antidepressant but one of those odd types, not an SSRI. It works similarly to seroquel without being an antipsychotic. It works on the same brain receptor. It increases appetite and helps with sleep while being a mild antidepressant. It works better for sleep at lower doses and better as an antidepressant at a higher dose. I love it. It makes me sleep great and it makes me eat when I'm on the regular tablet, can't eat at 15mg of the dissolvable but can eat at 30mg of the dissolvable. At 30mg of either tablet type I can't sleep. Remeron doesn't make me the least bit manic or crazy. If you have problems eating or sleeping it may be something to consider.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remeron/mirtazapine may help. It's an antidepressant of sorts but acts similarly to seroquel. That's what they gave me when I was coming off seroquel and had bad withdrawal from that and it worked great. Just a note, it works better for sleep at lower doses. Adding a pill doesn't make you sleep more. It makes you sleep less. At 15mg I could sleep. At 30mg I couldn't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Three questions. It helps me sleep, sure, but it's a light sleep and I wake up a lot during the night but fall back asleep. Will it turn into a deeper sleep the longer I'm on it? I've only taken 1mg for two nights. Insurance only covered 15 pills for 25 days. What? Is that normal? Why? Do I need to try other things before it'll be approved? Do I need to call them and make an appeal? Will I be forced to pay out of pocket for the other 15 pills? I've previously been on seroquel, mirtazapine/remeron, trazodone, temazepam, and atarax/vistaril. I have not tried ambien and I get ketamine infusions, which benzos make ineffective, so xanax, klonopin, ativan, and temazepam aren't options even though temazepam worked in the past. What's the difference between ambien and lunesta? I'm planning on being on this long term. My remeron dose makes me unable to sleep and my mood is doing so well on latuda and remeron (diagnosed bipolar) that we want to keep the psych meds the same and just add something for sleep. Remeron doesn't work for sleep at higher doses and I'm on 30mg.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was on wellbutrin for a long time. Remeron surprisingly has helped my depression. If you have sleep issues it can help with that too at lower doses. I take a high dose of latuda, 100mg, to help my depression. What dose of latuda did you get up to? I noticed a small difference at 40, a bigger difference at 60, that wore off, then an even bigger difference at 80 and I stayed better for a while but I'm doing fantastic at 100. 120 was too much. Seroquel did wonders for my depression too. No SSRI has helped me. My depression is super stubborn. Ketamine infusions help but they're expensive and not covered by insurance and you need monthly or so boosters. For me it's worth it. I've tried close to 30 meds. I told you what worked best for me. Trileptal didn't help, lamictal only put a dent in it, ativan isn't for depression, latuda has worked super well at high doses, and I've never tried zyprexa. I require a couple meds at once. Right now it's latuda and remeron. Through my trials I've found that just because a drug is from a certain drug class doesn't mean you'll react the same to other meds in that drug class. Zoloft made me cray cray. Prozac was awful. Lexapro did nothing. Tried it 2 or 3 times. I've never had a drug make me manic but I have had them make me self harm and turn dangerously suicidal.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-24 19:58:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm buying a house and my parents are helping me out with some of the costs but they're being angry and unreasonable and wanting me to get all of these features that I don't want like extra deadbolts and electric blinds and fancy garage door openers and a sprinkler system for my yard and my dad wants me to dig a well in the middle of suburbia so I can water my lawn without it raising my water bill or water my lawn even if there are water restrictions. I don't give a flying fuck about any of those things but they're being so mean and insistent about it. They are the kind of people that won't accept no and will get angry and start yelling at you if you fight back. In the past year I learned that I was highly abused as a kid and it all counts as prolonged trauma. It's starting again. I'm in my car crying to get away for a little bit. My dad isn't here yet but my mom is. They live in the northeast and I live in Texas. I moved away for college and stayed. Best decision I ever made. They keep calling me lazy and saying I settle for things. No, I'm just not ridiculous and I accept things as they are. I trust the process. They'll get things done by closing but my parents say I need to demand things to be done immediately and ask for compensation since there are some things they're still working on. Closing is in a little less than a week. They have time. It's a new build. The inspection was fine with minor issues, mostly cosmetic things. My dad is insisting my inspector had a bias since my realtor recommended him and the realtor and the builder are in cahoots since they know each other professionally. No, they just know each other. They're not doing favors for each other. Why can't everyone be nice and get along and trust the process and not throw a fit until the end when things are supposed to be done? So I'm in my car crying. I'm being minimized and I can't remember the word but basically my opinion doesn't matter and nothing about me matters or is taken seriously. Not devalued. This is really bugging me, it's the perfect word and I can't think of it. I don't know how I'm going to survive the next two months with my mom and about a month of time with my dad and my mom, who belong divorced and treat each other horribly and treat me even worse. I guess I'll go upstairs now. My head hurts from crying so much. Back to the world of being criticized and devalued. It's like they forget that it's my house and the final say should be mine. Edit: invalidated. That's the word I couldn't think of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Luckily my dad won't be at closing, just my mom. My dad isn't seeing the house until after closing. I do want the house and I love it. I just don't love what they want me to do with it. Home buying is normally stressful but wasn't for me at all until my parents stepped in. Now it's bad. I guess it could be worse. But it's definitely not good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Different medication. My sweet spot is 100 mg latuda, 30 mg remeron, 1 mg lunesta for sleep. I also get ketamine infusions once a month. Right now it feels like nothing is working and I don't know why but I had a good long spell. For temporary relief the app calm harm is great. It's nothing but coping skills, all different types, and dozens and dozens to pick from. It's really helped me before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We lowered my remeron dose for a couple weeks and when we raised it again it's like it's not working. I was fantastic on it before and happy and now I'm depressed unlike before. I don't know what to do about this. I cried in public today. Is it normal for meds to no longer work the second time? We raised it back up almost a month ago so I should be adjusted. What can I do to not be depressed anymore? Even ketamine didn't seem to help at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ketamine is somehow considered essential so they never stopped offering it. They only allow one person inside at a time, you text them from your car that you're there and they let you know when it's ok to come in and you go straight to the treatment room. I still got TMS through this too until I quit it. Also considered essential. Therapy and pdoc appointments are all virtual. The crying was because I'm buying a house and my parents are being monsters about it. It wasn't stressful until they got involved. They're giving me money and helping me move so I can't force them away and do it without them. I have to go through the trauma and abuse I dealt with as a child all over again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a new build so there weren't really showings. I picked out this house in like February and they started building it in March. Construction on homes is considered essential so it went on like it normally would have. Same price, oddly same interest rate, you wouldn't know it was a pandemic throughout this experience. The only difference is that the builder went from walk in to appointment only. I'm going to talk to my therapist about how I feel like I'm being abused again. Maybe I'm not. Maybe that's how I feel when they challenge me. Being called lazy and stupid certainly doesn't feel good so I know it's not how I should be treated. My mom is with me for about two months, she's not nearly as bad. My dad is the bad one. He's getting close to 70 and has gotten so much more stuck in his ways in the past couple years and much more hard headed. He falls very strongly on one side of the political spectrum, I'll say that much. He doesn't respond to logic if it's not his idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My doctor took me off of it way too fast. I went from 600mg-0 in less than a week. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, my mood was a disaster, and I ended up hospitalized. They put me on remeron in the hospital and said it acts on the same brain receptors as seroquel so it may help the withdrawal. The withdrawal stopped immediately. I love remeron but I do miss seroquel. They made me go off of it because I'm also on latuda and they don't like you on two antipsychotics at the same time and I was immediately super depressed when we tried lowering the latuda so I refused to go off of it. Going off seroquel quickly was a nightmare.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try the instant release. I had a very hard time sleeping on XR. Also give it more time. According to my post history I slept like crap on seroquel at first but eventually it was great. You might get better responses for this post on /r/insomnia. If you don't care about the mood qualities you could try a low dose of remeron (15mg or 7.5mg). The lower the dose the more it helps you sleep. I'm on 30 and it doesn't help me sleep at all. It can also give you the hunger side effect. Atarax has helped me sleep too. It's an antihistamine. Trazodone was ok for sleep but not the med for me. You have options that aren't seroquel if sleep is your main concern. I ended up on lunesta. So far so good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's an unspoken rule about no two antipsychotics together. I was fantastic on both latuda and seroquel but they wouldn't let me stay on both, they being multiple pdocs I went to pleading to stay on the combo. I had lamictal and wellbutrin as my base with latuda and various others and there were times where I was too medicated. I'm doing so much better now on a high dose of latuda with remeron and something for sleep than I ever did on latuda and lamictal and wellbutrin and whatever else. When they lowered my meds I was doing pretty bad and I was terrified of how I'd be on fewer meds. Turns out I'm doing so much better. We went to 100mg latuda from 80mg and wow. The remeron stayed the same but later we raised it and I got even better. Turns out the lamictal and wellbutrin didn't do much for me after being on them for 5 years. They may be doing a lot for you, everyone is different. I would fight being on both abilify and zyprexa. That's not right.</TEXT>

Extreme pain going in, pain the whole first day, amd the hormones made me crazy like I've never been before. I got that taken out somewhere else because I needed to be seen asap. I was hospitalized not long after I got it out. A friend and my therapist didn't really give me a choice.

    <TEXT>I've been to the hospital three times, once at a for profit mental health hospital and twice associated with a Methodist hospital. The Methodist hospital was fantastic. They prided themselves on being a top program. Private rooms, meal menu choices, occupational therapy groups, it's really not too bad. The for profit hospital had workers that didn't really care and weren't very sympathetic. The hospital can make a huge difference in your experience. Even the doctor within the hospital can make a huge difference. You might have a bad time while someone down the hall might not. If you go pack sweats but nothing with a string. I wore yoga pants and leggings mostly with a pair of slippers and a pullover fleece. No regular bras because no underwire so I wore all sports bras. I don't normally read but I read all the time when I'm in the hospital. That's like all I do. I carry a book everywhere. It can get boring between the groups. Some hospitals allow you to have your own toiletries, some don't, but they will all provide them for you if needed. My shortest stay was 2-3 days and my longest was 8. I think I had two that were 3 days and one that was 8 days. It can be scary at first but it's not too bad. Mostly boring. In my state if you're voluntary you can request to be let out and within 24 hours they have to either let you out or get a judge to order you to stay. My first time I did that to get out. I was fine like the next day after I got there. If you do go, participate. Get as much out of it as you can. Check to make sure the facility AND the doctor takes your insurance. The for profit place I went none of the doctors took insurance and they charged you $100 a day for a 5 minute visit. Bullshit. The second place insurance covered all of it. It was still expensive but it was all within my plan. I paid 20% of the bill. Every year I max out my insurance plan because I end up in the hospital at some point.</TEXT>

Some doctors had me try a bunch, some wouldn't change my meds much, and I'd much rather have the doctor that listens to me and takes me off of a med if it's bad, which yours sounds willing to do, even if they're reluctant to do so. They don't know what will give you side effects and what won't. A new doctor won't change your possible side effects. Also, some side effects go away after a few weeks so if they're reluctant for you to stop it may be because they want to give it more time because it's not working *yet* or the side effects aren't gone *yet*. Your pdoc doesn't sound like a problem, it sounds like you're in the sucky part where you're figuring out your med combo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Could you change your sleep med? Remeron acts similarly to seroquel and works for sleep at low doses. The higher the dose the less it works for sleep. Atarax/hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that works for sleep. Trazodone helped me but totally took away my appetite which is a rare side effect and I couldn't eat hardly at all. /r/insomnia is a pretty good resource for sleep meds. Currently I'm on lunesta for sleep but that's a heavy hitter and addictive and people shouldn't take it long term. Oh well. It works so I'm going to keep using it long term. Seroquel is not the only med that can make you sleep.</TEXT>

Being bp and needing multiple meds is common. It sounds like you need to add more to your cocktail or switch to something that works better at a dose you can tolerate. Best thing I've tried is latuda but not everybody has the same amazing experience with it that I do. Different meds work for different people. I've tried close to 30 and finally found meds I can be reasonably stable on. Lamictal was in the mix for about 5 years but in the end it didn't do much for me and a high dose of something else was better than a moderate dose of a few things.</TEXT>

I've had times where I cried right after I left but never during a session. I have this wall of apathy up. I'm not truly apathetic because I get upset later but in the moment I act and feel apathetic. It's how I cope. I tell myself and truly believe that I don't care but then cry later.

    <TEXT>I wish more were easier to reach between appointments and I could email/message. One office I went to had a secure messaging system and their policy was to respond quickly so I could hear from my pdoc frequently and it was great. I've had some that won't answer their phone or email and were impossible to reach. My therapist tried going to that pdocs office since they were in the same building and she couldn't get a hold of him either. I wish more of my med switches were gradual. The last one I had was fine. Half dose of the old one for a week or two while half dose of the other at the same time for the same length of time and discontinue the old one at the same time I do the full dose of the new one. I have had so few like that. Like almost none. I've had doctors tell me to stay on something when I was about to kill myself from the suicidal thoughts I got as a side effect, I've had doctors take me off of things that were working great, I wish they listened about what I think I should and shouldn't be on. One pdoc told me latuda wasn't an option. Now it's my main med and I'm doing fantastic on it. I've had multiple doctors told me I was just about out of options. They were wrong, thankfully. I wish more docs knew the mechanism of action for the meds instead of just what drug class they're in. For example, both seroquel and remeron act on the A2 receptor. When I was going off seroquel and going through withdrawal a doc knew that remeron, although in a different drug class, acts similarly. So they put me on remeron and the withdrawal stopped and I reacted very well to it. I like when they monitor my ativan usage and ask if I want more even if I'm not using it much, just in case. I've had some refuse to prescribe it at all and that was rough. Then I got into a habit of stock piling it. Now I never take it and don't ask for more but I appreciate that they still offer. Bad communication and not listening are the worst. Good doc but can't be reached? Reason to switch. The communication piece is vital.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love love love latuda. No side effects and it helps sooo much. I'm on a high dose of it. It helped starting around 40mg. Then it stopped working. Then we raised it to 60 and it worked great, until it stopped working. Then we raised it to 80 and I was on that for a very long time. 120 was too much for me. Now I'm on 100mg and it's wonderful. Best med I've tried. I'm also on remeron and those two things together make me reasonably stable. It took a lot of trial and error to get here. I think I've tried something like 28 meds. Lamictal wasn't enough by itself so we added wellbutrin and it was better than nothing. I was on that for a few years because I didn't have access to mental healthcare to change my meds. Then we started playing around with adding a 3rd med. Eventually latuda was tried and it was a gamechanger. On 80 it wasn't enough with the rest so we played with adding a 4th. And a 5th. And eventually we got up to 7 with the as needed drugs. Then we started lowering how much I was on. Eventually they cut what I was on in half and raised the latuda and that fixed things better than I ever thought it would. Sorry I started rambling. My med journey has been long but latuda is easily the best med I've tried and I really hope it helps you. There's a savings card that takes off quite a bit of money and makes it more affordable. Make sure you use it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zoloft made me crazy. If that happens it points to bipolar. It's an odd combo to start on and a little risky. Abilify isn't a mood stabilizer. Antidepressants can make a bipolar person manic on their own, without a mood stabilizer, and sometimes even with a mood stabilizer. I would find a different doctor or ask lots of questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can totally relate. I was terrified of starting seroquel. Honestly it wasn't bad at all! It made it harder to wake up and it made me hungrier. A tip is to track your calories and find low calorie snacks. Cheddar rice cakes taste just like cheetos but with like no calories. Don't waste calories on drinks. Diet or unsweetened or water. Find things that are filling but not too many calories. Honestly I ate dry fruit loops as a snack. Not the healthiest but it solved the sugar/carb cravings and I only ate about a cup at a time which isn't terrible calorie wise. Avoid fast food and eating out. Too many calories. I loved seroquel. I miss it. It was intimidating to start but once I was on it I was fine. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was also on latuda and there's an unspoken rule about not being on two antipsychotics. It was one or the other. I tried dropping latuda but got extremely depressed immediately so we dropped the seroquel. The withdrawal was horrible. I was taken off of it way too fast and got hospitalized where they put me on remeron which acts similarly to seroquel and took away the withdrawal. I've been on remeron ever since and love it. Seroquel was great for me and really helped my residual depression. I wish I could be on it with latuda but remeron is ok.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Not coping well</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 16:06:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm frustrated. I'm getting angry. I'm mostly controlling my outward reactions but I'm not controlling things inside very well. I want to self harm. I wish I had a way to kill myself. It's lots and lots of little things and not having control over my surroundings. I recognize it all for what it is, not coping well. My mom is staying with me for a while. Leaving to go somewhere to get away isn't really an option. Even if it was I'd return to the same crap and wouldn't end up any better. I want to cry but I can't cry in front of my mom. I'm so...frustrated. Depressed. Stressed. Wanting to be alone. But I can't be alone, not for a few more weeks. I go to bed a little early to watch netflix and take my time getting up in the morning but it's not enough. Shit, I was so fine before. I was doing so well. Last ketamine infusion I got didn't do anything and it feels like my meds are off but idk how they'd change if they ever change again in the near future. This is still better than I used to be on a regular basis. Why is it that when the going gets tough my coping skills get forgotten and disregarded and go out the window and I'm left with nothing? I can't wait for therapy tonight. I'm a mess. Anything past this is venting. Nothing that needs to be read. I bought a new house. We're slowly moving in, the big move is in a couple weeks. My mom is here to help me pack but hasn't done much at all. She's why my brand new hutch got ruined putting it together, because she wouldn't get off her ass and help me with assembly. Ruined. My appliances got delivered today. The delivery guys took my door off its hinges to fit the fridge and now it's misaligned. The wall in a different spot is damaged. The paint and texture got taken off. I'm filing a claim to get it fixed but so far it's being bounced around. My brand new house that hasn't even been slept in yet has a fucked up door and wall. I'm upset. My phone screen is all cracked from an accident last week. My mom and boyfriend keep turning the fan on in the house and apartment and make me cold. I hate being cold. It's my house. It should be my temperature. Why do we have to cater to people that are hot and others suffer being cold? I don't have full control over my diet and food timing so sometimes I need to eat extra for my latuda calories. I don't want to eat twice at night. Sometimes I don't want to eat once. I want to be on my own so I can control my food. Hell, I want to be able to walk around in my underwear to get clean clothes from the dryer. Moving is such a pain. I hate packing. My mom was supposed to be helping in all these ways but she's barely doing crap. I want to kill myself so everything can stop. So I can be in control. So fuck everyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see my therapist today and I'm looking forward to that. I'm moving locally so I'll still be with her. Boyfriend bitches constantly that I keep it too stuffy and if I change the fan to be on a lower setting he changes it back. He won't let me be comfortable or compromise. My mom will. He won't be living with me, he's still in another city finishing grad school and living at home. The food thing, I had been doing the cooking but my mom said she would make spaghetti and meatballs so fine. We were at the house and I said I was hungry so we went back to the apartment and it took her two hours to start cooking. I told her I was hungry. So I couldn't take my lunesta because if you take it too close to eating it doesn't always work and we didn't eat till like 9 so that's when I took my latuda. Or we're at the house and hungry so we get fast food and I have to eat twice because I don't have my latuda with me. If it was just me I'd either not eat or head right back to the apartment where all of my stuff still is. Or I say I don't want food and she brings me breakfast anyway even though I said no. She's being a mom and doing things on her schedule instead of mine and I'm used to being on my own and doing things on my schedule.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I cried in therapy for the first time</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-11 19:21:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been in therapy for two years but never got upset enough during a session to cry. Until yesterday. My ex messaged me that the dog I used to have that his parents ended up with died. I wasn't upset about that, she was 13 and lived a good long life. I figured if she wasn't already dead she would be soon. I was upset because I was so terrible to him. He's the person I was with when my symptoms started. He was nothing but kind to me and I was such a bitch to him. I got angry, I used him, I'm ashamed of how I was. I told him I was using him but he insisted it was fine. It took him years to realize it wasn't fine. My therapist said it was the chemical imbalance and I wouldn't have been that way if it wasn't for the chemical imbalance so I need to forgive myself. I guess I'm still caught up on that. It got me thinking about how bad I was for years. I should have been hospitalized a few times before I finally was between college and post college. I was so so so bad. I'm better now than I used to be but right now I'm unstable again. I feel like I have nobody to talk to and I can't be honest, not even on here, about my thoughts. Like nobody gets it. Like nobody can help. I don't know what it'll take to get better. My therapist thinks the worst of this is over and I'll keep getting better but it feels like I'll never be better or at least this will always keep happening and I'll never stay stable. What's the point in trying? If I was gone people would get over it eventually. Maybe not at first but after a while they'd move on and be fine. I'll never be better better. Why should I have to keep suffering so others don't hurt? How is that fair? How is anything in my life fair? How is it ok for me to keep going on living like this? I'm a terrible person. I don't deserve the kindness that people give me.</TEXT>

It did some good but I really wish I wasn't still depressed. Maybe my other meds need to be changed. I just had the idea, lunesta is relatively new to my med combo. What if it's making me depressed?

    <DATE>2020-06-12 21:51:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I haven't had self harm/suicidal thoughts since October when I was hospitalized and my medication changed. Until we dropped remeron from my med combo and added trazodone. Then I was depressed. Then we added back the remeron but added lunesta and now about a month later I'm wanting to self harm, I'm suicidal, and I'm really depressed. The only difference between my meds now and my meds a few months ago when I was fine is the addition of lunesta. The problem is I couldn't sleep. What else is there to try to sleep? Ambien would give me the same side effects as lunesta. Atarax didn't keep me asleep. Benzos aren't an option because I get ketamine infusions and they make ketamine ineffective. My remeron dose is too high to put me to sleep because I use it for the antidepressant qualities. Has anyone else ever had ambien or lunesta make them depressed? How rare is it? 27/f/bipolar if it matters.</TEXT>

It's like my meds aren't working as well since I started taking it. I've tried atarax, trazodone, I'm on remeron but my remeron dose is too high for sleep, seroquel isn't an option because I'm on latuda, benzos aren't an option because I get ketamine infusions and they make ketamine less effective, ambien would have the same side effects as lunesta. Melatonin is a joke. Too much benadryl makes me restless and I don't sleep well on it. I'm glad to finally have realized why I'm so off. Good news, my ketamine booster IV infusion instantly cured my self harm thoughts. I don't think it'll last but I'll take the temporary relief.</TEXT>

Are they still holding groups? Or are you basically confined to your room all the time? I've been worse but the problem could be solved in days if I was hospitalized versus weeks or months outpatient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Normally I live alone but my mom is visiting me right now for a couple months. I wanted to go out and pick up breakfast one day but she said no and I got frustrated. It's my place, I should be able to do what I want. The advice I was given, by a friend who is a mom of college aged kids, said next time to say "mom, I love you, but I'm going out for (whatever). I'll be back later." It's so simple. Yours could be "mom, I love you but I'm an adult. I'm a college graduate. I'm sorry you don't like me going out but I'm going out for a bit and I'll be back soon." Be assertive yet respectful. I don't get along with my parents, they're abusive and toxic, and I could still see myself saying that. You could go out for a walk around the neighborhood and facetime your boyfriend while you're walking. Or offer to get groceries and meet up with a friend first or call him on the drive and while you're in the grocery store. Going for walks around the neighborhood might be really helpful. You could use the time to call up friends and you'd still totally be social distancing. Does going out before your parents wake up work? Just to get out? Or talking to friends after your parents go to sleep? Maybe go to bed a little early so you can get some alone time to talk to whoever you want. For a little while when my mom came I went to my room around 9 then watched what I wanted on Netflix for an hour or two. It was so great to have some "me" time. You need "me" time. It'll make the time more bearable. Tell your dad to stop commenting on your body. Tell him it makes you uncomfortable. Or talk to your mom about it and ask your mom to tell your dad to stop. You need to set boundaries. That's what my therapist tells me. I need to tell them no, set boundaries, and set expectations. They'll fight it but if you're persistent, according to her, they should change. I'll be trying it out next week. My dad comes to visit Sunday for two weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I truly love ketamine. It helped me so much but I don't think it's doing anything anymore. I had an infusion Friday and by Sunday I was suicidal again. Today I got a major depressive swing. Last month I felt like the ketamime did nothing. This month it worked for what, a day? That's not worth it. This sub is amazing and I love you all and how friendly and supportive you are. Where I go for infusions doesn't offer any take home options, just IV. I go every 4-5 weeks. But these last two months it did almost nothing. I can't justify $300 a month for something that doesn't work. I got my set of 6 about a year ago, sometime last summer, and I've had 14 or 15 infusions total. During that time I was hospitalized once for being so suicidal. Ketamine didn't stop that. Everyone says they notice a difference since I started getting it and it really helps me. But it doesn't feel like it's working anymore. Thoughts?</TEXT>

You can make plans and keep them without getting stressed out or overthinking. Things are easy. Showering doesn't take any effort. Doing laundry is routine. Cooking is enjoyable, or at the very least not a hassle. You can really cook. Life is so different in so many ways and you're thankful that things are ok, like really ok. You know you used to be depressed but you can't really relate to it. It feels like you're a different person. You feel a little bad that people dealt with you when you were depressed and unable to do all of the things you can now do.

A depressed person can't do all of the things I've been doing, at least not easily. What changed? We added trintellix. I had GI issues the first day and now it's making me a little itchy but my appetite is better, I can sleep on my own now, I'm not depressed, it's wonderful. Hopefully it lasts! I even made an appointment to get allergy tested. Why not? I am so fortunate to be like this. There were so many times where I thought there was no hope. I've tried like 30 meds. Finally, a good pdoc that knows what they're doing and a good combo got me to a good place. It's amazing. It's possible. There's hope.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once had a breakup where the guy told me to "do the world a favor and go kill yourself." I almost did. I moved halfway across the country for college for him. I had nobody left. Guess what? Now I love my life. A couple boyfriends later, some breakups easier than others, and I realize that the relationship I was so hung up on was pretty dysfunctional. I was originally a science major. My BP got in the way and I switched to education. Because of my science background I'm a science teacher and I absolutely love it. Is my life anything like what I thought it would be when we broke up in 2012? Nope. It's better in so many ways. I've grown so much. It felt like the end of the world and for a while it was but eventually I moved on and I'm doing great. I moved again but stayed in the same state. When I moved I knew literally nobody in my city. Now I have some of the best, most supportive people that have ever been in my life as friends and coworkers. Life changes can be hard. Or they can be opportunities. I know what it's like to have a tough breakup. I know what it's like to move somewhere and not know anybody. I've tried something like 30 meds, I know side effects. Well now I have very minimal side effects. I have friends in my new home. Who knows, you could end up great after you adjust.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me me me! Check out /r/theraputicketamine. I started getting ketamine infusions about a year ago. By the 3rd or 4th infusion I noticed a difference. I don't know how much it helps me now. How it works is you get it through an IV and get 6 over 2 weeks, usually MWF for two weeks. Then you get a booster about once a month. It helped for a couple weeks but I rarely felt like it helped for a full month. When I got it last month I was suicidal and wanted to self harm and it immediately took that away. Amazing. My therapist says it makes a big difference and she doesn't want me to stop, even though I feel like it doesn't help the most. Those around me notice a difference.</TEXT>

Being on fewer things at higher doses was better for me than being on more things. My last hospitalization took me off half my meds and raised my latuda and that helped so so much. Then we raised the remeron a little. Then we added trintellix. I had some absolutely perfect days recently. I never thought that would be possible. I saw others mentioning ketamine and I have to agree. I've done it and it really helped the depression. Browse through /r/therapeuticketamine and ask questions there.

I'm not on lamictal anymore and haven't been for months to a year but my cognition is still like it's on power save mode. I love the way you put that. Maybe it's the bipolar. Maybe it's my head injuries. Maybe it's my other medications even though they aren't known for cognitive issues. Whatever it is, it's worth it to be stable.

    <TEXT>My therapist asked a ton of questions lookint for red flags pointing to mania and couldn't find any. Being on 20mg of the trintellix is the only dose that made a difference in the depression. It also makes me fall asleep which is great because I struggled with that before and had to take something separate for sleep. I read that all of my things can be trintellix side effects so it's not like I'm too surprised. I'm guessing the next step will be going back on lamictal or wellbutrin.

    <TITLE>Auditory hallucinations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-20 23:15:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Are they a sign of an episode? Can it just happen randomly? This morning after I woke up I heard talking but normally my mom isn't up that early, I heard a lawnmower but my neighbor mowed his lawn over the weekend, and I heard music. Turns out my mom was up and talking very loud on the phone in the living room. Over an hour later when I was on my way home after going out there was a lawnmower going for the part near the road that the HOA is in charge of. There's no way the music was real. I seriously thought I was going crazy with all three sounds. My tinnitus is really bad today. I haven't had auditory hallucinations in a very very long time. The change recently is that we lowered my latuda to try to get rid of side effects from the trintellix. I think I'm going to raise the latuda back up. I'm still having the side effects and now I'm having higher anxiety and depression and auditory hallucinations. I'll deal with some extra movements and itchy skin and sore fingers if it means I'm stable. I know very little about hallucinations so any info at all on what they mean or what I should do would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was hospitalized in October because I was suicidal from the hormones from an IUD (birth control). Got that taken out real fast but it left me a mess. I was on lamictal or depakote, we switched back and forth for a while, wellbutrin, 80mg latuda, and 15mg remeron. In the hospital they took me off of everything but the latuda and remeron and I stabilized. I was still a little depressed though. My pdoc raised the latuda to 100 mg since I had tried 120 at one point and it was too much and wow. My anxiety vanished. My depression was so much less. I was doing reasonably well, but I was still mildly depressed and I couldn't eat. So we tried raising the remeron. This was months later. All of a sudden I couldn't sleep but I could eat. So now we're up to 100mg latuda and 30mg remeron. Eventually we added atarax for sleep but it wasn't working consistently so we dropped the remeron and added trazodone. Big hunk of nope. Depressed. Back to remeron. Tried adding lunesta. Made me depressed and suicidal. Back to atarax. It helped at a higher dose than I was on before. Still left with a little bit of depression. Enter trintellix. We worked our way up to 20mg and it's like a light turned on and I'm fine. So it's 100mg latuda, 30mg remeron, 20mg trintellix. I have some trintellix side effects. I move more and the joints in my fingers hurt but it's tolerable if I'm this stable. People I'm close to say they've never seen me like this before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I take an 80 and a 20. I max out my insurance every year so it's expensive for a while but then it all ends up being free. Latuda is $1300 before deductible, $15 after deductible thanks to the savings card, and that's each, and trintellix is in the $400 range before deductible, not sure how much after deductible. I hit my out of pocket max every year then go see other doctors for like allergies or a dermatologist or whatever extra thing isn't really that important because it's free. In terms of having to take an extra pill it's not so bad. I'm on fewer meds than I've been on in the past. The remeron is more of a pain because it's dissolvable so I have to tear open the blister pack for each pill every day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depakote increases the amount of lamictal in your body. When they had me on both they halved my lamictal to compensate. Still, being on both was bad. Horrible memory problems. We dropped the latuda eventually and I can't remember all of my side effects but I know I had hair loss, which sucks as a girl, and joint pain. My knees hurt so bad. Eventually I went off of it. Latuda does far more for my depression than depakote did. I recently started trintellix and I like it but now I have joint pain in my fingers. So I guess watch out for memory problems and joint pain.</TEXT>

I'm spending time with her tomorrow and I know I'll cry more. I don't feel abandoned. I'm sad a strong steady relationship is ending. I've had like 8 or 9 pdocs but only one long term therapist. I saw someone before her for like 3 sessions and we didn't click at all. Then I met my current therapist and from the start things were ok. My fear is that I'll have to spend a long time finding someone else I click with. She's recommending me to someone she thinks will work well with me so that's good but the fear will be there for a while until I get established with this person. Great, now my head hurts from crying so much. I don't know how to get over losing a close relationship like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't seen my boyfriend in two months and we're together for a week and he really wants to have sex but I don't want anything to do with getting intimate. I'm stable but have absolutely no sex drive. None at all. I usually don't have much of one but it's absolutely zero now. I'm on latuda, remeron, and trintellix. I don't even like the idea of playing with my vibrator. I feel awful. We're together for a whole week, we have a whole brand new house to ourselves, and I don't want to sleep with him. I'll probably force myself to have sex at some point, my choice not him forcing me, because we are young and should be having sex frequently. I feel like I owe it to him and he deserves it. Are there any meds to help female sex drive? Any tips for increasing sex drive? I know wellbutrin can help but I was on that before with a minimal sex drive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Diagnosed in I think 2014 as a college student. In 2013 I got so depressed I almost killed myself and had to drop some of my classes because I couldn't function. Got on minimal meds and stayed on them for like two years even though they weren't ideal. I didn't have access to mental healthcare. In 2016 I graduated college and got a job as a teacher in another city. Before my big episode in 2013 I was a science major. It's not that I wasn't smart enough, it's that I fell behind when I dropped classes and couldn't get caught up. So I switched to teaching. In December of the first year of teaching I started trying new meds to get more stable. New insurance and I ran out of old meds so I needed a psychiatriat. The side effects made me so sick my principal was worried about me and I told her about my diagnosis. Ended up being a good choice. Her mom had bipolar so she understands and doesn't judge. I think I've had 8 pdocs, some I left because they were awful, some were residents and entered the next part of their residency, one quit his job, one didn't like ketamime and I really wanted to try it, now I have a good pdoc. I've tried close to 30 meds. There were times where I was self harming, I've been hospitalized three times for being suicidal, and there were times where I couldn't get out of bed or shave or eat. I got down to 93 lbs at one point because I couldn't eat. Then I got up to over 150. A healthy weight for someone my height is 110-120. Now I'm reasonably stable! Ketamine helped a lot. A higher dose of latuda, remeron, and trintellix are hella expensive but it's what works for me so I'm fine with it. I max out my insurance every year so everything's free after a while. I had hospitalizations I didn't think I could survive but I did and I'm all the better becayse of it. I had med side effects so bad I was incapacitated. But now I'm fine. If a med was ok for you but not great ask your doc to try a higher dose. I was on 80mg latuda for a long time. 120 was too much. Now I'm on 100 and it means taking two pills but it works. Different doses is what I needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After I tried half a dozen a doc told me I was out of options. After I tried a few more a different doc told me I was out of options. Overall I've had three or four docs tell me I'm out of options. That's not true. Now I'm with someone that knows how the different meds work and she knows what should work based on its mechanism of action. It's made such a difference. Meds don't have to make you feel awful. Meds that have been fine for me are lamictal, wellbutrin, remeron, latuda, trintellix, seroquel, atarax (for sleep), and ativan. Ketamine helped a lot but now my meds are good enough that I don't need it anymore. I will go back to getting ketamine if my mood gets bad again and meds aren't doing the trick. Right now I'm depressed but that's because I had a drink. Now I know even stable I still can't drink. It's not worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lamictal helped me some but it wasn't until we discovered latuda that I got real improvements. It's expensive but for me totally worth it. When I went off Lamictal I felt no different. It's not for everybody. Remeron helps me sleep at low doses but I'm on a higher dose for the antidepressant effects. Trintellix makes me sleep now. Being on trazodone and off remeron made me depressed when we tried that. Then we tried lunesta. Made me suicidal and depressed. Then we went back to atarax for sleep and that works at the highest dose. Trazodone didn't work for the first few days, it had to be in my system a bit for it to work.</TEXT>

My new primary care doc doctor told me to go on a low fat diet and she'd check my cholesterol again in 6-12 months. Why does everything I like involve cheese? I don't know if I'm strong enough to go on a diet. I just started eating regularly. I could cut out baked goods even though baking is my new hobby. I could buy low fat products and cut out butter. I could limit fast food. But cheese? And white bread? Anybody got tips for going low fat? It sounds easier than low carb at least. I'm planning on working out from home on weekdays. I'm thinking about going to bed early and waking up early to work out. I go back to teaching in a few weeks so I can create a solid routine. Seriously, any low fat tips or go to foods/ recipes would be appreciated. My primary care doc put me on the diet, not my pdoc. I haven't talked to my pdoc about it yet. I see her next week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mirtazapine (remeron) helped me sleep for a while. It's a mild antidepressant. The lower the dose the more sedating it is. It doesn't help for sleep at higher doses. Trazodone could help. It didn't work for me the first couple days but then it started helping. We dropped remeron for trazodone and I ended up depressed because trazodone is an even weaker antidepressant. I tried lunesta and it made me depressed and suicidal. Atarax at a high dose works for me. It's an antihistamine. I need the max dose to sleep but half of that used to work for me. Temazepam has also worked well for me, but the lowest dose wasn't effective. Just because a low dose doesn't work doesn't mean the med doesn't work, you may need a higher dose. Except remeron. There a higher dose won't help with sleep. /r/insomnia is a good sub to search through for help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There have been times where my temper got the best of me and I exploded on the kids but overall the routine is so good for me. I love being creative with my lesson planning and trying to find the best activities I can. The first year is tough. Once you know the curriculum it gets so much easier. The right administration is key. My principal is the person I'm the closest to in the world. We're probably closer than I am with my boyfriend. I tell her everything to do with my bipolar. I can't see myself doing that with any other administrator. She's special and I'm not saying you should be that close with admin, I lucked out. Anyway, the hardest part is the behavior from the kids. I teach in a somewhat rough school and I teach 6th grade and those kids suck. I still love them. If you have a passion for what you're teaching, I do science, it makes it all better. I know so much about science and get to share all the random crap I know with kids. School keeps me more stable. It's a good distraction. I've never taken a mental health day because I know if I do it's a slippery slope. I have missed days for being hospitalized. Generally teachers are accepting because we see it in the kids and don't judge the kids so why would we judge each other? I'm not super open with it. I keep quiet about my diagnosis except with a select few. It's not easy but I love what I do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going into my 5th year. I would like a slightly younger grade, like 4th, but during a pandemic before meds being stable was not the time to make a major change. Plus I was getting ketamine and had monthly pdoc appointments so I had to leave early 2-3 times a month and I didn't want to have to explain that to a new boss. If you're reasonably stable I think it's doable. There are a few of us bipolar teachers on this sub. I would recommend posting teacher questions here over /r/teachers because a lot of them are nasty and jaded. They go there to complain. You can always message me with teacher questions too.

    <TEXT>My psychiatrist ordered it. I'm on latuda, trintellix, and mirtazapine but the mirtazapine is at too high of a dose for it to work for sleep. She said with everything I'm on I should be sleeping. For a while on this med combo I was but I think anxiety is why I'm not. I'm a teacher and we're going back to work and that scares me. She thinks sleep apnea but I have none of the symptoms. She didn't even ask me about my sleep when she said that. She also ordered an insomnia test, that I have to go in for. I can't sleep without meds so I'll fail that hands down. It's during the day. Mirtazapine at lower doses helps my sleep but I need it for the depression so I need a higher dose. Trazodone left me depressed and didn't fully work. Lunesta made me depressed and suicidal. Atarax used to work but now it's not. Temazepam works but she's against it. Who is ok with lunesta but not temazepam? Whatever. If it's not sleep apnea what can a sleep study tell her? What exactly is an insomnia test? They said something about trying to sleep for half an hour and seeing if you fall asleep. That's not going to happen. People can fall asleep on command? During the day? I'm doing it at 5pm. It's a 3 night at home sleep study. I don't know what to expect. Any insight?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the trintellix. I've been waking up a few times a night and sometimes having multiple dreams a night. They're typically unpleasant. Tonight I had one where I was in a restaurant and an active shooter opened fire right next to me. I woke up with my heart racing around 5am and never got back to sleep. All I took for sleep last night was melatonin. My pdoc recommended it and oddly it's helping but it's not perfect. Should I talk to my pdoc about going off trintellix? It's the final piece of the puzzle making me stable but the nightmares suck and I have joint pain in my fingers plus quite the appetite that wasn't there before. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had joint pain in my knees from depakote for months about a year ago. I find it interesting that the joint pain this time is in a different place. I told my pdoc about that when I saw her last week and said it was tolerable because of how well I'm doing and she didn't react. I can do normal tasks fine. Picking up heavy things with my fingers is hard and makes them almost collapse but that only happens a couple times a week. The sleep issues are more of a problem for me than the joint pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You wouldn't expect to hear that from a teacher who's about to start three weeks of virtual learning. My lessons are better than ever. My special ed accommodations are amazing digitally. If there are any teachers that need advice I'm here to help. I made worksheets digital. They can mark their text evidence in a reading. I can add audio directions to my written directions. I can read passages or questions out loud to kids. I can make things different colors so they're just looking at half of the information, not all of the information. It's called chunking. I can assign different kids different leveled assignments and they'll never know theirs is different than someone else's. My instruction is better than it was in past years. I was given such a chance to grow because of all of this. I helped my former mentor who is now at another school make digital lessons and she publicly thanked me on Facebook to let everyone know what I did. I feel great. I feel appreciated. I feel like I'm being helpful. I'm so ready for school to start. I'm going to be meeting my kids' needs on a whole new level. I have a new team of teachers I'm working with and we're getting along great. This year has some bad circumstances but I'm making it work and I'm thriving.</TEXT>

Well let me just say I'm oddly excited about this remote instruction thing. We're asynchronous. We're operating through google classroom. I found out how to make the same worksheet they'd do in class digital. I figured out how to make sorts digital and even chunk them. I found out how to add audio to google slides to read directions to kids or provide clarification or read the assignment to them, in chunks of course. My assignments are so much better than assignments I've done in years past. They're similar but better. My training on digital teaching this summer was amazing. I learned so much. And I have a new team this year and I absolutely love them. This is the first time I've had a team I click with. The circumstances of this year suck but so much is going right. I'm so excited about my instruction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My district did three days of training for digital learning and I had a three day digital teaching AVID training in June and a one day district workshop a couple weeks after that. A lot of it I learned from other teachers. You can always YouTube it and there are a ton of videos on there. If you have any questions you can always ask me! I don't know everything but it's funny, people on my campus started seeing me as the technology person to go to. I'm not the most knowledgeable but I did post a few times on Facebook about it and I figured out a few things like adding audio to google slides so you can do oral admin. My AVID training taught me about marking the text in google docs. I think campus collaboration is how I learned to make worksheets digital. I'm on a Facebook page for bitmoji classrooms and that's how I learned the most, just reading the posts. It's called Bitmoji Craze for Educators. Wonderful page.</TEXT>

I'm bipolar and on latuda, remeron, and trintellix and that works for me. I've tried a ton of medications and this is the answer, at least for now. Ketamine was just a bandaid.

    <DATE>2020-08-29 17:37:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had an especially bad day Thursday and almost had the cops called on me I worried someone so much. I need to learn to identify better when it's time to call a crisis line. My first step would be to text 741-741. If that doesn't work I'd call and talk to someone on the phone. The problem is I have an out of state phone number so if I call I get a call center in that state, not near where I placed the call, and I relate to Texans better having lived here for the past 9 years. So I can't call the national number. I need a local number for a crisis center I can call. Currently I live near Houston. I'm a little too overwhelmed by the idea to do all of the research myself. I've tried looking before and kept getting directed to the national number. Or does anyone have any good crisis centers to call that are elsewhere that you can rely on? Any favorites? I don't want one that's going to freak out if I call and I don't want one that will hear I'm not in immediate danger and not care. I've had the experience before where they didn't see it as being enough of a crisis so they ended the conversation and that hurts.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-31 00:57:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's my story. When I was 2 my dad came home from work one day and came into my room and started screaming at me. I don't know why. My mom had to pull him out of my room and she came to comfort me. I was shaking. Even after I fell asleep with her holding me I was still shaking. I don't remember most of my childhood. They first noticed signs of depression when I was in 2nd grade. Nobody did anything to help me. In high school my room was a mess. I was depressed and I didn't care if my room was neat. My dad would come home from work, scream at me about how I'm worthless and going to end up on the streets and get kicked out of the house the day I turn 18. This was every night. Eventually I would pretend I was asleep so he wouldn't come in my room. Sometimes he'd still come in and scream at me, sometimes even when I was actually asleep. He wouldn't stop. My mom had to pull him out of my room and they'd scream at each other in the hall outside my room. I don't have flashbacks. I am very sensitive to people yelling or being hostile. I shut down when there's confrontation. At the time I knew my dad was full of crap. I was in AP classes, in a bunch of clubs, and on honor roll. I spent as much time at school as possible so I wasn't at home. I started noticing I was depressed in 6th or 7th grade. I started getting bipolar symptoms when I was 21 and immediately got treatment for the bipolar on my own, which caused problems in my family so I didn't talk to them for a few months. Is what I experienced abuse? Is it trauma? My last therapist told me I had some form of PTSD but CPTSD makes a lot more sense than PTSD. She didn't go into it and I forgot to ask at our last session together. I start with a new therapist next week. I'm so worried that I'm going to splinter and get unstable by talking about my trauma in therapy. If it was trauma. In the moment when I'm talking about it I don't have a reaction to it. I say I don't care. But then later I get upset after it all sinks in. Is that normal for some people or do I handle it wrong? I'm new to this sub and going to spend a while reading through posts to learn more about CPTSD.</TEXT>

I just got a new therapist and she wants to start talking about my trauma since I'm reasonably stable. Well, just telling her what my past trauma was made me a mess. Not even digging into it, just telling her what in my past counted as trauma. I am terrified that I'm going to hurt or kill myself as a result of talking about my trauma and breaking it apart. How can I make sure that doesn't happen? What do I do when I'm bad but don't want to use coping skills? How can therapy prepare me for talking about this and help me when I'm too...lazy? Unmotivated?

    <TEXT>When I was diagnosed I didn't exactly tell my parents at first. I lived quite a few states away for college. Well, then I had to tell my mom. I needed my dad's social security number to use the insurance card to get my prescriptions. Mom asked what prescription so I told her. I didn't have a choice. She immediately told me that I didn't have bipolar and it led to so much arguing and such a big fight that we didn't talk for months. For a couple of years she denied it and still said I didn't have it. Finally she understands that I do have it but we still don't talk about it. A little back story as to why this hurt more than it would have otherwise. They first noticed something was wrong with me in 2nd grade. Nothing was done to help me. I started noticing I was depressed in 6th or 7th grade. In high school doctors hinted to my parents that I was depressed and they ignored it or said no or called the doctor a quack. So there's a history of my parents ignoring my mental health struggles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help getting through emotional flashbacks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 22:04:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I found the name for what I was going through I felt relieved. I'm in my bed curled up and feel like I can't leave the room, just like I did after getting screamed at and put down. It's absolutely an emotional flashback. I haven't gotten there in therapy yet. How do I get past this? How do I feel normal again and make my brain believe there's no danger or threat? I live halfway across the country from my parents. I'm in a house all by myself. There is absolutely no threat. I do know what caused this but that's not important. It was my mom being my mom and harassing me a little. She wasn't the problem growing up, my dad was.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My former therapist suggested I had PTSD. Now I see it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 01:14:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think it's CPTSD, not straightforward PTSD. Emotionally and verbally abusive childhood. Well, today my mom called me and we were talking and she was harping on me about some stuff and not being super nice and I basically hung up on her. Then I had an emotional flashback. I was curled up on the bed in my spare bedroom staring at the wall feeling like I couldn't get off the bed and it was unsafe to leave the room. My parents are in a different time zone. I moved far away. I live alone. There was no danger. But I felt exactly like I felt a decade ago after my dad got done screaming at me. It was awful. Emotional flashbacks are a CPTSD symptom. I want to get officially diagnosed with it now. I'm going to talk to my therapist about it this week. I'm not ready to talk about my trauma but I do need help dealing with its effects. I felt so helpless and so scared and so stuck on that bed. I'm glad I figured out what it was, I do much better when I can put a label on what's going on. But wow did it make me realize how fucked up my childhood was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I truly believe it's both bipolar 2 and CPTSD. The emotional flashback and how I react to yelling tells me yes, CPTSD. But my depression that happens randomly without triggers and anger over nothing and reaction to medication tells me bipolar. I'm curious how many of my episodes were really emotional flashbacks that I didn't recognize at the time. The one I had yesterday is the first one I've ever noticed but I'm positive it's happened before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was awful at cleaning my cat's letterbox so I bought an automatic one. Totally worth it. I don't eat three meals a day, and that's fine. I live alone and went through a phase where I was self harming. I came out the other side. My issues are slightly different than yours. I have the cptsd but also bipolar. Now that my meds are better I only get bad when I have a trauma response to something. I'm not bad all the time. Is medication for depression and anxiety an option? It's helped me so much. It's made it possible for me to be stable enough to talk about the trauma in therapy. We still haven't dug into my trauma after a couple years of therapy because I wasn't ready. Soon I'll be ready and I know I won't be coping with it well. What you need to focus on is the essentials. Eating at all, even if it's not 3 meals a day. Sleeping. Surviving. Therapy isn't the only thing that can help you. Medication can too.</TEXT>

School found out and made me do paperwork with HR and if it happened again further steps would need to be taken. Well, that's what's kept me from doing it again. If it kept happening I could lose my job. Not worth it. I've struggled with the self harm thoughts since then but was able to not do it. Wow. Can't believe it's been a whole year. I'm so much better now than I was a year ago. After a hospitalization last October and med changes I'm reasonably stable and now only really get bad as a trauma response to things. We're starting to get into the trauma in therapy now. I wasn't ready before this. Interesting how far I've come in a year.</TEXT>

A higher dose of latuda did more for me than being on a bunch of different meds. It looks like you're on too many similar meds. Get a different pdoc. Yours keeps throwing things at you without getting rid of the things that are ineffective. At one point I was on 7 things at once. Now I'm on 3 and doing far better than I did on 7.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why hydroxyzine if also ativan and seroquel? I take hydroxyzine for sleep at night. Seroquel is also sedating. Ativan can also be sedating. Lamictal at 200mg gave me awful brain fog. If you switched the seroquel to at night and raised the dose you may be able to cut out some of the meds and you may not need the trazodone. Your seroquel dose is very low. That low of a dose didn't do anything for me. You may not be on the optimal doses of your meds. I found that I did better on fewer meds with higher doses. I used to be on 7 things but now do better on 3-4 depending if I take the hydroxyzine for sleep. It does nothing for my mood so I consider that I'm really on 3 for mood. Also, you may be anxious from the wellbutrin and Vyvanse. They can both make you anxious. I got way less anxious when I went off the wellbutrin and upped my latuda dose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I'm depressed without sadness. Lack of interest, no appetite, not hungry, ignoring calls from people, sitting in silence instead of watching tv, not showering, not brushing my teeth, wearing dirty clothes. I'm eating. At school I'm having like a salad and a greek yogurt then something moderate for supper. Yesterday I had a huge breakfast then never got hungry again for the rest of the day, even 10 hours later. Today I made myself eat breakfast but I'm not hungry for lunch. No school because of tropical storm beta. We're supposed to get hit tomorrow with 10-15" of rain so I'm guessing no school till Thursday or Friday. We can't even do remote because the face to face kids returned the computers they were borrowing. I'm not that bad but I do have lots of depression symptoms. I definitely have cptsd and two weekends ago, maybe last weekend, don't remember, had a huge emotional flashback and my new therapist said yes, I do have ptsd and trauma responses to things. I learned my childhood had emotional neglect. So abuse, trauma, and emotional neglect. I'm sure that all has something to do with how I'm doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven't been eating breakfast during the week. If I am it's breakfast tacos...tortilla, egg, potato, cheese, salsa. What are lower calorie tortilla options? I could cut out the potato or do turkey bacon. Cut down on the cheese. Salsa is very few calories. That's on weekends and I don't have lunch if I have breakfast tacos. What are low calorie chip options? Lunch during the week has been a pre-made salad that's about 240 calories and an 80cal light and fit greek yogurt for a total of 320 calories and it keeps me comfortable until supper. I don't snack. Drinks have been coke zero. I had been drinking coke but I switched to coke zero. I know soda isn't good for you but it's the only thing I consistently drink and I have problems staying hydrated. Supper has been a part of a bigger meal I heated up and portioned out. Around 400-500 calories. Like a quarter of a family meal or a homemade burger. The burger is probably closer to 600 calories. On an average weekday I'm eating about 1000 calories. I know the minimum you should have is 1200. The problem is I suffer from depression and my appetite sucks so it's hard to eat sometimes and I don't always get hungry. The stuff I see on this sub is a lot of work and I don't know that I can do that. A common supper I have is a burger. Homemade so less calories than fast food but still, it's a burger. How can I make that less calories? What are lower calorie bun options? I could cut out mayo and cut out cheese. What are lower calorie meat options? The pre-made frozen burger patties are soooo fatty. I don't know how ground turkey patties would be or what kind of cheese would go with that. I don't really care for ground turkey and the super lean beef is expensive I haven't had any fast food or anything fried in a couple of weeks. If I have pizza it's a smaller serving than I would have eaten before. How can I make healthy or low cal pizza? Naan bread, sauce, and not too much cheese? Or single serving thin crusts? I don't really do toppings. If I do it's veggies. One of my medicines requires 350 calories in order to absorb properly so my supper has to be at least 350 calories. A lot of foods that are low in calorie are too few calories or I'd have to eat a lot of it and my appetite doesn't always support that. Like the Trader Joe's chicken cilantro mini wontons. Great but not enough calories. My suppers have to be easy and around 400 calories. Also, how do you calculate calories for homemade dishes? I guess you have to measure and weigh everything and do the math? I don't see a lot of posts on here like this. Everyone seems to already know what they're doing. I need easy or it's not going to happen. I'm a teacher who lives alone and is so overwhelmed by doing both virtual and face to face in the same day, I have little motivation to cook when I get home and weekends are for relaxing. TJ's is a drive but a drive I'm willing to make for good stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not showering much, I'm not really brushing my teeth, I'm not eating right, I have low motivation, I'm a bit of a mess. My therapist said it's time for a med adjustment. This is past what normal coping skills can help with. She did give me a couple of things to try but said do call my pdoc tomorrow. I was doing fine until the stress of school started. Even when we were doing virtual school I was fine. Now that I'm both virtual and face to face I'm a mess with the stress. It's anxiety behind the depression. I know it's the doctor's job to suggest what steps to take next but I think I'm going to ask about vraylar. I'm worried adding lamictal and wellbutrin wouldn't do much. I was on them together with other stuff for about 5 years and we cut them out almost a year ago. Worst case I get bad and end up hospitalized. Likely case I end up with side effects. Best case I get better. I may pack a hospital bag just in case. I want to get better. I finally see the need for more extreme help to get better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been on it for a few years. When I was getting on it I noticed a difference at 40. Then it stopped. Raised it to 60. Noticed a bigger difference. Then it stopped. Ended up on 80 for a very long time and it really helped. Now I'm on 100 and doing significantly better than I had been. Not too many side effects. Make sure to eat with it. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>You don't have to do things the hard way. Shortcuts are ok.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-26 23:47:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a cat. I was so awful at scooping her litterbox so I paid a bunch of money for an automatic litterbox and now I only change it once a month. I got a house and realized lawn care fucking sucks so I hired a lawn guy. I've been able to keep up with taking care of the inside. One time my toenails were gnarly and I couldn't find my toenail clippers after moving so I got a pedicure. If you're someone that has a hard time washing your hair, going to a salon to get it washed is ok. If you're bad at taking care of your nails getting your nails done once in a while is ok. Buying ready made meals you just have to heat up is ok. Paying a little more for fully cooked food or fully prepped food you just have to throw in the oven or throw in a pan can be worth it. Buying paper plates if you're bad at dishes is ok. Tidepods to make laundry easier if laundry is hard for you is ok. Detergent packets for the dishwasher if washing dishes is hard for you is ok. Whatever the shortcut is, as long as it's not too much of a hardship, is ok! I find it easier to do the things I need to do when I'm not stressing about the things I really don't want to do like the lawn or prepping every single meal. Also, paying a little more for a shampoo you really like or a face wash that smells good is worth it IMO. Anything that gets me to do the task I don't really like doing to have better hygiene is worth it if it gets me to take care of myself better. Have any other shortcuts you swear by? Share please so we can get some ideas from each other! Edit: the only things I regularly do are get my lawn mowed for me, which is $30 every other week, and the kitty litter, which is like $8 a month. Even with paying my lawn guy my monthly living expenses are cheaper now that I'm in a house than when I was in my apartment. I almost never get my nails done, I use regular detergent, not tide pods, I clean my house myself, I don't order to-go, and I don't pay a hair dresser to wash my hair. I tried to list all of the things I've seen on here, not list everything I do. I do have stable income as a teacher. If I didn't have stable income I'd live somewhere cheaper, not have lawn care, but still have an automatic kitty litter box and still buy partially prepped meals, trying to keep it under $3 per serving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do have makeup removing wipes for the rough days but haven't been wearing makeup recently so I haven't been using them or washing my face outside the shower. I know, awful. Great idea about the listerine. Once I realized I didn't really need to brush my teeth since I'm always wearing a mask around people I stopped brushing my teeth so much. I already only brushed them in the morning. I usually brush them on weekdays but rarely on weekends and never at night.</TEXT>

Yes, I could have gone to more stores to check but I was overwhelmed. It was a one time thing. I almost never get my toes done, I always do them myself. I think in my entire life I've only had 2 or 3 pedicures. Laugh if you want but you don't know the whole story.</TEXT>

Most of the things on the list I've never done. Some of the ideas I got from this sub and things I've seen others do. I'd personally never pay to have my hair washed but I've seen people comment on here that they've had it done. I was trying to give a list of everything I can think of that might help someone who's overwhelmed. It was meant to be something to give people small ideas to help them get over hurdles they have in their lives. I'm sorry you didn't see it that way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not upper middle class. I'm an unmarried teacher. I have never paid to get my hair washed, that's something I've seen posted on this very sub by people who were too depressed to shower and washing their hair was too much. I would never do that, I'd wash it myself. I've only ever gotten two or three pedicures in my entire life. It's not something I do regularly at all. I do use dishwasher pod things but that started when I was having problems with residue from the dishwasher detergent being left on my dishes, so I switched to the pods. I don't use tide pods. Even though I try to get food that's minimal prep I try to spend under $3 per serving on it. I don't ever order take out from a sit down restaurant. Many of the things I listed were just ideas. Not necessarily things I do. My mortgage is cheaper than my rent was so I can afford to have my lawn mowed. I do not pay for a cleaning service to do the inside. I wash my car myself instead of paying for a car wash. If it's something I use regularly I shop sales and stock up. The litterbox is my most expensive splurge but for me it's worth it. $8ish a month for litter isn't that bad. Some people spend more on booze and drugs and cigarettes than I spend on my little things to make my life easier. We choose to spend our money differently. My boyfriend buys liquor and beer and gets take out. I get my lawn done every other week. View me how you want, think of this post how you want, I'm just sorry you didn't see it as me trying to give others ideas for ways people could make their lives the tiniest bit easier when many of us struggle so much to survive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For dishes, try doing one step. Emptying the dishwasher. Even if you just put the dishes on the counter and not all the way away. Then load the dishwasher. Another day turn it on. Another day empty it out. You don't have to do the whole task at one time. I absolutely love my automatic litterbox. It's around $150 and I have the litter set up in subscribe and save so it gets sent to me automatically, which encourages me to change the litter every month. I don't have not having litter as an excuse. Tell yourself you're going to shower every 2 or 3 days and try to stick to that. Every day is for stable people. I didn't shave for a couple of weeks because I hated being in the shower and it was too much work. I did buy an electric razor for those times and that made it so much easier to shave my legs. I could do it dry and without making a mess or it taking up a lot of time. Absolutely worth it if you want to wear shorts but don't want to take a shower or shave your legs in the shower. It's the little things that help me get by. Doing the lawn is too much. But I can swiffer the floors one day and wipe down counter tops another day and clean up all of my dirty clothes another day. I've always had a messy living space. Always. Until I got a house. My last therapist was right, sometimes a new space is like a reset button and you can change your habits. My house isn't totally neat and put together but I can pull it together at the last minute and get it ready for guests if I need to, which I've never been able to do before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't really get manic or hypomanic episodes but they still consider me bipolar and not unipolar depressed. Your therapist sees you on meds after a hospitalization. If you were that stable you wouldn't have been hospitalized. Your therapist didn't see you at your worst. In the hospital they diagnosed me with BPD on top of bipolar, symptoms I only had because of hormones from an IUD. I need to talk to someone about getting rid of that diagnosis. Bipolar, absolutely. Borderline, no. Not everyone is right about your diagnosis. I guess my two points contradict themselves.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I took a couple months off of ketamine because I was doing great. Well, now I'm not doing great and thinking about going back. Leaving work early and not having a ride after is a huge pain. I'd love to try it a way that's not an IV that I can do at home. I'd need a prescribing doctor and a compounding pharmacy.

    <TEXT>I hadn't gotten it in a few months. I was doing great. Well, school started again and with that the stress of being a teacher. I wanted another infusion. Called the place I went before and they stopped doing ketamine. The next closest place is too far for anyone to give me a ride and way more expensive. I tried tms. I tried 30 medications. I'm still on meds but they're not quite enough. I've been in therapy for a few years. I've done so much and ketamine helped some, but now I can't have that quick, easy relief when I need it. I wish I had a way to get troches or nasal spray. I think I'll call compounding pharmacies tomorrow and ask who prescribes it locally. What works better, nasal spray or lozenges? Is either a replacement for IV ketamine? Esketamine may be an option but leaving work early would be incredibly difficult as a teacher during a pandemic with no subs. There is a place I could go for ketamime but it would be over a $30 uber ride each way because it's so far. He would raise my dose and try to get me to only need to come in every 6 weeks or longer. He said it only lasting 2-3 weeks, he can do so much better. Nice to have someone that would work so well with me but it's much more expensive and I wouldn't have a ride.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a history with depression so when the super severe depression hit I didn't think anything of it. Then I got reasonably ok. Then I started getting irritable and angry and staying up late and starting projects and cleaning. The irritable and angry part was the red flag. Got checked out, yup, bipolar. This was all in college. The depression started in middle school. The super severe depression didn't start until late high school, but I had chronic migraines and a head injury. The really really really severe depression was college a semester before the angry and irritable hypomania.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>20 mg latuda is a very, very low dose. It did absolutely nothing for me. I needed a much higher dose than that. If it works for you, that's awesome. But if you do get depressed consider asking your doctor to add more latuda. Set a bedtime. Take melatonin if you have to in order to get to sleep. My doctor was very specific to tell me exactly 3mg of melatonin and if that didn't work after a week to double it to 6mg. Amazingly 3mg worked, but it gave me nightmares so I had to stop it. For a bedtime maybe 10 or midnight so you can still be up at a reasonable hour. I used to go to bed around 10. Now I go to bed around 9. I turn my alarm off on the weekends but still wake up around 7. During the week I wake up around 6. I used to not wake up till at least 11. Now I can't sleep in. It depends on my meds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go ahead, say I told you so. I think I'm hypomanic. Talking loud and fast (I did this before bipolar) My credit card bill doubled (I can afford it) Getting really interested in a few random new hobbies (monogrammed pumpkins, classroom prizes, making tshirs) Spending a total of about $500 on prizes and stickers for my classroom (nothing costs over $0.75 each, much around $0.63, some $0.20 of less, stickers less than $0.03 each, my kids aren't getting expensive prizes...I bought in bulk and got a huge variety) I think I'm like the greatest teacher ever (but I have people telling me I'm doing super amazing, I have great classroom management this year, the kids love me, and my kids work so hard for me) Buying lots of gifts for people I love Wanting to clean or make shirts or read the robotics binder around midnight since I was still awake (voluntold to be the new robotics coach for my middle school, Vex) even though I'm normally asleep around 8 or 9 But Eating normally Sleeping reasonably and tonight's abnormality is because I actually ate breakfast so I had a late lunch so I had a really late supper so I took my meds really late People around me think I'm finally normal but can't recognize it in myself and not hypomanic Based on my meds I had a feeling I'd get manic. I'm not on a mood stabilizer. I'm on latuda and two antidepressants. For a week or so it was latuda and three antidepressants but I got a serious side effect from wellbutrin and was told to drop it. Then when the wellbutrin wore off I became fine. I want to brag. I am such a great teacher. I got all the special ed in the whole grade as a general education teacher. I have kids we suspect are special ed but haven't been tested yet. I got permission to give them accommodations and I got them believing in themselves and trying so hard when before they used to guess and not try because they knew they couldn't do it. Well, now they know if they try hard they can almost pass, which is an accomplishment for them. I got them to put in all of that work and try. The behavior team complements me daily and says they wish more teachers were like me. The administrators all praise me and my growth. The academic coaches brag about me to the administrators. The other teachers give me praise on Facebook. There's evidence that I'm doing great. Where it becomes a problem is when I start thinking I deserve teacher of the year. I've never thought that before. So....hypomanic or are my things justified? I'll call my doctor Monday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My credit card bill is the only down side but here's what made it up... blank tshirts to make for people, they mostly paid me back in cash, fake pumpkins for my team and the office to put our names on them in vinyl, a project I'm doing with the principal and I'm hoping she pays me back for the office ones, and prizes for the kids that I got in bulk and spent very little on each prize. All things that really seem justified. The shirts are because we can wear scrubs to school and a motivational shirt is more comfortable than a scrub top. I am doing a great job at school. I have three face to face classes and one remote class, but in a couple weeks it'll probably be four face to face classes with one of them a hybrid class. I also have an intern. I'm doing such a good job they gave me an intern who will be student teaching with me in the spring. Like there's so much evidence I'm doing a great job. I have people telling me how proud they are and how much I've grown. Tuesday another teacher who is struggling is going to come observe me to see how I do things to get ideas. Really this side of me isn't a problem. The principal swears this is a normal level of excited and it's justified. She does not think I'm hypomanic. And she's studied behavior and knows a thing or two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm leaning no on the dog. I feel more stable. I feel very mildly depressed and don't want to buy anything so hopefully the hypomania is over. I called my doctor's office yesterday and they never told her what was going on, they just put a note in my file. What's going to prompt the doctor to look at my file between appointments? I'm a little mad at them. I'm going to talk to my therapist about all of this today. The only differences I really notice are very very mild depression and I don't have a burning desire for the dog anymore. I do kinda still want her but I'm on the fence about it. People had really good points about why I should have a dog. But I understand the concerns and can finally take them into account too. I asked if I could foster instead of adopt and they said they'd get back to me in a few days. That's not something they normally do. The option of it being a temporary hope is appealing. I told them I would like for it to be a foster fail and to end up adopting her but I would like to see how she gets along with my cat first. It doesn't feel so urgent. I'm glad the process isn't immediate and they make you wait a few days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My therapist said yes, this is absolutely hypomania, and it's getting worse. She said the angry, irritable hypomania is worse than the happy, overspending hypomania. She said there's a chance I go manic. She said don't make any decisions without checking with people, but I checked with a bunch of people about getting a dog and all but one person said a giant yes, go get the dog. They really want me getting the dog. My therapist said yes to fostering, no to adopting and I'm fine with that. I don't know how long this will last. I don't know if mania or deep depression or normal comes next. I called my pdoc first thing yesterday and they blew me off. I'm going to call back tomorrow and make them listen. Is angry, irritable hypomania worse than flighty, overspending hypomania? I guess I need a med change? I'm not on a mood stabilizer. I'm on latuda and two antidepressants, remeron and trintellix. I was briefly on wellbutrin and that may be what started this. I really need help understanding hypomania and what comes next and how to navigate it. I'm watching my spending closely. I'm not going to adopt the dog anytime soon. What else is important? My therapist mentioned sleeping and eating. I'm eating like how I had been eating, salad and Greek yogurt for lunch, drinking coke zero during the day, and something modest for supper so I can get my latuda calories. I take atarax (hydroxyzine) for sleep. I haven't really been hypomanic since before I got medicated about 6 years ago. I don't remember much of it. Any help or stories is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate the work you're putting in to try to make me better. I called my doctor today and she set me up with a brand new nurse practitioner in her office next Monday. I'm very unhappy about that. I'm complicated. I need someone experienced. I'm debating going back to an old pdoc I didn't get along with so then at least I could be seen by an MD. I have enough lamictal to get started on it on my own again but I know that's a terrible idea and that lamictal doesn't treat high swings so it may not help me now. I feel like I'm at such a loss. I'm asking for help and not getting it. My therapist is very concerned about me. We have only seen each other a few times but she's super smart and understands mania and hypomania so much better than I do. I'm planning on returning all of the dog stuff this weekend. The therapist who does know a lot about mania told me fostering is a good idea. I'm finally seeing that no, it's not a good idea. I want to stay up all night watching Harry Potter and not eat. I have no interest in food whatsoever. I have no interest in sleep. Last night I fell asleep around 8:30 and woke up every hour during the night and woke up for good at 4:30. I wanted to bake brownies when I woke up. I forced myself to stay in bed. I had plenty of time to shower but chose not to. So I put my hair in a ponytail today. Once again I don't want to shower but then my hair would be absolutely disgusting. I crafted with my principal and a member of my team after school and had an ok time but wasn't really all too interested in it even though I bought a dozen fake pumpkins and vinyl and ribbon to make monogrammed pumpkins. Such a hypomanic thing. I got the stuff a couple weeks ago. So I guess I've been hypo or mixed for about two weeks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was clearly hypomanic a week ago. I see that it was coming for about two weeks before that but really ramped up a week or two ago. Now I have no more desire for a dog, no more spending, no more crafting ideas, no more anger and irritability, I feel balanced. I have a pdoc appointment for Monday but I don't know if I want to keep it since I think I'm ok now. It's not with my pdoc, it's with someone I've never seen before so I don't think it would really be beneficial. One option is to keep the appointment and go back on lamictal to help the ups and downs. I'm not currently on a mood stabilizer. I'm on latuda, remeron, and trintellix. I love that I don't currently have brain fog but a month ago I was horribly depressed and a week ago I was very hypomanic. So even though I'm fine now, is going back on lamictal and dealing with the brain fog the right choice? How many days do I have to feel ok before it's safe to say I am ok?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, euthymic would be the right word. Definitely not stable. I'm keeping my Monday appointment for sure. It got changed to being with the psychiatrist during one of my classes so it'll be hard to do and I don't know if it's even possible. Hopefully I can get coverage. I know your opinion on the dog but I'm back to thinking about fostering. Adopting is another story. I seriously love this dog and I want her out of a kennel and at least in a home. I would love for it to be a foster fail and end up adopting her. It doesn't feel like I need this dog like it did on Sunday. It feels like a more rational decision. For most of the week I leaned towards no dog. Now I'm considering it. I do not think this is a hypomanic thing anymore. Some people in my life are saying yes, get the dog, even some that know about how bad I get. Only two are saying no and only one is a hard no. I'm listening to what they have to say and I'm considering it. It's not a rash decision like it was last weekend where I wasn't listening to anyone that disagreed with me. Now I'm listening.</TEXT>

There's a neighborhood person who can also walk her multiple times a day and feed her if I'm gone for $15 a day. Very reasonable. I do have the stuff she needs to be healthy. I have a vet in mind. I plan to keep her on heartworm prevention. I'm going to keep all shoes in the garage so she doesn't eat my shoes. I'm going to keep all food she could get into out of reach or closed in my craft room (like the Halloween candy I don't want her getting into). I set up her bed and food dishes and got her bone out and put her treats up high. I moved the cat's food so the dog can't get to it. I should be taking her home tomorrow. I am so excited. Her vet appointment is Tuesday and I'm going to get a wellness plan that I pay for monthly so I don't have costs of vet appointments or vaccinations as an excuse. Keep her healthy and take her to the vet twice a year, at least. I have the $43 a month for this. I have the money for food and toys. I plan on stopping to get her a toy she likes on our way home from the shelter. I even have a friend that wants a pit bull that would love to take her if it turns out I can't take care of her or it's too much work. I truly think I can do this.</TEXT>

I have food, a bed, food and water bowls, basic toys, a dog bed, treats, a bone to chew on, leash, waste baggies, and collar. Stuff to play tug with and stuff to fetch. I picked up my bedroom and living room. Next I'll clean the kitchen to get even more ready for her. I'm getting a wellness plan that's $42 a month, that's cheaper than it was when I got my nails done last year which I stopped doing when the pandemic started, I'm rarely eating out, and I have about 3 month's salary in savings. My credit cards are paid off every month. My mortgage is cheaper than my rent was. My electricity bill is the same as it was in my apartment. Spending less on gas since I live 1 mile from my school instead of 8 miles and the grocery store is super close. I only drive farther once a week or so. Therapy is free while it's virtual. I have almost $2,500 in my HSA so I won't have to pay medical bills for a little bit. I get about $60 more per paycheck that I didn't get last year. I'm financially stable, even with the spending I did a couple weeks ago. I won't have to spend money on prizes or stickers for a long, long time. I opened up the box with a ton of stickers in it and I honestly don't regret it at all because I know the kids will love them. They make me happy.</TEXT>
