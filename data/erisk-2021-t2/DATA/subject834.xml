    <TEXT>It's not a fact that interesting but here it goes: In portuguese, there are only 3 verb endings at what we call "forma infinitiva"(infinitive form) : "ar", "er" and "ir". Just to give some examples of this: "Ar" ending - Falar(to talk) "Er" ending - Comer(to eat) "Ir" ending - Sorrir(to smile) But maybe someday you might come across a verb that seemingly doesn't follow these rules : P #244;r(to put). What? An "Or" ending? But you said there was only 3 verb endings! Well, it actually does! "P #244;r" historically comes from "Po #234;r" which belongs to the second ending "Er".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say verb conjugation is tricky in portuguese, because there's a lot of them and sometimes they're not even regular. For example, the conjugation of the verb "ser"(to be) in simple present is: Eu sou(i am) Tu  #233;s(you are) Ele  #233;(he is) N #243;s somos(we are) V #243;s sois(you are) Eles s #227;o(they are) In other words, the verb "ser" becomes "sou", " #233;s", " #233;", "somos", "sois" and "s #227;o" depending on the person, and this is one out of six tenses Sidenote : "v #243;s" is "you", but refering to more than one person, although is hardly used in spoken language(at least in brazilian portuguese). It's usually seen in very formal writing or old texts. If you say it, people will think you're trying to look "cultured"</TEXT>

Doesn't sound like G at all to me, but maybe it isn't the case to an ukranian point of view(or should i say "point of listening"?).

    <TEXT>Well, i'm sorry to tell you, but this is very unlikely. The trend in technology is that we're going to be producing larger and larger amounts of data(which is already huge) and none server has infinity memory to store it. Nowdays, some websites are deleting users after a long period of time without loging, google drive is deleting files from trash can after 30 days inside of it and so on and so forth. These kind of strategies to save memory storage will be more common down the line</TEXT>

Since they own the server, they can delete whatever they want if they want to or need to. Also, i'm not sure about the data integrity over time. What if the images/gifs start to corrupt or lose small data bits by compression/sending, what if the server crashes down really bad? What if there's sn accident?

    <TEXT>Once i reckoned how many kind of grandsons one person can meet in a lifetime if the family keeps having kids really young. If you live in Japan, your life expectancy will be 85 years give or take(one of the highest in the world). Let's consider this, so you can meet the greatest number of generations possible. Let's consider every family generation has children at 18 years old. Then 85 / 18 = 4,7 generations 18 ---1 X --- 0,7 X = 12,6 years You will be able to meet 3 generations after yours at the age of 85 which means that you will know your great-grandson and he will be 12 and a half. Now, let's take a step further and consider you'll be the longest living people in the world and you'll live until 122 years old(the older that someone ever lived). Then: 122 / 18 = 6,7 generations Wow! You'd be able to meet your great-great-great-great grandson and he'd also be 12 and a half!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This remembers me that one scene from "The groundhog day". In one of his groundhog day(GHD), Phill decided to get close to that old homeless man who asked him for money every morning. Turned out that the old man'd die by the end of the day...wilingly to save him, Phill uses the next GHDs doing different things in order to save the poor man...but it's all completely in vain. It's such a powerful scene, because after reliving so many GHD, He was calling himself a god, but couldn't save the life of one single man. Edit: For those that didn't watch, the story tells about a news reporter who goes to a city to cover the groundhog day. Somehow, he gets time-stuck in it, and keeps reliving the same day over and over.</TEXT>
