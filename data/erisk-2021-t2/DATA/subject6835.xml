    <TEXT>\[JUST AN ADVISE FROM A STRANGER\] Well to begin with i don't think anyone is wrong.She sure is being unreasonable by not trying to see the whole picture but that just what her motherly instinct is telling her.She fears what will happen to you in your future. I think you should sit down with her and explain her your situation and tell her that you are trying your best and you are sorry to make her worry like that. She might also be thinking that you have not grown up enough (cause in parents eyes we always remain kids) to handle life . So i think talking with her (I know she might not listen that easily)and showing her that you are responsible enough will make the tense environment lessen a bit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish your friend a healthy recovery and that u can also leave this episode behind so that it doesn't bother you. Well because sometimes we cannot change what has happened and have to live our lives despite having misery and suffering . As for your best friend if she accepts the offer its either that she is interested in such stuff (well some people are ) or she is just curious or wants to be adventurous . In the latter case I would highly recommend that you tell her to "WAKE THE HELL UP" cause you never know what kind of shit we might find our self in and then regret it through out our lives . So i would suggest that whenever you encounter anyone friend or a foe going down a rabbit hole don't hold yourself back and tell them that their choices can have serious consequences so they should rethink what they are heading for .I know that some people don't like being told whats right or wrong ,which might also cost you the relationship but i think its better to tell people what you think of their outrageous action rather than thinking later that i could have stopped it .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well what u did was right. Stalking any person is wrong and telling him that you didn't like his approach was the best thing you could have done. One should not compromise his or her happiness for others unless they are truly worth it. I am also depressed and was rejected all the time .People around us (i.e depressed people ) try to blame others so as to not make us feel worse . That's why they told u were a horrible person, you are not , you did the most reasonable thing which was to come out and tell that you didn't want a relationship .By doing this you didn't get his hopes up. As for his suicide attempt don't think that you have contributed to it anymore than just another bad day. Having tried to do this sort of stuff myself,even if u had agreed to him his situation wouldn't be much better. He was trying to find something to fill his heart with rather than adersing the main problem(which happens all the time ).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry for being an asshole. What he did was wrong and i know that it hurt you a lot . I am no expert but just saying from what i have read and heard .There are rarely happily ever after cases in real life. That's why someone said that marriage is not just about falling in love . We humans are creatures req high stimulation so we sometimes waver . So in marriage we keep falling in and out of love. I would suggest that you talk with your husband telling him that you are hurt but still love him so want to move forward together on the journey of attaining the best possible relationship you both can have , for example why dont u both join the gym together . Plus lack of communication kills most relationships ,So decide together that whatever bothers you both , u both shall sit down together and listen to each other . Become the ideal self which you both diser.In my opinion there is nothing more beautiful than seeing two people selflessly working for one another .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good choice my brother. I know it hurts to leave someone you love but sometimes we have to leave the things we love so as to not our selves fall into the depths of darkness . Just like when an addict loves alcohol and its really hard to leave it , but he must endure it cause he knows its for his own good. Btw if she used you she might contact back, dont give in . Please don't resent or hate the world what happened to you. Sometimes situations like this make us question society and life , but sadly life is unfair and such stuff happens . We need to move one despite how we were treated cause holding onto anger will only make you one of them. So i would suggest to just cut your ties with her and see this as being free and start over with your heart filled with love and joy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the concept of true and false ..right and wrong is very hazy . It is due to the fact the what we consider things to be (correct or incorrect ) is mostly based on the way our society is . Throughout history we have seen wrong things proven right and right things proven wrong. So sadly one cannot stop from concluding that most of the things around us are not simple answers but I think that if one wants to reach at some conclusion he has to see the current events to make judgment and possibly assume that the knowledge used to conclude is sufficient. There is a great video in which Richard Feynman tells us that sometimes we just have to accept our ignorance and conclude to something or one will perpetually stuck be in the realm of curiosity. Some people are endlessly curiously and we need those sort of people to see the possibilities but it does not help to conclude . Well now it falls into your hands which thing do you want ? answer for current events or possibilities</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is not about extensive or intensive . What I meant by that was that adding anything in a system containing gas restrics the path , so the distance travelled by the molecule before encountering another one decreases and therefore rate of collisions increase and so does the temperature . It's sort of like in a carnot cycle when adiabatically the gas is expanded or contracted the temp changes If you are able to isolate the N+1 then you wouldn't have a change in the system cause to measure u need interaction which i think an isolated body cannot do . Even with the new thermal equilibrium the energy is still diff cause equilibrium doesn't mean that the energy is same as before</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny how i also have similar feelings . I too have adhd , high anxiety , depression . Some doctors say that i have Aspergers but some say i dont . I can feel people's emotions but i also feel a real disconnected from my family . My friends only consists of people online . I started my school late , then had to repeat 11th and then dropped out in 12 . Now doing distant learning. So i am like 3yrs behind  #129315;. Most of my days are spent lying down on the bed, wishing for someone to hold my hand and some days I just want to end it all. I feel like am also a very bad person cause these problems make me very angry and i can see that people around me are affected and i feel intense guilt .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well as someone said earlier , you should go and tell this to her because lack of communication is what kills a relationship. Second even if you both don't have much common hobbies you both can always go up and pick something new which you both agree on , like joining a gym or learning a new skill or perhaps you both can teach each other . This way you can also spend quality time together .</TEXT>
