    <TEXT>I've been getting it too. I was at work and I thought they just blocked the site but when I got home I got the same message. So I looked on here to see if this was an issue for anyone else. I've only tried on chrome but I'm gonna try on IE right now</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Issues with the space button during typing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-17 09:11:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been using Typeracer for a while now. Since April 8, 2014. It has definitely helped improve my writing. But recently, I've noticed that there have been some issues with the site. I'm not too sure when it started but sporadically when I press the space button the entire page goes down. I know this is a short-cut key for moving the page down on chrome so I thought it was user error and for some reason, it was registering on the webpage and not the typing bar but I made sure every single time after that incident that I click on the text bar and it still happened. I hovered my mouse over the type bar and click on it before the race started and after the race started but the issue still persisted. I'm not too sure what is going on with it but I know it isn't user error anymore. Also on occasion, my computer just completely freezes up whenever I try to go to the site. I noticed that this started happening once they implemented the whole competition thing (I think that's a very cool idea btw). So my theory was that for some reason it was loading a bunch of statistics on the backend of the site and it was slowing down my entire computer. Because I have a pretty beast of a computer since I'm a video editor as my day job. The reason why I think it's the competition stats is that when I was typing I was in the top 50 typers for the year and whenever I loaded up the competition that's when I would start to have issues. I haven't been typing that much lately on the site because of these issues and I've dropped out of the top 100 since then and the issues stopped. I don't know if this is still an ongoing issue for people who are in the top 100 in the competition section of typeracer for the year. I was just curious if anybody who is in top 100 are also experiencing these issues as well or if it was just me. Also, I did try 2 different web explorer applications and all the issues I mentioned persisted on both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get that message myself sometimes as well. I just haven't downloaded anything and I haven't run into any issues without it. I don't use AE that much though only for tracking and rotoing out images. Sometimes I use particle effects if you're doing anything more extensive you might run into issues. I would say just trying it out without downloading quick time and if you are beginning to get issues I would say downloading an older version of QT since CS6 is an older version of AE it will probably work</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're more concerned about the content you could try and play the game on a different resolution. It will end up being distorted while you play but once you start editing it will fit just right into the Youtube 16:9 ratio. Just set the game to windowed mode and set the resolution to a 16:9 ratio. 1280 x 720 If your screen can downscale resolution you could also try 1920 x 1080 so you won't lose any quality. Otherwise, I suggest setting it at a lower resolution and upscaling in post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was having this issue as well. Except I use Premiere. The issue was that when I was exporting I was exporting in the correct resolution but in the wrong pixel ratio. This is probably the problem for you. Unless you shoot with anamorphic lenses or are trying to go for a stylized visual the pixel ratio should always be 1:1. I'm not sure where that setting would be in Davinci but look for aspect ratio or pixel ratio or pixel aspect ratio</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have a really good voice I like it a lot. I feel however that you pause way too much and it sounds like you're reading from a script. You probably are reading from a script but you don't want it to sound like you are. I would recommend while you are writing your script to read it out loud while you're writing it so when it actually comes time to perform it, you feel more comfortable with the words you are saying. It might be a bit more work but also think about re-doing some of your mistakes. One of the more noticeable ones was the noise of you bumping into your mic at 2:03 - 2:09. I like the jokes too but again they sound a bit too stiff because it sounds like a script but I feel you're on the right track. Just work on talking without pausing or if you do pause try adding some lower thirds because it sounds like some of those pauses were intentional so you could segment the video up. Also, one last thing that I feel I have to mention is that the Intro looks like a template you downloaded from some free site. It doesn't help with brand recognition if it feels so similar to other intros. It might not be a template but it feels like it is. I would recommend updating that. But you're on the right track!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The pictures in the beginning way by way too quickly. I understand what you were trying to go for but it ended up not working. Slow it down you don't have to cut that quickly from shot to shot. Also if you do plan on doing something like that again try adding some Audio folly like wooshes. 0:14 - I could tell you made this picture outside of your editing program. Layer the text on top of the image in your video editor. 0:38 - It looked like you were trying to make a J-cut right there. One thing I realized after editing for so long is to not be afraid of making J cut long not just .01 of a second. 0:54 - The audio cuts off suddenly. Try fading out to make it less of a smash cut. 1:16 - I don't know if you used a fade effect on the sound but again it was sudden at the cut. Try overlapping the sound over the cut 2 cuts so it's not such a sudden change of pace (I won't mention issues like this again just for the sake of brevity) 2:32 - I would recommend not putting your face in these transitions. Simplicity is often more visually appealing than a lot of photoshop. Be honest with yourself and ask if you use these because you feel you put a lot of effort in them or because you legitimately think they look good. I was in the same boat. I used to photoshop all my thumbnails for videos and I put sometimes hours into them and I used them because I put so much effort into them but being honest with myself they weren't good they were ugly and had too much going on. 2:34 - eww. black bars. 4:02 - why please no vertical 4:59 - I was going to mention that I don't particularly like the thick stroke on the text. Also if you made it smaller it would make it feel more professional. People automatically perceive smaller text as more professional since it's associated with the big screen Aka movies. 4:54  amp; 5:01 - If you're going to put lower thirds keep them constant. 5:28 - this happened multiple times throughout the video where it kind of just cuts randomly and I originally thought it was my computer acting up but it's happened way too often for that to be the case. Before exporting double check that your timeline is situated. I usually do 5 runs while editing. 1. cutting out unnecessary footage 2. Roughly placing footage in a good flow 3. Adding music and adjusting and editing footage to sync up with musical climaxes and notes 4. adding text and lower thirds 5. Refine editing (adding and adjusting transitions I may have missed and adjusting music, text, and lower thirds) And lastly, I watch everything back to make sure there aren't any hiccups or black spots or miss edits. 5:54 - I really like the use of music on this part to build tension. Your commentary kind of took away the tension. I would have edited away the commentary and just kept the music. You're music and commentary should never be at odds with each other. Unless you're purposely doing it as an exaggeration of something or parody or other stylistic approaches. 6:20 - I know this may seem like it contradicts my last point but I really like this part. It takes a break from taking the video seriously and acknowledges it. The video so far seems like you weren't taking it completely serious while filming and wanted to add a creepy vibe to it. This part is geniune and I feel it works well. 7:02 - this is a very good example of parody I mention in an earlier comment. I like it. 7:49  amp; 7:57 - Why do you have 2 outros? Overall, I felt it was very disjointed I can tell you wanted some parts to be funny and some parts to be serious. It ended up not meshing well. Pick one and roll with it. In regard to your questions. 1. I think the video length is actually too short but because you visited so many locations in one video. I would concentrate on trying to tell more of a story in one location and knowing more about the history. This felt too rushed and had way too many locations for me to feel invested in any of them. 2. Audio quality can be improved. I think if you were going to upgrade your audio I wouldn't get a shotgun mic. I would get a cardioid condenser mic since it seems like the actual onset audio is fine but the VO audio quality is lacking. 3. You can't please everyone. If someone isn't interested in urban exploration than they aren't going to watch it. Don't try to cater to everyone. I think that's why you were trying to be funny and serious at the same time and it ended up not working. I like the concept a lot and I am actually excited to see what you come out with next. Just try and concentrate more on having a central theme and don't try to please everyone. Not everyone is going to like one piece of content. I would like to see more of a behind-the-scenes kind of footage where it just is you and your friends messing around and keeping the main videos more serious and creepy. But all this is just a suggestion. Cool concept</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not too sure if your offer still stands but I've been working on a gaming channel that focuses on News and Gameplay videos. I want a more plain look for the banner. The one I have now doesn't mesh well with my new intro. The banner also has Overwatch on it and I wanted to stray away from centering the channel on a single game. Um, I want to post my channel just so you can see what I'm talking about it's hard to explain but I don't want to get banned for self-promotion. It's called Breakable Program if you look it up on youtube. Yeah if you're still doing this I would really appreciate that and recommend you to anyone I know trying to get designs in the future!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just any cardioid condenser mic. They're for studio use not really for on-site filming. NT-1 from rode is a good one or NT-1A. It really all just depends on your budget. Blue makes some good microphones too. The blue spark is a good mic or if you're looking for a cheaper good quality mic the blue yeti is also a good choice. Check around. Google condenser microphones they are the best for capturing voice overs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that it's really good. I like the humor in it. A big problem that I had with it though was the fact that I didn't really understand the story. I think that it's due to the fact that you intersplice so many jokes into the video it doesn't really leave any room for any other information. I've always been a fan of these types of videos. I'm sure you know that it's the same genre that Ralph the Movie Maker and Jon Tron use. But I think the key difference is that they put more time into explaining the story. It is a 5-minute video and I think that's the major issue. If you look at their videos most are not under 15 minutes. Extending the length of the videos will probably help a lot. Also, I don't want to come off rude but your speech is very hard to understand at points. Work on your on your camera voice and I think you'll be golden. It might be a speech impediment if so just try speaking a little slower so you're easier to understand. Comedy is gold though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The beginning audio was really quite you should try boosting it up in post so it is leveled with the rest of your audio. *note I'm writing this review as I'm watching it* The audio mixing is a little bothersome for me. 0:54 - Personal taste, I hate transitions like that. 2:05 - Again just personal taste but Jesus horrible transition. Sometimes cuts are the best kinds of transitions and it may seem like you're over using them but I guarantee you you're not. Don't be afraid to just use regular cuts. 2:22 - The audio is too quite. I know raising the audio would have also raised the background music as well but that is a choice that I would have made. 2:29 - I would have cut after your boyfriend/husband? moved the camera. It would have made for a more professional looking shot. I'm really liking the use of time lapses in this video though. 2:45 - Feels empty because you don't have any music or at least transition music. 3:11 - I read that you said that you wanted to cut background noise and I assume this is one of those parts. I would have opted for VO on top of b-roll. 3:35 - This is where I would've put VO 3:40 - The change in music I feel was too sudden. Maybe a longer fade effect would have been more effective in transitioning the music. 5:05 would've been cool to know what those different medicinal properties were. Although I can't imagine a way to put that in the video without severely ruining the flow. I agree with the decision to cut that out but just curious. 5:44 - again the audio mixing is off it would have been better if the announcer was louder than the music. 5:49 - I've said my peace about the transitions I won't mention it again after this... eww 5:55  amp; 5:56 - It feels a bit strange that these 2 clips were the only 2 that were just straight cuts. I think you didn't put your usual transition because they were too short of a clip and it would have ended up transition during key moments of those 2 clips the smile and the line "follow me" it's just a bit off putting that it was inconsistent 6:00 - I noticed that this is a reused clip from earlier in the video. I think that you were going for a symbolic ending with the doors closing and the bus driving away. I feel like the impact of this would have been emphasized if you would have put more attention on this reused clip the first time you used it. I like the idea and I think it works but that would have made it that much better IMO. Overall, I thought it was a really good video. Whenever I review something I look for flaws and that is the first thing that I comment on and I only comment on positives if it was surprisingly positive in a lackluster video. The fact that most moments in the video were good is a fantastic achievement. I felt that you're personality showed well throughout the video and that you managed to handle the vlogging aspect and historic story-telling aspect well. I would have liked to learn more about the history but that's just a personal thing. I liked it just the audio mixing needs to be worked on and the transitions I hated but again that's just a personal taste. If you really like them you should continue using them but if you're indifferent about them.. please stop using them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Note I write the review as I watch the video* If you like you intro you should continue using it but if you feel it's too long try cutting out the first 2 seconds and see if you feel that works better. Also if you started with a preface and then added the intro that might also work better for you. That's the format that is successful for most people. Explain the video - intro - meat - close/call to action. 0:21 - This would've been the perfect place to put the intro 0:48 - The audio is really quite 1:20 - EA did say that this is only a temporary measure. 1:54 - I feel like it would have been better to intersplice footage of what you were talking about. AKA starfighter footage. 2:11 - I read that you were rusty at commentating. Try writing a script of if you can't work like that just write down some bullet points that you base your conversations off of. The "ums" and "uhs" are getting really intrusive. 3:28 - I am really wanting to see relevant footage of what you're talking about at this point and also the audio mixing is really apparent. 3:42 - EA has made several statements that they will not be changing their micro-transaction practices and have made very anti-consumer statements. I would recommend you doing some research into the company that you're talking about. If you were only to talk about the game I wouldn't have brought up this point. But you have also mentioned EA and them "turning a new leaf" multiple times throughout the video. 3:52 - please don't just stand there 4:00 - please move 4:02 - finally 4:11 - I like the outreach to your community. Asking for a specific comment is a great way to interact with your audience. 4:18 - why is the video still going on? You should've cut it or put some more interesting gameplay or at the very less. Turned up the game volume so it's not just quite gameplay Overall, I think that you should do some more research on what you're talking about before you talk about it. And really work on your presentation and audio mixing. Just keep at it and you'll continue improving. If this is you're first attempt at getting back into commentating it's not a bad one but there is work to be done. Just keep working hard and you'll be making higher quality content in no time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I looked at the channel. I watched a few videos. The content you create is really good. I don't think that you're having any issues. You're a new channel and are actually growing pretty fast contrary to what you believe. 124 subs in a month is really good. A few things that can be improved and this is all regarding your actual channel because I don't think that the content itself needs improving. Actual there are a few things now that I think of it. You don't have a solid introduction. I mean like you don't have any brand recognition. If you guys are open to it. You should change your name to something that revolves more around the kind of content you produce. Sophie and Joe just sounds like a boring couple channel. You have a really good concept that I don't think I have seen anyone else do before and you should use that to your advantage. You have great on camera personalities but the name isn't appealing. Also, You should create playlists and separate your videos into different sections. Video Tutorials, and Vlogs. Except don't name them that make it creative. If you name a playlist vlogs it's gonna be boring. That could be where you could incorporate your name into the channel. Sophie and Joe's Great adventures that's just an idea you're free to use that if you want. Also, a channel trailer goes a long way to establishing what you do on your channel and presenting your personas. 1 month of content is a decent size of material. I would recommend creating a short compilation video of your greatest moments and putting an introduction of you guys explaining what the channel is. I.E. "this is our channel and we make videos on tutorials [show a short compilation of some tutorial vidoes] and daily vlogs [show short compilation of daily vlogs]" Except don't actually use those words that's really boring. I'm sure you guys can easily come up with something more exciting than that. But yeah, playlist, channel trailer, maybe an updated name, continue posting on other social media and create a 2-5 second intro for your videos. You'll be golden won't be surprised if you guys are on youtube rewind for 2018. That's not me blowing smoke up your ass btw. I genuinely believe you guys are going to do great. Just remember me you have 1 million subs and throw some my way yeah... jk not really... but really... just kidding... but seriously... jk</TEXT>

I would recommend making one of your own. you're the best person to make the intro because you know what kind of style you're looking for. It may seem unconventional but maybe try making a live-action intro or look up some AE tutorials and take some ideas and run with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*note I review as I watch the videos (also side note I work as a video editor for a top 10 youtube channel so I feel especially qualified to critique this video)* 0:05 - The gap between "share" and "some" is way too long. It seems little but a little mistake like that in the beginning of the video can turn off a lot of people. 0:14 That text could've been faded out to make it more visually appealing the sudden cut makes it startling. 0:18 - I read that you felt that some shot felt like they were going on too long. This is probably one of them that you felt. For a picture keyframe video like this, you need more pictures and more lively keyframes. I can tell you used linear keys with this shot. An easy ease in key would have worked better. Personally, I would have already moved on to another picture. 0:20 - Syncing up text with audio is a tricky thing to learn because it's really based off of feeling. It just takes practice but this text isn't synced up properly. I think the text pops up too late it's really fickle just keep practicing and you'll get the hang of it. 0:25 - Funny joke. I feel like it would have landed better if you would've just had the text appear altogether or if it was already there when the checklist appeared. 0:29 - Paused is too long after "scene". Edit out empty space so there isn't this awkward silence. 0:50 - Not a fan of the blue stoke on the yellow background. 0:59 - I think this is another shot you mentioned that went on for too long. 1:32 - There's a lot of unnecessary paused throughout your video. Try cleaning it up in post or just whenever you're reading it, make a conscious effort to not pause between the lines of the script. Also, I can tell you're reading from a script but there are some points where that stiffness fades which indicates you are getting more comfortable reading from scripts which is a good thing. 1:39 - Again bad text and stroke color choice. This shot was barely too long as well but just barely. Cut 10 frames and it would've been perfect. 2:31 - I see what you were trying to do right here with the keyframes. It didn't work because you were still zooming in. Making the zoom in less would've been more effective or just completely removing it would've worked better. 2:33 - Should've cut to black when you said "OK". Making for a more comedic punch. 3:23 - You don't have any cards. WHERE ARE THE CARDS MAN! WHERE ARE THE CARDS! But seriously, if you know you mention cards in the video be sure to actually make the cards and sync it up to when you mention the card. An easy way to do this is to just write it down on a sticky note while writing the script and put it on your screen. And while you upload set it to private so you can put in the card and then make it public once you've done it. 3:40 - this is the way you should've done it in the first checklist. Funny I like it. Overall, I think the content is there. You just need to work on delivering your script and continue working on using keyframes effectively. Also a little editing tip. You can create presets for keyframes that you use often so you don't have to manually do them every time. But good top 10 video just work on speeding up delivery. As far as openings, its good, I wouldn't concern yourself with that. But if you want to establish a brand you should create an actual intro that you use in your videos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ok, usually I do like an in-depth review um. Don't do this man. Don't make videos like these it's a detriment to your health and it could cause you to gain toxic followers who will only encourage you to continue doing more dangerous stuff. I don't know if you know the story of the girl who shot her boyfriend with Desert Eagle but even though that's an extreme case it's very telling of what the search for fame can do to a person. I'm going to continue this review but it will be under the pretense that you'll take the points I give you and use it to something less dangerous. 0:06 - The kind of shtick you're going for here requires audible cues. A more solid desk would've helped. It just sounds flimsy. 0:10 - Again a louder noise is needed. You could've used some Sound Folly and put that in to emphasize the joke. 0:20 - You sound too monotone. I can tell that you're going for a kind of Idubbz vibe but if you watch his videos it seems like he has a monotone voice but he actually has some inflections in his voice that make it appealing. 0:44 - ... 1:05 - I'm not too sure on why this joke didn't land. Again maybe it's your monotone voice but it didn't work well. 1:40 - This isn't funny it comes off as awkward. If you show it to your friends I'm sure they'll laugh because it's someone they know but as a bystander. It's just cringy. 2:21 - You're taking it too seriously. You could've added humor by overexaggerating that it was pointless or you could've gone in the other direction and made it seem like it was the most important thing in the world. A video like this is about self-humiliation. You can't come out of the video as the cool guy. I recommend watching some silent films and pay attention to how you perceive the actors. 2:42 - This ending is taking to long to finish. You said it yourself that you don't have any content to show at the moment. I would've forgone the ending credit altogether for the first video. Ok, my overall opinion it came off as really cringy. I can tell you take a lot of inspiration from IDubbz but the reason it works with him is because, he acknowledges how ridiculous the situation he is putting himself in is. Not just verbally. The way he acts and his inflection. He's playing a character in his unboxings. It's not just him unboxing fan mail. It's his character unboxing fan mail. Trying to replicate it just by doing something stupid isn't going to work. You have to create a foundation for your video to stand on or else it just comes out cringy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, so this is actually a pretty common technique that is used quite often in movies. All you have to do is add a camera shake to the object that you are trying to use this on. There are plenty of free presets that you can look online for. One of the more popular ones that I have found is the Deadpool camera shake. The one I found is used with Priemere but AE actually has a built-in camera shake function which basically does the same thing. Here's a link to AE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A74a_yZU9sU explaining quickly how you do it. and Here's a link to the Deadpool plugin that you can use on Premiere https://premierepro.net/deadpool-handheld-camera-presets/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, you use vegas. Mmm I'm not too sure how Vegas works I've only ever used Creative Cloud. If Vegas has keyframes you could use those it's very time consuming to do it this way but the end result is the same. Here's a link to how you do it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5jaj3tOddw Again it's very time consuming and I don't know if you would be willing to go through all the effort to get the effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Games like PUBG are already marked for demonetization. It's just the algorithm learning. If you even mentioned a game like PUBG that could be enough to warrant demonetization. However, it could just be the fact that you may have used some music that doesn't want to make any money. It's weird and hard to explain. There's a lot of variables and it's hard to know without watching the video.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Working too hard on one video [Question]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-25 01:21:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been working for about 2 weeks on a single video and I've put so much time and effort into it. But now I'm in in the editing phase of the video and I'm not sure if it's coming out well. The last time I put this much effort into one video it ended up getting 16 views. And I know I shouldn't get discouraged by views or whatever. But it's almost one of the least viewed video on my channel. I'm worried that this video will also be unsuccessful. In a situation where you put a lot of effort into a video but you're afraid it's going to fail what do you do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I write the review as I watch it* 0:05 - I like the idea of the background it looks like you just bought it though. I would iron out those creases next to your body just to make it look more professional. 0:11 - You're out of focus. If you have autofocus I would recommend turning that off and getting someone else to sit in your place a while you pull focus and just leave it like that before making the video. If you don't have another person a broomstick will work. 0:18 - Eidtion (typo) watch your video before you export it so you don't have issues like this. 0:50 - I don't usually watch haul videos so I'm not sure if talking about the site without showing it is a thing that people do but you should show the site. Either by the snipping tool which is in every windows computer or I would recommend downloading OBS so you can record your screen and show the site through a video of you scrolling through the site. It's a bit of a learning curve but add a lot of production value. 1:20 - You cut yourself off mid-word I don't know if that's because you were starting another word and wanted to cut it out before starting the new word but if that's the case just redo that take. If it was a stylistic choice it didn't work that well. 1:48 - WHAT! NO UNBOXING! You should've unboxed it. I don't know if this is also a thing for haul videos if it is then I'm just ignorant but I would have enjoyed an unboxing. 2:30 - You explained what you were going to do unnecessarily. Just post the picture you already explained that thats what you were going to do. 2:56 - Showing the Instagram post would have helped. 3:45 - Whoa why the cut off of the music. You should've kept the music playing. 4:40 - The music ran out on you huh. This happens often to me where the music is to short for the entire length of the video. Couple of ways to get around it. Change up the music at key points. I think that's why you didn't have music in that one shot because you wanted to delay the music ending. Or repeat the music in the middle of the song, not the end and add a fade effect and most people won't notice unless they're paying extremely close attention. Especially, with commentary over it, people will not notice. 4:52 - Again you cut yourself off mid-word 4:54 - Hello... extreme close up startled me and you took a second to actually start speaking. It came off as you were trying to be scary. Also again with the music just randomly ending. 5:34 - What was that sound right there. It was distracting. Redoing takes that get interrupted like this will help with production value. Or acknowledging it and making fun of it is a good way to convey you're personality and humor in the video. MANY YouTubers use this technique in their videos. 6:48 - again cutting off yourself mid-word 7:39 - oof, the music again. I'm not sure what editing software you're using but I understand with some software's it may be hard to do something like what I described so I would recommend with just switching out the music. 9:43 - out of focus again. yeah broomstick suggestion 9:50 - If camera battery life is a concern. Just buy another one or two and keep them charged so whenever you run out of battery you can just replace them without skipping a beat. That's a tip I learned from shooting on location although we would usually bring 5 batteries but one extra one will do fine if you're just recording at home. 10:30 - You could've used this footage as B-roll while you talked about the shoes. Voice over over this would have been fantastic. 10:50 - BUT WHAT! BUT WHAT! the world may never know... That's a little call-back to tootsie pop's advertising. Seriously though it just kind of cut you off midthought. Ok overall, I really liked your personality. I'm personally not a big fan of videos like these but that's only cause I'm not your target audience so I wouldn't say it's a negative. See if you can upgrade you're audio and write some bullet points before you start recording so you can stay on topic. The image you use for your ending credit and slides are... I don't know how to phrase it in a way that could be seen as constructive. They're not good I think the reason for this is because they have too much detail in the leaves and the text and pink box just doesn't mesh well with the background image. Simplicity is key to good design I'm sure you know that seeing as you're into clothing. I would recommend maybe changing it to a gradient maybe something like this https://webgradients.com/public/webgradients_png/049%20Fresh%20Milk.png and adding the text on top of it. And maybe adding some green accents on the edges just little dots of green to keep that forest vibe. Again you have a good presence but try to be more concise and focus more on production value.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got the joke within the first bullet point write. It's to thin of a concept to make into a video. If you would have added some more jokes within the video it might have worked. There a slew of audio mess ups. The Dubs are very blatant and you really can tell when you had to do a line over the video. The introduction was very off-putting. I didn't understand what was going on because it just sounded like his voice. A reverb effect would have helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, they removed that a few months ago. If you're just trying to stick together clips. Windows movie maker is free and easy to use. If you're a bit more advanced. Hitfilm express is more in-depth and also free. If you are willing to pay money I would go with the Creative Cloud membership. That's personally what I use but it really advanced and there is a steep learning curve. I've been using it for 8 years and I'm still learning things to this day.

    <TEXT>I usually do reviews with time markers on here but I think this video is too long for that but I'll try it out for a little bit until it starts getting absurdly long. 0:20 - You should really hold shoutout until the end. 2 reasons. 1 You don't want people to leave your video before they watched it. And 2 why would someone check them out if they don't know if the video is going to be any good. 0:41 - Everything from this point and back should've been cut. You shouldn't tell your audience the issues you had with the making of the video unless it's some sort of behind the scenes look. 0:47 - I don't know if the white around the Silhouette is supposed to be intentional but it's noticeable. 1:16 - Ok so you were trying to do a head nod with the movement of the frame but it didn't work because it was to slow and it was only one nod. When you nod in real life you do it 2 - 3 times and at a much faster rate. Whenever you animate you should always be looking at real-life examples. 1:59 - That's an odd choice to have a gradient in the character's image but not earlier a few seconds before. Consistency is key. 2:59 - It may just not be my sense of humor but I don't think the joke landed that well. I do know that it had to do with the delivery of the line. It sounded like you were trying to get it all out without stopping instead of actually sounding upset. 3:08 - Yeah again there's no gradient on the character or you might know it as a ramp depending on what kind of software you use. Also, something you could have done to emphasize the sparkle is add a glow effect to it and just turn it up and down as it was coming at him. 3:50 - Why were the pauses so long between their lines it very much ruined the pacing of the interaction. 4:07 - Yeah again the pause. I think you're voicing both characters. If that's the case just edit the pauses out in post or do the lines separate and add them together in post. 4:50 - I don't understand why this calls for such a long pause. It feels like an undeserved dramatic pause. 5:15 - The cup uh... he has a hole in his body. I was going to continue I got to about 15 minutes into the video. It's not my kind of video. I don't personally like the humor but obviously, you have some people that actually enjoy it so, me not liking it shouldn't take away from the community you've built so far. As far as tips with animating. Premiere is very limited in what you can do with animation. I would recommend looking more into after effects if you really want to up the presentation. Recording booths I don't think is a big deal for you at the moment. I think that you need to work on mic awareness. I don't know if you have whatever recording software up when you record but always make sure that you're looking at the waveform and make sure you never clip unless it's for a comedic purpose. The flow of the story was slow because of the line delivery. The story seems like you were making it up as you went along and some people like that but it's personally not for me. Things happened but there was no connection between events. Everything just kind of happens. I could give you more tips on production value but honestly, I think that a video like this has to be either really bad and there's a charm to it or extremely good like um I don't know what the show is called on cartoon network. Gumball something, they have the same premise of mixing 10 different kinds of animation styles together and it works well but they also spend millions of dollars per episode. If you were to put more effort I don't think that you would want to keep this same style. This is a niche that I don't enjoy but just focus on line delivery, no clipping and don't put any unnecessary information into the video. Any other advice I could give would be null due to the type of video this is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You never show any examples of what you're talking about and a video like this is made for a layman. Terms like encoder, buffering, OBS, Xsplit. Nightbot, mods 2:20 - ... you can ban words automatically. It's called blacklisting. 3:28 - What is latency 4:35 - It doesn't seem like you have a plan to what you're video is going to be about. You should write notes or bullet points or something. When you make a video like this you can only go 2 ways. The really simple route. In that case, you have to explain everything that you're talking about. You can't be throwing out terms like mods, OBS, encoder without explaining what they are and why they are important. Or 2 you can go the super in-depth route and show every minute detail of what you're talking about. You were speaking like you were talking to someone who already knew all these terms. And people that already know all the terms don't need this video unless it adds something of value. I would rename it to something else like. The basics of streaming and explain everything like you were talking to your grandpa. This is useless right now. Everyone who watches it are either going to be confused or already know all the information you're talking about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Review Video](Swearing) Balancing Entertainment and Information.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-25 22:32:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16JMoxrNaE I've been working on this video for a while and when I finished with the research portion of the pre-production there was so much information so I had to eventually cut out data from the actual video. And it felt to dry with just me talking about numbers so I felt I had to add some comedy to keep the attention of viewers. But looking back I don't know if it worked well with each other I've been working on it non-stop for a week and whenever someone works to long on something they tend to become extremely self-critical. Is the balance of trying to be funny and actual concrete information give done well? Self Review: I feel like the Music choice could have been changed throughout the video and it doesn't really add much to the video. There were some inconsistencies of SFX in image pop in that I didn't catch watching the video. My main concern is that the information and "comedy" didn't mesh at all in this video and it was sort stitch together instead of flowing well with each other.

    <TEXT>That was actually a major concern of mine that people would either be turned off by too much data which is why I felt it was necessary to add in all that comedy stuff. But I do think you're right the type of person to watch a video like this isn't going to be turned off by all the information and I should've stuck to my guns of presenting it more. I also agree with the fact that I probably should've not used gameplay footage for the background. That was told to me before that watching the gameplay and listening takes too much concentration. I felt the drumroll was too long also. I made it that long for comedic purposes but I guess it ended up not working. This is my first time making something like this usually I just make compilation videos so I didn't know how to approach presenting this much information in an entertaining way. But I find your review really helpful. I think that if I do another video like this I will definitely lean more towards being informative and less trying to be funny. I really appreciate the feedback. P.S. I'm gonna steal that title from you. thanks for that!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I checked out your channel. There's a lot of things missing and I feel can be improved. You mentioned that you are using photoshop to make thumbnails. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are skilled at design. I use canva and they produce high-quality thumbnails in a short amount of time and offer a lot of flexibility. I often get compliments on the quality of my thumbnails so I would recommend going with that. As far as buying editing software, I wouldn't bother unless you're already used to using a specific program. I have been using Premiere Pro for years so I can't imagine editing without it. However, if you are new I would recommend going with a free software. Hitfilm Express is a good starting off software. It's not as diverse or in-depth as Premiere but unless you're going to be doing a lot of high number multi-track editing I wouldn't worry too much about it. The branding on your channel is non-existent. You have the name Jedis of Reddit but there's no recognizable logo or banner or even color that is consistent throughout your channel. Leaves people with an unmemorable experience and they're likely not to remember your channel name even if they wanted to come back. The content itself is lacking. There is a lot of 1 hour or 2-hour streams. No one is going to watch the entire thing unless they are already invested in you. The short 1 minute clips are bad. They are either lacking in content themselves. And the ones that are ok are hidden underneath all the pile of rubbish. I feel like you're using this as a substitute to not edit. There is no substitute for not editing. You need to start compiling footage and saving them so you can edit them into a concise and entertaining video not just spreading the clips throughout your channel. I wanted to add a small example to the streams. Even GTLive a million subscriber channel still edits their streams down to just the good stuff. They have been doing this for a while and can generally entertain over an expansive amount of time but they still cut stuff out because it's not entertaining enough. Just overall, Work on branding your channel. Try out Canva, Try out Hitfilm Express, Don't just post VODs of your streams, and edit. Also, a general note that I keep in my head when I post a video is the thought that no one cares about me. If the video I'm working on only has a merit to me because I'm in it. I change it to make it entertaining or add something of value. Think of it this way. If you were watching the video and you weren't in it, would you still be watching it? Be honest and if the answer is no change it so it adds something of value to the average viewer. Getting 2 kills in Fortnite is not adding any sort of value either entertainment or information to a random viewer. They don't care about you. It's your job to make them care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I usually do a real-time review of the video but after watching the first minute of this video I can tell that it wouldn't be helpful. I can definitely agree with you that this video is pretty awkward but that's ok. My first video was horrible I had so many um and uhs and I went off on so many tangents and I wasn't coherent. One Thing I would recommend to help with that is whenever you are out driving by yourself or doing chores around the house or basically whenever you are alone, try talking to yourself and pretend there's an audience watching you and try to be funny or charismatic. It's going to feel silly at first since you're literally going to be talking to a wall but it's extremely helpful in making you more comfortable in front of the camera. If you're doing face cam try to be aware of how you're face looks. If you look bored people watching the video are going to feel bored. As far as the Audio and setting up OBS I think this video will really help you out a lot. It's a bit long but it goes really extensive into the program and shows you things that I didn't even know you could do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbbzrRIhTgc Also regarding the Razer Ripsaw. I also use this capture card and something that might have been the issue is you might have HDCP enabled on your Wii u? I'm not sure what console that is. It doesn't say anywhere in the literature but the Ripsaw doesn't function to it's full capacity with HDCP enabled. As far as the Youtube Filters... stay away from them. They're horrible. Also if you're having trouble with introducing the video. Try coming up with a little catchphrase in the beginning of the video. It doesn't have to be super original like some of the big youtubers i.e. JackSepticEye's "Top of the morning to ya laddies". It could just be as simple as saying your name, the name of your channel. FYI this is what I do. It sounds boring but if you add excitement to your voice while you say it, it can become catchy. This is more about branding but it can also help with introducing videos and make you feel more comfortable with that. It just depends on how serious you want to take this channel. If you're just looking for time to spend with your daughter I wouldn't recommend doing any of this. Just enjoy the time with your daughter and continue sharing this with your friends and family. But since you posted it on here I get the feeling you want to move just past sharing it with your friends and family. In that case, work on everything I just mentioned and start really thinking about branding and the style, theme, type of content you want to be making on this channel. Starting off on youtube is hard and making your first video is a big first step. But there is a lot to learn and you should be excited!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I write the review as I watch the video* 0:00 - Ha my name is Henry too 0:23 - I could hear the wind inconsistently entering the flute here. I don't know if there's a word for that but I heard it. I've been playing music for over a decade now so I like to think I have a pretty good ear for catching off-key notes or inconsistency. 0:29 - It was out of sync on this part for a second. I don't know which 2 though. I also noticed that you were wearing earphones so you can keep in sync with the rest of the music but I would recommend trying to hide those next time in future videos. 0:42 - I liked the harmonizing right there. 1:01 - I just noticed you reading the notes off-screen. It's a little distracting. You should try to memorize the music before performing it for 2 reasons. 1. So you're not looking on screen 2. It's going to be easier to sync with yourself while you play. 1:08 - I heard the wind slip again and 1 second before I think I heard a note of key but I don't know if that was intentionally in the music when it was written or if you just played it off key but it didn't sound appealing. Don't be afraid to deviate from the source material if you think it has a better sound. 1:12 - I heard it again. This makes me believe you just played it off-key 1:25 - Out of sync again for a split second 2:30 - I can hear a spitting sound hear and it's a bit distracting from the music. 2:45 - Not a big fan of this end card. it looks too plain. Maybe adding some lights or snowflakes would have helped with it. Also definitely changing up the text to something more festive would be nice too. Overall, it was good. There were a few parts that took me out of it I mentioned above. One thing I noticed was that you recorded this in a mono form. Which is ok but it made it feel very... not bland but that's the closest word I can think of right now. Adding a reverb effect in post could help with this. Also another instrument being added in would have been nice just to accent it. It feels empty without it. As far as the editing I didn't really touch on that during the timed review of it but it was also very plain. I assume that you've heard of the Acapella group Pentatonix. This video right here shows how you can change up each shot and change how much of each shot takes up the screen to make for a more stimulating visual experience. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MteSlpxCpo I'm not saying you have to change the lighting but maybe a change of clothing into something more festive and some close-up shots of you playing the flute would be more exciting to look at. Another good example of what I'm talking about is from this Female artist. She does cut-aways whenever a new instrument is introduced. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhf7cvs-pE I know you only had one instrument but doing a cut away from time to time would help your video seem less stagnant. As far as your questions. If you should integrate music into your channel. The video you put up is a good starting point but if you want to incorporate it into your channel I think you're going to have to make it more exciting. As far as your playing being good enough. I think you just have to practice on getting those tiny imperfections out and you'll be solid. For a first attempt, this was extremely good starting off point. I have no doubt that if you continue to pursue videos like this and put, even more, effort than you already have. You can make it successful. Also, a tip, look into audio editing so you can start doing more effects like phasing and equalizing high and low frequencies to match your needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I write the review as I watch the Video * 0:09 - I like this new intro you have right here. A suggestion I have is putting a drop shadow on the circle that has the LT on it. Also adding a radial gradient to the background from really dark gray to black. 0:13 - There should've been a small .1 second pause right there. "monster hunter game(extremely small pause to indicate a comma) that might sound weird". I know how easy it is to walk over your own words. I do this often but whenever I look back on videos I made and I hear it, it makes me cringe so it's just good to acknowledge it when it happens. 0:32 - I notice that you still have that tendency to pause between lines. It's gotten better since the last video I've seen of yours but it's still apparent. Just keep working on minimizing that pause. 0:36 - I didn't understand what you said right there. Try enunciating words more while reading the script. 1:16 to 1:19 - For some reason, I really liked the way you're voice sounded right here. It sounded really natural and genuine. Try to recreate this moment of VO in future videos. 1:25 - The capture software does tend to overblow some colors and clip it. You can't recover color data once it's been clipped but doing some light Color Correction can help to bring out some color that is still there. 2:03 - You said this like it was a question. Just remember that if you catch yourself during the recording process where you say a line that didn't come out right. Do some retakes and edit out the bad versions in post. 4:20 - You mentioned this in the self-review but you should've cut away to a different shot right here so people can see what you're talking about. 4:26 - You're getting a puffing sound right here. You can avoid it by getting a pop-filter. Or what I recommend, just don't talk directly into the mic. Talk to it at an angle. You legitimately don't need a pop filter and most studios only use them to add a sense of professionalism for customers. 4:49 - Whenever I do a review or when I use to do them. I play the game, write the script, go through the script and write down what footage I need to capture, capture that footage, do VO, Edit the footage and VO together. It seems like more work but it's really not and adds a lot of production value when what you're saying is being reciprocated on screen. Ok so overall, I do see an improvement from the last video I reviewed of yours. However, there are some things you need to continue working on and I saw in your self-review that you are. Enunciating and minimizing pausing. Another thing I noticed is that there are times when it sounds like you're not sure what the script means. I know you wrote it but it's a bad habit that people get when they're reading from a script. I went to an elementary school that was serious about performing arts. And one thing we did when reading from scripts is going over every line and reading it and understand the meaning of what is being said. We were reading old English Shakespearean writing so it was more necessary. But while you're recording before you say the line. Read it and understand what you're saying before you actually say it. That's a helpful tip that elementary school taught me. On a personal note, doing these reviews have really helped me self-evaluate my own work and I see a lot of mistakes that you and others have made in my work and I think it just goes to show that we can all improve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, I watched it I gotta say that I'm not a big fan of taking someone else's work and trying to pass it off as your own. I know you put the video link in the description but if I had not gone and ACTIVELY looked for it. I would have never known that you didn't record most of the footage in this video. Or sorry you did. But the main crux of the video was centered around footage that you did not capture yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks I really appreciate this. I think the video was actually a good idea for a video. I like the old adage of if you find it entertaining most likely other people will find it entertaining as well. I thought the fact that not I couldn't find anyone else doing was a good sign. There's a niche to be filled and I knew other people did have an interest in this type of content by the very fact that game theory, a channel I reference throughout my video, exist. I know the banner is an issue I've been putting off making another one just because I know that isn't my strong suit. Designing in PS doesn't work for me for some reason. The introduction you mentioned being forced. It was that's not my usual introduction so I wasn't used to saying it and game theory actually doesn't have an intro like that so I had to make something up and I just felt uncomfortable saying it. Regarding the hellblade review. I'm not a video game reviewer it doesn't come naturally to me so I wanted to start dipping my toes into the water with it. I think gaining some skills and learning from the mistakes I made was a good lesson for me. And I think that even though it's just a review it's good to get a solid foundation in what you're doing before you start to deviate from the norm. And also I think it's a pretty good review so it's not a detriment to have it on the channel. But I'll take that into note to be more creative with my video ideas. In terms of the actual video I've gotten a lot of points from people that it was to long and that it either had too much information or not enough. I agree that mixing in the gameplay was a bad choice for this video and also that some people aren't going to like just because of the subject matter and I shouldn't try to please everyone by adding in unnecessary humor. Thanks for the feedback and I'll take it into account for the future!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the video* 0:04 - Ha ha. I like the little dum dum dum dum 0:09 - The music is way too loud right here you should've lowered it. 0:58 - I don't know it sounds like the mic is recording in stereo and it's distracting hearing your voice switching between my left and right ear. Or maybe it's just an effect you added or maybe it's just the mic being weird but it's distracting 1:26 - Hahahaha this is great. I think this was great. I do have a few issues, not major issues but things that I think could be improved and I think that is the level of quality. Actually, this is going to be not what you would expect. This is too high of a level of quality for the type of content this is. This is obviously satire and its good but it looks too good. It's kind of confusing for a person that is just scrolling by. I feel that there are 2 approaches when making content like this. Either you go way overboard and invest a lot into the production and make it seem like a legitimate news source but pump out fake news. Like the onion or you make it extremely low budget with poor editing and poor keying to exemplify the fact that it's an amateur production. Also, it was kind of lacking in content the improv was good but I feel if there were a little bit of more bullet notes about relevant YouTube news events it would have had more of an impact. Overall though, I think this was well done and funny. I actually laughed throughout the video. Oh, also I wanted to say that I wasn't a big fan of the ending. It was a little bit to drawn out but that's just a personal opinion. I knew what you were going for but I felt if you had delivered it differently it would've been better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the video* huh. I usually leave bullet points for different times in the videos to show examples of what I'm talking about but I really don't understand this video. I think it's either a parody of pointless experiment videos like the now dead 1,000-degree knife to etc., but if that's the case it just went by way to slow and it just wasn't interesting. There could've been things that you added to maybe emphasize this point. Or the other possibility of it is that it's a genuine study of what happens when you put water in a bag and freeze it. In that case, you just did a thing that everyone knew the outcome of what would happen and just threw it at the ground. It didn't really give any new information that we didn't already know. I just feel like the video is sort of a waste of time. It wasn't funny because it was to slow and it wasn't educational because it didn't add anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the video* 0:04 - ooo. That background is boring. Take a look at most other make-up guru's videos. They are usually in a bedroom which isn't the most interesting place to be but they add different props into the background whether it is lighting, books, posters, etc. They also usually record as far away from the wall as possible to add depth to the shot. 0:17 - I'm never a big fan of explanations for absences since in a week they become outdated. I wouldn't focus too much on that unless your video was an update video. 0:33  amp; 0:36 - These shots should've been reversed. Show the make-up first and then show you applying it. It's a strange break in the flow of the video that can be fixed just by switching the shots. 0:45 - It's a bit strange that you didn't include a cutaway to the lip balm. Maybe, because you think that it wasn't important enough to show it but you did mention it which is weird. 0:52 - Again you should show the product first and then the application. I think you get the point I'll stop bring this up for brevity. 2:32 - I don't know why I didn't mention this before but the audio has a sort of buzzing in it and it's really jarring to all of a sudden hear that buzzing in between application shots. 3:14 - Oh you didn't show us how you did your hair. I would've omitted you mentioning it if you weren't going to show it in your video. 3:45 - I feel like this boot shot went on for a bit too long. Just a bit though. Alright, so I want to start off by saying. I'm a guy and my girlfriend was never that into make-up she just wore... foundation/concealer? I don't know what it's called. But my sister watches some makeup guru videos so I've seen a few videos but I'm not too familiar with the genre. I wanted to add that the portion of the video where you were showing off your clothing was really well done. I don't know if it is idk normal to add prices of each item as you showed them but that would've been a cool addition. I can't really comment on the actual content. It's not really interesting to me but I'm not the target audience so I can only really comment on the actual production of the video. Like I said in the above comments. Adding props and being further away from the wall will definitely help shot composition. And doing little things like for example cleaning up the palette? is that what it's called? at 2:30 may seem like a small change but it can do a lot to add production value. Also, I did notice that some cutaway shots of the products did have a really harsh glare and it's hard to read the product names. You can avoid this by facing the light away from the subject and placing a bounce board (a white sheet) to reflect the light back to the subject so it won't have a harsh reflection. Yeah, that's pretty much it. my 2 cents of how to improve your video. But that clothing part was a real highlight. I thought it was well done.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Question] Optimal Video Length?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-31 16:32:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I'm working on a video and I have about 16 minutes of usable footage and I think I can probably edit it down to 12 minutes if I try really hard. Is that too long of a video? I was thinking about splitting up the video into 3 or 4 parts and making them shorter but I feel like some people are going to get tired of it by the second part. Should I just upload it to the full 12 minutes or split it up into 4 parts with 6-minute segments. Oh if that math isn't making sense to you I didn't mention that I've only edited half of my footage so once I finished editing the whole thing it's going to be around 30 - 40 minutes in total. And I know that's way to long.</TEXT>

My channel isn't big enough to be monetized yet but I think that you're right. I should make them short and more frequent the content is good so if people get tired of it then I guess it's not as good as I thought it was. Thanks for the advice!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the Video* 0:15 - Ha funny 0:20 - The music doesn't really work well with someone talking over it. It just doesn't mesh well, maybe a different song choice would've been better or maybe it was just too loud I can't tell. 1:50 - There are a few enunciation issues with some words, it's not all the time but its enough to notice. 2:32 - I like your attention to detail the glasses calling back to neistat. I just wanted to point that out cause I feel like I'm not really contributing much feedback right now and this is just here to pad this post. 2:41 - It was really apparent that the wind was an issue I don't know what kind of guard you had on your mic but if you had a wind guard it possibly could've helped. If you did have a wind guard then I don't know if turning down the gain on the mic would've helped. note wind and pop guards are different. I'm sure you know that but it was just a preemptive block when people say you had a guard on your rode in a previous shot. 2:45 - If you're doing a sit down shot like this one you should have your camera on manual focus so it doesn't switch focus like it did right here. It wasn't an issue this time but it could've been causing wasted time. Also, generally I would recommend having focus on manual most of the time if you can. 4:33 - That woosh sound effect didn't really sync up with the zoom in. If you had a more drastic zoom in it would've been more effective. Or if you would've just found a shorter woosh sfx that could also work. 5:34 - I literally laughed out loud. Again the attention to detail is pretty good. I saw the side bar had all videos of the guy Twaimz I thought that was pretty cool. I was also just curious and I looked up saimz and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not a real youtube channel. That's pretty crazy that you put that much effort into one clip of the video. I feel like the video was good. The things that I kept on noticing was that enunciation was an issue at some points. Especially near the end, you were kind of tripping over your words. Another thing that I don't know if this was an active choice but the shutter speed was set to high for my taste. It felt like I was watching stop motion at some points. It's supposed to convey action but it was used really liberally in this video. That's more personal taste I just would've liked a lower shutter speed. Regarding your questions, Yeah it was pretty engaging from the start you made fun of it but starting a video like did actually grab my attention. Guess that's why people do it cause it actually works. it also funny. I understood all the references but maybe that's cause I watch youtube all the time. Yeah overall, I think it was a pretty good video!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the video* 0:00 - Shot is out of focus if you're using obs you can set this manually in the webcam settings. 0:06 - You should get another fill light to light up your face it's really dark right here. I didn't realize the shot earlier was just your computer screen. 0:16 - Wow, that's a big webcam. You should think about cropping it so it just shows your face and gets rid of all that unnecessary edges. 1:09 - I feel like the gameplay sound should've been louder than the music 2:19 - it's really confusing like your friends are trying to engage you in conversation and you're not responding back. And it seems like you want people to focus on your gameplay but you have your face came in the way taking up like 1/5 of the screen. I don't know if it's supposed to be a funny video or a video showing off your skills. 3:29 - I'm pretty good at following action in games like these. I can watch COD gameplay and know what's going on but I don't get why this clip was randomly inserted here. I think it was supposed to be a follow up to "follow me" but I'm not sure it wasn't made clear enough. 4:04 - umm missing links right here. You should set your video to private before you finish uploading it so you can do all these little things like adding the links at the end of your video. Overall, I don't think it worked well. You're friends were trying to be funny but you would never engage with them. It seemed like you were just focused on your gameplay. That's fine but you can't have both at the same time. You can have clips of you doing well but raise up the game volume so we can hear what's going on. I saw that you were switching off and on your webcam so I think that you edit that in during the editing. It's way too big. Crop it so people can actually see what's going on when you're on screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*I review as I watch the video* 0:00 - Not a big fan of the black bars on the side. I don't know if Apple's OS lets you change your resolution to a 16:9 resolution but if it can you should consider doing that just for the sake of being compatible with Youtube's Player. I thought I was going to leave more but it was a pretty short video. I feel like it's a good concept for a channel. A lot of people need to learn Excel for work and what not and little short tip videos like this are helpful. One thing I would recommend is investing in a mic. Or even just using your phone as a mic. They actually have pretty good recording quality. I wouldn't worry to much about people trying to find your videos on your channel. People always use the search bar on your channel and can look up things that way. I'm haven't used Excel since they taught me it in elementary school so I'm not too sure what the use case for AverageA would be but I don't think a video like this isn't directed towards someone like me. The people watching this video are going to know more basic's about Excell. I'm not sure if this is common knowledge for people who use Excel but I would worry about being in a situation where you're preaching to the choir. Again I don't know if this is the case for this video because I haven't used Excel since elementary school but I would take that into account the next time you're making a video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HAHA oh yessss, I have had this experience not a lot but a few times. I worked hard on a video or something else. I remembered I was capturing footage for a video that took 5 hours and all the footage didn't have sound so I had to do it all over again. You just have to deal with it as it comes. It hasn't happened to me since because I've grown cautious over things like saving and making sure everything is working before I continue something for longer than 5 minutes. As far as handling it that's exactly what you have to do. Handle it. Things like this happen and you have to fake the energy. I would recommend either 2 solutions. Just do it over as quickly as you can and get it over with. Or start working on something else and you can come back to that project at a later date. But either way, it is very important that you don't tell your audience what you went through. They don't care and it just adds unnecessary filler to your video. Basically, don't say "This is my #th time doing this" it's annoying and I hate it when I see youtubers doing that. I saw big youtubers doing it when youtube was still young but that practice has disappeared for people that have over 500,000 subs because they know that the audience doesn't care what you had to do to get your video done. Just make the video and make it good the rest doesn't matter.</TEXT>

Record the person on a black backdrop and then mask them out and put them in the window so it looks like a reflection and turn down the opacity on them to like around 50% or 30% depending on how clear you want them to be. If it's a moving shot you would need to use AE and track it in there and just add in the video in post. Then just use the Puppet tool in AE and morph them if you need to, to make it look more natural.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MMM, it doesn't look bad. I'm not too sure what you're talking about maybe the noise. If that's what you're talking about you just need to set you're ISO on your camera lower and bring in more lights. I know you said you had plenty of lights. But CAMERA's they some greedy things. They like a lot of light, especially with low ISO. It may be slightly out of focus. When you focus you have to zoom in and focus because when you're zoomed out you don't really get a fine picture and it's just easier to notice imperfections when you're zoomed in. I didn't notice anything though, it might just be your imagination. Do those things and if you're still not satisfied it just might be the image is flat and you need to change the levels of the footage to get the best colors. I'm not sure if the M10 can record in LOG but if it can you should do that and add a LUT in editing. I don't know what editing software you use but if that's available you should do that.</TEXT>

Should work on trying to find less noticeable places to cut and repeat music. Also adding a crossfade to the audio would help hide the cut. 1:27 - This whole sequence is just kinda boring visually. Some more B-roll of the actual statue with moving shot along with the accompanying VO of the historian would have been better. 2:14 - I don't remember if you remember me talking about your transitions from the last video you posted on here or the last video I reviewed but the cuts were something that I had a personal issue with. These cuts are a lot better, they're not intrusive and they're quick and visually appealing. A lot better just wanted to point that out. 2:36 - Seems like the audio kinda dipped down and then got boosted up again. That was a bit distracting. 3:10 - I like these shots of the skylines and monuments and such. But, I feel like adding some color correction to make them look more appealing would be nice. 3:54 - Those two L3 don't match up. They're kinda similar but the text is different on the second one. Having consistent L3 is key if you're going to use them or having the same style at least. Should change up text stroke color between uses unless that's a consistent change. That's an oxymoron 4:05 - That's harsh clipping with the sunlight right there. I know you probably can't see it because you're in front of the camera but that could ruin you in post. I usually don't bring up clipping in videos because most of the time it's in the background and it doesn't really affect the video because it's not the main focus and only REALLY affects you when you're doing post-production like Color Correction haha see what I did there it's coming full circle. If you start doing CC and you have clipping like that in future videos you're not going to be able to properly CC because there's no data for the software to pull from since the shot has clipping. Clipping btw is when something loses information because you're either to under exposed or over exposed in a shot. In this shot it's your face and behind you in the background the wall is pure white. You lose the detail in the shot. Clipping is also a term used in audio for basically the same reason if you're too loud you lose information and can't edit it. 4:17 - Ooo The text stayed on the screen longer than it should have. I don't know if that was a mistake or you didn't know how to edit it to make it look smooth. If you didn't know you could've just moved the text to the left while the transition was taking place and adding a cross dissolve. It's cheap but it would've hid that a lot better. If it was a mistake then just make sure to rewatch your video before posting it so you can catch things like that. 5:18 - That's weird that you have that Sound fx with the upper third when you didn't have it before. CONSISTENCY! also that probably isn't the best choice of sound fx in the first place. Doing something like a rustling sound would've been better. The element to the left of the text is unfolding not popping. (note I noticed the one a few seconds before this one too and I checked back to see if you adding this sound effect to the L3 in earlier parts in the videos I guess you don't really need to know that but I did check before writing this) 6:36 - OMG what the heck what's with all the sudden changes and additiosn of SFX to accompany the upper thirds first it was the pop now its the little magical jingle. WTH... that is a better choice of sfx though and it works a little better but I still don't think it hits the mark also it's too loud. That kind of sound is supposed to just add a little something not dominate over all the sound. making it quieter would've been better. 7:19 - oh no. no. why'd you use a picture when you could've recorded it. It looks a lot less natural 7:40 - I don't like the use of that transition right there. It has a sort of zoom effect which can be used to cut to a tigheter shot of something or transition into another shot with motion or just in general but using it for the same shot in the future is weird. Overall, I think it was ok. The felt as if it dragged on a bit too long but I can't place my finger on why it felt like it did. I don't usually say this because people usually need to find a basis of skill before they upgrade their equipment but I think you need better equipment. You have fundamental ideas down and it seems like you can implement them you just need better stuff to shoot on. Especially with this type of content where you're focusing on landscape and architecture, it would benefit from getting a stabilizer. Tweaking you're camera settings or if the camera isn't good enough just getting a better camera. And a better mic for field shooting. Also, something that I kind of missed from your last video is the VO that you did before. This video didn't have any of that. It's not a necessity but it felt empty looking at some of those shots without VO. You improved a bit but I think your equipment is the thing holding you back at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. I think it depends entirely on the type of content that you are making. A montage really focuses on the transitions between clips. They are the crux of a whole montage. The flow between clip to clip needs to be perfect and constant hard cuts isn't the right move for all content. I can't give you a good answer without knowing what kind of content you're making but don't be afraid to use other kinds of cuts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, there are loads of affiliate programs where all you have to do is just sign up and they'll automatically accept you. Sponsorship is still a different beast and you would need to show that you can add something of value to whoever is going to sponsor. You also can still monetize your videos while still being sponsored. I see YouTubers do it all the time. Honestly, though I wouldn't recommend going that route just yet especially if you're still small. I heard from a lot of Big YouTubers that it's better to focus on building a core audience than trying to get money from the more casual audience members that you have at the moment and it could be more detrimental to your growth than not having ads at all. I would say unless you really think that the sponsorship or affiliate programs you go into are really going to help your audience I wouldn't go for any kind of monetization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the audio quality is fine. The only thing that I would say is something that Dfeiserr said in his comment that there was a lack of background music. Or just sound effects. Video essays do have to have a good essay part but they also have to be good videos. Visually and auditorily entertaining and I think that's something that this video lacks. I'm sure that you've heard about Clean Prince Gaming if you haven't this is one of his videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugyqOSUlR2A Another thing I would point out is how he separates his videos into sections. This video kind of lost me in the middle because you were just talking without stopping. Making a longer video is fine but give the audience a little time to breathe before moving on to different sections of the dissection. 1:20-2:20 - This section could've been a plot synopses portion of the video just as an example. lastly, another thing that irked me was the fact that you reused clips. Shadow of the Colossus is a huge game and I don't see a reason why you couldn't have different clips for every single cut. Unless you were specifically talking about a moment in the game where you wanted to go more in-depth I wouldn't have re-used any clips. It was a good essay but formatting the video can definitely be improved and adding more visual and auditory elements as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, so I can tell that you definitely have some design experience with the set design you've created. You kind of mesh into the background though. Everything is brown and it makes everything look so bleak. The actually color correction is off the shadows are too bright and there doesn't seem to be any color grading. While I was watching it, it did make sense to me that you come from TV. TV and Youtube are incredibly different and I think that you have a very long way to go as far as Youtube content. Everything on youtube is about expediency and if you don't have that people will very quickly click off your video. 0:23 - "We'll get into later" ... no. Haha sorry but this isn't TV. You have to get to the point. People click on this video to get a review and if you wanted to go into the history of it You should've included that in your title Dead Man's Deck history. And worse after this, you go on a complete tangent with a silent film skit. There is definitely an audience for that and it was actually well made but people watching a review are not interested in watching a long skit that takes up almost a quarter of the video. The actual review portion of this video had a good presentation but was shot very statically. There wasn't any movement in the video. I'm not sure if you've watched other review channel that have glamour shots of the products but most of their shots are moving. Even if it's very slight movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J83sZrz9XTc This is a video by MKBHD that he recently released. And even in shots where he is holding the product still, he still adds movement to make for a more interesting shot. Taking the phone out of frame or pans the camera from side to side to make it more visually stimulating. There are a few static shots where he is just holding his the phone still and not moving the camera but those are intermittent and most of the shots are moving. The introductory shot when you first showed the cards was good I liked that. And near the end of the review portion of the video had some very good shot but the visual pace of the video felt like we kept coming to a stop light every time there was a static shot. You can add them but not as much as you did without slowing it down significantly. Another thing that I wanted to point out is the very noticeable drop in audio quality when you switched to VO. I don't know what happened there. That was distracting. As far as branding. There wasn't any from what I could tell. You said Gentlemen's out at the end of the video but that was about it. No intro. No outro slate. You didn't even say the name of your channel in the video. Watching the video by itself would not lead me to think that you have any sort of branding. There definitely is a style but branding is lacking. You have the technical ability to make good videos but I think you still have a while to go before you get the actual content part down. A thing I would say is that this isn't TV if someone doesn't like the video they can easily click off and will 100% find something else to watch on youtube. Unlike TV there aren't dead periods where "There's nothing good on any other channel" mentality that TV has. You have to constantly fight for the viewer's attention. I think once you get that down you'll be solid but I think it might be a hard mindset to switch to if you've been working on TV for a while.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PS4 Controller issues</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-09 02:19:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Alright, so I've had a PS4 pro came out and I had to buy 3 controllers because of the same reoccurring issue and I thought hey maybe I'm just unlucky and the same issue is happening to the new controller that I bought a few months ago. So here's the issue once in a while the controller starts to register the sensitivity as though it's only being pushed halfway. So let's say for example you're playing COD and you hit R3 to run. You would stop running and start walking because it's registering the left stick input as only being pushed halfway. It's always the same issue with the left stick so I know that it's not an error on my part of poor maintenance. I mean it's a controller it's not like it needs much but I keep it on my desk away from food and I never eat or drink while I handle the controller except for water. So build up would not be the issue. Ok, so the reason I decided to finally post this is that I thought I was having bad luck with buying 3 malfunctioning controllers one after another. But over the past few months, I've been talking to my friends and they have all on separate occasions said that this has been occurring with them as well. The left stick is not registering the full sensitivity of the left stick causing them to walk or to move slowly. And I just now heard 2 more strangers confirm this same issue while playing OW. So it's not just me. I think that maybe having some upgraded quality assurance is needed. When your spending 60 dollars on a controller you expect it to work properly. Especially when that product is being marked up more than 300%. Yeah, controllers cost 17 dollars to make and they sell it for 60. So what's going on? some of that margin has to go to fixing the controller come on guys. Whats the deal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I do take care of them like I said. I don't eat with them and I only drink water but that never gets on the controller. When I get mad I just place it down. I've never thrown a controller I usually just hit my desk and that's only when I get really mad. This is an issue that many of the people I know have and a lot of strangers I met through online play also have. It's literally the same issue. The left stick misregisters the sensitivity that it's bring pushed to. Also I have heard that you can fix it by opening it but why. Should you buy a product and expect it to work. Unless it said assembly required or if it's machinery that goes through a lot of abuse you shouldn't have to take it apart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/02/ps4-pro-4k-difference/ Yeah, it does upscale. Also, there are differences but when you're actually in-game it doesn't feel like anything is worth the extra money. You can stream at 1080p and some games are actually native 4k but most games aren't. There are I know of 2 games that run at 60 fps that don't run on that on the original PS4 so unless you have Uncharted 4 or Horizon: Zero Dawn than it's literally not worth it because it's the same game. I think that GTA V also has a higher res pack that you can download that may be for XBOX though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My boy Jesus it's like whatever I say you want to dispute everything. He was asking for an opinion. The GTA V texture pack was for PC sorry that I didn't look it up beforehand. He's asking for an opinion I don't think that the PS4 pro is worth it compared to more storage if he's downloading a lot of games. There's a literal setting where you can change whether you want to play Horizon: Zero Dawn on a higher resolution or with smoother framerates. Idk if it's actually 60 fps but does it really matter. All these numbers and shit does it matter when you're actually sitting down and playing the game. If he cares enough about the enhanced resolution and support of HDR than the PS4 Pro is good but if he doesn't and downloads more the Extended drive is good. Instead of nitpicking little things. Because they are little. None of the things you proved for me to be incorrect is I said there's no real improvement. Are there improvements sure but does it actually affect anything in game? The differences are minimal to none. And since you want to be all nitpicky I never said it only upscales from 1080p that's a misunderstanding on your part. I'm giving my opinion which is something that I gathered from owning both of the consoles. Do I do all my research in order to make an assumption of something subjective. No. Why should I. If the end product is the same of me sitting in front of the TV and I can't tell a difference and I don't think it's worth it that's my opinion. That's like going to a restaurant and having your mind changed on how good the food taste when they tell you how much effort they put into it. If the food tastes good it tastes good if it doesn't it doesn't. IDC if they spent years perfecting the recipe when it comes to the table it still going to be the same product it would be without all that extra information.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey wow I just read your self-review and preface and I was like dang this guy actually cares so Ima do like my old style of timestamping all my critiques. 0:14 - Wow, blown away already by the editing and care that you took into making this video. A lot of editing and I like how you synced up the title with the music. 0:49 - I don't know what kind of response that was supposed to garner but I did a little "hmmm" laugh. 1:01 - Ok, i noticed that the Framerate is messing up. Something is up with it. Looks like its running at like 14 frames per second. Was this taken from a stream? 1:31 - haha alright that kinda got me. It reminded me of my friend. 2:12 - I don't think that the music works well in this part. I'm not too sure if it's because a bias I have. I've used that music track a lot in one of my earlier youtube channels and now I hate it. But I also think that maybe changing up the music would've better. You did use it for almost every other comedic moment in the video so far. 2:50 - Ha that was funny 2:59 - hahaha that got me too 3:30 - that got a tiny chuckle out of me. (I want to give my reaction to most things just so you can gauge what is working but i'll explain my bias at the end) 7:03 - smiled a little not to sure why it didn't work for me. 11:00 - Ok I kinda like this actually the music and all. Like I know it supposed to be kinda jokingly dramatic but I think it works well. If you made a compilation of just moments like this I would watch that. I don't like fortnite because it's never exciting for me even when we win it just feels boring. This really brought out the excitement for me. 12:27 - I actually really liked that bit. Ok so I just want to preface everything that I'm about to say with the fact that I hate fortnite as a game. I play it when my friends want to and never touch it if I can avoid it. I've made "Funtage's" myself of fortnite and I can honestly say that yours are better. They are better edited and have a lot more thought and effort put into them than I do. But I like my videos better because my friends are in them and I like the fact that, that's an experience that's always going to be on the internet. That doesn't mean that mine are better it just means that whenever you watch something like this you're always going to have bias in favor of them just because people you know are in them. It was a good video and I think that a lot of people that watch it are going to like it. It wasn't for me but I don't like these kind of videos. I do think you deserve more subs though and if you wanted to talk about doing something together we could talk. I do gaming news videos but I don't want it to seem like i'm just leaving this here so we could collab so if you want to talk just PM me if not that's cool. One thing that I did want to point out is the editing in the "sad story" bit was funny but I think that different text would've been better. That's it. It made me laugh at some points which is better than what most top YouTuber's can make me do so yeah it was good. I'm just rambling now so I'm gonna stop but good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:13 - If you added some glamour shots while you were talking that would've been cool. 0:22 - Oh shnaps went from 0 to 100 real quick ok! 0:47 - whoa what happened? It was all cinematic and then it just comes to this shot. That was just very startling. 1:47 - not a big fan of that motion blur right there when there wasn't a lot of motion. If you sped up the footage more I think it would've worked better. 2:27 - Yeah I just think that the shots between cinematic and vlogging style is way to sharp. I think there could be a way of transitioning between them. Maybe like a long J-cut or something. 3:11 - I just wanted to say this is great. Your composition is on point. 3:39 - Whoa stop right there. That's what that needed. Like a shot like that so you can transition between vlogging and cinematic shots. That worked really well right there. If you could implement shots like that into the rest of the transitions between the two styles that would be perfect. 4:00 - I feel this shot lasted a few frames too long. 4:09 - This also worked really well as a transition between cinematic and vlogging styles. 5:59 - Yeah this was not a good transition. I think it's just because of the sudden music stop and then the abrupt change from cinematic to vlogging handheld. 7:02 - I feel like the last 3 food shots lasted too long. Maybe like taking a third of them off would've been better. 7:06 - XD never been in a Kayak that would be me. 8:23 - yeah there you go I think it really is just that simple of letting the music hang for a little bit after you finish the sequence. Yeah this was a good video. You obviously know what you're doing. I think that there are a few things that you can improve but you have an incredibly solid foundation and I just think that you need time to fix those tiny issues. I agree with both of your points of you being a little to tense in front of the camera and the video is long for this kind of video. They usually range from 4 - 7 minutes max so I do think this video length is pushing it but that's an easy problem to fix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2:59 - Wow this is the first time that I feel I have to say that the music didn't go well this moment. It's so intense but nothing is going on. 3:28 - I noticed that you zoomed in on the timer I don't play this game so I don't know what just happened but I guess something good happened. I'm just not too sure what happened there. Ok so I know how much effort these videos take and I also know that you can get fatigue from making these videos really quick. I know its only a 4 minute video but I know that making this video took hours. And the bad part is, is that you can tell when you started to get tired. 2:59 onwards felt like you were tired of editing and didn't want to continue doing all that shit. I would just recommend taking a break and edit videos like this over the course of a couple days. Spending more time for a better product is always the best course to go. That being said. This shit is my shit I subbed it was really good. Liked it a lot I was smiling through most of the video. Oh btw I did watch the whole video but I only started typing at that 2:59 minute mark because everything before that point was perfect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you need a teleprompter. most people just do what you do. Write the script and memorize and recite it. Guess who also does that dun dun dun. The vlog brothers. They don't use a teleprompter either. Here's proof btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoy-x9VBhVc I personally also do this myself. While I write the script I read it out loud so when I actually go to record it, it sounds more natural and I already know what inflection I'm going to use in certain parts. During school we had teleprompters and they hindered rather than helped most people because they were just reading from it and not putting any emphasis on anything. If you memorize and then say it you can think about what you're about to say and add character to it. Even if you literally read it 2 seconds ago as long as you're not looking at the script you should be fine. Because when you're reading from a script your focusing on reading for verbatim and not focusing on delivery. They use them in News outlets because that's actually important and they're not meant to show much emotion so the trade-off is worth it. But when you're adding your character it should be the main focus. Not trying to get all the words right. I feel like I'm just repeating myself but that's my 2 cents.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Review Video] Are the new assets I made for my video good?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-02 05:28:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I wanted to upgrade the quality of my videos. I made an end slate and a background animation whenever I show an image to up my quality and solidify my brand in the videos. I wanted to know if those fit well within the videos. self review: I think that most of the video is fine. I still feel like I'm struggling to keep a good pace in my voice and I stumble a bit in my wording. I don't want people to think that I'm too boring when I'm delivering news which is kind of hard just because there's no real emoti0n in it but I would like some tips on that. Also, there was a section where I censored a part of the video and I don't do that often but I did it here and I don't know if it worked well. I think it's fine just for comedic value but if I ever do have to do it legitimately I want to know a more proper way to do that. I was thinking cropping the area that needed to be blurred and just put a blur on it but I don't know if that's the best approach.

    <TEXT>Yeah, so that only appears when enough people have watched your video that also have a youtube account that has that information filled out on it. Male or Female is optional age range is not but if not enough people watch your videos in a certain range date then nothing is going to pop up right there. If you change the range date to lifetime you should be able to see it again but it won't be up to date. If that doesn't work then... I don't know something is wrong with your demographics tab.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-04-02 07:48:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so before I start I wanted to say that we all start somewhere. when I started making videos back in 2007 they were all bad and up until a few years ago, I would say that most of my videos were still bad until I started to take it more seriously. My point is there is a famous quote I'm not sure who said it but it goes like "Your first 100 videos are going to be bad. There's no way around that. But you need to get through those bad videos to get to the good ones". Ok so I want to help out that process I'm gonna split this up into 3 different sections. **Production**, **Performance**, and **Content**. **PRODUCTION** This is the area that I feel the most strong in myself so this is the area that I think that I can help you the most in. *LIGHTING* Starting out the lighting is way too much. There's this thing that's called 3 point lighting where you use 3 lights in order to create a light to light up the subject (you) this is called a Key light. Another light used to light up the scene and create shadows (Fill light). Another light to create a sort of glow or highlight around the subject in order to create a definitive separation between subject and background (Back Light). I know you probably don't have lights to do this kind of set-up and there are other kinds of setups where you don't even need a single light and just use natural light but they all have the same concept. Creating a scene where the subject is the main focus and only using the background as just that a background not a centerpiece of the image. What I would recommend for you to do is turn off all your lights and see if you can find lights to really try to bring out the subject (you) away from the background and not have it all mesh together. While we are speaking about lighting the lighting in this video is a way to bright for your camera. If there is a way to lower the ISO or Aperture in your camera you should get that adjusted AFTER you set up your lighting. Also, try to set your white balance yourself and don't put it on auto or else it's going to be a bitch to color correct in post like you have in the shots. 0:03 (Red) 0:04 (Blue) 0:06(Slightly red) *FRAMING* Ok, so I want to bring up the Rule of thirds. If you imagine 2 evenly spaced horizontal lines and 2 evenly spaced vertical lines on the monitor than that would be the imaginary lines of the rules of thirds. You want to keep things inside those boxes in order to make for a more pleasing image. The very first shot is almost there If you would've moved the camera more to its left you would be spot on filling up the 3 middle vertical boxes. Most of the shots are fine in regards to the rule of thirds and you don't have to be exactly spot on when doing this but one that is definitely really noticeable is the shot at 0:20 seconds. your just laying on the couch taking up most of the screen. Moving away from the rule of thirds let's talk about headroom. You don't want negative space above your characters head. If this is the shot that you wanted to make you should've moved in closer with the camera so you can avoid all that negative space above the doctors head. The shot at :38 seconds is also another example of bad implementation of negative space. Whenever you have negative space you want it to either be occupied in the direction that the subject is looking at or of a background but at that point the subject is no longer you. It's the background. There are always reasons to break these rules but you first have to understand them in order to know when to break them. Same thing with writing. You have to learn the fundamentals and the proper way to do things so you can know when you don't need to do it the right way. *AUDIO* Oh boy. Um, it's not good. I'm not too sure what to say about this. There's a lot of background hum. You could edit that out in post. It's hard to hear you sometimes and I think that's partly due to your delivery of the lines which is something I want to discuss later. But if you move the mic or whatever you're using to record the audio closer to yourself than you're guaranteed to get better audio. Be creative and find little spots where you can hide the mic. If you're using the onboard camera mic... don't. You can even use your phone which most of the time either has better or equal audio quality to your camera. Even if it's worse I would still recommend using it just so you can hide it and get a more clear soundwave and able to isolate the background noise from the actual content. Don't worry these next few sections won't be as long. **PERFORMANCE** Your performance is very stilted and I can see that you don't really feel that comfortable in front of the camera. This just comes with time and the more exposure you have to it the easier it will be for you. I went to a performing arts elementary school and we actually performed in front of thousands of people. (We traveled to different states and performed for tourist and students) So this part is kind of hard for me to try to give advice on how to get better. It was so long ago and that skill kind of carried on with me. Just exposure. Pretend that there is no camera and really think about what's going on in the scene. We did a lot of Shakespearean plays and the teacher would always make us translate old English into modern English to make us really understand what was being said. I know that you write the scripts but actually go over it before you perform and think about what is being said. Also don't be afraid to be loud. Just be louder. Like I said I learned most of this stuff a long time ago and it was a theater that we performed in not a camera. And I'm not THAT good at it. Shit, I'm sounding like I'm cocky. I'm not a professional actor but I have experienced more than the average person would. **CONTENT** Alright, so the actual things being said. I think that this concept is tired and not that good. Maybe having some more original content would be better. Even if you executed everything else flawlessly I don't think it would work just because it's not that funny of a concept. Honestly, I don't think that I'm right here I just think it's the way I feel. There's been a lot of concepts that and videos like on Vine and Facebook that I thought was stupid but people liked them. It's not my kind of taste and if you were to implement it well I think more people would pay attention to it. This is more personal to me that I don't think this is a very good idea but like I said there are always people out there that are willing to watch stupid shit. I myself am a fan of Meme videos. My friends think they're stupid and annoying and deep inside I get where they're coming from but I still like it so I would take this advice with a grain of salt. **CONCLUSION** Alright so you just started out and I don't think that you should attempt to fix everything I mentioned at the same time. And like I said, in the beginning, your first 100 videos are going to be bad and that's ok but just as long as you keep going and keep actively trying to improve your content you'll eventually get to a place where you happy with it. It's a long process but just take one or 2 things I mentioned and really focus on that for your next video and just keep doing that until you've mastered it then you'll start improving. But yeah good effort and always keep going forward. Don't listen to the people that say that you're bad and just put you down. But do pay attention to people that offer genuine criticism. Keep working alright I'm done. If you read all of this and thought that was long. Just imagine me writing it. Took about 2 hours. ok bye.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:02 - The audio quality is not the best. It sounds like the mic is 100 feet away from you. try to figure out a way to bring it closer to you. That will instantly improve audio quality. 0:04 - Wow that was impressive. I don't know if you did that on purpose the slow focus on the product but that was well done. A thing that does bother me about this though is the confusing just layout of the background and that random box in the foreground. What is that? is that like your laptop or something? I'm not too sure its kind of distracting. The background is bland I think you did a good job of working with what you had. Blurring the background out was a good choice. I would recommend adding some light fixtures or just adding some color. A tree, poster, something to make the background look less bland. 0:07 - uh... is this an after effects template? 0:16 - Ok so the reason why I ask is that most starting YouTubers just find a cool looking template and just add their own pictures to it. Most of the time it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the video and it's off-putting because you think you're getting one thing and it's not what you're getting. I would recommend ditching that template and making something simpler. It doesn't need to be flashy just make it good so it meshes well with the rest of your content. 0:42 - This set up is so strange. There's so much going on, on the screen, it's hard to know what I'm supposed to focus on. If you haven't seen unbox therapy I would recommend checking him out. He keeps his table empty because the focus of the shot should be on the product, not the set. I would recommend just getting rid of that mirror and the tree shadows on the screen. Putting up a tarp behind you or wherever that source of light is coming from. Maybe keeping the lamp if you really want something to compliment the product in the shot but I don't know how well that would work. 0:51 - You didn't show the function buttons. Ok that's fine I guess, you just called attention to it and we couldn't really see it in the shot you provided but in the grand scheme of the video, I don't think it was that important anyway. It just felt a little weird to keep that one shot out. 0:56 - I do like these cut-away shots to the product I think that's cool and something you should definitely keep. 1:33 - 2 boxes? Um ok. I think it's going to get a little cluttered if you bring everything out that you got in 2 boxes. It's a guess but we'll see. 2:10 - Yeah you don't need to bring them all over just take the content of one of the boxes and show that and just tell us that you bought four of them. I really don't think there was a need to show both of the boxes. Sorry I'll let it play out. 2:35 - I did want to point out that I did notice the waterproof cases as soon as you started this sequence. I saw it in the left corner. When you put the 2 other camera's away it looked like you were looking at the camera monitor. I would just suggest in the future to double check that nothing else is in the shot. I mention this because I see that cord on the left and it's a bit bothersome. 3:31 - haha yeah the table is already starting to get clutter. In the future, I would suggest that if you do buy more than one of the product just show one and you can tell us you bought more. 4:35 - This was meant to be an unboxing right? Didn't you just show us what came inside the box? 6:05 - Is that also a one of the camera's you left on the beach or is that your regular camera? I'm not sure. I think it's your personal camera? But if it isn't is there like a setting to increase the FPS on the little gadget or I'm not sure. This shot looks a lot better than the ones you have connected to your body. If this is your camera like I'm thinking I don't think it was a good idea to switch between your camera and the camera you're trying to show footage of because then you get situations like this where I'm just confused. 6:37 - I'm interested to know if any water leaked into the case. It sounded like it did. I'll wait to the end to see if you talked about that or not. 6:53 - whoa whoa whoa whoa what is this.A chipmunk movie hahaha? Why did you just randomly speed up the footage? 8:29 - Wait, what? what was that shot? HAHAHA, that was so random! Oh, my goodness. So with 2 seconds left in the video, I don't think that you're going to talk about how well the waterproof case held up. A more comprehensive review would've been appreciated. Alright, so a first video this was actually really good! Gotta say I'm impressed I was not at the level near where you're at when I first started but there still is a ways a way to go. Uping the audio quality by getting your mic closer to your face. Weird editing choices that don't really serve a purpose and set design that either clutters the shot or doesn't bring enough to the shot. These are all these I think you need to work on but I think you're a few steps ahead in the right direction. As far as your self-review I think that you just need to get more comfortable in front of the camera and that just comes with time and experience. I don't think that your speech is bad I just think that you're nervous and the audio quality needs to be fixed. And yeah I think the amount of time you spent showing the actual camera footage for the review was really short and next time you do a review that should be your main focus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you a lot actually. I was thinking the same thing about my voice and nobody reciprocated it so I thought it was fine but I do think that I mesh words together too much. Well I guess meshing together any words is bad but I never tried to fix it because I thought it was just me and I was crazy. As far as the intro I hadn't really noticed that before the abrupt transition. I do try to add a subtle fade effect for the sound but I guess it's not enough. I was actually thinking about letting the music play through the intro but never really tried it. I'll give that a go. Thanks again for the review it really did confirm a lot of my own suspicions and bring up things that I hadn't noticed before!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, we are a brand new team that is currently looking for new members. We currently have a coach that is ready to build a team in order to participate in Scrims and Tournaments once we get situated. Specifically, we are looking for 3 DPS roles (2 Hitscans, 1 Projectile), 2 Tanks (1 Main, 1 Off Tank), 3 Supports (1 Main healer, 2 Off healers). SR can range between 2700 - 3300 If you fall outside this range feel free to apply! There might still be a possibility for you to join! However, if you are either in Gold or below or Masters or Higher the likelihood would drop significantly. We have a few candidates already but we are still trying to build this team and are also looking to build a sub roster at times when people can't play or other players are better on certain maps and/or roles. Discord is required in order to join. That is where we communicate all changes, coaching, skrim times, and tournament times. We want to build a solid team so that means that you will most likely only be playing one role while on the team. Don't tolerate racism, sexism or any kind of bigotry. Message subject4835 on PSN for more information and if you want to apply for the team apply at http://www.guilded.gg/r/AAdlO51ZZj We'll set up an interview time and a few trial games to see the cohesion with the rest of the team. Look forward to hearing from you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to stream Typeracer and this would happen to me as well. But a viewer explained it to me. He said that because of Lag from the Typeracer server it would sometimes take longer for you key inputs to actually be inputted into the server and the lag between the time you typed and the time it logged would be different. But when you watch the replay it doesn't take real-time input into the account but rather from the second the race started to the second that you finished pressing the last button.  #8203; I don't know if this is true but it's the explanation that I had. I'm not as fast as you are but I do sometimes get this as well but only by 1 wpm. And that would explain why faster typist would have this issue amplified. Making your actual speed 150.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow! First of all I just want to say like wow! I'm interested to see what you come out with. I enjoy studying business and financing as well, so I definitely want to see you succeed. The space that you are trying to break into is definitely filled with a lot of knowledgeable people but very few of those people are actually able to output well produced content. So, if you focus on your visual content than I think you will have a huge leg up on everyone else. # Equipment **Audio and Video** In regards to your question about your camera. The iPhone 7+. Most phone cameras are perfectly fine if you're starting out and especially if you're doing the kind of content you're planning to do. The iPhone isn't going to hold you back in that regard. However, more important than the camera is your audio. You have to make sure that your audio is serviceable. I think that the iPhone definitely is a good enough device to capture audio. However, I wouldn't recommend recording audio AND video at the same time. If you're going to do a talking head video. Chances are the phone isn't going to be close enough to you to pick up decent sound. And if you're going to keep it close enough to you so that it will be able to pick up good sound it most likely won't have a good shot. The only way I could see you using an iPhone as both a video and audio recording device at the same time is if you're shooting an overhead shot on a whiteboard or something like that. But even then I would still recommend recording the video and then the Voice Over separately. If you can only invest in one of the things definitely invest in an audio product. A lot of people out there that are into audio are going to tell you that the lower end of the Blue Microphone line up (Blue Yeti, Blue Snowball) aren't worth it. The truth is that you can definitely get good sound out of these microphones you just have to do some minor post processing once you've finished recording. If you need help with that I'll leave a link[ here](https://youtu.be/fknmkG0mPzw) of a video that can help you out. I chose this video for you because it uses Adobe Audition and that is available to you in the creative cloud suite. But definitely though if you want to use you're phone as a microphone I would say that, that is a good option but I would look for a different video recorder if you're going to go down that route. Just so you know. I would say that the audio quality in your iPhone is probably as good as a blue snowball if not much better. **Lighting** I alluded to this earlier but lighting is going to depend on what kind of videos you are going to make. If you're making a talking head video (a video of you sitting in front of the camera) the lighting situation is going to be demanding because you are lighting an actual model (Yourself). However, if you are going to be making videos in front of a whiteboard then lighting yourself isn't going to be as important. Lighting the whiteboard is going to be much easier and forgiving if you're going to go that route. Or if you want to do a overhead whiteboard video similar to[ minute physics](https://youtu.be/t-O-Qdh7VvQ) that would be the easiest to light however would be more difficult in editing if you're trying to replicate that exact style. If you're going to use your phone I would recommend playing around in Pro mode or whatever apple calls it in the camera app and figure out a good lighting set up. For you and your usage case I would recommend probably a "in front of whiteboard" kind of video where you just write in front of a whiteboard. Maybe you can ask a professor you're cool with if you're able to use it between periods. The room lighting would be sufficient so you wouldn't have to worry about that since you're only concerned about the whiteboard. However, if you were interested in creating talking head videos you would most likely have to invest in some sort of lighting for your setup. It is more work but you would have the benefit of having an uninterrupted recording space and you would have more options for visual aides than you would in a "in front of a whiteboard" kind of video. If you are interested in learning about lighting with natural light[ here](https://youtu.be/q7jCB8vHh-U) is a quick video demonstrating proper use of natural light. And if you wanted to invest in a lighting setup the most common setup for interview type videos is the 3 point lighting setup. I won't go in depth here but if you do want to go that route[ here](https://youtu.be/pBt8qdO03-k) is a quick video explaining 3 point lighting. # Pre Production **Research** I think that you have this part handles. But just to reiterate what you already know and if someone else happens to read this. If you're going to make an informative video RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT! I make little gaming news videos and it doesn't seem that important but even still I do a lot of research. Research is probably 60% of the video making process for me. I cross reference reports. I ALWAYS ALWAYS check the source and (I haven't done this because I'm so tiny) if you can you should talk to someone directly involved in your subject. In your case I would think that, that would be the bank. I think calling the bank and asking them questions about their specific numbers would be extremely beneficial for you. And if you can consult an expert that is also a great source. Again, if you are cool with a professor that would be extremely helpful. Don't make a mistake, especially with your type of content. That kind of mistake could cost you credibility and a loss of viewer base if you ever got to a significant number. Again I think that you should have this down if you are interested in this you know more than me but[ here](https://youtu.be/MUiYglgGbos) is a video just explaining how to think more objectively and more like a journalist. Maybe this won't be that beneficial to you but if ever you do get to a point where you need to investigate something this is a good first step to learn how to think like a journalist. **Script or no Script?** I'm not going to mess around with this one. Write a script. I guarantee you if you don't write a script and if you haven't CONSISTENTLY been in situations where you have to concisely give your thoughts quickly without hesitation you won't be able to talk off the top of your head. Something that I hope you've noticed if you've watched any of the videos that I linked here is that most people talking in those videos are quick, direct, concise and deliberate. There is no Ums or Ahhs or trailing thoughts. Every word that comes out of their mouths pertains to the subject at hand. I don't know for certain but I would bet you any amount of money that 90% of people that speak like that are reading off of a script. Sorry, I know this part isn't really that informative and it's more just me saying "Hey write a script". But here are some tips. * When you are writing your script read it out loud to determine if something sounds wrong when said out loud * When you are reading your script DO NOT wonder from your script * When you finish writing your script, read through it out loud at least twice * When you finish reading your script out loud. Read it out loud one more time as if you were recording the video at that moment. * Make any corrections after you've finished reading your script out loud and then read it out loud at least 2 more times * Write in short 1-3 sentence paragraphs (more on this in the production section) I know I put an emphasize on reading your script out loud but that's for a few reasons. 1) When you read it out loud you can better detect if something isn't going to sound right. 2) When you read it out loud you begin to feel more comfortable with your script and where to enunciate particular words. 3) Reading from a script is awkward and doing it multiple times will make you sound more natural when you're actually recording it. Also one last thing. Understand the audience that you're trying to go for. You're not trying to reach someone outside of your scope. You don't have to try super hard to be entertaining. If you title your video "Pros/Cons of Equity Funding " or something like that you're not going to get someone watching it going like "This is boring" Because they are there for a certain reason. Don't try to incorporate anything that would take away from the video. Like long drawn out attempts at humor. I'm not saying to be stale but understand who you are talking to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT># Production **Type of video content** Again, there are different types of video content. There are talking heads, whiteboard, power point. By far, the most popular in your niche is going to be power point. Not because it's the best way to go but because most people making videos in this sector aren't creatively inclined. In my opinion, the best type of video for informative videos are talking head. The reason for this is that a face is a lot more easier to stare at than a whiteboard or a power point. However, there is a major drawback to informative talking head videos. The only real way to get visual aides in the video is to do it in Post Production (Editing) and that is a really steep learning curve. That's why I recommended the whiteboard for you. It's more engaging than a power point but not as hard to implement as a talking head video. If you are interested in doing talking head videos there is no one source that I can show you that teaches you about it. Editing takes a long time to learn and a long time to get good at it. BUT for the first step to going down this path I can give you an[ introductory video on editing](https://youtu.be/PYTPXsMkYDE) that would be beneficial to you. Also, I assume because you have creative cloud that people on your campus are into video editing. You can always ask one of them to teach you a few things. Maybe one of them would be interested in helping you create your YouTube videos as well. I doubt that though. People in a video production course are more interested in creating narrative projects not informative but you never know. Again, I would recommend whiteboard videos. But if you do want to do talking head videos I would start out with whiteboard videos and get familiar with the software and once your familiar and have learned some basic skill I would then transition over to talking head videos. **Shooting** Have the script nearby either on your phone or printed out. Honestly, there is something about having the actual script in physical form that makes it easier. If you're going to print it out. Print it out with a large font size I would recommend 18 but you might go through a lot of paper like that. If you can't do 18, minimum I would do is 15 font size. Also, if you mess up just start the whole line over again. If you can, start the paragraph over again. This is why I also said to write the script in short 1-3 sentence long paragraphs. If you mess up reading a line. Starting over at the beginning of a short paragraph is a lot less taxing on you than if you had to start over from a 5-7 long sentence paragraph. Also after you finish reading a paragraph stop for a second. This will help you out a ton when you begin editing. Just for one second. Read through the script one paragraph at a time. Once you are satisfied with how you said the paragraph wait one second and move on to the next one. Don't be afraid to redo a line several times if you need to. When I started I redid lines about 8-12 times before I moved on and sometimes they still turned out poorly but you'll improve over time. # Post Production **Footage Ingest and Organization** Make sure that when you take the footage from your device (phone, camera) onto your computer that it is organized. If you're going to be making consistent videos files and footage will pile up quickly. This is how I organize my files  #8203;  #8203; |\[Channel Name\]---- gt;|Unedited Footage-- gt;|\[Current Video Name\] --- gt;|Camera A shot 1|| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| ||||Camera B shot 1|| ||Rendered Footage --- gt;|\[Current Video Name\]||| ||Assets --- gt;|Video Assets --- gt;|Intro Video|| ||||Outro Video|| ||||End Slate|| |||Sound Assets --- gt;|Music--- gt;|\[Background Song 1\]| ||||VO--- gt;|\[Current Video name VO\]| I hope this table makes sense to you. Basically every thing with the arrows after it are folders and anything that doesn't have arrows are the actual files. Everything in brackets is just a placeholder name (just for example "\[Channel Name\]" would be Breakable Program). Everything that doesn't have brackets is the actual name of the folder or file. I hope that makes sense. But organization is key when you're making videos. You don't want to be looking for something for hours just because you didn't organize properly. I'm not saying to do it exactly like me but I feel like this is a good example of what it could look like. Also if you want, you can back up the entire \[Channel Name\] folder to the cloud for extra security in case something happens to your computer you won't have to start over. **Editing** I know there is a lot to learn here. But the video I linked above to will definitely help you out if you've never edited before. One thing I would recommend is before you actually start. Look through all the footage and check out the takes that you like and the ones that you don't like. And just keep that in your mind. This may seem like it will take longer. Watching the footage and then actually beginning editing but it will help you out in the long run. Also I don't know if the guy said it in the video. But if you just record one long video you can speed through the footage by pressing ctrl + L or CMD + L on mac I believe. This won't actually effect the end product. It's just a feature to help you go through footage at a faster rate. I use it all the time if I'm working on a long project.</TEXT>

    <TEXT># Networking and Marketing **Networking** Just interact with people in your space. Check out other people's channel that are in your space and have a genuine conversation with them. DO NOT say "Hey check out my channel" that's an instant turn off for people. Find people that you like and talk to them and in the future if you guys become close enough maybe you can end up working together on something. But the main goal should just be to find people in your niche to learn from and eventual grow with as well. **Social Media** This is kind of closely related to networking but just posting about relevant things on twitter and Facebook and interacting with people is a great way to get your name out there. Interact with other creators or with people who have questions about your subject. Actively seek out people in your space and learn to use relevant hashtags. LinkedIn might also be a good way for you to meet people as well. This is where it is okay to promote yourself however there is this common ratio that is put out there. 3:1. Where every 3 post should be about something relevant to your subject but not self promotion and then every 1 post can be self promotion but to promote it in a way that it will seem as a benefit for people to click on it. For example "If you need help on funding your seed capital and how much personal capital you should invest check out my newest video" Even that probably wasn't the best way to phrase it but it's better than saying "Hey I put out a new video here it's about the difference between crowd-source funding and Angel investors". What I'm trying to say is. Try to explain how your video will provide value to the people your trying to pitch it to. **YouTube SEO** These are tags and thumbnails and what not. Make it brand appropriate and a really good way to get ideas on what kind of thumbnails you need or titles is to look at other people in your space. Also, this feels a little dirty saying but it is a genuine way to get your video seen by more people. Just toss in a few influential people in your tags. Like keep them relevant to your video like for example someone really popular on the internet and is also relevant to money would be Elon Musk. Just toss a few names like that in your tags and that can help push your video up in the queue. But just make sure that your video is clear and doesn't misrepresent what's in the video. Tags are fine to kind of misrepresent because they are not easily available to the average viewer (BTW other people can see your tags if they use certain apps). Just don't put Elon in your thumbnail or Title if he's not actually a part of the video. Also be consistent with your uploads. If you want your videos to continue to be relevant you have to consistently post in order for the algorithm to keep you up. I think this is one of my major reasons why I haven't been growing. I post maybe once every 3 months but whenever I do post I see a massive jump in my numbers not just in my new video but in my old videos as well. # Conclusion I know this was a lot of information and I hope that you're not overwhelmed but it's just a lot of information to start out a successful YouTube Channel. There is still a lot of information out there for you to learn and this isn't an all inclusive post about everything about YouTube but it's a good stepping off point. And I hope to hear from you soon about you first video. TL;DR READ YOUR SCRIPT OUT LOUD WHILE YOU WRITE IT!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I don't want to beat a dead horse. But the intro is too long. And like everybody else said. Don't leave in your rending in the video. But if you are going to leave it in there. That would be a perfect opportunity to explain something about the software or talking about different techniques or whatnot. If you don't do that, I would recommend just cutting that out.  #8203; Alright, There are some other things. I think that the music choice was just a bit off putting. If you're going to have an energetic intro the rest of your video has to be energetic. It went from fast and loud (and long) to your smooth talking and quiet ambiance in the background. I think a quieter softer (shorter) intro would definitely fit your style better. Also I don't think you need to be more active, you have a very soothing voice and demeanor. I think you should roll with that and make a simpler calmer shorter intro. Maybe like a quick logo. Something like 3 seconds long.  #8203; Also, this is something that bothered me a bit. I don't know if anyone else really cared but... the lower third at :22 is so high. That's more like a middle third than a lower third. hahahah joke. not really though it's really high up. Also it's a little weird having it on the right side. Lower thirds mostly default to the left side but I don't know if that's wrong but I just haven't seen that done too many times.  #8203; Last thing. Something that I really like is to see the final result in the beginning of the video. So you could show the final result after you finish your little sh-peal at :03 or you could just do some VO over the final result. But having the final result in the beginning of the video is really nice and helps the viewer understand EXACTLY what the video is going to be about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:12 - What about your channel though? Also, branding? I don't know who you are. 0:45 - That's a pretty good reason to change your name. You want to have a unique name that stands out... BUT... like I don't really need to know about it. Just change your name and go like. "Yo I have a sick new name and be excited about it" 1:16 - Yeah your reasoning isn't wrong but... like why put that in a video. 1:28 - Is there a better picture or is that the only picture there is of the skin? If there isn't a better picture maybe you could explain that really quick like "Yeah I know it's only the top half of him but FUCK it's the only picture that was avaliable." Maybe don't curse though. 1:57 - I want to see the skin : lt;
     2:07 - I actually don't see... you took the picture down 2:24 - I think I'll give you a pass because I don't really play fortnite but I assume people that would be watching this video would know what you're talking about. But if I were you I would've put up some pictures of the skins. 2:34 - WHHHAAA!!! WHY didn't you show that picture in the beginning. And why didn't you explain this when you showed the skin instead of moving on to something else. I think at least having an outline for your video would help you keep on track. 3:35 - .... liar...there is no link 4:01 - It would be nice to see what you're talking about. I know you already put the picture up. But just put it back up while you talk about it brother. 4:08 - I swear to christ if you take this picture down and then start talking about how it looks after it's gone I'll will lose my shit. 4:26 - Hold on... I'm looking for something... I don't know where it went. I lost my shit somewhere 4:55 - You get it right... don't talk about how something looks when it's not on the screen... I know you can't go in the past and change that but.. next video alright... plz : lt;
     6:33 - OH FUCK! YOU'RE DOING IT! YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WHILE IT'S ON THE SCREEN! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU MY SON! 6:43 - Nevermind... you disappoint me 6:48 - OMG! NEVERMIND AGAIN! YOU PUT A PICTURE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! In all seriousness, just literally do that for everything that you're talking about. And the things that you say will be easier to follow. honestly, the whole 5th minute I was kinda thinking about something else. But that's not my fault. That's your fault for not keeping me locked on your screen. (that's why it jumps from 4:55 to 6:33 out of nowhere) 7:29 - nice shot 8:47 - This is what I call Behind the Scenes talk. You can and should absolutely think like this. BUT! it's for behind the scenes. The viewer shouldn't know about this. Not because it's bad but just because it's not important for them and that's not the reason they clicked on this video.  #8203; **Conclusion** Ok, so a few things. your band is not anywhere in the video. Besides you talking about it I could not tell who you were. Invest in a little short intro or something. There are plenty of good templates you can find online and there are some sites where you can make it. Having a consistent opening saying is good as well. Something simple is fine like "What it is what it do my name is Xeni with a new leaked skin review" something like that just so people know who you are. Also you were kind of all over the place in the beginning of the video. You hit your stride afterward but I could tell you were pretty unorganized in the beginning. Making an outline or a script would definitely help you out. That's pretty much it. There's a lot of people in your space so you have to stand out. I don't know how to do that with you. Maybe be more energetic and add some flavor to your videos with your voice. Add a gimmick something to differentiate you from the other people doing this on youtube.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try to focus on one specific audience. SPAM as defined by Google. irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of recipients. Imagine if I were to just post my YouTube channel here without giving you an answer. It's not really helpful. Also posting just one link doesn't really help you out in terms of subscribers or views. I would recommend getting to know people in the gaming community and seeing if you can collaborate on something. Also I said it in the beginning but, focusing on one specific audience will help a lot. If you say your demographic is gaming audience then that's too broad. Think about the audience that you want to reach and from their point of view think of what kind of video they would want to see. My advice right there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2:57 - Weird Audio glitch just re-record that next time. 14:44 - That actually made me laugh out loud.  #8203; So, when I first started watching the video I didn't have that high of an expectation. A lot of the jokes in the beginning didn't land for me. The Copyright disclaimer was too long and I think the intro after that was too long for me. I think the reason I didn't like the beginning was because it took like 2 minutes to get into the actual content of the video. You were just explaining the movie which is okay, but I just think that it took too long to get through.  #8203; But then you started to get into the actual (I don't know what you call it "play-by-play"?) of the movie and it's a good format it works well if you have good commentary behind it. I think the little graphics and text that you put in the video visual looks bad. BUT, I think there's a charm to it so I don't know if you should change that or not. Making it look more professional might take away from it in my opinion but I don't know I would have to actually see it.  #8203; I think that you did have good commentary. It was funny like I said some of the jokes didn't land for me but most people that I watch most of their jokes don't land for me. I know this is a video review and not a channel review. But I went to go take a look at your actual channel and it looks really empty. Right now, I think it's fine because you only have 5 videos but you should be thinking about how to make it look more full. Getting a channel trailer and making playlists and what not. Your thumbnails are also a little bland. I don't know how to help you there. I haven't study thumbnail design and I'm not that good at it myself. But you don't have to be an expert to know when something looks (not bad but not eye catching).  #8203; Overall though, the video was actually really entertaining. Usually when I watch a video I do like a timestamp thing when I write down everything that I'm thinking but a little ways into the video I stop thinking about this review because it was so entertaining to watch. There was this couple on this subreddit a little over a year ago and I told them the same thing that I'm about to tell you. I think you can absolutely do this if you keep putting out videos. You can tell when someone has it in them but I think it's very important especially for people like you to begin studying marketing and social networking because you have the content. I think your set with that. I think your focus now should be on trying to get your product (videos) out there. By the way, that couple I was talking about came here when they had 50 subscribers and 2 videos out and now they have almost 4 thousand subs and are continuing to grow. I know 4 thousand isn't a lot but they're getting there. I think you could do the same. Good luck and I hope to see more from you soon. Also subscribed to you and like that video I'm gonna watch the rest of your videos as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, I'm personally not interested in electric unicycles but I enjoy watching other people do something that they enjoy. I thought the video was fine there was a bit when you guys started racing I didn't really realize that you guys had began. At 2:55 you start explaining the different sections of the course. But I think if you would've done some VO and explained it, that would've been more engaging for the viewer. Just as a general rule people don't like to read on videos. Then once you started racing you could've explained the different difficulties in the actual parts of the race. A lot of the footage was just footage with no explanation. As an outsider looking in, I didn't understand why some part were so difficult. Like for example, the off-road section seemed like... I don't know it didn't seem like that big of a deal but maybe if it's harder to maneuver on grass maybe you could explain that. I don't think I'm doing a good job of explaining myself. Here's [this video](https://youtu.be/0Yp9WS6cJFA) that kind of demonstrates what I'm trying to say. You can see him go through the run and he isn't really doing a lot of explanation but you can hear it in his voice that he struggle at a few parts and his thought process through the track.  #8203; I think that you have a good niche and that you won't have trouble getting people that are already interested in electric but if you want to appeal to others that aren't necessarily in that niche I think what I said could help but you definitely found something focused you did a good job on that. Hope you do well!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Review Video] New Video Game Series Concept</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-18 19:23:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently my writer has been talking to me about diversifying our content. Most of our content is just gaming news and reviews. I told him that we could try out some of the content he wants to make and see if anything works. So this is one of those concepts where he just talks about different issues that are going on in the gaming industry. We also have some other ideas of trying out and I might post some of those videos on here later. Anyways QUESTION that I'm looking to answer.  #8203; 1. Is this concept of talking about industry and individual gaming issues something that is Viable as a series concept? 2. Did you find it difficult to understand the issue he was talking about (i.e. did he explain himself well)? 3. If you're not into gaming what parts of the video did you find it hard to understand or to keep up with? 4. If you are into gaming, do you feel that this topic resonates with you? 5. I've had to remake all of our assets because I lost it during a reformat of my computer. SO! What do you think about the new updated assets (Lower Third, Motion background, End slate)  #8203; I know those are a lot of questions but I like to be thorough also if there are any other issues that you saw or heard please let me know. Also, I don't answer these question in my self review because I literally don't know the answers to them which is why I'm posting on here.  #8203; [Video in Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3UmxqprxB4 amp;t=4s)  #8203; self review: I think there are parts in the video as the editor where I could've better edited the footage to better demonstrate what the writer was talking about. For example, at 0:40 he talks about games reusing the same mechanics but I just use a different shot of the same game at a different point of the story... that was a little lazy. Some of the wording in the writing could have been phrased better to better explain the intent of the video. Like instead of using the word "meander" use a phrase like "dive deeper". The quotation part of the video was meant to be a bit of a joke but I don't think it hit that well and wasn't really that funny. 1:15 is another example of not editing to better demonstrate what the writer was talking about. I think the music audio was a bit too loud at some parts and I could've done a better job at leveling that. I think the positives are the voice over work. This was his first video on the channel where he voiced it and he did a fantastic job in my opinion. His inflections and tone and everything was really well done.  #8203; [Review 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/be9r46/review_video_electric_unicycle_racing/el7eijd/?context=3) [Review 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/bek0c7/review_video_primms_hood_cinema_movie_review/el78257/?context=3)</TEXT>

And I know the description is too short too but I just couldn't think of what else to put in there I'll revisit that. However, the tags are advice that I got from someone that I know has more experience in the field than me so I think that I'll continue to do that. However, I can see how that would be preceived as bad but most people don't know how to look at video tags.

But unfortunately we are limited in equipment but that's something that I've been wanting to do. We need a good camera and lights and either a set or green screen and we currently dont have any of those. But I do agree that we need something like that.

    <TEXT>I think that it's going to be a lot easier to push the colors in 10 bit and there'll be less chance of banding but if you know what you're doing when you're shooting and you're careful when you're doing the color grading I think you can get away with using 8-bit. Of course, if you can shoot in 10-bit that would be the most ideal situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I'm fine. The viewers that watch those videos are the same type of viewers that might be interested in this video I believe. If I were to put something like Kim Kardashian I could see that being misleading but I think this is fine. Like I said this was advice that I got from someone else who has a lot of experience in this field and she explained it to me and said that it is a bit of a gray area but it's a valid way to tag videos. I'll talk to her some more though just in case. I appreciate your concern!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah : lt; . I figured that the audio was a bit too distracting and I thought that maybe it was too loud but I found after editing that you can push audio a lot louder than most people expect. HOWEVER, this case... yeah I think it was too loud as well. Next time i'll turn it down a little. Thanks! I appreciate the feedback!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that my thumbnails aren't the best. That is something that I'm at a very amateur level with. I don't know how to compose a picture to grab someones attention but I think that's another thing that I need to invest my time into learning as well. I also agree that there were some points in his voice over work where he didn't really enunciate well and mumbled a few times. However, I think he did a fantastic job for his first time on the Mic. Oh this was his first time on the mic as well. From here, I think that he'll just continue to get better. He has a real knack for it, but there are some places to improve upon for sure. I appreciate your feedback!  #8203; Oh also as far as the series idea. I shared some of your concerns as well. But I thought about it some more and the industry is constantly evolving and issues are constantly arising so maybe it won't turn out as dry as I initially thought. But only time will tell!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey thanks for answer all of my questions! Yeah the audio was a consistent issue I found among most of the reviews of this video. Normally, I don't make that mistake but I was trying out a new way of editing that doesn't give you as much control over the audio level and it didn't work out too well. But for next time, I will definitely take that into account! Appreciate your feedback and I hope that you do well in your ventures!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:39 - Ahhh yes, I was confused about what you were doing here. Not in the elevator... obviously... you were going down... I MEAN THE WEIRD EDITING! It was you trying to do that vlogging thing that people do to show you leaving. I didn't get it a first but the issue is actually rather easy to fix. You just need to cut down the clips even further. Each clip was anywhere from 1-3 seconds long but if you cut it down to .5-1 second long that will definitely help get that effect across.  #8203; 0:58 - I would never vlog because I'm so fucking... I don't know the word... "not confident enough" to hold my camera out in front of me talking to it while I'm walking outside. But, you gotta do it. If you're explaining something it's more visual interesting to see you talk about it while you're walking outside. Not just standing in front of a mirror... That was a cool little flip you did though. Turning from one mirror to another. I was like "Dang that's some top level choreography"  #8203; 1:15 - Aye that's what I'm talking about. But you're blurry : lt;. Easy solution to this. Set your camera to manual focus or lens or whatever it is on your phone. Put an apple on a table the same distance you would hold your camera away from your face and focus it. Once you've got that focus get a little marker or tap and just mark it on the camera lens. So whenever you want to pull focus on your face you just have to line up the marks on your face to set focus. EASY!  #8203; 1:39 - YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!!!  #8203; 1:44 - BECAUSE YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!!!  #8203; 1:55 - Yeah do that thing I said earlier about pulling focus  #8203; 2:23 - Oh yeah funky music. Nice little J-cut leading into it that was nice. You should do that more often. almost 2 and half minutes in and this is the first music I've heard. More music would be nice. For example. When you were doing that intro cut thing you could've put a small sting on that.  #8203; 2:49 - Don't cut the music like that EW! do a fade out that would've been nicer. Also the guy was about to start singing. I would've just used the instrumental part and faded before the vocals came it. It was so abrupt this way. Making the montage shorter would've been better than cutting at the vocals. Also try experimenting with slow-motion. I don't know how fast your camera can record but record in 60 FPS and try some things out. If you can't... I don't know what editing software you use but just doing a slow effect with optical flow in Premiere works out well enough.  #8203; 3:32 - This is where I would've cut the keyboard part let's see how much longer you take to cut...  #8203; 3:38 - Ok 6 seconds. That's a bit longer than I would've done it. Slowed down the pacing a bit too much. Try cutting earlier that's a consistent issue I see with you.  #8203; 3:49 - Again out of focus. Just pointing that out.  #8203; 4:03 - That would've been a better cut if you would've cut sooner into the montage.  #8203; 4:11 - mmhmm... mhmmm... WHAT! KIND OF MONTAGE WAS THAT! IT WAS 2 SECONDS! I would've done combined the lunch and the waiting montages together and then introduced your friend.  #8203; 4:20 - Hmm weird echo effect going on here. Did you use the external mic and internal mic at the same time while you were editing? that's what it sounds like. Also... 420 BLAZE IT!  #8203; 4:35 - I wasn't going to say it because it's normal for the shot to be poorly framed when it holding it backwards. But the shot has been poorly framed for a while now. Just being more aware of how the camera is getting the shot will help you out here. But it does take practice and even the pro's (Kasey, Jesse) still mess up here. So it's not to big of a mess up. Just try to be more aware.  #8203; 5:57 - The text was a bit weird there. It took up the whole screen. Usually subtitles are more centralized towards the bottom of the screen.  #8203; 6:29 - Ooh major mess up right here. Plan! for your end screen. You don't want to have something on screen that is obscured by the end screen overlay. Just think about it while you're editing.  #8203; 1. No not really I think that Vlogging is one of the harder types of content to do on Youtube because you either have to do something exciting or you have to be exciting. I'm not a fan of them but you should look at the paul brothers for example. They always energetic and always doing some crazy shit. This was not that. 2. Oh... I don't read questions before I start watching videos. Well, check above for suggestions. Another suggestion though. The beginning was kind of abrupt. You want something to start it out like a small montage or establishing shot from the outside. OR, just saying something to start the video. You just all of sudden started talking about what you were going to do today. 3. No... sorry I'm not a fan of vlogging in general and this doesn't really pertain to anything that I'm interested in. Which is something you should also try to focus on. You said you don't have a specific target audience. Well GUESS WHAT! That means that I'm a part of your target audience and you didn't grab my attention. SO! you should either figure out who you want your target audience to be or figure out how you can make a video that appeals to everyone... The uhh... second option is impossible btw... I'm basically saying figure out who your target audience is. 4. I think I gave a lot of suggestions already but here are a few more if you want them. I believe that building a brand is important so you should look into that. Actually that's it, I think I already said everything else above. Goodluck, vlogging is one of the more saturated markets on YouTube so you have to be really good at it to get noticed. There are some top notch vloggers that don't get that noticed. But if you work hard and persevere you can do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh. You've never written a review. Just do it brother. Start writing reviews and putting them up. They're going to be bad but you gotta get through your bad reviews to get to the good ones. And if they're not bad and you have a knack for it then you're all set. But things to help you along your way. 1. Take notes. FUCK! Take so many notes. (with time-stamps if your watching a movie) 2. Try to create a story when you're writing it. Not like a romeo and Juliet story more like a central theme the review revolves around. 3. Be hypercritical. I don't know if I should give this advice out but I find that most people are not critical about many things. I'm not like this at all. I can find something wrong in everything... (it makes me sad... I can never enjoy anything) but it works well for reviewing things. But I find that most people aren't like that. So just have a critical eye and if you find something that you don't like even a little jump on that. IF you aren't already like that. 4. I don't follow this because I'm a fool but find something that stands you out from the crowd. There's this good new review channel that has blown up called Girlfriend Reviews. And she has a whole shtick around her reviews. But especially in this day in YouTube you need that to get recognized. I saw some people acknowledge Angry Joe and Gameranx but those guys have been doing YouTube for a while and already amassed a following. You don't have the luxury of having started 9 years ago so you have to have a shtick. That's it. Good luck. Post your video on here so I can review. I'm HUNGRY FOR MORE VIDEOS TO REVIEW!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow this was nice. It felt like you guys have a little community of friends. That was really nice it made me feel all warm and fuzzy. NOW LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS WAS SHIT! I'm just joking. (Kinda... I don't like being mean)  #8203; Obviously, there are some things that can be improved. Just overall, the video seems a bit not well edited. Sorry, I understand that whoever edited this put a lot of time and effort into it but it just didn't turn out to well. FUCK! i'm such an asshole I'm sorry BUT! For example the beginning where everyone is being introduced. It looks like they added a blur effect to the asset before they added it into the composition making it have that weird black edge when it's blurred.  #8203; The 0:21 intro was pretty tight though. Has the smoke and reflection at the bottom. But there is no sound effect added to it. Sound is so so so important when you're making a video of any kind. That's one of the first things that most people skimp out on when it's literally more important than the video.  #8203; Also the transitions like the ones at 0:43 they just kind of look cheesy. There's this sort of effect when something is not well done it adds a feel of charm. This however doesn't hit that for me. I hate not being able to explain things and this is one of the things that I can't explain. Some things look bad but they feel good. This looks bad and feels bad. Maybe it's because I see some of the assets that were added where well made. But they're surrounded by bad animation and bad transitions and it feels like it's a disservice to whoever made your assets.  #8203; The flares that you have in the intro doesn't look good with the background. It looks tacky and cheesy.  #8203; I don't want to just rip on this video. I think that this video does achieve something that not most videos don't. I genuinely felt a sense of love and passion for the things you guys were doing. I felt like a real sense of community and it just sounded like you guys were having so much fun. And honestly it did make me want to watch your channel. I just think that it could be better if there was some tighter editing and animation around it as well as sound design.  #8203; Also the music. I feel like that song is EVERYWHERE! I hate that song. It just reminds me of shitty facebook life hack videos. But you definitely did achieve that feeling of community in this video and did a good job of explaining the different kinds of content that you offer. It was really nice. Like I'm not just saying that. It felt refreshing to watch a group of people just doing something that they like. MAYBE! this is just a thought. Hire someone to edit your channel trailer. Hey if you want I'll even do it for you for a discounted price. SHIT! this post just seems like an advert now. It was just a thought. But if you want DM. Hopefully you don't hate me after reading this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this trailer is definitely better technically but I like the new one better. It fits better with your channels style. The old one is not something I would want to watch. Maybe it's because I hate templates. I would rather watch a poorly mad custom video than a template. But yeah if you want to get in contact with me or someone I would definitely recommend that. Upwork is a good place to find people and fiverr. Fiverr is a bit less reputable but there's some decent people on there. And again... I'm avaliable too. Just saying... pick me... jk (not really I would really like to help you guys on your channel I want to see it succeed) but if you find someone better that you think could do a good trailer for you. You should definitely go for it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:31 - the wind 0:48 - Hahahaha that made me laugh. "oh sick" hahaha 1:09 - I think the delivery of that joke was off. 1:24 - The lighting is pretty off. It's so dark. Maybe investing in some lighting equipment or better utilizing the lighting that you have could help you. 1:27 - The audio cut out is weird. Like you can tell that it's two different shots. Also the song just cutting off is weird. You can fix this by recording background audio and placing that over the whole footage and taking away the background noise from each individual clip in post. 2:31 - I'm liking the skater guy a bit but I don't think the writing and delivery works to well with the scientist 2:52 - AHAHAHa. that was great. It just cut completely to a shot of a mixer but it was a computer. That got me. that was funny 3:18 - holy shit... that's crazy how'd you do that? Is your house actually flying off into space? 4:35 - I'm not really feeling this scene right here. 5:22 - I think that joke would've been better if you would've waited longer to do it and drawn less attention to it. That's like a tid bit joke. 6:28 - That got a smile out of me. If you would've kept it going maybe I would've laughed. 8:37 - That hand got me. That was funny. 9:15 - I feel like overall the cutting could be quicker. Maybe when you're recording keep in mind post production so you can add J cuts to make everything go smoother. 10:59 - Maybe the zero g part went on too long. 11:23 - That got me too. I'm really enjoying the editing being purposefully bad. I think that's really funny. 12:37 - Oh wow I wasn't expecting to see this again. 14:59 - I was waiting to see if something would come up but so far nothing. I don't get the music choice in this. Let me keep watching though and see if it ties into something 15:04 - Ok yeah no. I don't get that music choice it was pretty random. 16:10 - I laughed. I'm sorry I don't know what to say. I'm trying to write down my thoughts to better help you. But I think the best way to do that is for me to write down when I thought something was funny so you could examine it for yourself and see what worked and what didn't.  #8203; Overall, I thought it was pretty good actually. I think that when you're making content you have to have an understanding of what you can do and what you can't. I'm trying to say that there were some things that didn't work technically because it either looked bad or it was just off. BUT there were also other things that looked bad and sounded bad but were funny because it was bad. There was a funny bad and just a regular bad. I think if you leaned into the more meta funny bad production kind of humor you could do well.  #8203; Most of the jokes didn't land with me but some actually did and I did actually laugh out loud at certain points. I think that humor and jokes are so subjective that one person's opinion isn't really enough to know if it just wasn't funny. Well, actually you can tell if something is not funny. I think there were some part in this video that weren't funny because of either delivery or writing and it just wasn't funny. But there were other parts in the video that weren't funny to me specifically and I think differentiating those 2 is something that you have to get good at. A very useful and extremely hard thing to do is to look at your work from an outsiders perspective. It's hard because you worked on it and those are your friends and you had those memories of shooting it and the good times you had so most of it seemed funny to you. I'm just saying that, it's hard to do but that something that you should work on distinguishing between something being funny because of your involvement and funny because it was funny.  #8203; Humor is so hard to critique for me but there you go. I gave you some time stamps with my thoughts so you can go through that yourself if you find my thoughts of value. I'm not good at humor though and I've been told my sense of humor is really weird and off. Because I really like dumb super simple jokes. But I also like really complex, hard to understand jokes but not really anything in the middle. I thought it was enjoyable though. It made me laugh more than most other youtube videos even the popular one so overall I would say good job.</TEXT>

If you could be more specific with what kind of feedback you're looking for that would be helpful. Editing tips?

    <TEXT>YO! I am shook! This is literally me. I also make gaming news videos and take a lot of inspiration from Philip DeFranco! Are you me? Watching this made me realize all the mistakes that I am making in my videos and how I can improve. Definitely watching through I noticed that trailer footage is not engaging to watch. Unless, you are making a point to show something specific on the screen it's not engaging. Simply putting the same game that you're talking about on the screen isn't enough. I GET IT NOW! FUCK! I've been doing that all the time! I mean sometimes I try to put in little graphics and what not but IT'S NOT ENOUGH! Separation in news stories is also important. AND I SEE IT NOW! I just to want you to understand how much this has opened my eyes to my own content that I'm making. Oh my gosh we even have the same style of titling our videos. But separating when one news story starts and when one ends is important. Also you don't sound to comfortable reading off the script so maybe just that will come with time. I know I keep bringing this up but this is me. I can't believe how similar our content is. Okay, since I do make literally the same videos as you. (BTW I just put out a video that includes a topic you mentioned in this video). I'll leave like a little list of things that helped me. * Adding more graphics into the videos * Editing out the small little pauses in between talking * Making the intro shorter * Making sure your branding is consistent Sorry I just can't get over how similar our videos are. I'm gonna be so blunt right now and just say this because I'm lumping myself in this too. But I don't think that this kind of content is able to work to attract viewers if there isn't something added to it. I need to reevaluate my own content and see how I can add a twist to it. Luckily for you, you have just started doing this and you CAN make that quick turn. I have been making these kinds of videos for almost a year now and I think I'm going to have a harder time transition into something more.  #8203; Sounding monotone is a huge problem for me and that's something that I noticed in your video too. I think that just in general talking about all these news topics kind of gets you disinterested. To be honest, I don't play half of the games that I talk about in my videos and I do feel like I'm not interested when I'm making them. I hope you don't go down that road too.  #8203; I don't know how helpful this was to you. But this was very helpful to me. Overall, I think the video was a bit dry and boring mostly because of the lack of visuals your lack of enthusiasm in the recording. I don't know I don't want to be harsh but I feel like I can say this because I think I'm making the same mistakes and I'm definitely going to change things up after watching this video. Thank you very much for posting this it really opened up my eyes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So there is a way to get rid of ums in Adobe Audition. I don't know if you have Creative Cloud but in Audition if you import your footage. There is this effect called Delete Silence and it basically does what you're asking. There are some built in presets where you can delete only literal silence but you can also choose to delete anything below a certain threshold. Personally, I never use it because I find it to be a bit unreliable. Maybe that's because of my inflection when I speak but I just do it manually. Hope this helps. As far as I know.

    <TEXT>Mmmm. I'm unsure of what your looking for it's a 54 minute video. I think your talking about the green screen? So how I would do have a camera connect to my computer with me in front of a green screen. And then open up OBS and set up a scene to capture my screen and put my keyed out feed on top. Don't really even need to put it in an editor. And OBS is free! If you wanted to do this in an editor you just capture footage and screen separately and key out yourself and drop it on top of your screen footage. Same result but putting it in an editor takes longer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so this shot overall is just a slowed down shot. It looks like the eight red dots surrounding the upper third are all on one layer and they're just faded in and out really quickly. The dotted time line underneath the text looks like it's actually 2 images and you can see the cut they do at 2 seconds in. One is just the timeline and the other is a divided timeline. But you could probably make this in Photoshop or Illustrator whichever one is easier for you to use. The solid blue line underneath the text looks like it's just faded with the opacity and it has a crop animation from left to right. Again the six blue dots underneath the solid blue lines look like they're on their own layer just faded in and out quickly with the opacity setting. The dollar signs are just popped in one at a time. First the middle then the left then the right. And it looks like they just cut it out the same way. The actual text. I don't know if there's a preset for it already in After Effects but if there isn't. I would just key frame each individual letter's opacity with the desired effect you want. And lastly the bottom is just a flare. You could buy a pack of flares but AE has some built in flares. Just add a glow effect to it and maybe add a tint effect also to make it red and you're all set. I'm not to sure what effect you were specifically asking for in this post but I think I covered everything. If I didn't explain what you were looking for let me know</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Primm's Hood Cinema. Does movie reviews about black movies. He's pretty funny and entertaining. I also thought about Sophie and Joe. They are this couple channel that is kind of like H3H3 except British. Last year they were at 100 subs around there. Now they are at almost 4k subs. So I think in a year it will be even higher if they keep working on it. Also found this new youtuber named Chloe Lupi. She only posted 1 video so far but already has 58 subs. She's in a advantageous position because 1 She has a degree in game design. Which is pretty slim already compared to the amount of people that play games. And 2. She's a girl. So she can offer a different perspective on gaming because of both 1 and 2. They're a lot of girls that play games but not a lot of girls that play games that also have a degree in game design that are interested in making videos on youtube. That's very niche.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is just a first run. It is really messy. I had the artists performance on separate tracks so I could jump between them and pick the best ones. So each track was it's own performance. I was going to flatten it out and start adding effect and what not because right now it's really basic. But the finished product should only have the most I think 4 lines in use if that.</TEXT>

I still haven't implemented the B-roll since it was the first run but I'll be doing that now and then going through another pass fixing little things up and then a 3rd pass adding effects and then I think I should be done with the video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also just as a note. I don't use reddit on the daily maybe like twice a week. And I appreciate all the karma and especially the discussion that this has brought up. I think it's good to discuss organization in timeline as well as just in general when editing. Bins and folders and nest and sequences are all important to use when organizing. Second just wanted to explain a little further why I did it this way. The deadline was extremely short. 2 days I thought it would be quicker to toss everything in the timeline and cut where I wanted the cuts and then choose which shot I wanted. I've worked with multicam before for an interview and a corporate training video and I did think about using that function as well but I didn't, it came in my mind and left and I should've but didn't. Ultimately I do think this saved a bit of time since the base of the editing was pretty much done by the time I had selected which clips I wanted. However, multicamming would have definitely been faster. I think that's it. I'm still pretty new. This is the second music video I've done. And there wasn't any sort of idea given to me. They just gave me the footage and said "2 days" and slowly backed away into the shadows. So overall I felt like this was a good learning experience and I feel like I learned a good bit posting this here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright so reading through your post I think see you're concerned about why you're not getting views. So that's what I'm going to try to focus on here.  #8203; 0:13 - Wow that's pretty bold with a 13 second intro. That's pretty long brother. I wouldn't want to sit through that if I was just a random walking through. If you're not confident in your ability to make an intro, depending on how serious you are about it. You can hire someone to make you an intro or just add your text on black and just let it fade out. Simple isn't bad but ugly is bad.  #8203; 1:04 - There's this sense of stylistic dissonance. The music in the beginning made it seem like this was going to be a clip video of pop off moments. Then you go into some comedy. It doesn't work. It feels so awkward with the music and the actual content in the video. Also I feel like you missed some opportunities to make the content more engaging by not syncing up in game action with the music. I think that if you wanted to add comedy and action together like this. You should purposely juxtapose them and make it a point.  #8203; 2:36 - I didn't get the joke right there. I don't know what was funny. Maybe I missed something but I think it's just the fact that you guys were enjoying each other and you thought it was funny because it was you too. But from an outsider's perspective. It didn't really register. Kinda felt left out.  #8203; 3:37 - Again that's so awkward for me. You had this soft beat going and then out of nowhere you pop in this meme. I guess you can do that but you have to be consistent at least for that one sequence. If you're going to make a sequence funny make the whole thing funny not just that one moment.  #8203; 5:45 - That was so much dead time right there. Maybe there could've been a way to focus on the intensity of the moment but the way you had it now. It just felt like. BAM BAM 2 kills and then HAULT. For what? It killed the pacing. I could think of 2 things you could've done. Either emphasize what your teammates are saying to establish that this is a tense moment or just cut that part out. I could see that cutting that part out might have messed with the pacing a bit but this was so much worse.  #8203; 5:59 - Wait... yo are you serious. You didn't even let us see the finish of that fight? What? Why? It ended so abruptly. That's so weird. I don't get that choice.  #8203; Alright. so I can see a few reasons for why the views are coming in. Apex has been dying out already. There aren't that many people interested in it since some of the bigger twitch streamers stop streaming it. So I think you're going to have a bit of a harder time trying to capture the audience that is there. As far as the actual content. When you start editing a video you have to come up with a story. Every video tells a story and even highlights have to follow this same rule. You can't just put in random clips and expect it to work. I think there were some nice pop off moments and you could really use that for your advantage. Honestly, I don't find a lot of people funny. I didn't really think this was funny but that could be just a personal taste thing. I don't think so though. The jokes didn't land. Just putting in random memes I guess could appeal to some but it was implemented poorly. If you're having trouble juggling two different themes together just try focusing on one and make sure that, that part is good and then after a few videos once you have that down. Try implementing the other in a way that makes sense. Or you could do that from the get go. Making sure you video is cohesive is important.  #8203; That's the tips I can give you. If I were you I would honestly just focus on the actual gameplay and not try to go for comedy until your confident in it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. So I'm not to sure if you were going for the whole dead pan comedy thing. If you were you fucking nailed that shit. This was one of the funnies videos I've seen in a bit on this sub. Definitely though as everyone has said. Video and audio quality needs to be improved. The whole delivery with the jokes were so spot on. It's honestly really good. I don't know where you got timing but it's perfect. I study a lot of youtubers just to see why they work well. And one of my favorite fashion/beauty channels is Safiya Nygaard because there's personality behind it. I think you have that some aspect to you as well. Where, even if people are not into fashion, people can still enjoy your videos because of your personality. Again, video quality and audio quality are things that definitely need to be improved. The ending dance as someone mentioned here was a bit too long. And I was expecting it to kind of end in a joke it didn't so it seemed off. But other than that, it was very well performed. The editing was simple and good too. I think if you improve and lean more into your personality you'll definitely have a good size following.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YO! A Lookbook! I'm not into fashion but I like look books because it's not just about the clothes. (I know nothing about clothes btw, I wear the same shit everyday) Lookbooks are about showing off clothes. I think it's a bit of a difficult distinction to make but one of my favorite type of production are product shots. You can do so much with product shots and that's basically what a lookbook is. Just a series of product shots to show off a certain product in the best light possible. SO! even though I'm not into fashion I think I can defo help you out.  #8203; Alright so. Immediately, Location. Making sure that the background and the outfit match is important when you're trying to show off the product. Often times blank backgrounds can work with certain products. I don't think that's the case with clothes. Part of the appeal with showing off products is the idea of selling this sort of lifestyle. I understand that if you don't have someone to shoot with that it can be difficult to get some of these shots. But maybe putting up like a black tarp or some shit can help in this regard.  #8203; Again I know that shooting by yourself really limits things. And I think you did a good job getting different dynamic shots with the limitations that you had. Different angles and what not. That's really good so good job on that. I think maybe being a little more active movement wise could also help in this regard for the left side of the screen. Just trying to accentuate different parts of the outfit. Like you did with your boots on that close up shot. I thought that was really good.  #8203; So diversifying the backgrounds that you use in the video can be helpful. Execution wise I thought it was really good. Actually really good. The music choice was spot on for the outfit. I think the beginning text font was appropriate. I would say that maybe it lingered on too long. But I don't think you have to cut it short. It just felt longer because it was so quiet. Adding a little accent sound like... MMMM I actually don't know. The VHS insert sounds are really popular these days but I don't think that would fit with this video. But that's just an idea. The editing was so so so good. I am so happy to see some cut on the beat. It's such a small thing but adds so much to the video.  #8203; So lookbooks in general don't really have talking in them so I don't think that you're setting yourself at a disadvantage if you don't add it. Overall, it was pretty good. I know you said you don't want certain parts of your house in your video but finding someone to help shoot you would be really helpful and going out on the town doing activities would really up your video. You could make a day out of it. Just having fun doing random shit and shooting some of it. That's my advice I think you have a good foundation to make something great. Good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright so I watched the whole video. I think maybe you're focusing too much on the subtitles. You should take a look at the rest of your video. The game volume was so quiet whenever there was something being said in game I couldn't hear it but you were reacting to it. Usually if you have your game volume all the way down that means you're trying to carry the video with your comedy so calling to the in game comedy isn't the best move. But you are right about the subtitles. They were too low. Most of the time I didn't even notice that they were there because they were so low to the bottom of the screen.  #8203; I don't know you obviously, but it kind of felt like you were trying to force some jokes. I think just being genuinely yourself works out a lot better. Saying fuck, bitch, shit. Things like that don't really work on their own. I think they are good to add more to jokes but you need a comedic standing first. For example, as soon as the tentacles came out I was thinking. Please don't make a cheap hentai joke. And then you kinda did. I say kinda because you didn't even say it. And I didn't really get where the joke was going. I think maybe recording longer and cutting more and being more yourself would be the best course of action.  #8203; Me usually in games I am loud whenever I play with someone else because I try to entertain them. But I don't ever try to force anything. Whenever, I play by myself I'm really quiet so I find that a lot of times I don't say anything. So if I'm ever trying to make a gameplay video like this. I pretend I'm playing with someone and it makes it feel more natural for me. But that's how I am usually with friends. Talking to yourself can help also. It's a little weird but I find that it helps me whenever I'm trying to work on something like this. Like you said, you just have to get more comfortable recording yourself. Just go with the flow if you find that you're making less jokes that's fine. Usually that means that the ones you are making are better in quality. If you're thinking something just say it but don't try to force anything. Just making more videos helps. Just keep plugging away and you'll start to get better at it over time!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mmmm. Sorry brother, I don't know how old you are so I don't want to be too harsh with you. I would disagree with you that you are a good editor. Montages are a thing you don't have to have a script in order to make them. If you're making scripted content. Then I would recommend a script but montages aren't scripted content. I think your clips are good. I think whenever you are making as montage video the quality of the video depends on the quality of the editing and the clips themselves. I think that my clips are trash but I'm very confident in my editing to where I know that even if something doesn't look good I can make something good out of it. But I think that our videos are at the same level because your clips are actually good. And that supersedes good editing. But adding music and editing to the music will definitely help you out brother. Just check out some tutorials or just look at other people's montages for inspiration. I don't know what kind of editor you have but look into something more heavy. If you're using movie maker that won't take you very far in terms of editing montages. I would recommend looking into Hitfilm express or davinici resolve. Both of them are free software and heavy enough to do the kind of editing required for a montage. They're not full fledged editors but it's a good place to start learning.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Review Video] Breaking Down Effects in Music Video(Swearing)(Nudity)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-11 16:38:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello!  #8203; I've had this idea for a while now. I've been wanting to go through a music video and trying to explain all the effects and shots and what not in the video. So people could better understand how they did the things they did. I thought of this after looking through a sub where it was people literally just asking questions like. "How did they do this effect in \_\_\_\_ music video?". So the audience for this is people who are interested in either recreating the effects in the music videos or who are just curious about how the crew did some of the shots.  #8203; self review: I wanted to have a more laid back feel in this video but I think that, that kind of backfired. I didn't really explain myself well and used incorrect vernacular some times. Or a little bit more than sometimes. The raw footage for this was initially an hour long. I tried to use as many examples and explain what I meant as best I could. But I think that was bogged down a lot by the fact that thing were a bit incoherent at times. At other times, I think that maybe I just didn't explain myself well enough. I also think that there's this sort of assumed knowledge that might not be applicable to the people who don't know how things like this are done. Also, I know the video wasn't that polished. I didn't write a script and I sort of just winged it. I know what I'm talking about. I'm not concerned about my lack of knowledge just maybe not being able to get my point across well. But if I were to continue doing a video like this I would definitely take more time in making it look better and explaining points better. Points that I think I did nail. It was pretty... mmm I don't want to go as far as to say engaging. But it wasn't scary. It wasn't a video that when you clicked on it made you feel overwhelmed. My use of terminology was incorrect at times or just repetitive but I think that helped on the accessibility side.  #8203; Question: Did you learn something after watching this video? What were things that you felt you were still unclear about after watching the video? Are there any moments where you thought I did a good job at explaining my thoughts? Is this something that you would consider watching more if it were more polished?  #8203; [Video in Question](https://youtu.be/KGerb0RJTWA)  #8203; [Review 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/bz6t9l/review_video_graphic_violence_swearing/eqrrsov/?context=3)  #8203; [Review 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/bz5o0z/review_video_im_a_fashion_youtuber_and_i_would/eqrpe83/?context=3)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo get him involved! When you have someone supporting you that's a huge boon to your content. It makes a lot of sense that your in school for editing. When I watched the video that's the first thing I noticed. I was actually impressed it was a short video but it showed that there's an understanding of at least the fundamentals. I did notice one thing regarding the camera though. It wasn't a big deal so I wasn't going to mention it. At the last shot. The camera got put of focus for a few frames. I think it was at 0:56. But I would recommend putting your camera on manual and mess around with the settings. I don't know if your professors suggested this to you. But look into photography. It's not film or editing but it gets you really familiar with the camera and composition. You said you live in a weird city. That's really good. Maybe when your out on a shoot take the camera and try to look for good shots. Something someone told me when I was learning was that 80% of video is actually sound. That was one thing that I thought you were lacking in. In the video. Again I wasn't going to bring it up because that's like more advanced editing stuff that most youtubers don't really know how to implement. But building a library of accent sounds and Foley and knowing where to put those in video is important. I would experiment with that as well. Sorry I didn't mean for this to become a second review. But I think you do have a really good foundation and you just have to build off of that. Good luck</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Turn-Based" Doomfist Game (Doomfist Chess)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-15 08:22:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I made this game mode I like to call it Doomfist Chess. Basically, the only movement you have is your cool-downs. It's really fun if you do a 2v2 but I adjusted it so that you can play 5v5 after about 4 hours of testing it. The cool-downs are just long enough so in a 5v5 it isn't complete chaos but in a 2v2 it's not completely slow. 2v2 is Def the best way to play though. A lot of people that joined enjoyed it some didn't but most did. It's more about trying to bait out cool-downs and ult play is really really cool. You can bait people to you and ult on them if you know they don't have any cool-downs. There's a lot to this game. And in a 2v2 you can actually coordinate really good cooperative plays.  #8203; There are some minor things I couldn't figure out how to fix. Doomfist E doesn't work exactly how it does in vanilla. You can change your direction of E in air to land at a different spot. It's still very quick but you can abuse this if you fall off the map to get back on. And if you get uppercut-ted in just the right way during slam you can extend your E pretty far. Also when you're charging your Punch you can move. It's very minor movement but I feel like it adds a bit to the game. Because of some of this idiosyncrasy there are different mechanics you can learn. It's not super in-depth but I'll leave you guys to discover them if you want.  #8203; Original Old Workshop CODE: 5F2NX NEW "Easy" Doomfist CODE: WDYNZ NEW "Medium" Doomfist CODE: E952J NEW "HARD" Doomfist CODE: AVFZN  #8203; ~~Also if you guys are interested. I was thinking about ways to make it both more difficult and easier. Here's just what I thought of.~~ Edit: I have done a lot more play testing and have created a new more fun and balanced version of the medium build. The old isn't as fun and quick and after testing and survey people let me know that moving during ultimate is much better. So now both the Medium and Easy version allow for movement during ultimate. The list below is updated on the new builds.  #8203; Easier \- Shorter cooldowns \- movement during Ult \- ability to shoot \- inability to melee  #8203; Medium \- Balanced Cooldowns \- inability to melee \- movement during ult  #8203; Hard \- Longer cooldowns \- inability to melee \- No movement during ult  #8203; I don't necessarily think that they will be "easier" or "harder' but it will definitely be different styles of gameplay. The "easier" option being more chaotic. The "harder" version being more methodical and strategic. I think the medium strikes a nice middle ground. If you guys are interested in the other 2 forms let me know and I can take a crack at creating them.  #8203; EDIT: I appreciate everyone taking an interest in this. I left the old build in case some people wanted to try out the original but I wouldn't recommend it. The new ones are better. The "easy" is really hectic and not at all strategic but it's really fun and people enjoy it alot. The "Medium" strikes a balance between the 2 of them. The "Hard" is fun IMO but a lot of people would disagree. "Hard" gives more of the Chess vibe that I like where you actually have to think about what you're going to do and it's a lot slower. I like it but most won't fair warning. Appreciate you guys and thanks again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Professional Editor Looking to give feedback on your videos</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-11 07:14:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been editing videos for a long time. I think the rule to call yourself a pro is that you get paid for your work and I've worked as an editor for a YouTube channel getting an hourly wage as well as working on projects for other clients on my own as a freelancer. SO! I think I'm technically "Pro". I really enjoy giving feedback especially to people that genuinely want to improve so if you want SUPER in-depth critiques post your videos down below! Edit: Ok so it took me a while but I think I got to everyone. I hope my advice was helpful to you guys and I just did want to let everyone know. Like hey, I'm not infallible so if you really think something is work and I said it wasn't just continue. I'm just one person. I obviously don't think I'm wrong because I am myself and I wouldn't say something if I disagreed with it but I could be wrong and you could be right. But I do help my advice has helped you guys sorry to a few of you when I was starting to get worn out I didn't give the best advice or it was just really repetitive but I still think I gave a little feedback that was worth at least something. Again, I hope to see you all improve and to those like 3 I think that I saw that were making really good content. WTF are you guys doing why are you not uploading consistently, idiots. JK but not really because you make good stuff but no one is watching because the algorithm doesn't support inconsistent uploads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think that you suffer from this phenomenon that I have seen before. It doesn't just apply to people that make videos it something that everyone does in conversation and whatnot, where you believe that you and your friends are funnier than you actually are. I don't think this is a bad thing necessarily, you guys enjoy each others company and that's good but. As a piece of content to other people in the world. It's not funny because no one is invested in you as a person. I was just kind of watching a group of friends that I'm not apart of play a game. Actively thinking about the audience will help you out a lot. look back at your own video and imagine you're someone who doesn't know any of these people. And then cut out the parts that aren't funny. I don't like making these types of videos myself because i don't think I'm funny and I'm hyper aware of it. BUT if you actively while recording make the decision to be funny to not just yourself and your group of friends but to an audience you can get better stuff. Right now, I don't feel like watching the video because I just don't think it's funny.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok first off! the beginning image was random AF. Like you don't even have a logo with it. Not even your name underneath the swords or something. Second I think that you have a good background but the thing that kills it is the fact that you can see behind the background a little bit. Because it's not perpendicular to the background. If you raise your tripod a bit and tilt it a little down you won't see past your backdrop. You might have to move it it a little closer as well. I'm currently at :30 can I am desperately in need of SOME B-ROLL. If you don't know what B-roll is. It's basically a second shot where you cut to. You can also call them insert shots because you calling attention to the thing that your talking about but that's more for narrative work. Setup a place and nicely decorate it and just get footage of the sword. and if you know what pieces of the sword you're going to be talking about. Write it down and make a shot list. GOD i'm at :51 YOU NEED B-ROLL! It would boost your quality so much. You sound like you know what you're talking about but just holding up the weapons isn't enough. :58 AHHH! WTF where did this come from. Why weren't you adding in B-Roll before. OK. So you got the idea of B-roll which is actually really good. I thought you weren't going to show anything but at least you have this basic idea down. However, They aren't done in the most effective way. The shots look like stills. They probably are but when you're showing B-Roll of something you want some movement either on screen or with the camera. The camera would be the best choice so you can move around a certain position of the sword so you can emphasize what your talking about. The shots right now are too static. Look up MKBHD and his use of B-roll. You will notice that ALMOST 100% of the time either something on screen is moving or the camera itself is moving. Also lighting is an issue. Lighting takes a long time to learn but practice it. Go to home depot and get some simple lights that aren't to expensive and see what you can do with it. Yeah those are the things I would work on for your video. Let me know how it goes I would like to see what you can do because it does seem like your very knowledgeable. I'm getting a lot of responses so I'm just trying to get to as many as I can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I don't know if this effect that you're doing to the video is an effect or if it's just the camera. If it's an effect KNOCK IT OFF! Jk but seriously though it doesn't look good. If it's the camera well damn get a new camera. I think it's a nice video for you and sister. You guys are getting along having fun and whatnot. It's not entertaining for the audience. I could give you advice but it just really depends on your goals of what you want to accomplish. I don't think that you need to change anything if you and your sister are just enjoying making videos. But right now, the stories aren't that entertaining and the concept can work if you were to play it up. Realize that there is a camera in front of you. I've made this point before but making a concerted effort to be funny or entertaining is important. You can't just turn on the camera and expect things to turn out good. Plan something or improv something. If you look up GMM they put themselves in situations where they are in pain in some way and they AMP that up for the camera because it's funny</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what Facetune is. Ok I was so confused in the beginning because you didn't lead with what facetune was. you saying it's a big danger to our society WHat is it. lead with the explanation of the subject and then explain why that said subject is an issue. It was only a few seconds and then you did start explaining but i was confused before you did. OK i'm currently at :52. If you don't show an example of this app during this video. You've failed let's continue and see. 1:37 you're spending so much time explaining what the app is without showing it. and still have not gotten to why it's an issue. Ok so you just started about why it's an issue almost halfway through the video and I get that this app is a part of the issue. But it's strange that you singled this app out when it's like an industry wide thing in the media. Editing wise, the audio quality is poor. All the videos I've reviewed so far the audio has been poor. And the vibe that I get from your setting is not the same as what you're talking about. You're just talking about your issue. you're setting seems like you would be talking about your life or something personal and it doesn't really connect with everything else in the video. Ok what. I'm watching the new video now. How can both of these videos be on the same channel. They're nothing alike. I thought you would be talking about social issues and technology. I think you should first focus on what you're trying to talk about and then you can worry about actual production. Pre-production is important. Have an idea have a plan have a niche.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I haven't started watching the video yet but I can already answer one question you got. Where to source music and sound. Artlist, Epidemic sounds. There's a bunch. I personally use Epidemic and I've bought a few Sound effects packs. They are royalty free. Just as a little note to anyone who might be reading this. Royalty free doesn't mean free. Also visual effects you don't want to source. you just kinda make those yourself. OK so you don't have an intro you didn't introduce what you're doing. So it's just kind of confusing what this video is about. I get it your playing some game and things are happening I don't really understand. ok so I was going to save this for the end but I actually do play OW a lot. even still in the beginning I wasn't to sure what was going on and I think it would help a lot if you could explain that. Also, I didn't find it funny. the captions helped but I don't think you should be worried about editing more focus on the actual content right now. It's not that entertaining. Maybe if you had someone to bounce off of that would help you. Right now it's just like watching someone play a game. It doesn't really have any appeal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK! so it's good. The only thing is. It's a video game. But you do have the eye for it. There have been plenty of successful people doing what you're doing right now with real life. I don't know how many people are interested at looking at landscapes inside a video game. If you transitioned into the real world a lot of people would be into this. There was this one fantastic movie.... fuck I forgot what it was called. I think it was called something like Lights or something like that but it was literally just this landscape and model shots with movement. Again there's a market for this but not in video games from what I've seen. Maybe you could be the first one to do this. Maybe you could make something out of this because you composition is really good. Movment is really good. MUSIC choice my god. it's all good. I would say keep going with it see where it goes. And if not you should look into getting into the industry as a cinematographer. You're not like perfect but you have a really good fundamental understanding of composition and lighting and movement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo WOW I was not expecting something like this from someone your age. Damn brother. You've made a script and everything this is really good. Ok let me reiterate that. It's not good. BUT you're on a good road to get better. Keep making videos. Look into Voice Over tips because you're delivery is flat. But if you continue to make videos especially in this SUPER niche market you can get there. There's this saying it goes like "In order to get to your good stuff you have to pass through your bad stuff first." That's where you are in this process. You're still making bad stuff but it's fine because you're in the learning process. So some tips.  #8203; Continuing to create your own scripts is great you just have to work on your delivery. The banners a bit to much but you should look into Motion graphic design. Hey listen I'm not saying to pirate anything. BUT i mean we've all kind of pirated stuff in the past and maybe you can't afford something right now but I'm not saying to pirate. I'm just saying you should look into After effects to get better assets in your video. If you continue to add more photos and videos in your videos that will really help emphasize the things that you're talking about. But you're doing really good just starting out. Keep doing it brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look into different types of text. These are kinda ugly. This is really good. I'm going to do something for you because I don't know how to exactly help you. I've been foloowing this guy called ColdFusionTV since he was at about 100 subs. Take a look at his channel he has almost 2 million now. But the reason why I'm bringing him up is because you both make very similar content. Study this guy and you can imporove yourself. One thing I've noticed off the bat he uses a lot more videos not just still in his content. But your editing is good. There's a good foundation. Learn about easing and look more into fonts and try to find some really good stock footage and I think you'll be set. Also improving mic quality would be important to if you wanted to get serious but I don't think you should invest anything until you have a projection of making money somehow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh shit a cooking video. OH SHIT! I've ran a restaurant before not the KM but the GM so I'm not like super familiar with cooking more like the actual running of the restaurant so I'm excited. OK so I'm like at 2:44 right now. I think the video is funny. The cutaways are really helping you out. Your audio quality is really poor however. Most people nowadays have smart phones. You could've hid it somewhere nearby and gotten better audio. In camera mic is horrible. If I were you I imagine there's a bookcase to the right of the TV. I would've scooted up a bit more and hid my phone next the books and got my audio from there. 3:04 wow is this your footage. It better be don't lie to me. MMM ok before we started mixing ingredients I would shown a mise en place first so the viewere has a better understanding of what they need. 3:59 hahaha ok I wasn't expecting that. I think you're in a weird area right now where the footage is kinda ok looking but then you put stuff in like that and they don't really play off each other really well. There's this one guy that I was talking to about his channel where I made a comment saying that his videos didn't look good at all but in a charming way. Your kind of in the same situation but your videos don't look bad enough to be charming. I would either go higher or lower in quality right now because now it's just in this weird place it's not bad looking enough to be charming and I think that's the style that you're going for. Also I just feel like you're a bit to close to everything. Back up give us some room to breathe. If you want to get closer for glamour shots that's fine but don't make that your default. 5:25 God everything is so close wtf move back please PLEASE! Also the music choice. I don't think it was a good fit for the video. I think it would've been fine for like a fashion video or something else but it doesn't really fit with cooking IMO. God you're so close to everything just back up a bit please. PLEASE I felt like I was getting suffocated the whole video. Other than that I think the pacing was a bit to slow. I don't know if you were trying to hit that 10 minute mark but if you were I'm sure there's other ways you could've hit it. I think the product shots were good. But the process of making the food was so slow. Cut things down more to make the pacing go by quicker. Also the VO was better but if you plan on doing an intro like that again you should focus on improving that audio quality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I think the video is fine for what it is. If you're unhappy with your delivery just do another take. Do as many takes as you want there's no one where pressuring you to finish the video quicker I assume. Just try to get the best take possible. Also I do see that you're looking down at something. At either like a script or notes. That's fine but try not to have those takes where you're looking down in the video. Information videos like this are going to be a little dry but try to condense as much as you can as quick as possible .if you're worried about retention time being to low. Or try adding something entertaining I don't know jokes. actually probably not jokes. if you're not naturally funny it's hard to add that in and I wouldn't recommend or like little facts or something. I did feel it was a bit to slow but that's because it's not something that I'm interested in and maybe you could've gotten to your points faster.</TEXT>

It was fine to look at. But it didn't really set up a good story i don't think. It was just kinda you running around and adding hair to mobs. Try to create a cohesive story in there somewhere. I'm not saying to talk just like. Show a scenario and let us follow it. Also just a thought if you showed a clip of someone doing that water thing at the end and like made it black and white and then cut it to you dying that would've been funnier for people who haven't seen that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok you said feedback on your editing specifically so I can do that for you. But i feel like most people are in need of actual content help rather than editing help but I'll stick to editing since you asked. :03 - don't like the text or the effect of it spreading. :05 - Don't know if the bars are part of intro but I would recommend taking those off. Also it lasted maybe like a quarter second to long if you did want to keep those in. 0:57 - You cut that clip way to late. You can hear you start to say 3 and then the cut. 2:47 - Again brother. with the cutting to late. If you got yourself talking to early just do another take. 4:39 - I get the flash is a joke but I wouldn't stop the video to see what it said. I'm not a fan of things like that. ok I think i've seen enough. There isn't really much here in terms of editing issues. hiccups and whatnot that shouldn't be there but you can just fix those easily. I would probably add music or something because it's so quiet the way it is right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whoa music too loud already JESUS first thing and I'm already deaf. YO SICK! oil toss GOD that was really good. Weird black screen for like 1 frame when you spin the honing steel. BUT THESE SHOTS ARE REALLY GOOD. The transitions between them not so much. It puts too much focus on the transitions rather than the actual shots of your actions which are more important. Sometimes a simple cut is good enough. I think this is one of those times you already got 2 really nice shots. And I'm not a fan of that lens flare. Ew ugly. wow nice you showed your ingredients. Also I think you're talking but all I can hear is just \*MUSIC\*. Like I see your lips are moving but I don't know what you're saying. God you're looking into my soul. It's ok you don't have to look into the camera at all times. 4:26 - WHAT!.... OH YEAH I LIKE THIS SONG TOO!.... I SAID I LIKE THIS SONG TOO! (get it cause we're in a bar and i can't hear what your saying because the music is too loud) Damn those saran wrap skills man that's tight. I just wish you weren't looking into my soul and judging me whenever you did it. 5:45 - YEAH! I AM A FAN OF JACK AND COKE! Also along with the music being too loud. Sometimes I actually literally can't hear you. The music choice is really way off IMO. ok TBH I think out of everyone I've looked at so far you're the closest one to a really good finished product. Things holding you back the music. Wrong music and way too loud. Your audio quality poor. Look into a lav mic. Lighting is also poor everything is so flat and boring looking as well as the colors. You can color grade to make things pop.</TEXT>

Taking it seriously is hard and most times there isn't a return. I'm not saying like the return is small I'm saying if you continue most likely you won't get ANYTHING out of it and you'll just end up wasting time and money.

    <TEXT>The channel that I worked for was a list channel so. God I hate these kinds of videos. I've edited so many but off the bat. People don't really care about the content of the list they just enjoy the process of the numbers counting down it's so shallow. But something that is important are the title cards of the numbers. That is super important for list videos. Your number cards are boring. The text is... I'm not a fan. I feel like this is a consistent issue with people I've looked at. Look more into fonts. 3:10 - honestly I agree with the cat. meow indeed. The pacing is too slow. List are supposed to go by quick. Also there's like no music. Or background noise. whenever you just hear talking it just feels like your listening to a lecture and it's hard to pay attention. I've done so many list videos so I hate them now. But they call to a basic part of the human. It's just a dopamine hit. You just want to get to the next number so you can see the numbers count down. This pacing is way to slow for that. And it's too much like a lecture to be entertaining. the pauses in your voice your delivery is just to slow. Also the background is rather bland. Spruce it up. get some more posters. Make it look nice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ok that was werid insert shot of the tags and guitar pick. I mean it looked nice but it was just in such a random spot of the video. I thought it was ending I had to look at the time to make sure the video wasn't a 1:20 long video. I do like the colors in the background. The router or modem whatever it is just adds a nice little blinking light its really good it fills out the back without being to obnoxious. I do like the b-roll shots just the first one saying to subscribe felt like a weird call to action to cut away to at the beginning of the video. They are good shots though and I appreciate that you put them in a lull in the song. That's well done. 2:42 - Uhhhh. I think that effect could've been done better. It was ok but it didn't really capture what you were trying to do. Get that zoom out effect that you wanted it was too stilted. Just exaggerating a few things like the lens distortion. I watched it back in slow mo and I think you just kind of did this fade with a motion zoom. Adding some other effect to emphasize it would've been good. It looks to plain right now. 4:03 - I KNEW IT. There was something not right with that transition. The logo goes out of frame of the red for like 1 frame. It's not like super noticeable but watching it at full speed I felt something was off about it so it will be noticeable. Also I didn't notice the Logo doing the Venetian blinds disappearing but i think it would be cleaner if you just let it be masked away with the red square. and maybe add a little more easing to the logo so it doesn't just abruptly stop like the way it does. Ok, so I mentioned to someone before you that they were the closest one to a really good finished product. That's now you. You're almost there. And it's just a few things. Technically you know what you're doing except for a few hiccups. I think it's just issues with placements of certain things and small animation decisions. But you have good lighting your grading is really well done. and composition is good. Just work on those few things and you'll get there. One thing that I would change about the ending. I think you have a very calming presence but I don't know how to say this without sounding negative. Whenever you're making a video you kind of have to put yourself on a pedestal and you shouldn't be asking people for feedback IN your actual video. Outside in a forum like this is fine. You should be confident in your end result even if it's not good. This is good though. And you should more not ask for acceptance from the audience. Not be rude to them but not talk to them like you're on the same level. You're the one that made this video and it does have value. Let them know what the value is like you did and tell them they should share and like and subscribe because of that value that this video has. But that's minor and some might disagree with that. but it was a good video.

    <TEXT>Music is too loud. AHH GOODDDDD I can't keep looking at this the intro the animation everything GOD! you literally just put a picture of a subscribe button with a little hand without animating it. NO! NO! The source on the bottom left is way too noticeable. You can make it transparent so it doesn't interfere with the video. The TEXT! AGAIN! you don't have to add this blue/red distortation effect. If you do just for like a second not for the whole time the text is UP! COMEON!!! 3:13 - god I remember that. I was working with mobile phones during that time and it made it hell for me at work. "But why do I have to give back my note 7 I like it" well do you want to fucking die? good joke though I liked it. Ok I think I got enough from the video. The music choice again like most people I don't think it fits your video. It sounds like something on a cooking channel. And the people with actual cooking channels have like tech music in the background. Like YO! You guys should talk to each other and trade your music. The pacing was a little slow. Delivering your information quicker would be better. I like your set design though. If that lamp on the left was a different color the light itself that would be really good probably like a yellow or red because that's the color of the ducks or actually something different since they are yellow and red but you have a lot of nice little knickknacks and that's good. But yeah ok job don't overdo the effects with the text and see about changing your intro. Clean is nice especially for tech.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok ok ok ok. So far. I think you guys have a lot of good things going for you. The chemistry you guys have is GOOD and actually funny. God that's so refreshing. I think the music is a bit too loud and I'm not a big fan of the intro but those things can be fixed. OK so you guys only have one camera from what it looks like but if plan the shoot and make some shot lists of the shots that you need I think that would be really helpful. You have the personality you just have to put in the time to create a good video. Back and forth is good the jokes are good. Everything is good BUT video wise everything is bad. BUT! that's a good place to be because that's all just technical stuff. It's a lot easier to fix technical issues than to actually fix personality issues which is the case for most people. yeah really just taking this 1 step at a time. I think the most important thing right now for you guys is first learning to work with a shot list. Second would be getting better audio. Lav Mics or something. 3rd would be focusing on lighting but that's a lot more in-depth and cost some money if you're trying to get really nice lighting. And that intro is bad I would fix that whenever you get a chance. I think the idea of having both of you the focus in the intro is good the execution was bad. And the intro slate itself. ew. sorry but ew. It's not even the SAME ASPECT RATIO AS THE VIDEO! come on : lt; . It makes me sad when I look at it. I would enjoy watching you guys and I actually do want to subscribe. I'll be taking a look and seeing if you guys improve. If not... fuck me I guess but I want to see you guys get better.</TEXT>

It's just kinda look what happened here. Some funny things do happen but your guy's reaction just kind of kills it. It feels like something happens and everyone is whatever. And it brings the energy of the entire video. down. Editing is hard on that platform but I don't think that was the main issue. it's just the reactions and everything being so stale.

I don't play league of legends so the whole video I didn't know what was going on but you don't need to know what's going on to understand pacing and delivery. It was good. I think if you keep making these videos you'll continue to do well. with how long you've been doing this and the inconsistency of your uploads your subs aren't bad.

    <TEXT>Ok I the thing that I've noticed people that do gameplay videos make the consistent issue with is not creating a story. It doesn't have to be a good story or anything it just has to be cohesive. There has to be a running theme if not for the whole video just for a part of it and then you can transition into another story. And I think saying it like that makes it misleading. if sort by new and take a look at the video below. He made a league of legends video but there was a story behind it. It was comparing it to spongebob square pants. Does it make sense? No. but it was still a story and he executed it well. And after that he transitioned into another story about how someone was throwing his game. I don't understand any of it but I could still follow along with the video because there was something to follow along to. Even if it's just a montage video of you getting SICK KILLS. That's your story. It's "I'm good at this game look how good I am" that's that story. But this video is so cohesive there's nothing to follow. The music doesn't change with the situation it's just kind of clip after clip with nothing connecting them. It's not even funny like there's nothing connecting everything together. I would focus on that trying to find a story in the footage and creating it after the fact. That's something you dont' have to actively think about while recording but it is something you have to think about while editing.</TEXT>

Maybe I don't know the video hasn't even started yet. give me something of value first and then I'll think about contributing to your channel. Ok I'm not going to be to harsh on you for not explaining what VIPkid is because if someone is on this video they would already know what it is. Let me look it up real quick. Ok so I watched the whole thing. I think the title was accurate you did you step by step and you showed a lot of information to better help the applicant succeed. it's a fine video for what it is. You're not going to reach everyone because not everyone is interested in doing this program but it was fine. Informative videos I don't think to be fantastic looking unless your going for funecation kind of content. but this was just mostly information which is fine. It's fine it's a fine video.</TEXT>

Not really you shouldn't do that. you should write something down. There's a lot of you repeating yourself. Your energy is so low. I understand that you're not saying anything like exciting but you should show more of your own personality and not have such a monotone delivery. There's a lot of motivational speakers that talk about similar things that you're talking about. I think you should study up on some motivational speakers to better improve. Marie Forleo is a good youtube that does motivational speaking. She also brands herself really well and her delivery is good. Also get rid of that white background. Find some place else you can record. it's just so bland you have to liven everything up. Everything right now just seems so stilted and quiet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would have to disagree with you. I think understanding the person speaking is very important. I don't know how to help you. Maybe this is good maybe it's bad. I literally don't know it's based on the content. I've seen some videos that have really terrible editing with bad video quality that are great because the person making the video was just really funny and the low quality video fit so well with their type of humor. This one female had this amazing deadpan comedy routine that was executed so well because of the low quality video. If the video was better shot and better equipped it would've been a worse video.

It should be funny to other people not just to the people involved. I'm not a big fan of these kinds of videos. I just don't find them funny but you did a really good job with the editing knowing when to cut and keeping that cohesive story throughout even though it was with different people. This is good. I'm not a fan but it was a well done video. Good job.</TEXT>

OK so there's not much in terms of editing that I think you can change. Your audio being quiet was only for the beginning. I think you're personality and the editing is good. I'm not a big fan of this kind of content but for the people do are I think a lot of people would be entertained by this. I just don't personally enjoy gameplay videos. But yeah you were entertaining enough and didn't just go "Oh i died again" you added commentary and little effects it was good. sorry if i'm repeating myself it's just I don't really know what to say with videos like this.

Just your energy is a bit low and it's difficult to watch because of your delivery at times. It's really all I can give you. Delivery.

    <TEXT>uhhh. That's an interesting choice adding the folly sound to you putting down the objects. I would've just let it be the original sound and did that quick cut that people do. I think I get what you were trying to do but your cutting was WAY to slow. You just want to capture the audio and quickly cut like 1/3 of a second if that. Actually you know what I think I can edit this just to see if what i think you were doing is what you were doing. Here. hold on. I realize now that you can't tell time when reading a message but just know I'm about to go and edit this part for you. Ok, i'm back. I didn't do the whole video. but I did do the beginning portion and just doing it. The video's pacing is too slow. I didn't work on it too long but I cut off a lot of bit that I thought were unnecessary. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49d7ZzLOvxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49d7ZzLOvxg) Keep the cutting tighter and don't focus too much on people's reaction. You don't have to be super funny just give your reaction and don't slow things down unless it's like really really funny. but that doesn't happen often.</TEXT>

Also I feel like a lot of the visual aides your using aren't that helpful to your talking points. You also sound really bored while making this video like you don't want to be making it.

    <TEXT>the music is fine i think. I don't know I feel like I've seen this kind of stuff before. The addition of the particle system on the left is a bit weird. It just kind of looks like white stuff shooting out on the screen. The soundwave doesn't seem to be reacting that much to any other input besides the base maybe you could differentiate the bottom wave and the middle one. The picture in the back bouncing to the beat also seems a bit redundant with the audio waves also matching the beat. Like why isn't the treble being picked up by the waves. I don't use AE a lot just because I deal mostly with editing but I made one of these audio waves before and I remember being able to exclude different frequencies pretty easily. I think you should look into that. If you want to keep that particle system. I would recommend making the velocity lower and maybe making the gravity lower as well and making the lifecycle longer.</TEXT>

If you're just looking to improve your editing. That's fine. Work more on the editing aspect. You just had a few cuts and put 4 screens at the same time. try to do cool stuff with it and experiment with the footage.

The production value is really high but is killed by the lack of decent lighting. Everything is just flat and just seems like you lit up the scene with the lights installed at your house. I can obviously see that's not the case in some of these shots but... I mean you get my point right? The set design seems like it's good but the colors seems muted. I don't know if ti's too late to change that but everything looks so dull. I think the best fix would to just color grade in post. The pacing of the video was a little slow. I would work on trying to make things a bit tighter. But I think you have a good understanding of your content and a strong basis just a few things holding you back.</TEXT>

You have to cut it down so much. Whoa 4 minutes in and we're talking about it! Seriously though, I think it's important to make your point and move on. And if you're going to talk about the changes in genres of movies as a whole through history you can make that it's own separate video. You can bring it up but it shouldn't take 4 minutes to get to the meat of the video. I think I came into this video expecting one thing and no w I'm like 6 minutes into it and I don't think that you're actually going to be talking about the movie. I think you're talking about the impacts that the movie makes or is trying to make. I'm not too sure what the point of the video is but the video doesn't seem to be what I thought it was. It's fine but I think you have to work on your titles. OK i'm at like 10:37 and it's a good video. It's really well thought out and researched. I haven't seen the movie so I can't really comment on the specifics of what you're saying but I do see you put a lot of effort and I would continue watching if I've seen the movie.

Just get like a mic and put it in front of your face so you can capture the best audio. 1:05 What are these edits. You can't just make something funny by adding a mirror effect. There has to be a structure and editing just extenuates what's already there. I don't understand the satirical part of the video. what aspect are you making fun of. The Primitive Technology people? Or the exorbitant Cribs people. Right now it just kind of seems like you're just saying hey this exists and I'm here in the woods calling these sticks and branches my crib. Where's the satirical element in it? I don't know if the video made sense. The "awkward" part of the video was pretty awkward but it wasn't funny. It was just like.

    <TEXT>Vlogging is one of the types of content on youtube that I am not really into. I don't know much about it. I used to watch like 1 person back in like 2009 but I haven't watched them since like 2011 and I don't know if they make videos anymore. But the reason I watched them was because they were trying to be entertaining and brought something to the video. I'm gonna go ahead and watch this and see what I can give you but I don't know if I can be much help. Yo ok so from 1:13 - 2:15 it was just a montage of you driving in a car. So the point of these kinds of sequences is to make the audience understand that hey time is passing and I'm moving to a new location. You don't need that to take up over a minute of the video. If you have really good footage like drone shots or something maybe 45 seconds TOPS if you do have the really amazing footage. And the montage should end once you have arrived so you can continue with the video. I've only seen a few seconds afterwards but the montage should not continue into you exploring six flags. 2:32 this shouldn't be a thing. You have to create a break in order to differentiate the 2 different montages. Wha? You didn't show or explain anything in the video. It was just clips with music over it wha? Damn and you had the perfect opportunity to at the very least have the vehicle going in the other direction to indicate your returning to where you came from and getting that closure for the video. That's a bit disappointing. Video needs some work but you said it's your first one. Just focus on trying to explain what you're doing and if you're just going to do shots after shots they have to be really well composed and thought out shots. It can't just be you with your camera in your can walking on the street.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1:06 - that's one of my pet peeves I hate when people slow down footage. It not funny IMO and listening to someone say the same thing again slower doesn't bring out anything. Unless they said something that relates to something they did. You should repeat back something someone says. Like if someone goes like Ew I hate apples and then later you catch them eating an apple. BOOM there you go you can repeat that BUT just doing it because they said something 'funny" i'm not a fan of that. So, I'm not a fan of this kind of comedy. I don't find it funny. It's not bad for a first time editor. You understand timing somewhat but you need to add some filler to allow time for the audience to relax after a joke. Maybe explain what you're looking for exactly or something I don't know. I feel like the longer I do these reviews the less and less helpful I become. I've been doing this for like 6 straight hours I apologize.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's not a lot of commentary on your part you're just sort of explaining what going on in the video .i think you should focus on bringin more humor into the commentary instead of just that explanation. Also I just don't really understand why you're cutting between gameplay footage and yourself. If you want to add footage of yourself that's good but the gameplay footage I don't think it really fits with what's being said.</TEXT>

Like I understand that you were trying to get a good shot or whatever but it made everyone feel so stilted. Just let people react the way they wanted to react.

    <TEXT>There's this thing called dead air that you don't want to have in your video unless it to make something for or emphasize something. If you're not talking and nothing is going on, on screen just cut that part out. Ok so what is the point of this video is it to inform the person on how this game is played? is it to entertain the audience. If it's to entertain you're not really giving much of anything. But if it's to inform still your not giving a lot of information. It's just you reading what the game just told you. There doesn't seem to be a purpose to this. Find that purpose before you start recording and then keep that in mind while filming.</TEXT>

I'm not a fan of the font choice you used and the pacing is too slow to be funny. Like I understand the things you were putting on screen were supposed to be funny. It was just taking too long to get the punchline. and when you did get there it landed flat too many times because the editing was tight enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I think that you have a nice structure to your video. You talked about what Love Island is. I've never heard of this so, it's really helpful. I think you need to make yourself more concise and get quicker to the point. Also I noticed your editing you cut a lot of words off. That's ok if you're doing it for a comedic purpose. You weren't though. Just chill if you slur your words with the next word just do that take again. Be aware of how you're sounding while making the video. You're energy is also really low. Bring some more of your personality to it. Don't have such a monotone voice. add some inflections into the words you're saying where appropriate. That's the first thing I would work on with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so, the advice i give for people looking through this is based on what I see needs to be addressed first. I'm a lot more nitpicky on videos that have a solid base because the fundamentals are all there so I go into the small things that could be fixed to make it better. This is one of those videos so there's still issues but they're more minor because there is already a solid base. I just wanted to explain that so when people see longer responses that usually means the video is better and I can go into more detail of the issues because there are less of them. Your guys delivery is almost there. It was a little flat but only just and it made the video in the beginning feel like it was going by slow. Maybe the editing could've been tighter as well in the beginning but I think that just doing that take again and speaking a little faster or with more energy would have been better. :42 - Wow and L- cut. That was nice I wasn't expecting that. 1:38 - I like the idea of this slow mo shot but it wasn't done too well. If you use Premiere you could've changed it from Frame Blend to Optical flow and it most likely would've given you better result. Ok so the beginning sequence of events were a little difficult to follow. I think overall the editing on the video could've been a little tired and I don't know how long you've been doing this but especially in the beginning it felt like you weren't that comfortable in front of the camera. I think just making more videos will help with the comfort. But if you color code your footage in Premiere into the different sequences I think that will help you create a more concise story. Also the ADR bit was a bit I don't know unnecessary. Maybe if it wasn't so noticeable that it was ADR I would've not commented on it but it was very noticeable that it was ADR and it just left me thinking. Why did he put that in there. Overall good job just small improvements, tigther editing and getting to feel more comfortable in front of the camera.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok so I'm not interested in these kinds of videos but I do feel I can give you some feedback still. You never really introduced the video. It's happening now watch it kind of thing. Give a brief explainer of what is going on. Before you actually start recording the event go by each obstacle and explain what it is and why it's difficult or something like that. I don't understand how difficult or the importance of something if you don't tell or show me. Or if you don't want to do that adding some VO over what's going on to explain could be maybe just as good. Right now I'm just not to invested and I don't understand what's going on it just a car driving over some rocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>:31 - "I'll start to intro this for the video" Wth why was anything before this included. 1:13 - One thing that I dislike with people who are just starting to make videos is when they comment on their video itself. like the quality of the video or how they are doing presenting information. That's not important. Unless you're teaching a course of video creation you shouldn't be talking about your video. Even then you probably shouldn't talk about the video you're making right now unless it's for a small example. You could bring someone else in that exemplifies the point you're trying to make even better. BUT you're not making a video about video creation you're making it about mario maker. Put some actual effort into the editing and don't leave parts like the beginning in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The background is so bland for what the video is. It's meant to be a kids channel correct? Add more colors something because standing in front of a blank background doesn't keep many adults attention it most likely won't keep kids attention. I think, ironically, set design is most important in children's media because there is very little else that can keep a childs attention. If they see bland colors and monochromatic sets they're not going to be that interested. A lot of people don't address this issue in they're videos and I think they should address other issues first before they get to that myself but with kids I think it's really important and before you move on from improving your editing and effects and what not i think set design should be the first thing you should focus on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope wrong already, you can't choose that type of music and then just go into a "Hey everybody" music is so important to the video making process. Like most people don't understand sound is probably more important than what's actually on screen. And if you choose that kind of music and get that tonal shift to. "Hey everybody" like you weren't just playing some depressing ass/ horror music you're doing a disservice to your video's tone. Ok so I have no idea what's going on because this is a series obviously. But maybe you can explain what's going on first and the move on for anyone that is just jumping in right now. Also you're commentary on the situation just boils down to "I don't know what's going on and I don't know what to do" which isn't that entertaining. Bring something to the situation make a joke out of something. Just explaining what's going on isn't entertaining.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sound effects are too loud. It sounds like you're trying to make that the main focus. Just lower it down a bit. I think that for people that are interested in this game you're very knowledgeable and get straight to the point. I like that but you should focus on branding yourself as well. Get an intro or something to brand yourself better. The video effects themselves I'm not a fan of. If you can't make good art yourself try to find something better. Also the animation on the things popping in I don't think are that well done. Easing can make a lot of things look better than they are. Learn about easing and practice it. Also, you can do some post audio production to your voice to make the mic sound better. Because right now it sounds like you're talking into a pillow behind a wall inside a house that has a bunker with 10 foot lead walls covered in sounding proofing material. I'm just trying to say that you sound muffled is my point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think that the music choice doesn't really work to well with your content. and adding some visual aides will help you out. Also you kind of blend into the background. You should see if you could spruce up that white wall behind you somehow. The slate that you cut to between points I don't think has a good enough purpose to be there. I get that you're trying to separate different portions of the video into their own slots but the slate doesn't really convey you're moving on to another topic. It's just like your logo. Maybe if you added a number or something. But I think your main issue is just that everything looks so bland. Just set design and making your voice more dynamic throughout the video. I know it's an informative video. But there are still places you can lower your energy and give more energy. It's hard to explain because you sounded fine but it just wasn't a wide spectrum of emotions and again I know it's supposed to be informative but still adding some peaks and valleys can keep the viewer more entertained.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a really popular genre of videos on youtube. Just watching someone make something and I was never able to distinguish what makes a good video and a bad video in these style of video. But there's something missing in your's maybe it's the aesthetic everything looks really clean. but not in a good way. Like I feel there should be a bit more dark textures especially since you're working with leather. I think longer videos are fine. Maybe allowing there to be sounds of the tools working on the leather would be nice. It's just kind of music. I would experiment with just have a mic with the gain turned high and allow the mic to capture the audio. Longer videos for this are fine so you can actually see the process of start to finish.</TEXT>

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmxWJmnffQA amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmxWJmnffQA amp;feature=youtu.be) I didn't work to long on it so it doens't look too good everything is overexagerrated but I think the point is still good that some of the colors were muted and the composition of some of the shots weren't on par with the others so it creates this dissonances between shots.

You have to make sure the image your showing on screen is visual appealing because others are talking about this too that look better. So you either have to 1 up them or deliver something more that others aren't delivering. If you look at MKBHD's video it looks so nice and he makes his points so concisely. You might think. Well yeah no shit he's like rich and has a whole ass studio and has connections to get access to early products. But this is your competition. He's literally the person that your competing with, with this video. And if you can't match his quality or exceed it you have to bring something else. So what is that something else that you're bringing? I don't know you have to find that out yourself and roll more with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How did I get better at editing. Well a lot of practice was a key to it. A lot. That's one reason I don't like bashing on people that are doing a bad job because everyone starts somewhere. When I first started I was making videos about my dogs on Movie maker. Being really critical of yourself is also important and understanding what works and what doesn't by consuming a lot of content and dissecting it. And doing that to your own videos. It's really frustrating when you look back at your video and see. This doesn't look good and it's just overall really bad. But if you're not thinking that then you're not improving. Being honest with yourself can be discouraging but it's the only way you can get better. Doing a lot of reviewing and learning from people that are better than you is important. Not making excuses for your short comings. If something is bad accept it and figure out how you can improve it. If you like something watch it and don't just enjoy it really look at it and think "why do I like this? What are they doing that I enjoy and how can I implement what they're doing into what I'm doing?". I'm still learning a lot myself I'm not proud of everything that I put out and the things that I am proud of. I look back and think "Why was i so happy with this?" because I've grown and learned from my mistakes. This isn't really a recipe to make you happy if you're constantly thinking like this you're not going to spend a lot of time being happy. But it will make you a lot more successful. And that's just with everything in life. I'm not super successful but I've done a lot of things people my age haven't because I've dedicated my time and energy into it. If your interested in the things that I like so you can take a look at it. I haven't seen everything that A24 has made but most of the things that they've made I've really enjoyed. The witch is my favorite movie.</TEXT>

I think the point of using multiple takes is that you don't use any external audio. If you are just going to get someone else to play the piano for you just play one bit. It's really off putting. And you're not using sustain with the piano everything just stops. You should look up Nataly Dawn. She makes covers as well and does a really good visual job of it. You don't have to keep all 3 of the shots up at the same time. Like only when something of note happens then you can show it. But again why are you not doing all of the sound? it's just a little confusing for me.</TEXT>

I mean like that was not expected. 1:25 - naw that doesn't fit with the vibe that you guys are giving out. You don't have to show your self while explaining what you're doing. Get into a good spot with a good mic and just do VO and show what you're doing on screen. You can cut back to portion of you talking but if you're explaining something and doing PIP just don't do that. Just let the PIP be the main focus and put it on the whole screen. There were some werid choices for the pictures you put in the video. Like the hipster picture and the random space picture you had in the background for like 2 seconds. There's no consistency anywhere in your channel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't get the premise of this video. I think I got the premise after watching it but I'm not too sure. That's not a good thing you shouldn't have to explain to me what's going on in the video. Work on that. make your video easier to understand. Also just as a note I'm not stupid. I get it, it's a satirical look at how people that like to keep things organic and chemical free can be. I get it but it wasn't obvious in the video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You shouldn't open it up. You speak mutliple languages and a lot of people find that interesting you should stick with that. Also if you're going to make a video. Like make that video about the thing that you're talking about. You should dive into it and not give a long intro about something that is unrelated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So without looking at this video. Unboxing videos are videos where you live vicariously though the presenter. You should have a lot of shots of you opening the box and inspecting every aspect of it. Give your thoughts on it and express how you're feeling while opening and testing out the product. Ok I mean that's all I can think about let's take a look and see how well you do with it. Did you just introduce the video and then have an intro and then introduce the video again? that's a bit much. 1:23 - yeah that really was enough talk. The giveaway was cool but like you're almost 15% done with your video and we still haven't seen anything. Nice you showed the box. YO! HOLD UP! Did you make an unboxing video without you unboxing the product. WHAT? did that just happen. I like that your giving ample time for people to look at what you got. That's really good. There were something's I didn't like but overall I think it was ok. Maybe it could've been cut a little bit tighter so you could've shown you actually unboxing the statue but I don't know maybe that wasn't necessary. This is kind of a different unboxing than I was expecting. It's fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still in the beginning of the video but getting different shots with movement would be better at a lower angle. The audio only coming from one direction is jarring. The video is really relaxing your voice and the music goes together pretty well. This is so relaxing. I'm really enjoying watching this video. Getting different angles for your shots of plants would really help you out. ANd maybe moving away from the whole desk environment. It kinda kills the vibe but if not just like decorate it maybe put a cloth down over it that isn't white.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like the fact that you're using your city as a backdrop I think that's a good Idea. You need to get better audio though if you're doing that. And adding B-roll of just the city when you're talking about a set of headphones is probably not the best idea. Maybe include yourself wearing the headphones in the shot or just the headphones in the shot by themselves with the city in the background.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The lighting is so flat. You're guys energy is so low and the audio could be better. I don't get these edits with the noises and whatnot. Like I don't think that you guys are trying to be funny. Like you're just giving advice don't make these little edits that don't really help your purpose. Maybe some people will like it I just don't think it fits. I think the shot at 3:48 when you switch with the mirror I think is a good use of editing to tell the story. I think some of it works but others don't like the whole replacing your face with a catfish. I'm not a fan of that. It's not conducive to telling your story in a more entertaining way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I talked about this before. I still haven't come up with a name for it. But it's this thing where you think your friends and you are funnier than you actually are. And literally everyone does this. It's just something where you get with a group that you're comfortable with you tend to make each other laugh which is fine. But we're not apart of that group so we don't think you're funny. The editing I guess is fine. there's not much to say in terms of editing when you're talking about gameplay. I'm not a fan of the intro. I should come up with a name for that. Friend Group Comedy. I don't know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should change that intro. It looks just not good and even if it did look good. I don't think that that style is really in anymore. It's kinda of like old late 90's appearance of a logo. 12+ hour edit for a 14 minute video? Mmmm. Ok I think if you worked for more than 12 hours on it. It shouldn't be 14 minutes long. I'm just worried right now that the video is going to have a lot of sub par clips trying to be funny with adding small effects or text. But I haven't watched yet but that's what I'm expecting to happen. Ok I was right. There's this term in the creative field it's called being a baby killer. Or having to kill your babies. It's basically saying. Your attached to something that you made because you made it and you put effort into it and either because it doesn't meet standards or what happens most often. You can't afford the time or money to keep it in the project. So you have to exclude it. It's you're baby but you have to kill it. You should be a baby killer. The video should not be 14 minutes long. Get it down to 10 minutes. Then after you get it down to 10 get it down to 8 and then once you get it down to 8 go down to 4 minutes. And then you should have something that's genuinely funny. And if you want a longer video record more and go through that process again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was well done. Some of the jokes didn't land for me. But i mean it's an almost 20 minute video it's no big deal. There's some minor things and I don't know if fixing them would make the video better. But just like lighting at certain points weren't that great. Everything seemed kinda flat. The effects were good. I was like wow that's good. That was my reaction. Yeah good job. I would just work more on lighting and I don't know what else I could give. Maybe the pacing overall was just a little slow but I don't know. It kept me entertained enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would take the camera off of auto because of that zooming thing it keeps doing trying to focus the video. It's distracting. The lighting isn't really appealing and the backdrop is. It's not clean like the first shot I thought you were going to be showing really nice clean footage and then the next one it's this grunge kind of background. Also PS I know it's a mouse pad but I don't think that's important. I would go with just like a cleaner background. Go to like office depot and get some of that really long construction paper something with color and get a few of those so you can switch it up from time to time. Also I feel like some of the shots during the setup process lasted to long. There were a few but it kind of slowed the video down a bit. Just being tighter with your editing will help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like just a lot of this video isn't that funny. Editing wise there was no music or anything. It felt so empty there was nothing going on and I don't know who you were so it's kinda like. Are we just here watching you not talk and just listen to other people. A lot of times with people in situations like this. You have to get a lot more footage because a lot of it isn't funny. I mean it's fine but you just have to get more so you can dig those gems from the dirt. It's a longer process but you'll get a better end result.</TEXT>

It seems like you turned on the mic and just started talking with no real idea of what you were going to say. It seems very disorganized. The audio quality isn't the best either. It sounds so quiet. The delivery of what you're saying is ok. Some of it seems like you don't feel to comfortable with what your lines but it's not that bad. right. haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whoa super wide aspect ratio. Whoa this is tight. WHOA! I really like this. OMG this is really good. The effect of the house being build in the beginning didn't really sell me with the animation but the compositing was... Ok the smoke seemed over exaggerated but that was a really good idea. WOW! the image being cut into different boxes. That was really good I was like dang look at that effect. Oo : lt; you put that like in subscribe in the middle right there : lt; that kinda ruined it for a second for me. The pacing a little too fast and tbh I feel like some of that is because you know you didn't nail some of the effects you were trying to do and you wanted to get past it because it didn't look that good BUT it's still good. A little fast but good. Yo there's some really good ideas in this this is geniuenly really good. Let me go ahead and keep watching hold on. Yeah the pacing is really too fast I think. Some of the shots didn't make to sense one after another. Like It goes from ocean to peoples on bikes back to the ocean. But I mean I don't think that's too big of a deal. Some of the sound was also I think a bit exaggerated. Some of the dog ADR and the some of the ocean sounds mostly the dog. That stuck out like a sore thumb. BUT I think overall this was a really really good video. I was like wow there's a lot of cool ideas in here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I thought the editing was a bit slow in the beginning and then there was no real point to the video. That you're moving out? I don't know I didn't really get it. I think that you compose shots is probably your strong suit. Some of those shots I was like wow that's composed really well. But the editing was slow and some choices of footage was wrong like especially with the party scenes it was like static the whole time you were showing it. I was expecting movement and excitement but the camera stood still. So editing wise I do think that you need some work. Just watching back your own stuff and crtiiquing it yourself. Look and see hey does this feel to slow right now. Or does this feel werid and why does it feel weird. But the actual composing of shots was ok. I think you're better in that regard and if wanted to go down that route I think you could do well like as a DP</TEXT>

I think the only thing I would be worried about is whether the joke would get stale. But so far I think it's really funny. I don't know maybe it's because I have a soft spot in my heart for this game. This is like the only game that I had growing up and I played it so much so I remember so much about it.

    <TEXT>yeah. One of my pet peeves is when people talk about what they want their videos to be like in their actual videos. In a forum like this. yeah it's fine talk about it ask question ask for feedback and what not. NOT in front of the camera in the actual video. I hate that you should portray confidence in your content even if it's not good just act like it is. I feel like your stumbling a lot because you're not too sure what your going to talk about. A lot of people use scripts and at first it's kind of awkward but I think once you get past that stage your videos will be a lot more concise and less scatterbrained.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok haha honestly, I don't like these kinds of intros but the way you transitioned from you gameplay with facecam to the intro was really good. like the transition itself I don't want to confuse you with me thinking the intro is good. I hate these intros it doesn't say much about your style your brand your content nothing. It's just kind of loud and obnoxious personally I would just make my own. But I know how to make my own and I know that's not a skill everyone has. If I was short noticed though I would just put my name with a black screen and just sync it with music. I've done that before and I've actually received compliments about it saying like Wow you should keep that intro and I think like... no it's bad but it's a good enough kind of thing. I would recommend you try to make your own but for the mean time. White text on a black screen is good enough. Oh my good. I was not expecting this. Like your presentation is actually a lot better than most people that I have seen in this thread. I mean it's not perfect you stumble but you don't seem awkward in front of the camera. Jesus that's a good talent you got right there you just have to refine it. Yeah just keep doing what you're doing you'll improve over time. Sometimes you just have to get through what you're doing to start improving and just keep working at it. I think you're at the beginning of the right path. Also, just like don't try to be someone that you're not cause that's really going to show on camera. I think that's the issue with most people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok sorry I don't want to watch this, this makes me uncomfortable. I can answer your question though. It's really just like finding any job. You have to have a resume or in this case a reel that you can bring to people and show them your skills for the job that you're applying for. Before I was working for that YouTube channel I worked with a Pastor to help edit sermons for inmates in prison. And you have to actively search for it. Make a reel of something good and present it to employers. And if there's a certain company that you want to work for. Try cold calling. That's something that can be a bad thing depending on how you conduct yourself while you're doing it. Just like any job they want to know what you bring to the table and you should be ready to answer those questions. And if you're good enough people will start to seek you out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ho god ok first of all. Nice job on the set. Holy goodness. I think after looking at everyone's videos I think you have the 3rd best set design out of everyone I've looked at. 1st being this animation channel that submitted a video and second would be this cover of a song that guy had a good real life set. But 3rd isn't bad. This is good looking. Good job with that. Ok sorry, I actually haven't started watching the video I've just seen the first 3 seconds. 1 thing already though that I would change is don't say. "Welcome to my channel" Say "welcome to \[my channel\]" You get what I mean? Ok weird jump right there. There was this stray shot of a clip that made it through your editing. Don't do that be more deliberate with your editing. That was around :10 by the way. If you get a shot where you're looking down at a script just redo that take because that makes it seem really unprofessional and kind of kills the credibility of your video. Just as a rule have a 1 second buffer before you start speaking and a 1 second buffer after you stop speaking. In that one second just keep your eyes at the camera or wherever else you're looking at to make the cut more natural. Editing what the heck. You have to stop with those extra clips being left in there. It's like throughout your whole video. It's like there's a second of a different take that you left in. That's a big and distracting issue. Don't do that. The swish sounds don't make sense if you're just doing a jump cut. That's usually used with slide transitions. You can either take the sound away or just start using slide transitions. Yeah that editing is a huge issue with your video. But also just another thing you can improve on is the way you deliver your script. It sounds to unnatural. You should feel more comfortable with it. If you're new that will come with time but if this is a consistent issue and you've been doing it for a while. While you're writing your script try saying it out loud to see if it sounds right. If not just change it up in the writing process.</TEXT>

I was thinking about making a video about reading from a script and how to make it sound more natural. But just the tips. When you're writing the script read it out loud to make sure that you feel comfortable with the words. If not change it up to make it more comfortable for yourself. There's something about you guys. It's a very calming presence and I kind of enjoy it. I don't know how much you guys want to actually dive into this but if you want to take it more seriously think about investing in some lav mics and creating a shot list so on shoot day you can get B-roll of the different things you're going to be talking about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds really tin-y. As far as commentary that's a form of comedy. You should practice making connections that most people wouldn't see and applying it to the actual game. There was this one video that I saw in this thread where the guy would die and he would liken it to something that he's seen or experience before. And it worked well because it was funny. Like he got knocked off a cliff and went like "OH shit that guy just mario karted me off" or something like that. I don't really remember what he said but it was along those lines. I'm not too good at this kind of stuff myself. But look at others and study, why are they funny?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The intro. You in the beginning talking about the video was fine maybe a little too long. You could've gotten to the point faster but it wasn't too bad. That intro though.... god I was like... god no plz no. I was michael scotting it. Yelling NO GOD PLZ NO. Honestly, I gave this suggestion before. But adding just white text on a black screen is fine if you sync it up to some music. I did that for one of my intros just because I didn't have time to make an actual one. here's a link really quick just so you can see what I'm talking about. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=3 amp;v=U3UmxqprxB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3 amp;v=U3UmxqprxB4) I wouldn't watch the whole video. I'm not proud of the editing in this and this isn't my best work at all not even close. This was just a test for my writer to see if he could do some VO and I personally think he did a good job but the editing was so sloppily put together. The intro though was not great but it was good enough for just a one off thing. I'm not saying to copy that exactly but something like it or just the sentiment of it would be better that what you have right now.</TEXT>

Thinking back on it though I don't think that, that is a huge issue. I think it was just the lack of sound of the tools. Try including that I think that's more important than anything else. People like that whole ASMR thing associated with it and seeing the process play out it's fun to watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Visual aides. I was thinking when you were talking about sounds bouncing off walls and what not. I was thinking the whole time maybe if he just made a small animation it could be more engaging to the viewer. As far as dynamic I think the dynamic thing the first 5 seconds is a good demonstration of that. "If you have or even if you haven't" It was all with the same energy. I think it would've been better if you lowered your energy for that second half of that sentence. "even if you haven't" like slowed it down been more calm while you were saying it. It would've been more impactful. It's not a huge deal I don't think but little things like that could really help strengthen your commentary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>there's this thing called clipping where you start to lose data in either your footage or your audio and everything just becomes completely white or completely black. Your camera was overexposed so a lot of the image was completely white and it makes it look ugly. Over exposure. You can look that up some more if you want more information. Everything is just so bright. Bring some dark into it is what I'm saying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Improving animation. Adding more actually hold on. Nevermind I couldn't find the link but it's just like adding more personality to animations by adding stretching and squishing and anticipation and easing. But the main thing I think is just adding more inbetween frames and making your characters do more full body actions. It's really time consuming. Like animation is one of the most time consuming kind of videos to make well because of the skill you need to have behind it. Even with your style of video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah the angle is better and I like that you're actually branding the videos now. But when I was talking about B-roll I was referring to you actually picking up your camera and doing some side to side motion revolving around the product. I mean some motion is better than none but if you set up a space to record your swords and practiced with your camera moving it around a bit it would be a lot better. There's a lot to look into though and it can be overwhelming. Cinematography is what I'm referring to. Just take things one step at a time .</TEXT>

I think if you asked people to sub around the same time it would've been fine but don't make it the main point of what you're showing. That should always be the content maybe like a little lower third saying hey don't forget to subscribe. As far as audience retention. Some people are just there for the music and aren't interested in what ever product you're trying to sell. But maybe putting some detail in the beginning. I can't help you too much with that but try things out. don't make the beginning too long though or else people will click off.</TEXT>

It's just something that you as the viewer can follow along throughout the video. Maybe it can be comedy maybe it's just showing off. But there has to be something. You just need something connecting the video together. a purpose I think is a better way to describe it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>mmmm yes. Yes. creating a shot list is more work but I think there's a little misunderstanding and I don't know if this is going to turn you off to the idea but when creating a shot list with this kind of content you would have to do 2 shoots. One would be A-Roll that's the main camera capture the main footage and you would do what you did in this video without changing anything. But then you would have to go through another shoot and only capture footage at different angles. So you would have to make whatever you were making twice. The second time you would grab the camera and get close up shots. insert shot whatever you need. It's more work and if you do it at the same day you would probably be wasting food but that's why you separate the shoot days so that you can capture the footage and not waste food. It is more work but the end result is a lot better. Or you could just get another camera and record whatever you need to record while you're doing it. but you would have to edit around it .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so in High school I we watched the boy in the striped pajamas. If you've never heard of it. It's about a Nazi family who's father was involved in running a camp during the war. But something I wasn't expecting was how unaware the family was about the father's actual job. I think the mother was the only who suspected that they were torturing and killing jews but even her she wasn't 100% sure. In the film they showed propaganda footage of Jewish people having fun in the camps and making it seem like it was a getaway and not an interment camp. So, I was just curious. Like how accurate is that. Were families oblivious of what they fathers and brothers were actually doing in camps? or was that just something to make the family seem more relate able for the film?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Yes, I do very much enjoy this kind of format. If I've never experienced the media that you're talking about it helps to understand what's going on. And if I have it's a good refresher. 2. Ok, So I don't think you were to quiet. I Just think that the sound mixing was bad. Your voice was only a little bit louder than the in game audio. And I found myself not paying attention to what you were saying because I was paying attention to the game audio. You have this habit of pausing between words. It's fine it kind of adds like a charm to the way you speak but I don't know if it works too well with the script. 3. THE SCRIPT! TBH (to be honest)I thought a lot of the jokes fell flat for me. I don't know if it was the delivery or if I just didn't think the jokes were that funny. I don't think a lot of things are funny and comedy is subjective. But subjectively from me, I didn't think it was funny. Informative sure but I feel like the comedy kind of got in the way of that. And maybe you just need to pick up the pace with the talking. Again subjective but that's my subjective opinion. 4. Whoops I guess I already answered that. 5. I don't think that you should focus on one more than the other I just think that you should focusing on combining them more. This format really benefits a lot from being able to criticize something that's on screen. And it didn't feel like you were doing that. It just felt like you were criticizing abstract concepts and never utilizing the format to it's fullest potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're looking at the wrong audience. People will pay a shit ton for that kind of thing. I think that people at this level aren't that interested in that kind of service. I think you would have better luck focusing on small businesses or medium business that aren't utilizing online media as a platform. Easy 1G if you can pitch it like a ROI. I'm not a sales person but that's where I see money coming from. I think if you're just looking to help people. Monetizing it with D2C isn't a good way to go. If you've got a growing YouTube channel you should promote with that and if you have the numbers to back it up then people would be interested and at that point not only would you have the knowledge but the analytics to back it up as well. Once you get to that point, I still think 30 dollars would be too little for that. 250 maybe for a single client. Again if you are looking to help people in general I would just offer it as a free service in a youtube video and talk about concepts and not really give specifics unless you wanted to do like case studies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It took too long to get to the content. Like 3 intros for the video. The first words were spoken at :35 that took way too long. Attention spans aren't that long. You have to fight for people's attention. I like the cutaway to show the food. It slowed down the video though. I think adding VO over it would've been better. But it was a good cutaway. Mmm, I like that you're thinking about the choice of where you're choosing to film. I think eating inside the cabana patio thing that you walked pasted would've given a better aesthetic. There's nice brown wood that can contrast with the wide-open lake. I think as far as commentary. I think there could've been more. Having just the timelapse of you guys isn't I don't feel is enough. You guys did talk about the food. I think there should've been more talking though. Yeah, the cutaways slow down the video a lot. Like I said earlier you can just like splice that on top of your commentary about the food and it will help speed it up. Ok, I finished watching the video before I go through your questions. Things I would've liked to see. I think watching you guys decide where you go to eat and how you came up with those decisions would've been cool to see. If I weren't reviewing this I think I would've stopped watching at the beginning it just took too long to get started. Personality-wise it's not for me there wasn't a lot there for me to grab onto but that's just my personal bias in content. You can always find a market for anything if you promote and brand yourself correctly. 1. I don't think the camera angles were the issue. I mean having more camera angles is always good but I don't think that's what you should be focusing on. But sure more camera angles do that as well. 2. Oh, I did answer that. Just putting more content while eating would've been better. Something I like to do to check if my video is engaging is after editing the video. Watch the video 10 times in a row straight. On the 11th time watching see where you stop paying attention and what keeps your attention. My videos are a lot shorter like 4 minutes long so I don't know how well that would work for you but, give it a shot and see if that helps you. Maybe not 10 times though. 3. No, the thumbnail is pretty bad. It's not eye-catching it's so monochromatic in a bad way. My thumbnails are my weaker point I'm not too good at designing eye-catching visuals with interesting text. But I would do some research on competitors in your field and see how they do it and try to steal their ideas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uh ok, random religious quote. I don't know how well that fits in with your content but if you feel like putting that out there, I mean I guess it's fine. I have to actually watch the video to see if there's some sort of connect. You are so quiet in the beginning and it feels like you're a little stilted. I don't get the premise of the video so far. What do you mean you're going to catfish people? Like these are people you've already been talking to. How are you going to catfish them? 4:14 what is going on. I don't know if that is as entertaining to watch as it is to be involved in that moment. Is it catfishing because that's your friend's Instagram account? Also, like what's the setup? There's a lot of questions that I have and it' so unclear and we're already like 8 minutes into the video. 9:09 honestly I don't know what you're doing either. Hahaha, what are these timelapse shots? Hahaha, that's great. Uh. I don't know man. There wasn't really anything here. I didn't get the premise until like halfway through the video and even afterward I didn' think it was that entertaining. The editing. I think there was a disconnect. You put these noise effects and whatnot when I don't think it was appropriate or maybe it could've worked if you played up your emotions more in the video. Or if you're friend played up his emotions. The timelapse was the funniest part for me. I was just thinking like this is so irrelevant from what's going on in context. That made me laugh I don't think that was your intention though. 1. I think my long-ass paragraph above goes pretty in-depth. 2. No, it's not something that would appeal to me. But I have seen other thumbnails that I wouldn't click on that are along the same vein of design like this but it's not my personal preference. I think this kind of thumbnail was more ubiquitous on facebook a few years ago. I haven't seen much like this on youtube recently. 3. I would've not continued past the first few seconds if I wasn't reviewing it. 4. Almost immediately. But, I'm not a fan of this kind of content in general. 5. 2 6. no 7. The intro bumper was a good length I think and I actually enjoyed it a bit. It was simple but I feel like it captured the essencense of the type of video that you are trying to make. I would keep that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh, shit a tips video. Ok, I'm down for this. I like that you explained what the video was about before you started. I didn't like that graphic of the subscribe it was too big and somehow not eye-catching. Like I don't think there was enough color to it or animation but it's good that you're trying to implement those kinds of graphics. I don't think that one works. 3:15 You're talking about AD strafing. I think you repeated yourself a lot and made it a bit difficult to understand since you weren't using the terminology most people use. I used to watch a lot of videos about these kinds of things but in overwatch. And a thing that they did was they actually drew out what they were talking about as well as showing in-game examples. If you were to do that, I think you would be golden. There's a lot of things that are unclear because the way you describe them doesn't really line up with the in-game footage. 1. Wow actually, I think this thumbnail is pretty good. The words are solid and easy to read from afar. The red arrow is a little small I think you could've made that larger but I think it was well done. If I saw that and I played Seige I would actually click on that. 2. More visuals aides. I think your energy was good and the diction was good as well. But more visual aids and working on building better graphics. 3. Hahaha actually didn't read that before I started. The text especially felt lazy to me. It just felt like you just typed in whatever and didn't put much effort into it. It all depends on what software you use. If you have access to the adobe suite I would use AE to make some text prompt templates and use those whenever I wanted to input something. 4. I think I already gave a good amount of info but since you want me to be harsh. Fuck you. You will never amount to anything. You're a fucking piece of shit. No one cares about this piece of shit game or your antiquated style of making videos. Dumbass. ps. I'm just joking for number 4 you did a good job  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK, before I start watching. I expect you to like know your shit for a tutorial. If this is just like motion track it to your face with a null and attach an image to it. I will be disappointed. Wow, I'm too judgmental and I'm sorry about that. 6:01 I think that you could've done 1 for this and just like time-lapsed the rest of the process. We don't have to see you doing all of them. 6:38 NO PLZ I get it just timelapse and then come back whenever there is something important to say. This is taking way too long. I just skipped to 7:48 You should've just time-lapsed it. 8:24 I think that it's good practice to do an initial rough cut of your footage and then add effects like these and then color grade. That's something I would have liked for you to do and explain in a video like this so other people don't run into the same issue that you did. 9:05 Yeah I would've not done it like this. You should always use the raw footage to do the effects and then color grade and what not afterward. Wait was George Clooney batman? I thought it was ben afllack. I think with tutorial videos people are more concerned about the quality of the tutorial more than anything else. I will watch through someone who I think is boring that can give me information if that information is valuable. I wouldn't be too concerned about your personality on camera I would focus more on trying to build the best tutorial possible. Right now I think it was lacking and there were some mistakes in the video that I already explained. I don't think the end result looked that great but I don't think that is important. I think it's more important for the person to understand what process you're going through to achieve what you're trying to achieve. Even people like Andrew Kramer skimp on parts of making the video look better because he knows it's just a tutorial and that people will put more effort in their videos. Kramer does still like put in some effort but not as much as he would for an actual product that he was making for a deliverable. My point is that it's fine that it doesn't look great as long as you explain your process and how it works. As Far as that goes. I don't think you really explained too well how everything works but your step by step was good. There was a mistake that I saw as well. When you tracked the face. Tracking starts at the point where you press play where your playhead is. And you dragged it somewhere to where the track could see your face and then dragged it away. That's not the way tracking works. AE doesn't know when you created your mask it just knows where it currently is. I would learn a bit more about the actual process of how AE works before you try to make a video on something. You don't want to be giving out miss information or setting people up for bad workflows. Unfortunately, I think that's what you did here.</TEXT>

Wow if the whole video was this bright it would've looked better. 1:41 that right there is how you should've CC'd the whole video. 2:05 what happened to the audio? 4:50 I don't know what you're looking at bro. Like do you have a video off to the side or are you looking at the camera? That was a bit distracting for me. 8:56 There was something off about the whole video and I couldn't tell what it was until right here. You said that was funny but like, I didn't get that emotion from you. It was just sorta like you were reading from a script. None of the reactions feel genuine. Ok, I finished the video. I think what I said early still rings true for the whole video. The reactions feel so disingenuous But also, I think it goes a little deeper than that. You're trying to make commentary videos but they are, despite what people say, meant to be in sort of poor taste. You're making fun of people when you make commentary videos like these. But you never did. There's a disconnect and I don't know if the commentary style format works with your type of personality. You're too nice. I'm no expert, I think commentary videos are my least favorite and I don't know much about them but at the end of the day you're making fun of people and you never really did. 1. I think the fact that the whole video felt kind of disconnected because it felt like you were reading from a script. It made it feel fake and I just wouldn't have watched it if I wasn't reviewing. 2. Improvements? I think either being more committed with the whole commentary bit and being more aggressive with your roasts or seeing if you can turn it on its head and find a way to make commentary more interesting. The way you were doing it right now. It just sort of felt like you didn't have much to say with each video. I think that was also a part of it. Most of the things you were saying were just like. "Hey look at this video. Wow, that was crazy/funny/weird what happened in that video huh?" I didn't feel like you were adding much. 3. It's your first time? Ok, that makes sense. Improving on videos is an iterative process. The first video you make in a certain format isn't going to be good unless you're like a natural talent but very very few people are. I wouldn't get discouraged by what I'm saying just understand that hey it's your first time it's a process. But to answer your question. no. But you had a nice set design and your editing was decent work a bit on that CC. You'll improve if you keep making these videos. 4. Uhh... no just for the reasons I stated before. 5. Whoever told you 10 minutes before was spot on. Youtube promotes videos that are longer and the bigger youtuber's were either told or found out that 10 minutes was the sweet spot for video length. So you should always try to get your videos closer to 10 minutes but not below that. AHHH. I don't read your little self-review or questions before I start reviewing. I think that it kind of taints the experience of the review process. I should be able to see what issues are without you having to ask for them. BUT, seeing that you wanted to make family-friendly commentary videos is a bit of a paradox in my opinion. I don't think commentary videos are good-natured in the first place and trying to make them family-friendly I don't think would work. You can try that's not me trying to dissuade you from trying but it's just an opinion I hold. But yeah keep it up and maybe you can make it work somehow. Keep at it brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not use patreon. But I do have opinions on it. Some of my friends were thinking about making patreons. The situation is a little different for them because they don't really make videos they're more into drawing and art. Little side note, I enjoy talking about them because they're so talented. One of them is a landscape artist and another does really nice lining and pixel art. Anyways, I always try to push them away from making patreons. The reason for this is specifically because I think it tends to stiffen the want for people to help you monetarily. It's a sort of carriage before the horse situation. You don't want to build a stream for people to support you financially if there's no one there to support you. When you make one it adds another layer of community to your... well community. But if there's no one there in the first place it actually pushes people away. I used to run a restaurant on the strip. And there was this concept that the owner told me. If you see an empty restaurant it makes people want to stay away, because if the restaurant is empty then that means there's an issue with it. But even if you see a few people there it then turns from "What's wrong with this place?" to "Oh it's so small and quaint!" I think that some logic follows to things like patreon. If you had someone that was possibly thinking about supporting you and clickthrough to your patreon and find that no one is supporting you they will have second thoughts going like... "Well, if no one else is helping them out what must've they done to keep people away." Like the carriage before the horse idiom. The solution is simple. wait for a few people to get in contact with you and say "Hey is there a way I can support you?" That's what I told them and they just told me. "Oh yeah, I already have that. People are already asking if there are ways to support me." So, if you already have people, that's fine make a patreon but I would wait until you do have people asking. As far as tier benefits. The advice I would have is to think about scalability and implementation in a logistical sense. My artist friends are artists and don't really have that business sensibility. Not saying they're stupid but it doesn't come as naturally as it comes to me as art comes to them. They bounced a lot of ideas off of me and there were always issues with those 2 things. Scalability and implementation so I think those are the issues that most people will run into. My sample size is small though. Engagement and whatnot, social media is probably my worst skill as a person in general. I'm not old but I just never understood it. I don't know how people can invest time into it without getting something of value in return. I like Reddit because you can learn and share knowledge with people but not so much, things like Instagram and Facebook. That being said, I would recommend reading jab, jab, jab, right hook.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I reviewed your video before not too long ago. I'm a little concerned you didn't use any information to improve your video. Whenever I give reviews I expect people to like look at their own work and think critically not just take what I give them and implement those changes. Ok, let's see how you did. 0:11 - I would like to see some sort of branding beside you just saying "Hey it's matchpoint here" That's so generic and I don't have anything like a logo or typeface to connect to your video. If I wanted to look you up in the future I would not be able to remember your name. 0:24 - The Woosh Sfx is a bit too loud. It's distracting I would turn that down a touch. 1:39 - These graphics are a bit. I don't know they seem so low quality for the type of videos you're producing. It's disconnected. I would take like a week and see if you can make some lower thirds and CTA's for your channel that are on brand and also probably make an animated intro or something small for yourself. 4:13 - I think this is like a good overview video but it feels like each one of these tips could be a longer video in themselves. You're going by information to quick. If you don't have like longer videos on each one of these tips I would suggest making those videos and putting them in like a playlist for people to watch. It could help with your viewership of other videos. 4:45 - Oh look there you go. You actually said it yourself. I like your CTA but I would actually just go ahead and make that video. 5:10 - Wow why don't you have something like that at the beginning of the video. Ok, I think that there were slight improvements but there was still a lot that can be improved. I think the lower thirds explaining what was going on, on-screen was ok but I think there could be a better way to show that. Maybe like desaturating the screen in a way that makes us look at what you're talking about. 1. I like the text but the background seems like it kind of fades away... well into the background. Maybe if there were elements that you could incorporate into the foreground like the gun or something that would look better? 2. Yeah, I think I talked about that above. 3. I don't think they're too good. They just kind of slide into the screen or do a simple wipe. It looks low effort. There's not even easing. And easing is already low effort but the return on it is high. 4. I think I talked about that already. I like the knowledge that you have but your presentation of that is not as good as the actual knowledge you posses. 5. I don't think it's an issue with the audio levels. I think the mic your using is kind of flat. You could do some post-processing and give it some oomph. Check out some videos on how to master your audio. I think that could help you out. I do processing on my voice and people always come back and say. "Whoa what mic are you using?" it's like the most popular mic on the market for small YouTubers but I just do processing on it. Also, it kind of sounds like you're shouting at your mic. I would not do that. Just chill a little bit. But maybe I don't know the shouting is kind of attention-grabbing. I would experiment with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:03 - Whoa I like the concept of the intro I think the masking on the mountains is a nice touch. The only thing I would say to fix is that text coming up behind the mountains. It's a bit too smooth. I think like adding like a skip to it while it's moving up or maybe making it slower. But I think that would make the intro too long. I would just experiment with stuff on it. 0:14 - NO! the background noise in your audio is so noticeable! Damn. If you could remove that next time it would be a lot better. That was the first thing I noticed when your VO audio came in. Or maybe just putting some music behind your VO would also help if you're not able to remove that noise. 1:07 - The skipping on the lower graphic is what I was trying to suggest for your intro I enjoyed this a lot. The only thing I would say is that you don't really vary the intonation of your voice. It's all very upbeat which is better than being monotone but it's not as good as having lows and highs whenever you're talking. It kind of made everything your saying have the same level of importance throughout the entire video. And I think that was the main reason why some of the jokes didn't land. A lot of the jokes didn't land for me just because it was the same delivery throughout the whole video. Like I said earlier being upbeat throughout the whole video is better than being low energy but they're both monotone. I didn't really review much because I feel like you have a good product already and I actually forgot about the review and just watched the video. That's good. I would keep it up and just work on your delivery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok starting out the video. I'm not a fan of older games or gameplay videos but I'll try to get through as much as I can. I don't know if I'll watch the entire 30 minutes though. 0:11 - So, I'm about to start college for design : gt; I'm pretty exciting. But I've been studying a lot. And I've always had an interest in design but never knew how to word the issues that I've had. BUT NOW I DO! So, the spacing on the SIRKILL and the helmet seems too close. I think you should separate those more. Also, the 1000 doesn't look lined up with the SIRKILL I would move that over a few and see how that looks. It just looks like it's too close to the left side of it. But definitely, the text needs more space away from the helmet. Play around with it and see what feels better for you. Also, It looks like you upscaled the image and it looks fuzzy. I don't know if that's what you did but that's what i looks like. If you did I would make a higher rez file and try it again. It looks really soft. Also, it looks like you have like 2 or 3 different reds on the helmet. I would just make it one. Simpler is better. 0:23 - The pacing is too slow already. If you want a beginning introduction. I would just cut from "Alright, let's get it going here" straight into the action. 1:25 - The shuffling on the mic is really distracting for me. If you could like move your mic on a different table or put some cushioning underneath it or something so it doesn't catch your movement on your desk that would be better. 1:35 - Ooh, Speaking of your mic. The Blue Yeti has a front-facing input, not a top facing one. So you actually don't have the mic pointed at your face. From the video. The front of the mic is actually pointed at your chest right now. Lift that puppy up brother. Point it towards your mouth. 3:09 - I have no idea what's going on in the game right now. It's not that entertaining for me but I think that's not JUST because I don't know what's going on. Your energy is so low. I don't know if you took this from a stream. But if you did I would try to make a highlight of your best moments. If it's not from a stream you have to keep in mind the audience and try to keep your energy up. 8:16 - I feel like this is something more to be put in the background and not really watched or listened to but more like something to put on just for noise so it's not silent. The thing with that is that I don't know if you can find an audience for that. Even people with millions of subscribers are having a difficult time bringing people onto their podcasts. It's a smaller market that is quickly getting saturated. Ok, I stopped watching at 10:10. I think I watched enough to give feedback. This reminds me of a lot of Minecraft YouTubers. They are constantly in a happy or like energized state because they know what's going on, on-screen isn't engaging. So they compensate for that by acting energetic. If what's on-screen is low energy and you're also low energy, it's not that engaging. I would do 1 of 2 things. Preferably both, I would either bring more energy while I'm recording. For me, that is draining and sometimes feels disingenuous but some people make it work. AND/OR edit the video to only include the exciting parts. It's really slow right now and there's not a lot of content in here. If something of note happens but it was kind of slow while it was happening. You could just summarize what happened and then continue to how that affected the rest of the game. It's your first video. Everyone's first video isn't the best. I would continue on and continue working to improve. Keeping in mind the audience and I think you can do well. Especially if you already have a following on some streaming platform. And maybe play with your whole knight persona as well. I think you just put that on just so you don't have to show your face. But that's a good prop you could play around with. Keep experimenting and keep trying.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I rebranded and am looking for feedback and all the assets! (Swearing)[Review Video]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-07 20:25:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently decided to rebrand my channel and I went through a lot of work to have a cohesive brand throughout everything. I'm still in the process of making assets and fixing a few things up. But I still wanted to get some feedback before I finalize everything. self review: There are some inconsistencies in this video that I found after I finished editing it. Different typographies in different places. I think my voice was a little tired and you can actually hear when I stopped recording and started back up again. I think I should've just recorded the whole thing over again but I wanted to push this out quick. Looking back at the old channel and the old assets. I've been working a little bit on the thumbnail design, I think that it accomplishes it's the goal in being eye-catching and something that is clickable but I don't think that it lines up with my brand. I'm having a difficult time creating something eye-catching with the style I picked. Overall, the video seems very I don't know, not put together well. But, like I said I wanted to get others' opinions. Target Audience: Early 20+, People interested in Tech and Gaming. Males Prodimenately but I would also like to be inclusive for females. Questions: 1. What are you're thoughts on the overall brand? 2. Was there any point in the audio that struck out to you that needed fixing? 3. Is the Thumbnail something you would click on? How do you feel about the thumbnail and video style combination? 4. How did you feel about the narrator's voice and tone? Did it bother you at any point? 5. If you didn't review this video at what point would you stop watching or would you watch till the end? What made you want to stop watching?  #8203; Thanks very much for the reviews. If you have any other criticism I would love to hear that as well! : gt; [My Video](https://youtu.be/ZJ2l3n47I1k) [Review 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/delpiz/review_video_swearing_just_made_my_first_youtube/f2x9wj8/?context=3) [Review 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/deksrf/review_video_the_best_tips_for_clearing_rooms/f2x0ba7/?context=3)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pro Freelance Editor Looking to Critique Others</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 03:35:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I did this one time before it was a lot of work and some people messaged me hoping for a critique. I wanted to do this one more time to see how it goes. I have a rule this time though. RULES: 1. Give me your best video. 2. Give me a genuine thing you think you could've done better in the video. (If you give me a low effort critique, I'll give you a low effort response. I want to know that you're actually invested in improving. Looking at your own content and seeing the flaws is the first step in that. Why am I going to put more effort into reviewing something you did than you are willing to put into yourself) If you want to know a little about me. I've been editing videos since I was 12 started on windows movie maker. I got my first job as a video editor editing sermons for a priest for prisons and then a few years later I got a job working for a Youtube channel that had almost 2M subscribers at the time. I think now they passed 2 million now. And then I just worked freelance editing music videos, commercials, in house training videos and more kinds of videos. I consume a lot of YouTube media. A lot. Both small and large channels. Gaming, Makeup, Fashion, Vlogs, DIY, Repair, Timelapse, News, literally any kind of video out there. I've seen and watched and learned from. That's basically it leave me your videos and I'll tell you what I think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:03 - The shot is slightly off leveled. 1:26 - I've been fighting thinking about it. But I think the music audio is a bit too loud. There are points where I'm fighting trying to understand what you're saying because the audio is too loud. It's only a touch too loud though. 1:53 - Yup that audio did peak right there. It's good that you noticed it but if you do notice it in the future just go back and re-record that line. It doesn't take too long and it goes a long way to add production value to your video. 2:19 - I think it's an issue whenever you're talking about something and what you're talking about isn't on screen. In this case, I would've adjusted your script a little so it aligns with what's going on, on the screen. 3:31 - That mixing is off again. I keep thinking. If the music was a touch quieter it would be easier to understand. 7:48 - Something that always bothered me about even larger YouTubers that make this kind of content is the huge change in quality whenever they're switching from on-screen audio to VO. I understand capturing audio on-screen is more difficult. You can't hide your mic anywhere or whatnot but it's always bothered me. That's also an issue that you. It doesn't seem to be slowing anyone else down so it probably won't affect you but it does bother me personally. 8:04 - These verbal seagways are great. Overall, I thought this video was really good. There were a few issues that I stated above. But honestly, those are just surface-level issues that can be fixed easily. I think if you keep on keeping on doing these types of videos you'll do well. I tend to not critique much when I'm actually enjoying the video. That came out a little wrong. I still pay attention and critique but this video didn't really have anything for me to improve on much. It was good. I thought the timing was well done. The jokes were... They were stupid jokes but I mean that was the point of them I enjoyed it a lot. Good job!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:26 - So, right now I can say that it's either because of the delivery or the audio. It sounds really mushy like all the words are starting to blend in together. Listening to it again. It sounds like it's both. There's a lot of lower end in your voice which is fine but you have to keep in mind that when you process your voice like that talking quickly like you are is going to make it sound like words are starting to blur together. The bottoms aren't disconnecting. There's not a lot of high ends either which makes it sound a little muddy. Not too much like it's not a huge issue what I'm talking about but its something that I think a viewer would hear and think "There's something up with the sound I'm not too sure though" 0:29 - You see all your social media on the bottom left. If I wanted to pause the video and check out your facebook or twitter. I wouldn't be able to because the video controls are in the way. It's a simple solution just make some safe margins when you're editing the video. I don't know if you're program allows you to do that. I use premiere and they have that where you can set up margins. If not, just keep in mind when you're editing your video to add a little bit of a margin on the bottom so people can actually see what your socials are. 2:12 - Oh no, The graphic is off. I think if you're going to put something like that into the video you have to make sure that it lines up with the actual object. The doesn't even start at its feet and it ends at it mid-shoulder. Big no-no. 3:14 - "So, yeah," I don't like it when people do that it sounds like you weren't prepared when you were making the video. If you don't already do it. I would create a little list of things you want to talk about the figure and you can reference that list while you're recording the video. 4:04 - I would've liked more cutaways when you're talking about the figure. Not just that one stationary shot of you holding him in your hand. It would've been cool to see the figure on different poses in different areas. 6:11 - When editing. Sometimes you have to get really meticulous. I remember one time I was editing a video and the director wanted to add in a shot of this alley. But it lingered on too long. We spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to transition from one shot to the alley shot. It was a 2-second shot that we worked on. Eventually, after he let me try something we got the shot to work. I just said that story just so you could understand the level of detail that I usually work on. It was really noticeable right here. The transition leading to this shot. It felt like the video just stopped. The reason for that was because the VO stopped. There was like a whole second of nothing and then it transitioned. It felt like ages and that's an issue that was present throughout the whole video. Having tighter cuts will help speed your video along. Ok I finished the video. 6. That's how many shots I counted in your video. I felt it too. I wished there were more shots in the video. It felt like I was looking at the same screen for so long. The average shot in a movie is about 8 seconds. For action movies, it's actually shorter. You don't really notice it because we've gotten accustomed to it over the years. You definitely do notice when someone lingers on to a shot for a while. It slows down the content so much it makes it feel like the video is longer than it actually is. I would suggest getting more hero shots and adding them in throughout your review. Tightening up your cuts. And playing around with your audio a bit more to see if you can add in some higher-end and maybe turn down that lower end just a bit. GL hope you succeed in your niche.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:15 - I think it's cool how you had your animated background in the back and the video in the front. It's weird that you decided to not include the animated background in this shot. If you go back and forth between having that background and not having one. I think that's a mistake. It's just a little jarring. 3:09 - I don't think that there was enough time between you finishing talking and the video game character beginning to talk right here. It was very quick. Give a little breathing room. 4:41 - There's a lot of names being thrown out there and it's a little difficult to follow. There's a thing where you've been working on something. You get really familiar with it and it sort of becomes like second nature to you so when you beginning writing the script its kind of to quick for people that weren't close to the researching to follow. I think keeping up stills of who you're talking about would help to alleviate this. 6:32 - What was that text? 10:13 - I find the inconsistency in the background to be a bit just confusing. If you're going to use this style I would just stick with it. 14:52 - Something I wasn't able to put my finger on until now was the lack of music and how everything kind of seems to mix together. I understand that history isn't segmented into different parts but when you present it. You should have it separated. It makes everything easier to follow and creates a sort of storyline for the video. A person who does this well is History Buff. If you haven't seen his stuff you should check him out. He segments his videos into different sections and it does make everything a lot more digestible. While also including music changes to indicated "Hey we're talking about something else now." 27:38 - I'm going to stop watching right here. Ok, so issues. There were some inconsistencies throughout the video but these aren't issue that makes the video bad. It's just inconsistency issues that bothered me. The biggest thing, I think in your video that hinders it, was just the fact that it all meshed together. I already spoke about this earlier. But it felt like things just kept happening and happening and i get that, that's how it actually happened. But you're making the video. Even if you're trying to make an in-depth analysis of the company you can still segment the video into portions to make it easier to watch. There were a lot of times where you just start talking about something else and I'm just sitting here thinking. "This doesn't really have anything to do with what he was just talking about" That would be a good time to create a new section. Just adding like a little slate saying like Part II or Year 20XX would've worked. Other than that. It was good. I enjoyed the video, I like longer videos like these. I would've continued watching but I have to get to other people. Keep up the good work and I hope you continue to do well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1:07 - I don't like that you put your intro in the middle without any like separation. It was just kind of there. It's kind of a blink and you'll miss it. 1:41 - The audio of your voice is a bit quiet. I would like to hear from you more than music. 2:16 - There are points in here where I don't understand what you're saying. I don't want to be rude but anyone watching this video knows that you have a lisp. It's fine but just take that into account when you're recording audio for your video. Speak a little slower or try to speak more clearly. This joke right here, I didn't get because I couldn't understand you. 8:47 - I don't know who these characters are. I think that might be an issue because the game is really complex. I don't know much about kingdom hearts. I played the first one for like 20 minutes. But as a reviewer, I think it's your job to explain what's going on and what you're talking about not just about your qualms with the game. 9:54 - Whu... Did you just leave 2 takes that you didn't need in the video? Oh no. That's a big no no. Make sure that you double-check everything before you export your video. 13:53 - I get the joke that it's complicated to understand but... I don't know I still feel you should try your best to explain what you're talking about. I'm trying to put myself as someone who is thinking about buying this game. I don't know what's going on. I don't really understand you're problems with the game because a lot of it was with the story. And I don't understand the story. 14:26 - That's like just straight ripping someone else's joke. I'm not a fan of that. Yeah, bro. I think I said everything above. Don't snatch other people's content. As far as your questions. How many projects I get in a week. It's really inconsistent. I don't really promote myself consistently. So most of the work that I get is from clients that I've already worked with. Videos per week isn't really a metric I went by. A lot of times I would just work whenever I needed money. Which isn't great but it was my main job for a little while. The length of how long it took to make a video depended on the project. Sometimes I literally got paid like 100 bucks for a days worth of work. Other times it was a few hundred or thousand for like 2 weeks working on one project. It was my main job for a little bit. Now it's just secondary. If I want to buy something expensive I'll just look for a project and get paid like 200 and then buy whatever I want and have my main job there to support me with the day to day bills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:07 - Oh, god. Typography is probably one of the most important things in design that people ignore but it's super important. This typeface makes me think of old like 90s action-adventure movies like Indiana Jones. I don't think that's the type of feel you were trying to convey. 0:35 - I assume the beginning intro happened between the last shot and this one. Honestly, I think you could've done one of two things right here. You could've either just shot the first segment after the intro again with the new angle and Yoshis rearranged OR (and I think this would be the best choice since your channel is really focused around you) just like add a little shot of you realizing the Yoshi's aren't angled that way you don't have to use the same shot in the beginning again but the new shot with the new angle and the rearrangement isn't so abrupt. 1:14 - If you would've added little icons for the different things you were talking about it would've been a little more engaging. Also, right now it seems like the video is just really quiet. There's no background music which is ok. Sometimes adding background music can be too much. I don't know how it would fit in your video. I would have to experiment with that to see if it would help you. But definitely adding in some little sound effects would've helped you. Accent sounds. Swooshes, Pops and whatnot 1:39 - What the heck it's so quiet. That transition made it super noticeable. 2:22 - This doesn't really have to do with the video but with the youtube integrated subtitles. I speak a little french. Very very little but I got that there was the subtitle "and a chance to practice my french" was really short and didn't line up to when you were saying it. You can fix this manually. And I actually think it's important that you fix it because you're promoting yourself to multiple different languages. If you want to be accessible to all of them you have to take extra care in the subtitles 2:44 - Haha I think you gotta check your math there. That was funny I don't think you intended it to be though. 3:02 - Again the subtitle cut off a bit before you stopped saying it. Just taking care of timings for your subtitles is important. I do this myself as well, I only speak one language in my videos and don't expect people to use my subtitles but if anyone ever does, it's right there perfectly timed. 3:53 - I didn't get that last bit. The subtitles went by too quick or they just weren't there. Again I speak very little french. TBH, I think there was a missed golden opportunity. Someone who does kind of what you do. It's like a vlog lifestyle YouTuber. Their name is Safiya Nygaard, She really focuses on the experience. I feel like you didn't really do that. It seems like you kind of skimped over that. Presumably, that's what the video is about. The experience of going to meetups like this. It felt rushed at the point where it should've slowed down a bit and gone more in-depth with the experience. If you do look up Safiya Nygaard. I think the most recent video about getting married in a McDonalds encapsulates this concept. Like most of the video was just about her experience and she goes really in-depth into it. 5:22 - I don't want to bring this up anymore after this but just to emphasize the importance of having subtitles timed correctly is important. I don't speak Chinese at all. There were 2 times already where I felt lost because you were talking and there were no subtitles. It's important I would take extra care in that. 6:18 - Again it's consistent issues. It felt like you rushed through this section. Go deeper into what you thought of the experience. I feel like one reason you aren't finding yourself attracted to your own content is that you don't provide any emotional investment. It's all surface-level stuff that you're talking about. I want to know what you thought of the experience. Right now you're basically just giving an itinerary, that's not engaging. I'm hoping the Russian one is different because it looks like it takes up half of your video. Hopefully, you go more in-depth. 7:10 - OH NO, Typo in a subtitle. 7:31 - this out of focus shot is gonna trigger me if it keeps going on. 8:23 - THIS IS WHAT SHOULD'VE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE OTHER ONES. I think that the reason why you're going deeper into this one is because, you're a native speaker. There's an emotion behind it that's geniune. I think that the rant that you cut out would've been better used in just making this video about just the Russian Meetup. You could've included the other 2 as well but a lot shorter. Maybe making those 2 into one segment that's like a minute long or something and really focused on this Russian one. 8:54 - Yo, are you actually going to stop talking about it. Yo that's gonna be the biggest shame if you do. This is where the meat is. Don't take it away. I think the issues were not so much with the technical editing. I did hate that one shot with the out of focus shot. I did notice that you were trying to find ways to make it more visually engaging adding in little gifs and whatnot. If you don't have footage I think these are fine ways to add more visual appeal. But also, Half of the video is visual the other half is auditory. Add some sounds in music or something. I think your biggest pitfall was not identifying what the most interesting part of the video was and rolling with it. Looking through your comments There was a guy that said "Nice Video! I find it very scary to attend language meetups..." It kind of parallels your experience with the Russian meet up. It's a very human feeling to be unconfident in your native tongue. I know I struggle with this and seeing someone who also has a similar struggle, fight it, it's engaging. That's what I would focus on. Finding the meat and rolling with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo, bro I recognize you. I reviewed a video of yours before and you were very quick to implement the changes I suggested. I don't think your implementation was the greatest but baby steps right. So right off at the beginning. You initially didn't have text there at all. IPostSwords was something you added in after I suggested adding in some kind of branding design. I wasn't a fan of it when I first saw it but now... I'm still not a fan. I didn't say anything previously because like I said earlier baby steps. Branding is something that requires you to think about your content at a higher level. I don't mean like you wouldn't be able to understand it but branding isn't just making a logo. You have to think about your core audience and what would appeal to them. Just adding text to a still isn't the greatest but it's a good first step. I would think critically about the people that you're trying to attract and create a logo around that. A great example of something like this would be a smaller YouTuber I found his name was DWRelive and his intro is simple. It's not complicated but it fits really in line with the people that he's marketing to. This intro/logo/still thing, in the beginning, doesn't really speak to anyone. It's just kind of text on swords. it's better than nothing... but just barely better. 0:03 - Good nice, I like you fixed your camera angle from the last time I saw. 0:28 - That shot lasted forever. I don't know if what software you're using but you should look up some things about easing. It adds a lot of production value to your video and it's a simple thing to do. Also, the choice to not immediately cut to the sword as soon as you started talking about it seems a little odd. It made the video feel like you grinded to a full stop. Next time I would show the B-roll with the VO as soon as I started talking about it. I would not start at a no-motion beginning either. I would have the shot slowly panning over when we first get to the shot and then end with motion as well. 1:12 - the crossfade transitions make it feel slower than it should. I think jump cuts are fine right here. 1:44 - Yo bro I'm so confused. How tf are you going to properly cut away to a B-roll shot with the proper motion and timing but, only 1 minute before, do a shitty cutaway to a still. WTF you can't just improve like that out of nowhere... fuck you... that's a joke. I would prefer more shots like this. This was well done and I approve of this B-roll shot and cutaway. 2:18 - god that made me so nervous. 2:29 - What are textiles? A simple little definition popping explaining that would've been nice or a picture of it would've been nice as well. 3:41 - I think that would've been a fantastic use of cards right there. It seems like a missed opportunity to me. Cards as in YouTube video cards. 4:42 - I used to work as an AGM for a restaurant on the strip so I know a little bit of the terminology that you're throwing around. Tang, Patina and whatever but it's not really inviting to people that don't know much about blades. Like I said a simple pop up of a definition of what you're talking about would do tons for you accessibility to uninformed viewers. 6:37 - Stay sharp, that's great I love that Ok, yeah, bro. You sound like you know what you're talking about which is a huge plus. You offer a lot of knowledge and people who are interested are more willing to sit through a lower quality video if there's something to gain from it. I'm not saying your video is lower quality but I'm just saying you have something ot offer. I like that you're making strides in both your editing and your equipment that you'll soon be upgrading. I think you need to focus on consistency though in your editing. Like I mentioned above, there were times where you did great other times where I was like wtf. I think at your size I would seriously start to consider branding because you're already pretty up there. A consistent brand throughout your video and channel will make it easier to market yourself. Look into it. If you want to hire out to do that you can, as a Youtuber starting out, you kind of have to do everything yourself but if you're inclined to spend that money and you think it's worth it, I think it's worth it. Fuck that sentence was fucked to shit bro. I'm tired as fuck can you tell. I curse more when I'm tired. GJ though strong foundation you just need to build upon it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like this is deja vu. I also previously reviewed one of your videos. If I remember correctly my advice to you was to create a story that follows throughout the video. Also, if I remember correctly again, I think that you didn't really understand that advice. Maybe It didn't explain it well enough when I initially said it. But basically it was just me saying make a cohesive narrative tying one sequence to another. It could be a theme or a feeling or something that connects the video together. 0:24 - I think this intro is good. A few things I would say. The colors are so dark. I liked the little white line you put in the beginning. It lightened up the beginning swirling motion of the shapes without being too obvious. Maybe incorporating that into more than just the first circle would help liven it up a bit. The logo itself is good I think. Maybe a little too colorful... sorry wrong term I think simplifying the colors taking away a few of gradients would be better if you wanted in the future to print this out. It's fine as it is right now but if you wanted to do more in the future with this logo I would try to simplify it a bit but only just a bit. The actual intro as a whole I think is missing a vital piece. Your name? Where is it? If I saw this and wanted to look you back up in the future where would I find you. What would I lookup? I don't know. I would scale this down a little bit and move it up to have space at the bottom for your name and incorporate it into the intro. Also, this isn't completely necessary but when it swirls out, I would've liked to see it as an alpha layer so we can get right into the video instead of it just swirling into black and then cutting. 1:52 - You have a lot of pauses when you speak. Especially since your not showing your face I think this could just be edited out to make it flow better whenever you're talking. I do this all the time. Whenever I talk I pause a lot just because I want to make sure my wording is correct and that I get my point across in the most efficient way possible without trying to cause confusion. But in videos, I just edit that pause out. 4:50 - I feel like this part right here could have been edited down to like a little gag moment instead of lingering on it for so long. Obviously, there are some server issues that are causing everyone to lag. It would've been funny to just point it out and then continue on to the next thing when the game starts working properly. Right now it just feels like it's too much time spent on this part of the video. 5:37 - Yeah you spent like a good 2 minutes on this part. I would've just had like a little gag reel for maybe like 30 seconds max and then moved on. 8:04 - Ok so it seems to be like a consistent issue. If this happened to me I probably just would've scrapped the whole video. It's not really interesting to see lags like this for extended periods of time. Sure for like a minute it's funny. Look no one is moving but an entire video where that's the case, I don't think would work and so far for me it's not working. 9:45 - This is a tense moment. I feel like putting in some music to emphasize that would've been great. Kind of a missed opportunity. 11:07 - Your reactions are also very subdued. I don't think that it's fun to watch. I want to feel your emotion in the video. When I play games I'm very much like you. Maybe less talkative I don't like to talk I just kind of play and enjoy it on my own. But if ever I'm doing like a gameplay video I know I have to turn up my reactions. It's just part of it. If you feel something just like amplify whatever it is you're feeling. 12:56 - I feel like there's a lot of missed opportunities to accentuate situations. I would just go over your video while your editing and feel those out and work around this. Right now it just feels like you did find those moments but never really put in the effort to let them shine. I think I watched enough of your video I don't know think you're going to do anything else really special but yeah that's what I would focus on. So as far as you animating things and putting them into your video. I think that's a great idea. I would look at Loserfruit. She has a similar style of content of her just playing games and she's actually one of the people that are more subdued as well but even her she gets involved in the game. Check her out and see what you can take away form it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you there are a lot of good points here. I appreciate the feedback. I did do a lot to try to brand myself obviously I didnt really work on implementation in video I'll definitely work more on that. I agree with you about the title I should've done more to try to incorporate more information into it than just the giveaway. This was my first go at trying to make my own thumbnail and I think in many ways it was ok but like you said it was disorganized the thing that I didnt like about it was the fact that it doesn't really keep in line with the rest of the branding. Thanks for all this and I'll improve on the next one and try to make changes to this video</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:29 - I really like your style that you bring. It's quaint and really homey it's nice. That being said the intro is too long. The text is a little hard to read. I think that's fine IF it was your own handwriting. This just seems like some generic handlettering font that you found. These kinds of fonts are better for a solid background on the web not really for video with a moving background. I would either look for a font that's a little thicker or see if you can somehow get your own handwriting in there. I think that would add a nice personal touch. The CC I think is a stylistic choice. It's being more flat and nordic serves your needs the best especially because most of the background is white. I think that was a good choice. Trying to accentuate colors is going to be hard with that white background good job on that. 2:55 - I have not seen anything like this before. It is very relaxing, I really don't know why I'm enjoying watching this. It kind of gives me that ASMR feels. Nevermind, it reminds me a lot of primitive technology where I'm justing seeing someone go through the process of creating something. Except you're not creating anything it's just you going throughout your day. It is very relaxing to see it done with this style. I think the background hum actually helps with this. Usually, I would say to take that hum out and give some noise reduction to the audio but it works in your favor in this case acting as a sort of white noise. 3:12 - I think your placement of the word Sautee is in a bad spot. I liked the other ones where you put in the black of the pan. It made it easier to read. This kind of makes everything seem messy. 5:58 - Not the biggest fan of this music choice. I feel like it's a bit too pop. I would've liked more subdued and calming music like you have in the rest of the video so far especially since you're repotting plants. It's like a very zen kind of activity. 7:55 - not really a video thing but I would've liked to see the top half sort of leaning off of the bottom half at an angle instead of just being stacked on top of each other. 9:10 - This was really nice. I really enjoyed this. I think that you have a good product here and there was even a story inside of it. It was really really nice. I think you made some mistakes but they were simple mistakes that you can fix the next time you make a video. Everything was sort of surface-level mistakes. Your eye for making videos like this is really good. I would continue. This is something I would watch to just relax I really did enjoy this good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So it just depends on the length of the game. If it's a short like 1 hour game like journey I will record the whole thing. Actually if it's a medium sized game like spiderman or uncharted I will also record the whole thing. But if it's a large game like red dead redemption 2 I will write a script go back and record the parts that I was referencing in the script and I'll try to recreate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ahhh... Come on bro. Let's take a step back and actually look at your content. The video you posted had audio mostly coming out from one side... I'm not trying to trash on you bro but you gotta look at your shit analytically and shit and see what the issue is. If the content is good like you say, you should be seeing people come in soon. Reading through your comments and replies I saw you say a lot "Well that doesn't matter because no one is here yet"? What? It sounds like you want all the rewards without any work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:04 - Yo this reminds me of DSLR Guide already. Maybe it's just cause you both kind of talk the same. Slow and have a lot of pauses. But reminds me a lot of him. 0:44 - Ok, that intro was nice. TBH it was a tad bit long. Just a little like maybe like half a second. It just felt like it lingered on for a bit too much. 1:31 - So, I'm currently studying UX design. Really enjoying it thx for asking. I would avoid doing this. The pop up looks like the End Screen clickable pop-up. It just adds a layer of confusion for the viewer that is unnecessary. If you want, you could've cut to a clip of the video and pointed towards the card icon like you did but this is confusing. BIG NO NO! IN UX! 1:52 - I didn't want to say it because it's subtle and I don't really know how you messed it up. But the audio doesn't sound right. It sounds like you were doing some noise reduction but you pushed it too far. Funnily enough there's still noise. I don't know if that's what actually happened but that's what it sounds like. That's the first thing that hit me when I started your video. Also, you sound a little muffled. I think that might be because of the processing you did to the audio but it's a little hard to understand you. 3:17 - I read someone else's comment saying you gave wrong information about pricing. You put the Amazon links in the description and I think you did your due diligence I think you're fine. But if you do want to do a bit of CYA in the future you can just say. Prices may vary. I think that's a bit too much. Like I said I think you're fine but just in case you want to. 4:24 - Don't jump into Premiere before you do a comparison... OOOooo I'm gonna tell on you if you do, do that. 4:33 - 911 Yeah uh I just watched someone's video and they were talking about the quality of audio on 2 separate systems and didn't do a comparison. I need you over here immediately. 4:38 - Like I said, NO NO! 4:38 B - If you line up the audio manually without using Adobe's built-in sync and maybe explain a little about scratch audio I will be very upset. 5:18 - Thank god. I was about to be a very angry boi. 6:58 - Ok good. I like this so far. The only thing I would've done differently not the delete the audio on track one because once you place it over, it automatically deletes it but I mean it's not bad that you put that in. It's just an extra step. 7:12 - I know what you're doing but I feel like if I didn't I would be having a hard time trying to follow what you just did. Maybe explaining what you're doing while you're doing it would've been better so people can have a better understanding of what's going on. 7:27 - I would've not made those squares and rectangles do that wave effect. It's kind of distracting when you're trying to focus on the subscribe button. Maybe just like photoshop in some of your older videos or something. But making the wave effect just takes away from what you're trying to show. Ok, overall, I think it was ok. Not great but not terrible. I think you have a good foundation in the technical aspects of making videos. I don't think you have a good handle on presentation though. It's ok it comes with times and it's difficult for people to get up on that. Things I would say you have to improve. Enunciation. I know you have an accent very obvious I can hear it. But I was having a hard time understanding you. There's this I think Swedish guy on youtube his name is like AndyXd or something like that. He does video creation tutorials as well and English is not his first language but I can still understand everything he's saying because, I think, he understands that English is not his native tongue so he is extra careful to make sure that what he's saying is audibly coherent. Second, Just like your presentation overall, it was just kind of bland. I compared you to DSLRguide at the beginning of this review and I stand by it. But, he is bland too. He has a lot of good content and I think that there's a sort of scale. The more valuable information you have the more people are willing to put up with lower quality producttion. I'm not saying your production is lower quality but I'm just saying maybe your information isn't that great. I would just say spruce it up a little bit. Get more active make jokes, something to separate you from the crowd. But overall, it's ok. I use to be in your demographic and I think that if I was still in it I would not subscribe. Just because it took too long to get to your actual content. And then there was so little information for an almost 8-minute video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:30 - I have no idea what's going on right now... that's your fault hahaha 1:25 - I don't get a lot of these jokes. I think most of them aren't really jokes, to be honest. It was just you making observations. "Oh that's expensive" "Oh that goods". I'm just not really seeing the appeal right now. 2:48 - WHOA WHOA! YOU BETTER STOP THAT SHIT RIGHT NOW! You have VO with music that's not an instrumental. WTF! It was ok before because it was really quite. This isn't mixed right. We'll see in a few seconds but if it continues like this. NO! FUCK! 2:53 - FUCK! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? 3:34 - It felt so short and I didn't understand what was going on through the whole thing. I would say like try to incorporate a story into your video. It just started out with you in your room dancing and then at the market and then at an airport and then... what? what was going on? I didn't really think the jokes were funny or... i don't know jokes... but if you and others think it's funny I don't think that's something I can knock you on. Like literally adding structure is the only thing I can give you. I don't have enough information on anything else to try to help you improve. That was the biggest issue for me. I read your About: but like. A viewer shouldn't have to read something else in order to understand what's going on. Everything should be contained in the video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:09 - Ok starting off this seems like a joke video. I don't think it's because you're younger. I think it's just with the way that you're presenting yourself. Nike shirt with a laptop in your arm with a whiteboard that is almost completely off the screen and 4 clocks with no names connected with them. It all seems orchestrated to be a satire on these types of videos and not a legit product. 0:29 - Is this a joke? I really don't know. Because right now I'm leaning towards the joke end. "I'm going to show you how I made a shit ton of sales but had a Net Loss Stay tuned!" Hahaha I mean if it is a joke it's really well done. Like I legitimately don't know. 1:08 - I'm really enjoying this. This is one of the funniest things I've seen. I'm not joking, if this is you being serious I'm so sorry. But this is really funny. 1:12 - Bro there's no way this isn't a joke. You literally highlighted something that's not even in frame. BRO! you pulling the biggest prank. This is great! 1:51 - 50% wtf. That's crazy small margins. If you're already down 50 I don't see how you could be making money. I can't believe that this isn't a joke. 2:51 - Bro come on. I really can't tell now. you're literally writing off-screen and explaining the concept of shipping. I can't tell bro is this a joke? 4:22 - Bro! Ok, if this is serious I want you to take all the things I said and change them to make yourself more professional. I'm so convinced right now that this is a joke though. If this is a joke don't change anything. It's one of the best things I've seen on YouTube. This is really great! 4:39 - Hahahaha come on! "Arguably" Come on bro hahahaha. It was a Net loss so "arguably" I could've done better. BRO this is genius. This video is cracking me up! I am so convinced that this is a joke. I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying that to let you know, I caught on to your tricks boi. Hahaha, this was a great video. On the off chance that this wasn't a joke. Let me tell you why I "think" it's a joke. ("Think" because I'm pretty sure this is a joke). You didn't present the video by saying. "What I learned from my first failure," You said I lost money on Amazon and now I'm going to show you how to do the SAME! This is the second thing that made me think it was a joke. It's a clever jab at the way that people always present information like it's valuable even when it's something you don't want to do. The first thing that made me think this was a joke. Was your framing your set design. You have a whiteboard that is literally below your waste. Clocks with no Timezone markings. Your wording in certain parts. Like, "Arguably" that was really good. You didn't say, "In hindsight, I understand that was a bad decision but at the time I was thinking... Blah blah blah." You said Arguably like "Well it's ok that I lost money". You spent time talking about shipping costs at such a surface-level level. I think if you were just pointing that out you should've just said "another expenditure was the Freight cost due to the size of the product it was a larger expense than I was anticipating." Something like that. But instead, you go in-depth about, not how they calculate cost but, the unit of measurement they use in freight shipping. WHAT?! hahaha that's so genius bro. Like I said I'm not convinced this isn't all a joke but those are the things and more that made me think this video was a joke.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have not seen David Dobrik's videos. I've seen like clips and what not of him and I always thought it wasn't funny or it wasn't for me. But I guess I should watch him if people are getting inspiration from him so I can be educated on the subject. Even still, I think if I watch his videos there will still be structure. I'm going to watch one real quick brb. Ok starts off with a joke just like your video. But he actually says this video is a vlog. That's an improvement that you didn't have. The jokes on his videos I don't think are funny but they're jokes at least. Hahaha but he even setups a clip before he showed it. I think that's something you need to do. Yeah I was right. I don't like this guys videos. I don't think he's funny. But things to take away. Energy. His energy was always high. More energy = more engaging. Setup. He gave context to the things that were going on, on-screen Flow. Joke joke Meat. He made you laugh and then got into the actual meat of the video. In case, you're wondering which video I watched it was "WE HAD TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM!!". Those 3 things are the things that I got from his video that I think you need to incorporate into yours.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:07 - I usually don't talk about titles because it's not my strong suit. This title, however, I think is really bad. There's a lot of airsoft people making videos and every one of their videos has an interesting title. This not so much. 1:22 - I think your camera needs to be adjusted. I couldn't see what was going on this whole confrontation. 4:46 - I don't know there's not a lot here to catch my attention. I feel like once you have full editing software you'll be able to do more. I paused right here just because the Text it wasn't something I think would be popping up worthy. I was too busy falling. I don't think that merits a pop-up text like that. 5:26 - That was great. This is the end of the video. I think you have to work a little on your VO. Like what you say and also your presentation. It just sounded like you were bored when you recorded it. Maybe it's cause you're nervous but that's something I would try to work on. Generally, I think airsoft videos are A lot slower than most other videos. It's mostly just people running around and shooting like this. But I feel like this wasn't as quick. There wasn't enough action. It felt like you could've clipped almost every clip by like 5 seconds on the front and the back. There were a few times like I mentioned where the camera angle was too low. I would just not put those in the video. Once you get full editing software I have some ideas on ways you could improve. I know that mobile software is very limiting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:07 - Ok, I like your set kinda. I think that the left quarter of the frame is a little boring. I know it's a lot to ask for to like include something in the background but I think it would help tie everything together. It's good better than most. Just that left quarter of the frame. 0:41 - I think that's a bit of a missed opportunity to add like a little screen cap of you looking up Succulent or something to help illustrate your point. 0:50 - hahaha that made me laugh. I think it fell a little flat because... I'm not too sure why. Maybe the delivery was a little off on it. I think it might be the audio it was so quiet. I really don't know why. I liked that joke it wasn't a perfect landing though. It was good though. 1:39 - It's the delivery. I feel like your a little bit too monotone. It's a little just not engaging whenever you tell a joke. I think the jokes are good. But delivery could use a bit of work. I just want to say it's not like terrible I just think it could be improved. 2:05 - I noticed that you did a cut right here to speed up the pacing. I'm not a big fan of that just because it's a little awkward having that cut in there like that. I would've just redone that line. But if you did want to use that take. You could've hidden the cut with a zoom in. But again that would be awkward because zoom in's like that are usually meant to emphasize a point. It's just a little thing that was a little awkward. 3:28 - I think the lampshading would've worked better if you sounded more disappointed in yourself. Again it's about delivery. I think that's the main thing that's holding this back is just the delivery is slightly off. It's a bit too subdued. 6:10 - Ooh, I think that was another missed opportunity again. "I've seen a lot of weird stuff" You could've like done a call back to a previous video by doing an overlay or something. Or you could've just listed out weird stuff. It doesn't even have to be things you've actually seen. It could've just been like ridiculous things that you think of on the spot. Do a little bit of improv. Not a mistake necessarily but just a missed opportunity in my opinion. 6:30 - That was good. That was funny. I realized putting periods makes it seem like I'm being sarcastic but I'm not. That made me laugh out loud as well. LOL as the kids say. Overall, I would say the video is pretty good. I enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of commentary videos as I used to be so that's the main reason I wouldn't subscribe. But if I were I would definitely subscribe to you. The only thing that I think you need to work on a bit more is just focusing on delivering your lines better. It kind of felt like you were just reading off jokes you wrote. It didn't feel like they were thoughts that you had on the spot. But it was good overall. Enjoyed. Will like. Boop that's a like on your video.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:08 - I feel like I make this same mistake. Where I write a script and I try to follow it to a T and it just sounds a little awkward. I would focus on making it sound more natural when you speak. Maybe when you're writing your script say it out loud and adjust it wherever you think it needs to be adjusted to make it fit your voice more. 0:18 - That was a weird pause right. I think you were trying to showcase the kill but it was in such an awkward place. 1:28 - Not a fan of this text or the way it dissolved onto the screen. The text looks boring. It looks like it was meant for an information page where they're just trying to convey as much information in a cohesive manner. I don't think that's the vibe you want to be giving off. The dissolve also just looked ugly. 2/10 transition I did watch the whole video. I think it was a fine video. You seemed a little quiet. Like not quiet just low or something. Sad like you were having a sad day. But also not really that either. I don't know it felt like you were just not feeling recording the video. I think some of the onscreen elements can be improved. I think it was a fine video. On a scale of 1-10 I would say like 6/10 not bad and it's something I wouldn't mind watching but I don't think this video would entice me to come back to your channel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:20 - I don't like the choice of adding in the ding noise effects to the plus signs. It just seems odd to me. 1:12 - That pacing there was a little off. I feel like it slowed down the video a touch too much. It wasn't like a major issue but it was just enough to be noticeable to me. 1:49 - The audio talking in the background is a little distracting. I find myself trying to hear what they're saying rather than what you're saying. It is really quiet which helps mitigate this issue but I still think that maybe just getting some generic audio from a different portion of the game and using that audio instead would've been less distracting. 4:42 - I think you could've done more to emphasize this right here. Maybe reading it out. But I think reading it out would've slowed down the video as well. I think the best solution would've been to use a magnifying effect so we can better see what you're talking about. 5:17 - Again that choice of the dings doesn't make sense to me. The last little error noise did. I thought that was nice but not the dings. If anything I would've done like a pop sound when the assets came in not the plus signs. Ok, You already know bro. I like your shit. I really enjoyed this video. I think you made some surface-level mistakes but your foundation is great. The little additions that you added for people that have seen previous videos were a really nice touch. Like really nice. The little rock with the eyes. The magic users. It was really good it rewards people for watching previous videos without alienating new viewers. You should definitely keep that up. Really good video I really enjoyed it. rating it out of 10. I would give this a 1/10 - dogshit you should give up. Jk it was good : gt;</TEXT>

UX DESIGN RULE NUMBER 1 - Don't make me think! hahaha. I literally just said one thing in the timecode portion. I think your commentary was actually alright. It was good. The video was a bit short I would've liked it to be longer. I think adding some anecdotes just about I don't know anything could've helped buff the time on the video and shown more of your comedy. Actually not bad surprised. Good job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:23 - Really really really think this is dogshit so far. Just kidding. Your energy is really good. I like the whole vibe you're giving off. The editing is really good. I'm really impressed by it. Good job so far. I know we're only 23 seconds in but I like it a lot so far. 0:34 - Mmmm I think it's a bit useless to have a box with the same pattern as the background and separate the 2. I would've either gone for a different pattern or just made it white. Probably just gone for the white myself because white and red and black is Youtube's color scheme and it would've helped to associate it more to a youtube player. 1:30 - BRO! STOP! I FUCKING HATE THAT SHIT! LOOK AT ME! NOT AT THE FUCKING VIEWFINDER! God, I'm about to have an aneurysm. Fun fact: humans have a really strong and precise ability to know what another person is looking at. The angles can be a few degrees off and a human could tell from a few meters away without much issue. This is found in more social creatures. Dogs, for instance, do not have this ability. Dolphins do. Jk about the dolphins I'm not sure but it wouldn't surprise me. 1:40 - Speaking of dogs... Also really like this cutaway to your dog. That's some extra attention to detail that other people wouldn't do. GJ. 2:16 - Bro you better stop with that shit. I swear to CHRIST! 2:50 - Hahaha strange cutaway. It was funny so I won't dock you too many points. 3:43 - These cuts could've been a little tighter I think. It was ok I just think the execution could've been done a little better 5:07 - Interesting. I actually don't know what you were pointing out... Your hair? but it was like that at the beginning, right? why'd you point it out now? 6:10 - I think you're a pretty good editor. 7:57 - Hahaha that was good that made me laugh. 9:16 - Whoa that was a bit aggressive. That kinda hurt my feelings man... shit... Overall, I think this video was really good. Your editing choices at times were questionable but weren't bad. I think you're good at that end. Your energy level was great. It was engaging the entire time without feeling forced. Good on that as well. Yeah, it's a really good video and I think you have a future doing this. The only thing that I would say is that you are right about it being more difficult to grow if you don't have a consistent type of content. But I also agree that it's more important to be consistent with uploads than to have consistent content. But that's one of the main reasons that I'm holding off on subscribing. I just don't know what you're going to be producing. I don't want to watch only some of your videos. But again overall, really really good. Really good 9/10</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:02 - ew boring intro. 0:07 - What was that cliping. ew. 0:10 -WTF IS THIS MIXING. EW! 1:27 - ok that got me that was funny. 2:10 - Second time not as funny... ew 2:23 - I think the music is really helping you out here. It's a little too loud though. Your commentary is ok leaning on the side of being a little bland but as I said the music is really helping you out. 3:13 - I think the most important thing when making a video is having a story. That's the number one thing that I think most people don't realize. Right now, your story stagnates. The protagonist (you) wants Iron. Pro sees Iron but also sees enemy (Conflict). Pro is deciding whether to risk it (decision). Great set up it really is but... we've been here for like the past 2 minutes. Pick up the pace. Either go or don't either is fine. This is an issue in editing not necessarily when you're playing the game because when you get to post you can just edit out the boring shit. 3:32 - too long. I paused at the second I thought it lasted too long. So like go back 1 second and that's where you should've cut or maybe like half a second 4:01 - I would play this up more. I get that you're worried and don't want to die. I think in hardcore mode there's permadeath. I'm not too sure I don't really play Minecraft but I'm assuming that's the reason why you're being so careful. But just play up this emotion more so we can get more invested. People are simple creatures really. We see scare we get scared. We see happy we happy. See anger we anger. you hungie me hungie. smash smash boom boom. 4:14 - I don't get that fortnite sfx 6:16 - That timing was good. 10:38 - Speaking of getting sleep. I think I should get some sleep too I'm really tired. I think I gave some pretty good criticism tbh. More energy. Energy = money. More diverse commentary. Diverse commentary = money. I think your music choice was good. It was fun and bright and it helped out a lot. I don't think the text overlays worked as-is. I think you have to work on gathering a better font and doing some animation to the text to make it more appealing. But not bad out of 10. I would give a this 4 kneeslaps out of 10. Yum yum.

"Two Trucks" doesn't really fit well with this font. 0:17 - Again the font isn't that great and it's really small not very noticeable. 6:19 - I'm not finding this too engaging to be honest. I don't really know you or your friends and this isn't really helping me figure out who you guys are. It just feels like I'm watching a bunch of friends hanging out and I'm not included. Like I'm just here. 7:39 - I think I'm gonna stop right here. It really just wasn't engaging for me. I don't know any of you and I didn't find the humor funny. I would work on a way to make the viewer feel included in the video. I don't know how you would do that. It feels very jumbled as well. I understand that this is like a compilation video, but I think that the thing holding it back is the fact that at some points we're thrusted into situations without context and other times we are introduced to a situation with no resolution. when you make a compilation video there has to be a story. Even if it's a really simple short story that's fine. But each clip has to have its own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hahaha I've never enjoyed reading someone's review of my review but this was funny. As far as the anger at looking at your viewfinder. It was a joke jest. Kinda it's a little irritating when I see people do that but only slightly but I think it's a good thing to point out and be aware of when recording. Fun fact again mkbhd a tech youtuber hes really famous. Also has a bad habit of doing this but to a much lesser degree so it's a hard habit to get rid of but like I said it's something good to point out. As far as timing with the editing. It's just like watching a shit ton of content and getting the feel for it. In design theres a difference between optical symmetry and mathematical symmetry. Theres this good explanation of the G in Google is not a perfect curve the bottom is actually at a larger radius than the top. And even though its not perfectly symmetrical as far as values it looks symmetrical to the eye. Anyways the reason I brought that up is because editing is similar. Where something could be the same length during cuts 3:43 is what I'm referring to but it still doesn't feel right because your brain process time differently for different shots. Theres this whole study done on that where people are actually really bad at comparing time. My point is that it seemed a little slow only just a bit. Cutting it down a frame or 2 on certain shots could've helped. I think I even said in the review though that its questionable. I would've played around with that sequence of shots and see what felt the best. Idk I could've ended up with the same product you have but to me it just felt a little long at some shots. Like literally 1 or 2 frames too long. Not a big deal. Lastly the ending... that was joke hahaha I think your fine with ending your videos like that. Ok bye! : gt;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:10 - I like this intro. The only thing I would say is that the text is a bit out of place. It just feels like it shouldn't be there. The font, the size, the color. If it were bigger maybe taking up the screen it wouldn't feel that out of place. Right now I feel like if I wasn't really paying attention I wouldn't even notice that text. 0:14 - Ooo. Yeah, I just wasn't really a fan of that title pop in. It seemed just so random and it went away so unceremoniously. The intro as a whole I thought was good. I want to give a suggestion but I have to see the rest of the video. If it applies I'll tell it later if not then don't worry about it. 0:26 - You should close that window. I hear a lot of traffic outside. MMMM thinking about it... Actually now I don't know because if you closed the window the echo would be worse. This situation that you have yourself in right now is a lose-lose situation as far as audio goes. I would keep that transition and quickly transition over again to a better spot to record. 0:38 - You sound bored with the video yourself bro. You gotta keep the energy up. If you sound like you don't want to make the video. Why would I want to watch it? You know. It's a difficult thing to do when you're first starting out and as I understand it you are starting out right now. But that's something to keep in mind. Your energy. 1:12 - Holy shit 2 hours. DMV time that's kinda fast as fuck. Damn. It takes 2 hours just to get told how long we have to actually wait to get helped usually. Also, you seem a little nervous. I don't blame you. I would be nervous if I was recording myself out in public but that's why this type of content is for me (to make). 2:05 - Hahaha that lady in the back made me laugh. She's just like staring off into the tracks waiting. It just seemed like she had so much going on. Hahaha that was funny. The reason I bring this up though. I think you already know. Energy bro. I found myself kind of not paying attention to you because it just seemed like you were going through the motions of telling us what you were going to be doing. I think that's the last time I'll bring it up just cause I feel like I already hit that point too many times. 2:56 - Ok, I think that was an odd framing. I thought that the person in the blue shirt was you for a second and your girlfriend or wife was holding the camera. But it was not. I think just being more aware of how your framing your shot would help with not having issues like this. 3:44 - WHA? why'd you let that shot linger on so long. I felt like you could've cut it when you said "We are here, wherever we are." and then cut. But you had like a good 5 seconds of just extra footage. It felt like you were going to ask her a question but then... it just cut. That was so weird. 5:53 - haha I stopped it almost at the exact same frame of the thumbnail. But the reason why I stopped was because I just wanted to say as a general feel. It just feels a bit too slow. The editing isn't that tight. It feels like a lot of the shots linger on for a bit too long. 9:08 - That's another prime example of just letting shots linger. OK, so I actually want to try to edit this myself and see if I can help improve the pacing. But before I do that. I think the main takeaways are just getting more comfortable with editing and being more energetic on camera. You said it yourself that you felt a little weird recording yourself in public so I think that will just come with time. I can tell that you put a lot of effort into your video but I think some of the execution was not the best. Timelapses running a bit too long. Shots linger and whatnot. But I can definitely tell you put a lot of effort. The best example of this was when you went into your apartment, set up the camera and framed it properly and then went outside again and acted coming back into your apartment. That's some shit I would not like to do, it's so much work for one shot. But you did it good job. Ok brb I want to see if I can help this video's pacing. [Re-edited Video](https://youtu.be/tD8juS3NoSQ) So basically all I did was cut out parts I thought didn't really contribute to the video. Just a lot of small things. If you noticed I actually put in the title in the beginning a little later. I think it was 1 frame later just because it didn't feel right when I was watching it. It felt a little off. The font is better in my opinion. It's thicker has a better sense of exploration. The thing I don't really like with it was just that it blended in to the background so maybe searching for a better font would be better. Speaking of blending into the background I did blur that out a little just give the text better readability. And with the pacing I just did a lot of J-cuts. I did this really quick so the music sometimes sounds jank at parts but that's just cause all the audio was on 1 track for me. You can still do these things if you're cooking from scratch. But yeah those are the things I think you need to improve on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1:02 - Ok, that was really funny. "Oh it's enlarged to show detail" hahahaha. 2:33 - Hahaha god that's great! 4:10 - Stunt Coordinator. This is great. Ok, so I recently reviewed a video that I thought was going for the same concept that you're trying to do... Turns out they weren't doing a parody.... they were being genuine... felt a little bad about that one. But the main takeaways I got from him was that the more oblivious you are to your own ineptitude and present it as a skill the more funny it will be. Also their set design was horrible but in a good way. [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1XCXK1tI8**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1XCXK1tI8) That's the video if you want to check it out. It had me crying it was really funny. It's not meant to be but it was really really funny. They took the tropes of business channels (Whiteboards, Multiple clocks, etc.) and changed it just enough to be useless. For example, my favorite thing they did was put literally half of their whiteboard off of frame so you couldn't see it and continued to write on it like everyone could see it. I'm not saying to do exactly that but things like that, where you point out cliches in other channels and present in a really genuine way but do it stupidly. The only thing I would say is that the jokes are a little sparse but at the same time I think it helps whenever you do tell a joke to make it more impactful. The swatch really made me laugh and it was perfectly timed because I was thinking "When is the next joke going to come" at that point. So the timing was perfect. Like the part where you're just talking about the pasta wasn't really funny but I think it helped to sell the fact that you're dumb or your character is dumb I mean. I really enjoyed this video. It's a little short but I did enjoy it a lot. Subbed hoping to see something come out soon. Really funny!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok I appreciate everyone has different opinions and my opinion is just another one but I disagree with some of the things you are saying. And the only reason I'm commenting is that I think implementing the faster cuts and taking off the stumbles ore silence vastly changes the feel of the video. Normally, I would agree that faster pacing and having a solid intro is more beneficial but this isn't a serious video it's meant to be funny and those things add to the comedy. You can disregard this if you don't agree but that's just my 2 cents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the compliments on the audio. I was thinking about a way to make the video side more engaging. I don't show my face on camera mainly because I don't have equipment that I'm satisfied with so I tried to think of a way to add some visual flair. I did play around with the idea of having like the border thing you were talking about but I felt like that wasn't as visually pleasing as the soundwaves so that's ultimately what I stuck with. I think if the guest is comfortable with it I could ask for a video feed and just keep my side as the audio waveform that would be something to think about. This is actually my 2nd ever podcast I've ever done so I'm not really too big into this space yet. But I really appreciate the reference to [Anchor.FM](https://Anchor.FM) I'll definitely check that out! Thanks again for the feedback I'll see what I can do about everything! !givelambda</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Uhh... I dont get this. Influencers are a thing. If someone like Jake Paul went up and did this the return would be pretty sizable I believe. Especially if all hes asking for is a free room. I would jump at that if I was a hotel owner. The only thing is that she has very low numbers. I would've asked exactly what kind of returns she got for the other hotel. This hotel owner just seemed like he was insulted and started off the email very passive aggressively. If I wasnt interested I would've just said something like. No, were not looking for any promotion at the moment and I'm not sure what kind of returns we would see even if we were. The audience is have is on the smaller size as well, but perhaps in the future we could work something out. Thanks for your interest. Easy no bridges are burnt and it wasnt passive aggressive and in the future if they do get their numbers up maybe there could be a form of partnership that would be mutually beneficial. As far as the social media thing that he said. He was very keen on bringing up his own numbers and even promoting his own blog to her. Like wtf hahaha it all just reads like he was a failed blogger that's jealous of others success. I'm not saying she is, I've never heard of her and in general I'm not interested in vloggers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have to track it. I would had a green screen with tracking dots in the programming window so you dont have to manually track it. It also looks digitally imposed. Probably because it was but if you ad sort of light tinted effect and try to make it match how the screen looks. Maybe a slight desaturation. It has to be subtle enough so it's not noticeable but not slight enough that it looks digitally imposed. Yeah but I would make a green screen with tracking dots. You could even do it in priemere actually just make a green solid or blue. I think blue might be better actually and then make like 5 black squares 1 in the middle and the other 4 in the corners and just take it into ae and track that shit. But yeah Edit: yeah just looking at it again I noticed the that you! YOU! That's it's just you. But really. The obs logo was like imposed ontop of your hand and so was the black box in the timeline. Idk how you managed to do that. You can just mask the effect to only the program window so it doesn't bleed to the other pieces of the computer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently studying ux design rn. I'm going to lambda school I'm only in my first week but so far it seems really good. They have a lot of focus on getting you a job and teaching real skills that will be applicable in a job environment. The only thing is. It's pretty expensive and it's a long course 9 months if your doing it full time and i think 18 months if your doing part time. But theres no upfront cost and they dont start charging you until you get a job over a certain. Threshold. Usually 50k. I'm really enjoying it so far. It's really collaborative and they are really helpful and it seems like they care about our success. And you get 1 on 1 time with your own TL and they provide you a lot of resources. Again it's expensive and a lot of time commitment but it's really in depth from what i can tell. I was was watching a student who finished their web course and he was spewing out information like it was on the back of his hand and previous he didnt have any coding knowledge.

    <TEXT>For that, the Youtubers probably have their management contact the business and allow them to use the music. If not, they probably just use the music without asking and the most companies won't do anything as far as repercussions because it would be a bad look on them. But the companies have the right to take down the video or monetize it if it's not within fair use. Most of the time it falls under fair use and companies can't do anything about it. It's a really complicated subject and lawyers are the only ones that can give real advice about this but if you're a small YouTuber like under 10,000 subs I think you should be fine. That's small enough for people to not really care and in the future, I would just focus on trying to find music that is royalty free. Royalty free doesn't mean free. The youtube channel u/asbeastos was talking about. I would advice against those. You don't know where they source their music and if they steal the music you would be liable if you use that music even if you got it from them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:01 - Oo. That mic quality. I don't know. It doesn't seem the best. 0:10 - Oo. That intro. That looks very nice. I would change the amount that's going on, on the page. Three different things are moving, and they're all asking for your attention. I would change it so that only the most important thing is moving. Since it's an intro, probably the most important thing is your channel name. Everything else, I would try to figure out a way to make it static. 0:24 - Ewwy that mic quality. I get that there are restrictions on people's budgets, but like using something as simple as a phone could help you out. 0:59 - I like your commentary so far. BUT you can edit. It's dragging a bit too long. Just edit it down a bit. You have that power. 1:06 - I hate the fact that people are doing the censoring unironically now. If you're not censoring for a joke, I would not say curse words in a video. I find that irritating personally. 1:35 - I go back and forth. If you look at my previous reviews, I sometimes tell people like. "Hey no one cares about you, you shouldn't focus on yourself, You should focus on your topic in the video." But I realized that youtube is a very personality-driven site. So you should be showing some of your personality. But I think that this is too slow right now. We're 1:35 in, and you don't know what this video is about, and I don't know what this video is about. And why am I watching this? Well, now it's because I'm reviewing it, but if I weren't reviewing it, I would've clicked off at this point. Too slow. Speed it up with editing. I don't know, like add X2 onto it. I just mean cut out parts that aren't important. 2:34 - I think that joke could've landed if you let it sit a little bit longer. Or something, I don't know it just didn't land for me at that point. The timing was off a bit. Almost funny but not really. 2:38 - I remembered something about the joke, and I can go into it. Leave a comment on this if you want me to talk about it. But I think it's such a fringe case maybe it does not apply to you but perhaps not let me know. 2:56 - the \*PERTH is a bit hard to read. The background is so busy, and there are bright and dark points. I know you put it up there for a bit, but changing its location to the left side would've made more sense. It's darker, and you already told us (with the STREETX Text) that the text is going to be showing up on the left side. 3:45 - I think the text pop-ups are a good idea but the implementation of it here is poorer quality. The placement is so odd and there's nothing else accompanying it. I don't think you need to add more to accompany it all the time. But I would say like 75% of the time. Yes. 4:46 - WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! THERE COWBOY! How tf are you going to put a stroke when strokes have not been present. You know what I'm talking about don't act like you don't. Fucking inconsistent ass motherfucker. I'm not mad just like... joke hehe... I hate myself. 5:25 - Ok the logo also has a black square around it. You win this time. 5:33 - Again I think this is a cool concept but poor execution. I don't know how to fix this. I like how the text overlaps with each other. The light grey to distinguish the letters. Maybe that's why it didn't work for me. Maybe just having it the same color would've been cooler. I don't know. I would have to play with this in order to find out how to make it work. Cool idea though. 6:00 - I would've not put that "bruh" in there. I get it. It's a meme or some shit but it overlapped with what you were saying. Big no-no. Readability before anything else. 9:43 - I don't like that white border on top of the asset. Yucky IMO. I think I mentioned everything that I wanted to mention. Mic quality is a big issue for me. I'm not a fan of this type of content so I can't really comment on that. I am not your audience. I think I gave you a good number of things to work on. Yeah, that's basically it... ok bye.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:32 - Hmmm. Hmmm. I don't know. I like the hook in the beginning but I also feel like I'm lacking too much information for the amount of time that I've been watching the video. Just barely now do I know what you're talking about. The title doesn't tell me much and I don't really have a reason to click on this video except for... well I don't know why I would click on this video. 1:42 - This is just semantics but I think it's pretty important when you're doing a review. Graphics and Design are two separate things. Saying graphics and then talking about the art design was confusing to me. 2:16 - lul head pop. 3:00 - However! jk. You said them so close to each other and with the same intonation, it was just offputting. I do this often as well. I repeat a lot of words when I'm writing a script but you have to remember that this is going to be spoken aloud. So you have to take that into consideration. 4:38 - Whoa that was super noticeable. Usually, when people make audio hiccups I don't mention it because usually, it's not that big of a deal. You've done quite a bit already. But everyone does quite a bit in their videos. But that mouth wetting sound was so like out of nowhere. I just felt like I had to point that out. I think overall the video was ok. I think the biggest issue you have right now "having a reason to watch this video" The title doesn't tell me anything. The thumbnail isn't that eyecatching. And even the beginning of the video was lacking in information. Discoverability is what I would focus on if I were you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:21 - Ok it's a joke I get it. I want to see where this goes. 3:22 - I think that maybe you could've cut off in the middle of the scream that might've been funnier. I think this video shows that you have a good foundation but I just don't know how well this video concept worked. But keep going at it. Usually, I would have more to say but you did pretty well. The only thing that was off-putting to me was some of those sounds of cracks. Some sounded really real but then some sounded super fake. I don't know if that was the joke but for me, it didn't really connect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:56 - I really like this intro I don't know why. It's so happy and there's a lot of obvious mistakes but I kind of like them. It makes it give it like this homemade vibe that's really nice. 1:03 - ew, I didn't like that sound effect. yucky. 1:06 - Hahaha wtf it took you 3 seconds to start talking. Just start right at the beginning. In my videos. I actually start talking before the music fades away completely. It just felt like forever before you started talking. 1:14 - Whatever processing you did on this is not great. It's a bit distracting. 3:22 - I definitely think that the pacing could be massively improved. Editing your voice down can help. I was thinking about making this video about making invisible cuts in VO. But I don't know how interested people would be in it. Basically it's when you stutter and then you repeat the word but you kind of slur the beginning of the second word. Then you just cut in the middle of the sound of the word and connect them together and if you do it correctly it's seamless. I do this all the time for my videos but it's time-intensive and sometimes the result is a bit noticeable. But when it works well, it works well. I did this podcast and the interviewee messed up saying "Tokyo" twice. Cut that shit together. OMG listening back to it myself. I was like... "where did I make that cut again" It was super seamless. Anyways. Editing. 4:47 - ok... that was funny. FUCK! hahaha, that got a little chuckle out of me. Watching this video makes me feel like there's a missed opportunity. It just goes by so slow. But I think it's funny and the cutaways are really good. I like the unscripted vibe that I got from it. I don't know if it is unscripted but I like it. There's a few reviewers I get that vibe from and it's always engaging but this was just too slow for that. Editing would be my main focus for you. Cut those silences and pauses out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shorter and funny is better. But let me 1up you. Longer and Funny is better than shorter and funny. I think you might be thinking like "No shit." But is it really a "No shit"? Why'd you ask this question? Probably because you think that those are you're only 2 choices. It really isn't. Creating a catalog of content that people can go back and enjoy is important. Just record more footage and get more moments from it and make long and funny videos.</TEXT>

I would've tried to get the point of the video close to the beginning. It felt like I was reading an article which is ok if it was an article, but it's a video.

    <TEXT>Hi, My name is Henry. I'm a student working on my capstone project for school, and I need to interview a few people about things relating to the refugee crisis. You don't have to be an expert or anything. You just have to be interested in the topic. It would be a short 15-minute interview either today after 4 pm PST or an interview tomorrow anytime between 10 am - 3 pm PST. If you're available, it would be fantastic if we could talk to you for a little bit. The project is a site where you can share personal stories of refugees. If you're interested, you can leave a comment, or if you could DM me, that would be great!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm... Ok, show me your wizard. Show me your black magic, I am intrigued. 1:56 - If I wasn't reviewing this. This is the point I would've clicked off. You're talking a lot about your own experience and your background which is good but I think that it should be condensed down a lot. Also, the comedy doesn't really work that well for me. 2:46 - WOW! actual content. Thank you, wizard! 5:08 - Wow ok... fucking shame me then. Sorry that people don't like me. 7:26 - Meta AF 7:29 - WHOA SUPER META! 8:54 - WTF META! 9:33 - I think right here really highlights the issue. I think you have enough actual content for like a solid 10 minuter good video. Maybe with a little bit of fluff to show your personality. NOT 16 minutes. Already I feel like you've repeated things a million times. 10:32 - I think a thing that makes everything seem so long-winded is the preface to every point. People do this a lot when they want to sell you like a training kit or something. It doesn't seem like that's what you're trying to do right now. It seems like you're actually giving out free information. But then why does it feel like that? Like you're trying to sell me something? Just give me what I want I don't need all this "And now for the main event" shit. 12:51 - I don't know I feel like everything I've seen isn't going to generate anything me for you to work on. I think I'm gonna stop right here. Ok, so like I said the video is too long. IT takes WAY too long to get to the actual content. That 1:56 marker I put in there is true. But also I think that my attention span is a lot longer and I'm easier to appease then most. In terms of watch time. There's this quote from Steve Krug that I like a lot. "Get rid of half of the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left". I'm not too sure if you're familiar with steve but he's not a YouTuber or anything he's in UX and I feel like a lot of there mentality can transfer over to making videos. This video is too long for the size that you are right now. If you already have a following making longer videos will increase your viewer retention but right now you can't do that. Just cut down get rid of the filler and that's it. Ok, good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm actually in school right now for a coding boot camp thing. As far as I've research its one of the longer coding boot camps at 9 months I know usually they're like 3 or 4 months. Anyways I'm not studying code there but I am in school right now. 0:36 - Ooo. That intro feels so slow. If you made that intro I would work on it a bit and make it go faster. If you didn't you could just do a quick little "r" remapping if you know what I mean. Hehe. 0:54 - Hey you know what I appreciate that. 1:43 - False, that was longer than a second you are uneducated and I no longer have any trust in you as an instructor. jk. 3:42 - God, I love you. You're alright too. I really appreciate this time stamping a lot. let me scroll down and see if you have it in the comments... no. Description... yeah. A pinned comment is better than description FYI. 4:46 - This isn't that big of a deal but I just noticed the back the whiteboard. How 2 Start CODING! I was a little confused because you presented this video as the first video and read that and thought this was the second video for a second. Then I realized the 2 represented "to" the word. I would just change that to a "to" instead of a "2". 5:33 - I like these hand motions but I would prefer some visual aid. I think if you're going to make a video and you've proven you can do the basic adding in a PNG file into your editing software. I would utilize that along with hand motions. 5:50 - got a little lazy there huh? 17:12 - Wow W3school that's crazy. I studied web design in high school and we would go on here constantly. Every day just like "Hey teach, wtf is this shit" and he would go like "I don't know go to that fucking website I gave you" and I would go like "Hey teach, you a deadbeat you know that" and then he would go like "You know me" and takes a swig of his tequila and the whole class would laugh... so like... I'm familiar with this site was my point. 19:16 - Ok so far everything is making sense to me but... I already studied this in high school and you're not really going too in-depth so maybe the fact that I already went over this material in high school is helping me out. It makes sense though so far. I'm keeping up. 19:43 - I think that right there could've been excluded. If you're having a hard time explaining something I would just go straight into the example. I know you went into the example straight after but excluding the "Things" would've been better. Whenever I am listening to someone explain something to me I immediately start to wonder off if the instructor is having a difficult time explaining it. 28:46 - Whoa there cowboy now you're going to fast. You just said something and then dismissed it like... why'd you bring it up in the first place. I think introducing a topic and then dismissing it like that justs adds to the confusion and makes it harder to follow with no benefit. 31:09 - That's all I get is a kudos?... ok ok i see i see. OK pretty good. I would watch if I was interested in more learning. GJ. I think that you're pretty natural at this. It wouldn't surprise me if you said you were a teacher or something. I think maybe you were going a little too fast at parts. Some I didn't mention but I did mention 1 or 2. I don't think I'm the best audience for this because this is like very beginner and I already had that previous knowledge but I THINK that if I was watching it for the first time I wouldn't have too many questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I appreciate your appreciation! As far as the intro I was talking about the components in the intro. I would have to watch the next iteration to see if the actual length of the intro was too long. But definitely some of the components moving were to slow. I actually didn't rewatch it yet to see what components but I'll do that now real quick... Ok so the beginning 2 circles way too long to zoom in. Sometimes it's a stylistic choice to be slower but this isn't one of those times. Then the picture being pixelated and then shaking of that pixelation is a bit hard to follow in terms of concept. I think just making the concept simpler would be better. OR making the effect better by timing the shakes with the pixelation being removed would be better. If you think about a dog shaking water off his body. The water only leaves his fur once the strands begin moving in the other direction. So I think that the same concept could be used here. Where pixelation doesn't start to disapear until the moment the inertia in the picture starts to change. Also, that's another thing. It just moves side to side. It doesn't seem like it has any weight. Putting in some easing at the apex of each turn can definitely help with that along with the pixelation being proportional to the weight of the picture. BUT it would probably just be easier to make the concept simpler. (can you tell I'm really into motion design?) . And then the text moving in from both sides is ok in terms of concept. But it's again so slow. And it looks so boring. Like it's just a linear movement no easing. Easing is always nice to look at. Even a simple default ease is better than a linear movement. Except in some circumstances (this isn't one of them though). And then to contrast the slowness throughout the intro. The ending is SO QUICK! What the heck!? You switch that photo to a drawn image. and the subtitle comes in so quick it's almost to fast to read it with everything else moving. So here's a list of all the concepts that you have in your intro 1. Double Circle Expansion 2. Picture Expansion 3. Picture Pixelation 4. Picture wagging 5. Title text entering from sides 6. Photo switch to Drawn 7. Subtitle fade in 8. Alpha circle expansion That's a lot here's how I could change it in terms of concept 1. Double Circle Expansion (Faster) 2. Picture Expansion (Faster w/ Easing  amp; overshooting) 3. ~~Picture Pixelation~~ 4. ~~Picture wagging~~ 5. Title text entering from sides (Faster w/ Easing) 6. ~~Photo switch to Drawn~~ (keep drawn) 7. Subtitle fade in (Sooner) 8. Alpha circle expansion Again if you didn't make it. I would try just time remapping the intro and seeing if that helps. Also this is just like off the top of my head and I would have to play with it myself to see if it would work the way I want it to work but that's my top of the head suggestions. FYI IDK if anyone is reading this that isn't OP but my reviews are not all-inclusive. All my reviews are just surface level. I could write a 20-page essay on how a video could be improved. IDK why I felt the need to say that but there you go.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think someone should tell them that they accidentally put 40hrs in a day but a day is actual in fact only 24 hrs. I think they meant a week which would make more sense. Hopefully someone on their team sees this so they can make the appropriate changes to their merch. : gt; Edit: I read a few comments. I dont know why this post is so controversial. But this isn't a joke. They actually accidentally put day instead of week. I thought it was pretty bizarre as well considering that they must have stock of their own merch so even if they didn't do QA someone must have caught it at some point. But anyways I guess I'll just leave this here and if they see it GREAT if not that's fine too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:02 - Ok starting out I'm not a big fan of this font choice or the animation. It's alright, it's not bad but it's just a little plain for me. 0:11 - the black video. I get it it's for dramatic effect and that's fine. Like really it is fine and I do it often as well but this is too long of an empty spot. I would've cut it like maybe half a second before this time. 0:14 - OH MY GOD! TALK ABOUT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY! I change my mind the length is fine. The Darth Vader breathing could've been added sooner though to add this sense of anticipation and have it slowly fade in. Just the blank video with that quiet audio slowly starting to get louder and louder would've been fantastic. What you did right is alright and it's a really good idea but the execution could've been tighter 0:23 - Can't even hear the person talking. That's just a balancing issue. I think it's a big issue and you should focus on this in the future. But it's an easy fix. 0:45 - I think the overlay is a cool idea. The thing that kills it for me though is the jitteriness of the video. I don't know what editing software you're using but there's this setting if you're using premiere called optical flow. And you can actually turn down the speed a lot without that jitteriness. On default, I think it's set to frame blending and that causes the jitteriness if you're pulling from a low FPS shot. If you're not using premiere... idk 1:11 - the timing of the shots coming in and out with the music feels a little off to me. Like they're just 3 - 5 frames off. Maybe work on that and play with that. 1:24 - the frame of the shot in the movie is framed correctly because it's just the two of them. The shot incorporated into your scene isn't. I think just thinking about how certain shot work in the context of your shot would be beneficial. I would fix this by just moving the movie shot over to the right a bit. If there's an issue with the left side being to sharp of a cutoff I would just add a masked blend effect to the left side if it was an issue 1:38 - God that writing is so bad. Also the delivery. I know that's not you but... I just felt the need to say that. FUcK stAr wars.jk 2:04 - I'm not too sure why you decided to remix the sound yourself but it just feels wrong and the balancing is off again. The sound effects are too loud. Owwie my ears. Owwiee. 2:44 - Yeah bro the mixing the balancing needs work. Yeah the video was cool. Just a lot of overlays and what not but some of the concepts were cool. I think some implementation needs some work at some parts and yeah. Also, not really a fan of star wars but recently started watching all the movies because I got Disney plus with my phone membership. Idk why I felt the need to say that but... there you go... Ok well keep up the work and I trust in your future as an editor!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I use premiere pro but tbh honest. All editing software is basically the same. Unless you're starting to use it for more intensive workloads or want certain functionality. They're all pretty much the same. Use the one that's easy fast and has all the features you need. For me that's Premiere, I use adobe's other products as well and import a lot from after effects and audition and photoshop and AI and I've been using it for a long time so using it is pretty intuitive for me but that took a while learning the software. Premiere isn't an intuitive tool. Most robust software aren't. So just use whatever is easy for you, you know.</TEXT>

Ok... 0:00 - ARE YOU A WHEAT FARMER BECAUSE THE ONLY THING I CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEO IS GRAIN! 0:02 - What do you do when you sound so fucking bored recording your video? That's a jab at your delivery btw 0:07 - IT'S SO SLOW. WHY'D YOU KEEP THAT PAUSE IN. IF you were going to do a zoom in shot just fucking hide the cut in the ZOOM IN! 0:07 - Was that supposed to be funny because it didn't feel like it was. Pauses are there to give emphasize to something BUT THERE'S NOTHING HERE TO GIVE EMPHASIS ON! WHAT WAS THE PAUSE THERE FOR!? 0:08 - WHAT ARE YOU ZOOMING IN ON!? WTF! OH LOOK HERE'S A FUCKING SEARCH BAR WITH A PICTURE ICON AND A LINK ICON. YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT THIS!! NO! If you're going to FUCKING zoom in on something make it important. This just seems like lazy editing. "Hey this shot looks a little stale what can I do to make it more fun. I KNOW" \*FUCKING MOVES SCALE ATTRIBUTE UP OVER TIME\* 0:17 - You sound like your aunt is in the next room over waiting to beat your ass if you get too loud. WTF bro speak up. 0:30 - I actually couldn't tell. I don't fucking know you or your personality. This is my first introduction. Am I supposed to be a fucking mind reader? 0:39 - WTF is this? Where's the joke? 0:42 - THAT FUCKING SCROLLING AND ZOOM IN AT FUCKIN 2 PIXELS. What were you thinking? Hey, I know what's good. Let's fucking keyframe this shit to go at 1000000 Miles per fucking hour and zoom in so close you can literally see how cheap my monitor is. 0:52 - And now you go from literally going so far into the fucking text to not even showing it to us. WTF bro can you keep your head on straight. 0:58 - Is the joke that you don't upload? Or is that just a statement of fact. The way you said it sounded like it was supposed to be funny but there is no joke here. Ok I'm gonna stop. That was just a joke. Kinda. I think my critiques here are valid but they're not that big of a deal. I'm not actually mad or anything or frustrated... just wanted to you know... You said don't go easy... and like... I don't know it was stupid I'm sorry. Let me continue 1:41 - That text speed does actually bother me though. It's going way to fast for someone to follow it even if you say it out loud. You're just too zoomed in. You can back up a bit and do the same concept but it's too fast right now. 2:02 - I don't think that that shot was necessary. It didn't really add anything to the video. It just was kind of there. I'm currently going to school for UX and they told us. "If you don't have a reason for a design choice. Don't put it in the prototype" and I think that same concept follows in editing. If there's not a reason for an editing choice. Just don't add it to the video. 2:07 - Also I would've just removed your facecam from this shot if you're not going to show your face. It's just kind of distracting having it there but not seeing your actual face. 2:25 - Realized what? I'm actually lost. 2:44 - Yeah again. can't really see your face. I think it was meant to be funny but it didn't really land for me. 3:50 - Just read it again. Having a poorer quality video can maybe work once but twice is pushing. Just read it again. There's a lot of people that do this just to show you know they're human and they make mistakes too but doing it too much just adds to a sense of uninterest in your own video. which you know... isn't good. 4:39 - I don't really understand the anger in topic. A lot of people ask their sister to carry their child I don't think that's weird. But that's beside the point. I think I watched enough to get an understanding of the video so I'm just gonna stop right here. Ok, so I think that you're trying to ride off the curtails of people like pewdiepie right? People just going through subreddits and reading shit off. I think the concept is ok. I'm not really a fan of it but the thing that people miss when doing this is 2 things. Established viewer base and witty commentary. People like and especially like pewdiepie don't have to put as much effort into their content because they already did that work in the beginning. That's the reason why they are where they are. And even still they add a lot of insightful (to their community at least) commentary. I think it is possible to be successful with this kind of content but you either have to be really funny, really insightful or... I was trying to think of a third I couldn't really think of anything. But to be honest, I didn't really get either of those 2 from the video. Maybe that's something you can work on. Or shifting the video idea to fit better to your personality. Well, Goodluck with your future videos. I hope you do well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow 50 percent isn't bad. I think my average is... hold on. Hahahaha. Wow mines is really low 12.4 percent with my hightest being 104 percent? JK, I know how you can get more than 100 percent. Anyways you're video Ok so watching the video. I thought it was pretty good. I actually prefered this to other top # videos BUT I think I'm in the minority. I used to work at a top 10 channel. God I hated that. But I learned a bit from it and... it's just bleak. People really care more about the numbers than the actual content. And if you have like a constant reminder of "Hey we're on number 1 right now" or "Hey we have X more numbers to go" that's something that grabs people's attention. It's like playing a video game right. There's a sense of gratification for continuing to watch even if all it is, is just like a number pop up. And bring the concept of the list more to the top of your title I think could also help. These are the things that I observed from working there so I usually don't go like "I'm right and you shouldn't question it" but I kinda feel like that for this topic just because I've seen first hand proof of it working. They put so little effort into the actual content but the list and number counting down and graphics were definitely the most important thing. I'm not saying you should abandon like the content cause I think it's good but wrapping it up more a list format would be really beneficial. There's another channel that does this kind of. It's called like charisma everyday or something like that. Where they have like you know actual content but also format it around the list. As far as the title I think naming it "TOP 3 TIPS for Master Storytelling to be as GREAT as Mathew Mercer" or something like that would be better than what you have right now. You can take that or workshop that title if you want free of charge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:09 - WOW The masking. It could've been a little tighter but I think that it was cool 0:24 - so a lot of the camera motions were really jittery. which is... I mean like it's hard to get smooth motion if you're doing it handheld but I feel like the jitteriness took away from some shot. Almost all the shots, in the beginning, had a bit of jitteriness. Solution! just slow down the footage and when you're recording like try to do fast motions. Faster motions are less accurate in framing but are smoother in motion. So when you slow it down it will be really smooth. Most high-end phones nowadays have high framerate recording options. If you have one of those that's a good tool to use. If not there's really not much you can do to solve the issue without buying a stabilizer. It's an understandable problem and it's not an easy fix but you know it's still a problem. I would try shooting with that issue in mind next time if you can't do either of the two things I mentioned above. 0:34 - not a big fan of that transition. It just seemed a bit random and took too much focus away from the actual video and put it on the transition. Like to me it just like the transition was screaming "LOOK AT ME" and I was like... shit ok I see you. Fuck what more do you want from me 0:42 - Not a big fan of that zoom-in shot. It didn't really serve a purpose and it was just distracting. 0:51 - That transition again wasn't that smooth. The different motions felt real off when combining them like that. 1:32 - Oh god that posterize time. : lt; Why? Ok, I think there's this idea, especially with newer editors that there has to be some kind of effect in every shot in order to make it interesting. It's fine if some shots are just shots. It's fine to have some cuts that are just straight cuts. You don't have to put so much into the video. Different effects also have different feelings behind them. This time skip thing just feels like it's for a fun family having a good time and remembering that in the past. But you're not talking about that. you're talking about like depression and whatnot. So there are conflicting emotions colliding with each other. You can chill it with the effects. If you did want to add an effect to this, I think time remapping it to make it slower would've been a better choice. It adds to this feeling of somber and sadness which you know, fits with what you're talking about. 1:46 - Oh shit bro just fucking adding in some fucking stop motion out of nowhere ok. I'm chill with that. That's cool 3:03 - The last few seconds just being black screen was weird for me. I was expecting like an end screen or something. If you're just going to cut the video off just cut it off. Be bold bro. Fuck that end screen fuck that fade out. well, maybe a fade-out would've been nicer than a cut to black. I really think the strongest part of the video was just when you were talking to the camera. Which was probably the easier part to edit. I think you should incorporate more stuff like that into your videos and if you're going to add an effect just think about what is it for before you do it. Yeah, it's a good video. I think you're set up and have a good foundation just keep going at it brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:08 - That's so weird what was that audio change? Was that part of the music? unpleasant either way. 0:18 - Wow that was the first time I think I saw that the intro was too short but also, I think that just a byproduct of not knowing what your channel is. It doesn't show any of your personality or type of content. Yeah I see all your unboxings and whatnot in the background but it goes by so quick. Your picture, in the beginning, is also so tiny. Like who are you? Is that you? Your face takes up like 3 pixels. I think either adding in some detail about what your channel is or who you are would make the intro serve a better purpose than just being there. Right now it doesn't really give me anything. 0:33 - I don't know how I feel about announcing like a holiday unless your video is centered around it. It doesn't really serve a purpose and if people watch it in the future you know... it's not gonna be thanksgiving. If this video was focused around like black Friday or something that would make more sense. But so far, it's just a video about using a tethered connection on your iPhone. 0:38 - oh... no. You got a business card with that... oh no. I spoke with a game developer who got invited to attend a convention. And we talked about business cards and how much people don't use them. Like, if I ever get a business card it usually rots away in my pocket. And that's when a business card is good. This business card is asking WAY too much out of its user. You want them to go onto their computer. Go to Youtube. Pull out your business card (Also keep your business card). Search up your name. AND THEN discover what you're videos are all about. Presumably, you'll tell them when you meet them but people don't remember. I would just go like who is this? and then throw it away. If you're going to make a business card you should include information on it not just your channel name. 1:39 - I don't think that insert shot really works with your content but like I'm not opposed to you keeping it in there. It just came in a little too late. Like you said "terrifying" and then a whole half-second later you put that picture up. If you're going to do that I would just make it pop up at the same time. To better help connect those two things together. 2:27 - That audio increase just kind of jumped. It was so sudden. I would just add like a cross fade so there can be a smoother transition from low dB to higher dB. 2:42 - Yeah definitely not a fan of that intro. It's so quick and doesn't explain much</TEXT>

    <TEXT>0:02 - Ok first video. I like it so far. I know I'm literally only 2 seconds in but it sounds like you wrote a script. Being prepared is important I like that effort. The audio isn't the greatest though. There was a lot of background noise. Maybe you could do something to cancel that out. There's a lot of free programs that have integrated noise reduction software. Audacity has some and it's really simple to implement. Also, you're delivery just seemed angry. I just got two seconds of it but it already sounds like your mad. Not necessarily a bad thing just pointing that out. 0:12 - Whoo explosion came in too late. And having all 3 assets in the corner kind of seemed weird because that was the main joke. I would've made it take up more of the screen and MAYBE added in some pop in effect. If you look up Mouth pop you can find that SFX where it's just like \*POP\* 0:33 - Your delivery is just a little slow and a little monotone. I think you're trying to emulate like videogamedunkie and he's pretty monotone but he uses speed in his speech and he still does have some tonal variations. It's not completely just one-note throughout. The joke itself I didn't really like. Just because there was no real substance behind it. It was just kind of a sex thing to be there. 0:45 - Honestly same 1:11 - That was funny. I think the timing was just a tiny off maybe A LITTLE too long but it was still good. 2:23 - That was a weird cut with the assets. Like you cut one out and then another one and then you made the cut to the next shot. It was really distracting. Like I stopped and wrote about it because it was so distracting. I don't know what video editing software you use. But I can't imagine it being too difficult to adjust endpoints. 2:43 - Hahaha what was that pause right there? You know you can edit that out right hahaha. It was so long and for no reason. 3:31 - I rewatched these 6 seconds like 5 times to figure out what the issue was. It's timing. Also a little your delivery but that's been an issue the whole video and just comes with practice and time. But the moments you decide to cut to the next shots it's too late. Like it feels like you say something and then the cut happens a year later. That's an exaggeration but that's what it feels like. 4:26 - What is UP WITH THESE PAUSES JUST EDIT THEM OUT! 5:00 - Mmmmmm. I don't know about that one. It wasn't funny to me but I'm not sure if other people will also not find it funny. Maybe I'm just not familiar with the meme. I don't know a lot of memes so it's hard for me to comment on that one and often I think things are funny just because I don't keep up with that kind of content. 5:43 - Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Your script and the scene don't match up at all. By the time you say "Oh wait where did he go" That moment passed like almost a minute ago. (Again, I know it's not a minute but it feels like it). That's a tricky situation right there because if the scene was too short to get any more footage out of it then you would have to slow it down. I think having the footage crawl like at 6 FPS wouldn't be a bad thing for your kind of content. You're already leaning towards this "bad quality" but in a funny way and that kind of stuff you can get away with, with that kind of content. But I think the scene actually did have a longer beginning so you wouldn't have to do that. Ok, so overall I think the video was really good for a first video. It seems like you already have an understanding of what kind of content you... oh I read the title wrong. You said like this. Oh nevermind. The video was fine. I think you have to work on your delivery a little more and some editing choices were wrong. Like things being too long, having random pauses that don't contribute to anything. I would work on that. Ok bye! Goodluck!</TEXT>

I thought you were going to explain more about how it worked or how to actually set it up. You didn't really show any Iphone settings or anything. But it was short and I think that's beneficial for you. Umm and yeah that's it. GJ thanks for the lambda</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmmm. I'm not sure about the concept of this. I think going to a separate site to find basically an aggregate of social links is just adding an extra step for no reason. Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube and I think even GitHub all already have features to allow you to link to your other platforms. I think the concept could work if you added some functionality that's unique to it. Basically what you created here is a social bar but in full website form. It's really cool that you made it (from scratch?) but the concept isn't that strong. If you had ideas to add functionality maybe there could be something her. I'm thinking as an employeer, I don't want to go to a different site if I'm already on your portfolio to find a way to contact you. That should already be on your portfolio. As a fan of someone, I just want to consume their content and I already have all their socials anyway. The site itself is ok. I don't really like the color choice with the background of the site name on the top left. I think some of the colors kind of mash-up together in a bad way. The links lack affordance, and the email link doesn't even work!? I think this is definitely a cool project to put on a portfolio to show your skills as a beginning coder. I'm not too sure how viable this is as an actual product as is. Definitely keep working on it and iterating on it and it can definitely be a nice portfolio piece.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Would you love to know what helpful feedback I would give to Everday Technology? Ok for you TheArtyDans I will do this. For you only for you. # Banner Ok cool I like this idea of ET written like this BUT! I don't know how readable it is. From a glance, the E could be mistaken for an A or just speed accents implying the T is moving quickly. Which is a good concept but I just feel the E isn't that readable. Also, you have a lot of space to work with. While I do like the cleaner look I feel like this could be used better as a profile picture rather than a banner. Adding in some information about the upload schedule or specifically what your content is about would also be nice. One of my favorite designers on Youtube Zimri Mayfield does this pretty well if you want a simple but effective way of conveying what you do. # Profile Picture I think this concept is fine of just being a profile shot IF you're videos were centered around you. Scrolling down and seeing all the thumbnails I see no thumbnail with a picture of you in it. I feel like a good example to look at would be MKBHD since you guys talk about similar things. He features himself in most of the thumbnails and has a consistent style in the rest. I have yet to see your actual videos but if they focus more on the product I would recommend changing the profile pic to the Logo after you make some adjustments and creating a new banner. # Thumbnails These are all over the place. Some have text some are just shots of the products. But they don't feel like they could all be of the same channel. A thumbnail that I really like is the "The Nintendo Switch | is it still worth it in mid 2018?" because it shows the product very clearly and still has some nice lighting and colors involved in it. This is the opposite reason why I don't like the next most popular video. "Durgod K320 Mechanical Keyboard: Built like a beast!" The shot is of the product from a low angle with the lighting very flat. I can't really make out any detail in it. Your more recent uploads follow more of a pattern and it could work if it were implemented better. The lavalier thumbnail in one of your most recent videos is one that I'm particularly not a fan of. You can barely make out any details in the mic because it's being washed out by the background. And the text in the corner is so hard to read because of the transparency. I would remember that thumbnails are going to be viewed in a very small format. So if you're making something in like photoshop I would keep that in mind and try to zoom really far out and see if you can still read the text in your thumbnails. # Playlists I feel like these are ok, they make sense and some of them have interesting names. "Reviews" not that interesting but it explains what the videos are very quickly that's good. I would look at analytics and see which playlists are performing the best and separate it into it's own section and put that farther to the top. I find that most people (myself included) don't use playlists to their fullest potential. I only have 3 playlists on my channel but realistically you can make so many playlists with as many videos as you have. # VIDEO QUALITY! Ok so in America we read from left to right up and down. This is important because when someone is clicking on a video they usually will click on the most upper left video. In the case of youtube this is taken over by the channel trailer or featured video. So I'll just watch that one and maybe one or two more. **Best Amazon Cyber Monday Tech Deals 2019!** (0:02) - Ooh, I don't really like the way the ET moves into the shot. Coming in from the right feels so weird. I thought the thought process behind the logo was that Technology "T" was forever moving forward at breakneck speeds. That's what that looks like. But when you make it come in from the right it feels like that's not what the logo was intended to be. Which is confusing. (0:15) - You show your face more prominently, I would keep the profile pic and change the thumbnails to include more of yourself since you are the main focus of the channel and the products are secondary. (1:43) - This is where I would click off. You're not giving me enough information. "Most chrome books..." Tell me about the product you're showcasing not about the type of product (2:19) - Just to reiterate on my last point. You explained why I should buy it but didn't really go to in-depth into the actual product itself. If I'm watching a Deals video I want to know: 1. what the product is 2. how much is cost 3. what features does it have 4. how cool is it You're giving me 2/4 but I want to know 4/4 and I don't want the fluff (this is why you should buy it, I already know why I would want to buy it). I think this is long enough, I could go on but I think there's a lot here that you can work with and yeah. Postiives: 1. I like your tone, it's very conversational and not loud I enjoy that shit 2. The intro looked clean AF 3. You have strong concepts and titles are pretty good 4. Video and audio quality is very nice 5. You're very natural on camera u/TheArtyDans are you happy? Can I say a joke now without getting upset? It was a joke. Plz leave me alone</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'll review your video in a video</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-19 11:29:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen this done before and had the idea for a while. So here goes. My credentials: - over a decade of editing on youtube - have worked/work with channels over 2 mil subs - freelance editing for a wide variety of clients (music vids, commerical work, corporate videos, etc.) - kids in my comments always say "wow how did you edit this/ did you edit this?/ how do you only have X subscribers?" (kinda a joke) - Watch a lot of youtube (30 hrs average a week, not really PROUD of that but... it's a fact) So if your interested in my opinion leave a link to your BEST! Video and I will dissect it. I will be really critical but also really constructive. I'll make a video and if your in it I'll dm you and if not I'll try to leave a text comment in here. Thanks! Excited to see what you all got! Also I'm a student learning design so maybe I can try to tackle thumbnails but I'm still learning that and am not as confident in that skill yet. EDIT: Everyone I marked I've reviewed. The first video is like 21 minutes long so I decided to break it into multiple vidoes. If you're not in the first one then you'll be in a future one. Here's a playlist I made https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXhaFB858Mlvl0AWe2q9R8bEpUJUXIVb0</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever you onboard a client there are 3 things that you have to talk about. 1. Expectations - You have to know what they want to be done and you have to confirm that you understand. 2. Deadline - Obviously you saw what happened when you missed this. You have to make sure how much time you have and if you can do that. If it's a lot and you have very little time that's going to affect the price. 3. Price - How much is this cost for him. That depends on what he wants and when he wants it. You also have to take into consideration any revisions they want at the very beginning. To be honest, I have done free work once near the beginning of when I started freelance editing. We didn't talk about a deadline. I have edited for cheap and I let them know because of the price I'll get it back to them when I have time. They agreed and that was fine. I did it in a month it was about 3 hours of work and it was fine. The biggest thing that you have to make sure you do is be very clear. If you have questions bring it up during the first meeting. Make sure you hit those 3 things no matter what and make sure they understand as well. During the process make sure you keep them up to date on what's going on and if you need more time, bring it up as soon as possible so they're not blindsided. I think you mentioned in the comments this was done for free. That's a pretty good price for you as a learning experience. So now you know. Also this is your 1 job for free. You probably shouldn't work for free anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hated how long the beginning took to get started. What is SEO? I #8217;m not reading a comment. You can read it for me. That was it? I wrote those thoughts as I was watching the video. The video was very short and I don #8217;t feel gave any content. What is SEO? How does it help? Where is your research? The intro was really... I don #8217;t know weird. I felt like it didn #8217;t match the rest of the video at all. The beginning of the video was also very awkwardly paced. You just kind of didn #8217;t say anything and someone said your name but you let the shot go on for way too long. You could #8217;ve cut easily 2 seconds off of that. The outro, I #8217;m not too sure what thoughts you were looking for. It #8217;s ok, it #8217;s plain black with text. I don #8217;t think that #8217;s bad but it #8217;s not especially eye catching but it #8217;s fine. Overall, I think that you did an adequate job present your opinion but that #8217;s all it was. Just an opinion. I would #8217;ve liked to see information in there somewhere. I have conducted semi-serious research myself with my own videos. And I found that tags are not as important as people make them out to be. Title, Thumbnail, Posting time, Description, Tags is what I came up with in terms of importance for SEO. There was some research done from a bigger YouTuber. (I forget the source so I would take this with a grain of salt) They said that tags don #8217;t seem to help in terms of SEO and can actually hurt you. When YouTube #8217;s algorithm is looking for negative content to block, searching tags is an easy way to suppress content that isn #8217;t in line with what they want posted on their site. If I were a viewer and not reviewing your content I would not watch another video. No substance and that #8217;s important for the type of niche you seem to be going for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think DIY is something that someone would be interested in watching. I would recommend studying how other people make their video. The only channels that are kind of like DIY are  #8220;I like to make things #8221; and  #8220;DIY everything #8221; and also sort of  #8220;Chris Fix #8221; but he does more automotive. But, the first two, I would study those guys because they are really successful in that niche. Something I would pay attention to when you watch them is how they create a story around their DIY. If you want to grow you have to incentivize people who aren #8217;t into DIY to watch. If you can record well and edit well people will watch just to watch.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I signed an ISA for school and they shut my program down and aren't letting me out of the ISA</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-30 00:00:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am going to this online boot camp school. I signed an ISA in order to be able to actually go to this school. About a month into my program they told us they were temporarily putting a hold on enrollment into my program. For a while, the program was in limbo until a couple of months ago when they announced they were shutting down the program and allowing current students to finish. All the students that were waiting to get in no longer had the option to attend. Just to add a little context they announced a break because of Covid for a week. It was during this week that they announced the closure and messaged students on slack to let them know their options DURING this break. They let us know that we could get released from the ISA, transfer to a different program, or continue with the defunct program. They only gave us 3 or 4 days to decide all during the break. I didn't leave because I was thinking they offered all the students this option at the same time. However, I was in the latest cohort and I have not completed the entire course while every other student had. So I wanted to complete the course to see if there was anything the school could offer. There wasn't. There was a noticeable lack of attention given to our program after the closure even though they said there wouldn't be. I asked to get released from the ISA they declined. I asked to transfer to a different program. They declined. So now, I'm seeing if there is something that can be done about it. Any advice or steps forward would be appreciated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I usually do gaming videos but I feel my skills can transfer into vlogs pretty easily. Below is an example of a gaming video with a live audience I edited for a client. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGLqRrH0lN4 amp;t=156s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGLqRrH0lN4 amp;t=156s) I have focused more on doing like meme edits in the past. It's not what I focus on but I'm comfortable in that space. Below is another example on personal gaming channel I started with a friend. It's more geared towards gaming but I consume regular vlogging videos and know that space pretty well. [https://youtu.be/A9v4CCouTRs](https://youtu.be/A9v4CCouTRs) Let me know if you're interested.

    <TITLE>Looking for an Editor with LITTLE to NO experience to teach</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 20:57:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>**What I'm Looking For** So here's what I'm looking for. Someone with very little experience in editing that wants to learn how to edit. You don't need to have any knowledge but if you have a base knowledge that's great and would be really helpful. I don't want someone who already knows how to edit I think you can and should be charging for your skills. I just want someone that is passionate and dedicated. We would be working on a gaming channel so if you're interested in games that's a plus but the most important thing is an interest in editing. Potentially there would be another channel I wanted to work on that would be really low effort content and could be a quick crash course into editing basics. So 2 channels 1 gaming and 1 low effort stitch editing meant for teaching. **Why I'm doing this** I know how to edit. I'm pretty confident in my abilities to edit. I'm hoping to help someone learn this skill. I'm currently busy with school and I wanted to do an initial time investment teaching someone to edit in exchange for my videos being edited. I don't want to spend time editing. I'm studying a lot and I'm ok with spending a few weeks 1:1 with someone if it can save me time in the future. **What's in it for you** I'm hoping that me teaching you a new skill will be beneficial to you. I'll teach everything I know about editing and getting clients so you would be able to find other sources of revenue. I hope that's enough incentive because I can't really guarantee anything else besides sharing my knowledge. But if the channel does start to take off I was thinking that a 80/20 split of the net profit for the first year would be a good form of payment. Of course, I can't guarantee that the channel will make any money but that's hopefully the goal and after the first year. Non-excluseive so if you wanted to work with other people of course you can and would encourage. Yeah that's basically it. If anyone is interested let me know. I think this is a pretty fair deal but if you have your own idea I would be happy to hear it out. But yeah if you're interested please reach out and we can zoom and talk more about it</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Looking to partner with a host for a tech/gaming channel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:35:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! Feel free to DM on here or leave a comment if you're interested! **Background** I have a small gaming channel, \~200 subs. I haven't posted on it in a while, but I'm trying to start it back up. I want to create a small team to start this back up so we can be more consistent. In the past, I was responsible for all the roles: research, Writing, VO, Branding, Editing. I want to move away from that to make the channel more manageable, so I'm looking for someone that can do voice over. I would be taking the role of writing and directing, taking more of a backend approach. I'm currently working with an editor that I have been training, and I hope to find someone interested in doing vo. **What I'm looking for** I'm looking for someone with a good cadence and energy in their voice; if you're interested in gaming and tech, that's a plus. A decent microphone. It doesn't have to be the top of the line mic, just like a blue yeti will do fine. I want to be able to up the audio quality in post-processing, but if you do have a nice microphone, that's also a plus. Lastly is just the time commitment; the type of content we're planning on making is news content so, it would be more of a daily thing. But each day shouldn't take longer than an hour. You don't have to do any editing, just hopping on a call doing the VO and then sending that over. Hopefully, we can trim that down to like 30 mins as we get more familiar with each other. \- Good speaking voice \- Decent Mic \- 1 hour a day \- interest in tech/gaming (plus) **What's in it for you** Everyone currently involved in the project (just me and one other person) understands that making it big on youtube is difficult and unrealistic. Of course, the goal is to strive for that, but we understand it's not likely to happen. So at the very minimum, we will all have something to show to future employers/clients. If it does get big great! We'll keep heading with the channel. If not, you'll still have high-quality pieces that you can be proud to show to people in the future. Also, at the end of every video, you're apart of you'll have your name and if you want your Twitter handle. \- High-quality portfolio pieces! \- Credit at the end of every video you're apart of! \- Opportunity to be apart of the ground floor!  #8203; If you're interested DM on here or you can leave a message and we can get on call and see if we're a good fit for each other. Or if you have any questions feel free to leave it below.</TEXT>
