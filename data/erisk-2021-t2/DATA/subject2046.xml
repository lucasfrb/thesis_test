    <TEXT>Well if you're going to have a bullshit slinging rapist as a leader, better just about anyone than the brain diseased dumbshit you have as a president today. As an outsider who takes the time to watch his press conferences and doesn't just buy into CNN's version of events, your president is making your whole country look moronic just by association and the fact that almost half of you supported him in 2016.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep the center string holds all the weight (effectively like dangling the weight of the top section under the bottom platform's vertical hanger) except because the weight's balancing on a single point it's really unstable (like a spinning top that's not spinning). The two longer strings keep it balanced and prevent twisting. Had to try this when I saw it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coming from an Australian state where our only cases now are fly-ins, I can see a clear contrast between how our gov and the people handled this vs America for the initial wave. Our government acted decisively in implementing lockdowns and laws. They were very good in clearly explaining why the measures will protect the wider community. When I see your president and his messaging around this, it's a total shit show by comparison. Sorry, but your guy's a knuckle dragging imbecile who's got the leadership ability of a 3yo. The general sentiment from the outside is that America looks oafish because of him. While Australians generally have a good community spirit and sense of "matesmanship", you seem to have a large number of people who just disobey authority just because they can by law and prioritise that right over the safety of the greater population. For an advanced country you certainly have some backwards laws and cultures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Handling the ships and controls when the game releases is mainly going to be about developing muscle memory. Resource and shield control will become second nature. I'm using Battlefront 2 SA heroes vs villains using Tallie on resistance side or Iden on empire because they're pretty much just stock standard fighters and I want to gimp myself as much as possible. 4v4 mode. I've removed all useful cards so I'm forced to play well rather than relying on upgrades. Use Cockpit view and pay special attention to leading and tracking the aspect and trajectory of targets. Worst case scenario, squadrons is going to be manual with no lead indicator. Learn to fly in tight spaces and extremely close to objects as this helps avoid damage when you need to recharge health. Develop the reflexes to avoid crashing when unexpected protrusions pop out of the obstacles. Learn how to break out of circle fights when needed, they just waste time. Situational awareness of your immediate area, eg. where everyone is in relation to you and what they're doing, where's some clutter to evade in if you're about to be ganked and learn to identify (early after release) favourite obstacles to dodge around. In bf2 I have a bunch or irregularly shaped obstacles I know well and use to fly through, around and often bait pursuers into trying to follow me. They usually hit them. Who's respawning and where are they heading to. I can't wait for VR for this. Just turn my head rather than changing direction. Learn when to extend and when not to because you're unsupported or have a badly outmatched team. In SA learn not to fight attackers AT the objectives. Move the fight to half way between their spawn and the objective so it doesn't get shot at. Who are the weak pilots you can just let go as they're not a threat and not following objectives vs the ones you need to harass? You can often tell these from the start in bf2 sa, they're the ones making a beeline for the best sources of battlepoints, squadrons should have its tells as well. Learn to identify patterns of where people will be most vulnerable and when their awareness will be lowered (best times to attack), frequently travelled paths and blind spots ...etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The space combat "Starfighter assault" mode is really good for its graphics and mission design, but is very simple (on console at least) due to the lead indicator. Most of being good at it though (I mvp around 90% on Xbox) is about the situational awareness, map knowledge, strategies to reduce the probability of being attacked, and properly balancing ptfo vs dogfighting for each map. These skills "should" carry over to squadrons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep was the mine... Also later on an a-wing uses a jammer. I can see this being OP. In BF2 opening phase of Fondor Shipyard as imperial, I use the jammer on the bomber to clock up kills quickly at the start with relative impunity. If it also jams autoaim guns, using it as an A-Wing will just make combat so easy. With a jammer I can see VR being a must for competitive play as long as lower res isn't a big handicap. Wonder if jammer's directional or omnidirectional. I can see a lot of this game is going to be about cunning and attacking your enemies from directions where there's no silhouette and no specular reflection from your fighter (keeping track of light sources). A matt black coloured A-Wing is going to be perfect for that due to its blade like front profile . A round tie fighter fuselage is going to be inherently disadvantaged. The fighter profiles on the EA page mention silhouettes. If this works like I think, I'm going to love this game. A-Wing is a beast in BF2. It's almost as potent as a hero ship but doesn't draw all of the attention. People are going attack the fatter, easier X-Wings over agile, time consuming A-Wings.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fine, smooth control and fast reaction</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-07 12:47:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm interested in getting back into DCS and other VR capable sims but in the shorter term, looking at playing Star Wars Squadrons. As the game is cross platform, its going to require me to react extremely fast against console players who merely need to move their thumb an inch or so to go from lock to lock. The game will involve mainly guns kills so aim has to be extremely accurate and movements smooth to track targets. I'll need the accuracy to compete against other PC players who'll use a keyboard + mouse combination. I've always found the best pilots in arcade style sims use keyboard and mouse. I really want the immersion of a hotas setup though so does anyone know if the following hotas setup exists? - stick has extremely fine control which can be done with just wrist/thumb and forefinger movement and no need to move entire forearm - extremely smooth transition across the centre position. I have a thustmaster tflight which has an extremely pronounced bump as the stick returns to the centre position when going from one side to the other. I know how to remove the centre notch on the throttle but not sure there's any fix for the spring tension on the stick. - while accurate, also has a reduced distance to travel from lock to lock. Travel time from side to side reduces reaction time. - adjustable tension on centering springs. I'm pretty sure I'd like almost zero resistance with just the faintest bump (very slight only) as I pass the centre position . Basicly I'd like to have my forearm rested on a chair arm. For fine aiming I'd like to use just small movements of my thumb and forefinger. For full lock movement I'd like to only have to roll my wrist a short distance. Throttle would be good if I can easily move it with just thumb and forefinger. I used to have an old Microsoft sidewinder which was extremely easy to control accurately and since then have used a few joystick with longer handles (including tflight) and it never quite felt as good and intuitive. I do also want all the programmable buttons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Typically flight stick users are at a disadvantage compared to mouse and keyboard users if you're about competitive play. Mouse is much faster at finer aiming and far easier to track a target. The ability for a keyboard to apply full pitch, roll or yaw by the slight press of a finger gives faster reaction time compared to a stick with an 8 inch travel distance from lock to lock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given a lot of the game will be direct recycling of BF2 components it wouldn't take a lot for them to implement 3rd person view. As 3rd person gives a big situational awareness advantage, you're right it would need dedicated servers. The problem is this game was always going to have a smaller player base than other titles like BF2. We're not going to get casuals rolling in who just want a 20min break from galactic assault mode. By splitting the community in 2 from the outset, it will reduce the longevity of the game significantly. I think devs learnt this from BF2 as well. Just as numbers started dying down in BF2 star fighter assault, devs introduced the new heroes vs villains mode. A lot of the poorer players learned they could level up hero ships faster in HvV and disappeared from SA. Servers took longer to get player numbers and so a lot of people quit altogether. Splitting an already smaller community literally killed all but one server within 2 weeks of the community split (on Xbox). Now people only play on the one US server during US hours and many bear the 200ms ping  #128545; When you know a game is going to have a small but loyal community like this one, it's best to keep everyone in the same pool. This is why they shouldn't do paid DLCs (they take people away too) or have too many game modes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know about that. The gameplay vid shows both an A-Wing and Interceptor with lots of yaw authority. The new gameplay video looks very similar and the guy even starts yaw turning for everything at the end. Ace combat jets have very little yaw compared to roll and pitch. I haven't seen anything to indicate squadrons fighters will be as fast as ace combat jets either. Ace does have the ability to pump the brakes for high instantaneous turns but has a stall speed you need to watch. I'll give it a try though. Will fit lasers and rudder upgrades and see how it goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've practiced on the other side too.  #128578; Without the console that'll be shown in Squadrons, ties actually have better visibility in first person. Something interesting I've found playing hud off is that Y-wings are way easier to spot than anything else.... Good luck staying on target. A-Wings are the hardest to see by far. Ties on certain lighting angles are hard to spot but generally if side on are easy kills.</TEXT>

When I want to use the PC for more serious stuff (3d rendering...etc), I'd like to do it on my dual screen setup downstairs which I also plug my work laptop docking station into. Can anyone suggest a good wireless solition which will allow me easily switch between the gear in my two locations?

    <TEXT>The F-35s frontal aspect is extremely stealthy, to the point where a small scratch or dent in the surface could result in it being detected from almost double it's normal detectability range. If you zoom in and look at the screws that hold in that access panel you'll see that even the screws turns need to be perfectly aligned to maintain frontal stealth. It's the attention to detail that makes it so much stealthier than some other "stealth-like" examples being produced by other countries at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's winter here in Australia currently and I've noticed this Sir Walter Buffalo fade and leaves die off over the past few months. It seems to be dying in the centre rather than the edges of the grass so uncertain whether it's due to high wear ( I aerated it a month back but no change yet ) or something else. It may be fertiliser, as I've only used the stinky organic pellets until now, or lawn grubs (ones that eat roots only) but I can't see evidence of that and roots seem strong.

    <TEXT>I do the same from time to time. In many ways, hud off is easier for aiming as it allows you to watch the aspect of the target rather than just follow the circle which becomes a crutch. It's just hard finding targets. Aim assist is still enabled on SA though, even when you switch it off in settings (setting only changes for troops). The only time it really does get disabled is when tie bombers use their jammer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I figure the resolution is only going to stop me doing long distance snipes or see them coming at me. Radar and constant jinking will prevent that. Once I'm in close enough range to see opponent ship aspect, surely I'll be at a slight advantage being able to see direction changes well off boresight. It'll help getting faster kills. Being able to kill faster improves defence as I'm flying predictably for shorter periods of time. VR should also help flying around clutter a lot better which is a major defensive advantage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see it being tied to maneuverability. Doing skid turns for 270 degrees then quickly accelerating past a pursuer to get behind them with your better turn rate will mean you're exposed for a shorter time following the turn. Old xvt used to have different turn rates at different throttle settings (30% throttle gave the best rate from memory). Any word on whether that's true in squadrons? If so then acceleration will play a huge part.</TEXT>

The best dogfighting method after the merge was to pass at full throttle, pull hard until the opponent was at the top of your radar scope then drop it down to 1/3 to align and take the shot, speed up and repeat.

    <TEXT>Australia... I didn't stay up until midnight though, just woke up this morning and started the campaign/flew a few ai fleet battles before work. Quite the learning curve  #128513; The biggest difficulty I'm having is getting thrust to the right level with controller</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've swapped the targeting options button (not used when under pressure) with the press on left stick for boost button because I use boost and drift turns a lot. I find it feels better. Trying to develop a play style and build with Tie Interceptor where I just keep power assigned to engines then convert engine boost to laser overcharge when I get on someone's tail. You can take your finger off the boost button half way through a slide then hit it again straight away to quickly zoom out of the turn. Good way to do a triangle maneuver to get behind someone chasing you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- Divert all power to engines and build up boost - Full thrust - Press the left stick to engage boost - While travelling at high speed, start turning (you'll see the pilot view start leaning to the side) - Press and hold boost again while still turning (don't touch your thrust like some old posts have mentioned), you'll see you're drifting sideways and backwards. The pilot's voice will go "woo hoo!!!" The first few times you get it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Use a bomber with the proton bombs. Charge your engine boost before you get to the target and stay in cover until the last possible moment . Don't be the first to attack, maybe let the Corvette draw some fire before your run. Boost into close range (inside shields) and smash the components before a player picks you off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got the game on Xbox but intend on buying a PC with a VR set and just want to double check the investment's worth it. I'm holding out for reverb G2. When comparing VR to your monitor for this game, how's the graphics quality? How is the immersion? When commenting can you tell me what video card and headset you're running?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hehe maybe that was a game I was in this afternoon  #128513; I just hovered like a turret a few hundred meters out from the ship and rotary cannoned the Y-wings that were making coordinated runs to the ship. Y-wings don't want to try and charge me head on or they get overcharged rotary canon, Goliath and cluster missiles in the face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, have a few things to test this afternoon. In BF2, you could easily rack up score by using bobafett's charge to blob up all turrets on capital ships as the explosion went through ships' hulls. Interest to see if they've added line of site mechanics for explosions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you leave power diverted to engines and use SLAM engine it can boost for days. You sit just outside 1500m from the action and cycle through your team mates to see who needs help. Zoom in and supply/shield then boost out again. When done well, the other team gets frustrated enough to try and counter the support ship, pulling them off objective. A good support can keep an attack phase going for ages as long as the attackers aren't potatoes.</TEXT>
