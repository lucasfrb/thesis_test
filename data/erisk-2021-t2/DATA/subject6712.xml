    <DATE>2020-02-27 09:38:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been dating my girlfriend for about 3 weeks now, her mom knows she is bi and that she is dating me. No one but my close friends know I #8217;m pan, and also her mom. Me and my girlfriend were friends for years before we got together and I #8217;ve always have a good relationship with her mom. But when her mom learnt about this she threatened to tell my mother and out me. My girlfriend talked to her about it and she said she wasn #8217;t going to but that my girlfriend wasn #8217;t allowed to come over to mine until my mother knows. At the moment I #8217;m very upset and have cried for an hour. I need to know what do to. Please help me. This is a throwaway account.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Btw I don #8217;t really recommend doing this, but could make a good reddit story) Say okay for him using tinder, if he #8217;s allowed to do it so should you. Get yourself a tinder profile, (don #8217;t cheat tho) keep records of the texts just so if he accuses you of cheating you can show him the records of texts, and ask to see his. If he refuses show you, he #8217;s obviously cheating, so dump him, if he shows you and wasn #8217;t cheating well I guess you can trust him. Edit: Like other people are saying, he may be already using it, and you should be able to set your boundaries and lines that he can #8217;t cross.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Father denies my mental health and yells at my mother</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 10:42:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>My father is a pretty nice person, but when it comes to anything to do with my mental health he gets annoyed and denies everything. I #8217;ve been diagnosed with autism and anxiety, I also have depression (though that hasn #8217;t been diagnosed, but I #8217;m pretty sure lol) and I have tics (similar to Tourette #8217;s) Since I was really young, my father wouldn #8217;t let my mum get me diagnosed with anything, even thought it was clear I had mental health issues, like very obvious. Up until they got split I was never tested, even though many teachers said that they suspected something. Once they finally split I was tested and what a surprise! I has autism and anxiety. Even though I had the report my father still denied it, saying that my mother just  #8220;put it in my head #8221; and I didn #8217;t actually have autism. He continued to deny it for another year up until now when I started having those tics. He said my tics were just put in my head by my mother and said that I could control it. I tried explaining it to him, but as he continued to deny it, I got pretty annoyed and angry (btw, I start crying when I get angry, I #8217;m not good with hiding my emotions lol) anyway, I started crying and he started asking why I was crying and said that he wasn #8217;t angry with me, but he started getting defensive. After a bit of back and forth with him I ended getting myself into a panic attack. Later the same day, we went to his girlfriends house, and I was still crying. She tried helping me by letting me stay in her room but after a little bit and me finally starting to calm down she came in and demanded I left the room and spent time outside, and told me to  #8220;stop making those silly noises #8221; (but guess what, I can #8217;t control it! Yay!) and she told me I was being silly, which to hopefully no ones surprise made me get even more upset and sad. She left but both my father and his girlfriend came in and asked that I left the room, tried talking to me (btw, when I start to cry or get emotional, my throat kind of closes up and I can #8217;t speak even if I wanted to) and they left. By now I #8217;ve texted my mum asking to go home. She ended up calling my dad when I couldn #8217;t tell her what was going on and he went outside and started to yell at her. For over half and hour I sat there hearing everything he said and it made me feel worse. He was just being defensive and denied everything. His girlfriend came back in and tried talking to me again and demanded I went outside. When I refused she stormed off. Later my dad came back in doing the same thing and I spent an hour there trying to calm down but just being set off again when they walked in demanding I left. I texted my mum again, asking to go home and she kept telling me to wait it out. After a bit my dad came in asking if I wasn #8217;t ex to go home, after a bit I nodded and he drove me home. But not before the cherry in top of the story. The girlfriend asked my dad (quite loudly)  #8220;is that seriously what #8217;s happening? #8221; And he said yes that I shouldn #8217;t have to be there if I wasn #8217;t okay to be there (thanks, I guess?) and she asked if I was at least going to say goodbye. He came back into the room and asked for me to say bye, which I did. I even said sorry to her. As I was walking out I heard her say to me.  #8220;You #8217;re being really disappointing! We were meant to do stuff this weekend! #8221; In an accusatory tone. I left the house and my dad drove me home and I apologised again. And how here we are, hope you enjoyed the show! TLDR: Dad gets mad at my mental health, yells at my mum and dad #8217;s girlfriend yells at me. PS: I know this is a vent, but I just need some support in some way rn, so thank you for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can #8217;t promise everything will be okay, but just know that some people are here for you. And if you can #8217;t talk to anyone in real life, many internet strangers like me are willing to talk! You may not be okay or be able to accept yourself for a while, and that #8217;s okay. Never think you #8217;re alone because so many people understand what you could be going through, and many more people are willing to be someone you can #8217;t just vent to or ask for advice. As cheesy as it sounds, I wish all the best for you, you can do this!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t feel bad if you feel like you #8217;re missing it, self harm is an addiction and we are all so proud that you #8217;ve gone this long, like seriously we are all so so proud of you! It #8217;ll be hard and you might feel like going back to doing it at more points in your life, but just persevere. You #8217;ve made it this far so don #8217;t give up now! If you ever feel like cutting again try to distract yourself by talking to someone or watching one of your favourite shows or something, and don #8217;t give up!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to cut on my forearms, and at the time when I was doing it all reason just let my brain and all I wanted to see was blood, and my forearms was where it was easiest for me. And I guess I was lucky, cause when the wounds healed and became just scars it blended with my skin so well I could barely see them even when I was looking for them, let alone anyone else who didn #8217;t know I cut.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t beat yourself up for relapsing, ever. Self harm is a bad addiction and it should be treated as such, and depression is such a difficult thing to deal with. It may not be the same for you but whenever I cut myself, all reason would leave and the only thing I wanted was to see blood and feel pain, I just wanted to  #8216;punish #8217; myself in a way. I usually had bad periods where I cut almost everyday, then I #8217;d go weeks even months without picking up a blade until something happened, not even something big, and I #8217;d been sitting their in my room and then I would feel this need to just cut, to just see blood and to just focus on something other than all the crap that was happening in my life. So I would relapse after 1-3 months and feel like shit after. Then I #8217;d cut again and again until things calmed down, and then when the next shitty thing happened I #8217;d go back to cutting. Rinse and repeat. Do not ever beat yourself up or feel like shit or hate yourself for relapsing. No matter how you see it, your depression is not your fault. I don #8217;t know your circumstances, or what your life is like, but remember that relapsing is something almost everyone who has self harmed goes through. Don #8217;t think about the time you were clean as  #8216;wasted #8217; or that you messed up. Think about the time you were clean as something to be proud of, and strive to get a longer clean streak, make it your focus. Make you your focus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely. You could be having the best day in your life, but still hate yourself. You aren #8217;t alone there, I feel it all the time. I can go to school and my friends are being awesome, and I #8217;m having a fun time and class is chill and everything is going perfectly, I will still feel insecure and feel a a piece of shit because that #8217;s just how my brain is. Of course, you should try your best to feel good about yourself, but I know how hard that is to do, but just try saying something good about yourself often. Even if you don #8217;t truly believe it, just act like you do. Look in the mirror and give yourself a thumbs up every so often, cause you deserve it!</TEXT>
