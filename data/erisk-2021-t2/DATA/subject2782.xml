    <TITLE>It is literally impossible for me to get 100% in this game (Due to a Bug)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-17 04:28:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can't 100% this game, in two areas, and I was wondering if anyone else was suffering from these bugs too. First Area: Challenges One of my campaign collectable challenges is bugged. On "The Cleaner", there's a challenge that requires you to collect all of the collectables on this level. I have done so, but the challenge is bugged at 2/3. \(It should be displaying 3/3\). And since you are unable to re\-collect a collectable, this means that I am unable to complete this one, meaning it's impossible for me to get 100% in the Career section. This is extremely infuriating. Is anyone else experiencing this? Second Area: Trophies I'm level 48, and I've heard that the level 50 trophy is bugged, it's also the last trophy I need for platinum. Due to this bug, if I continue playing this game, I will progress to level 50, permanently bugging my level 50 trophy, along with my platinum trophy, so I am being forced to stop playing this game, due to this bug. \(I already know that this bug is known to both the community and devs, but I'm just pointing out that I literally can't play the game now because of it\) Possible solution for the challenge bug: Make the campaign collectables re\-collectable. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feedback for Extraction (and Kessel)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-12 13:36:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Honestly, in my opinion, I don't like Kessel or extraction in Battlefront 2. I never really played in Battlefront 1, only for the sweet sweet platinum trophy. (Thanks for fixing that bug btw, I now finally have it 4 months after I hit level 50  lt;3 ). My main reasons for not liking extraction are: (CONS) - FUCKING WOOKIES MAN! Honestly, these guys are op in cq, which is what Kessel and Jabba's palace are. Deathtroopers and Imperial Commandos have got no chance against these walking carpet bombs - Kessel, feels too cramped and clustered, I honestly think it's BETTER to play in first person, which means playing an enforcer in doors can be quite a challenge - Lack of heroes, I get why they aren't here, for balance, but you could've re-balanced them for extraction, like give Bossk 200hp, so that, yeah, you can lock down the cart, but ONE false move/wookie, hero is gone and dealt with I do like some things about it tho: (PROS) - Kessel does look cool, reminds me of a level from the perfect therapy game, Viscera Cleanup Detail - Making the cart act like Payload in Overwatch was definitely the right move, good choice. Of course, this is all my opinion, what do you guys think of Kessel and Extraction?</TEXT>

I screamed and ran out and told my family, one by one my brothers went in (I was the youngest) and they all went from: "Oh shut the fuck up Eek, it's just a tin- HOLY SHIT THAT'S BIG!" Parents go in: "These kids are wim- OHHH FUCK NO!" I still had a shower, but had my eyes glued onto that motherfucker to watch him move. He didn't move, just sat there and watched me. (He was even more scary because he was missing a leg) Next morning, he's gone, no trace of him, family hasn't done anything to him, he just vanished. I carefully peeped my head in through the door to scan the bathroom for like a month after that because of how terrified I was.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember probs the worst thing I work up to, here's the story: I'm an insomniac, I have trouble sleeping, and sometimes wake up randomly during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. Anyway, one time I woke up while my grand parents were over, and I didn't want to wake them up, (I usually get up and do random stuff if I can't get back to sleep) so instead of leaving my room and doing shit, I decided to just stay quiet and watch Star Wars in my room. While I get Return of the Jedi running, I notice that through my curtains, I can see the outside light is on. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I can hear footsteps and the hallway light outside my room is on. I'm thinking: "What the fuuuckkk..?" I can hear my mum talking with some other people, but I can't make out what they are saying, so I just stay in my room watching Star Wars, but wondering what on Earth is going on outside. I peep out my curtains, only to see a Paramedic and an ambulance sitting in my driveway. I immediately sit down on my bed just thinking: "Everyone's in good health, what the fuck is going on?" I decide to peep my head out of my door, and make eye contact with my mum, who just rushes towards my door, coming into my room, and closing the door behind her. She sits me down on my bed, I ask: "Umm... can I have context as to what the fuck is going on please?" "Eek, Something's happened..." "Is Nana ok?" "She's passed away" "Oh...." WHAT A WAY TO WAKE UP TO EASTER AMIRITE?!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>*IDEA* New content for solo/co-op players.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-23 19:57:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think we all realise how little content there is to offer in the single player side of this game. There's the disappointing campaign, a fun at first but quickly boring arcade mode that needs serious polishing, and that's about it. You can 1v1 your friend via splitscreen on console, but you can't play the campaign in co op with them. So here's my ideas for some new content that can be added for the singleplayer/co-op side of the game: 1) Small mini canon and legends campaigns. Add a remastered level from Republic Commando, or a entirely new canon level with them. Add a legends level based in the new republic. Make these small missions/campaigns co-op able, and maybe you could even port some of the content to multiplayer, like adding Commandos as an enforcer and making Delta Squad legendary/epic skins for them. (Pls I am tired of seeing those walking carpets everywhere). Or you could add the legends Old Republic to the multiplayer as well, which could open up the possibilities of new maps, and even a rakghoul hunt game mode! Imagine how sexy Sith Troopers would look in Frostbite! THE CHROME WOULD LOOK SOOOOOO GOOD! 2) Rework Arcade. Everyone has been saying this, please improve the AI, and add the big modes into the arcade, like you did with WA and SA last game. 3) Make the current campaign co-op able. Add a random storm trooper when Iden is by herself, or during the Lando level make player 2 Shriv (and then add Shriv as a hero please). Or make player 2 Del/Hask. The co op should also be able to be done in splitscreen and online, via invite or matchmaking 4) Level editor. Look at Halo's forge... how fucking bamboozling are some of those player's creativity. Even if it's just a map maker, you could have a "Weekly top picks" playlist, that plays through the communities top made maps, this could work for both single player AND multiplayer What do you guys think? If you don't understand anything I've said, please comment it and I'll try to explain it more clearly :)</TEXT>

But Galaxy of Heroes (I think that's the mobile game they're focusing on now) has HK-47, Bastilia, and other things from Legends, and they are advertised as Legends too, so I don't see why Battlefront 2 can't do the same. Imagine HK-47 as a hero. One of his emotes has to: "MEATBAGS!"</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-07-29 00:58:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been weeks since I last saw another person. I miss my wife and kids, I told them I was going off to join the Empire and fight for our Emperor, but he has vanished, and I can't find any Imperials, or Rebels for that fact. I invented a time machine to try to fight for the Clone Army or Droid Army, heck I even tried to join the Resistance and First Order, but their lobbies are too empty, populated only by me. It's quiet... too quiet. I miss the feeling of fighting, the adrenaline rush you would get for every perfectly thrown thermal detonator, the feeling of Darth Maul's saber-throw working and getting you 5+ kills, the sense... of pride and accomplishment. Forgive me family, for I was wrong to join this blasted war. Don't tell my wife about the crystals... she would kill me if she knew I was on those again, I said I would quit when our children were born... forgive me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mrs. Pink's Pink Hotel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-30 17:46:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Mrs. Pink owns a lovely pink hotel, located on Pink Ave. Everything in the hotel is pink, the sidewalk outside, the carpet leading to the front door, the front door itself, and the door knob. The foyer has pink tiles for a floor, with a pink receptionist desk. The rooms are pink, the beds are pink, the showers are pink. If you turn the water on, the water itself is pink. Mrs. Pink lives on the top floor with her her Pink poodle named Pinky, and her husband Mr. Pink. One day, Mr. Orange shows up to Mrs. Pink's hotel, and he asks for a room. Mrs. Pink takes him up to the 13th floor, and to the 13th room. They both walk in, Mr. Orange looks around the room, sits on the bed, and is happy with the room. Mrs. Pink gives him the key, takes his payment, and heads back down to the foyer. An hour later, Mrs. Blue comes into the hotel, and asks for a room. Mrs. Pink escorts her to the 12th floor, and takes her to room 12. (Each floor has their own set series of rooms) They both walk into the room, Mrs. Blue turns on the pink shower, and puts her hand into the warm stream of pink water coming from the pink shower head. She is satisfied with the room, so Mrs. Pink gives her the key, and takes her payment, before heading back down to the foyer. 2 hours later. Mr. Green comes into the hotel, asking for a room. Mrs. Pink takes him up to the 14th floor's 14th room, and shows him the pink T.V., which has a special art program dedicated to the colour pink. He's pleased, and gives her his payment, and she gives him his key. Mrs. Pink then heads back down into the foyer, and closes the hotel's entry for the night. The next morning, Mr. Orange, Mrs. Blue, and Mr. Green all join Mrs. Pink for breakfast. Mr. Orange orders Froot Loops, and so does Mrs. Pink and Mrs. Blue. But Mr. Green orders Frosties. What does this tell us? 3/4 people prefer Froot Loops to Frosties.</TEXT>

Oh and this other teacher had a child in school when I was in Grade 6 (The child was in Kindergarten), and this child fucking hated me. He would attack me, like ram into me, so I started to dodge these rams, and since he didn't have anything to impact on he would just fall to the ground, yelling "subject2782 pushed me down", and then he would fake cry. The amount of shit I got from his mother in class was like: "You have a grudge against a fucking 11 year old and aren't accepting my side of the story, please fuck off"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just keep in mind, A LOT of Halo 5's "free DLC" was actually content meant for launch, but wasn't done in time, so in essence, it wasn't DLC at all, it was just late launch content advertised as free DLC. For example, that city Warzone map, we saw it in trailers months before Halo 5 came out, and we didn't get it until... I think it was a year after the game came out? But then again, Dice hasn't even added their unfinished content yet...</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-03 05:49:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the new community calendar, we got to see some wacky game mode mods coming, such as 8 heroes on both sides, well here are my ideas for some more wacky modes, in and outside galactic assault! Ewok Hunt: 40 players, on bigger maps if needed Galactic Assault: 20 heroes vs 20 Heroes Extraction: Tug of War: The pay load is placed in the middle of the track, first team to escort it to the opposing team's side wins. Jetpack Cargo: Unlimited jetpack and pre-nerf rockets only Blast: Melee only (No enforcers and no specialist card bs) Star Fighter assault: hero starfighters only Galactic Assault: TRAITORS! (All heroes are swapped to the opposing enemy's side, meaning darth vader fights for the light side now, Rey for the dark side, etc.) Wookie Hunt: To get our rage out on those damn carpets, 1 vader with 100,000 hp vs. some amount of wookies. (In memory of Starkiller and TFU What do you guys think? And what are your own ideas for some wacky game mods/modes?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Geonosis is a little unbalanced for our brothers, I think it could use some tweaking:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-30 03:04:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right now, I have a 100% win rate with the CIS on Geonosis, and only about 20% with the Republic. The Republic has a disadvantage in both Phase 1 and Phase 3, with Phase 2 being almost impossible for the Clones to lose from my personal experience. I will run through what these are: Phase 1. The AT-TE button is not in the most ideal place, and every game I've had the droids have basically not even bothered with the Command Post and just defend the AT TE, which to be honest is smart of them, like how kamino phase 3 is just the Battle of the Barracks. I have lost half of my games as clones in Phase 1 do to the Clones not being able to push through the CIS's tight grip. In my opinion, phase 1 should be heavily in favour for the attackers, so that you don't get stuck playing phase 1 over and over again, like Jakku, for example. Phase 3: The Droids have way too many ways to take out the AT TEs, in my experience, 90% of the time, we either: No AT TEs even touch the point before we lose. And, if an AT TE with even 50% health remaining, will still be destroyed before it can fully cap the point. The main issues here are that, the spider droids can do MASSIVE damage to the AT TEs, but they aren't marked at all, not even hit makers, they need to have some obj and points tied to them. The AATs are literally invisible in the sandstorm, whereas the AT TEs have huge "I'M OVER HERE!" markers. Not only that, but you can see the AT TE health to, which allows droids to immediately pick off the weaker AT TEs. Not only that, but the Heavy's Ion Torpedo, Turret, and the Specialist's Ion Shot from the NT can basically take out an AT TE single handed. The main issue here isn't their weapons or star cards, it's their position. The Specialist can just sit at the back with their sniper and still achieve 100% damage to the AT TE, and the Clones can't even reach their location because it is out of bounds. The heavies can do this with their Ion Torpedo too. So, how do we fix these issues? Here's my suggestions, feel free to add anything or dispute them: Phase 1: Remove the ticket system with a timer. I always preferred a timer system to a ticket system, and I think ALL maps could benefit from this. But I know people do prefer the ticket system, so this idea may not work for everyone. On the other hand, just moving the positions of the objs so that the clones have a little more cover could really help them out in getting past Phase 1 consistently. Phase 3: Out of bounds needs to be tweaked for the droids and/ or clones, so that droids can't sit on the other side of the map and contribute to the objective, they should have to actually put themselves in harms way in order to contribute. AAT's need an outline around them, not a big marker, just a subtle outline so that they aren't invisible. And finally, the spider droids need OBJ markers on them, so that the droids know that they need to protect them, and so that the clones know that they need to destroy them to make winning easier. What do you guys think about this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Light Side has Y-Wings on 4/6 maps that slow you down and disable your abilities, how do you counter this? You don't, you pray the Y-Wing pilot isn't the best and can't kill a slow moving ship. X-Wings can quad their damage, essentially winning all 1v1 situations in both GA and SA, the TIEs and Droids can only increase their rate of fire, 1v1, head on, with the same star cards, the X-Wing quad damage wins 9/10 times if not more. They also have two more hero ships than the Dark Side.... dafaq? Also, please add more Starfighter assault maps! And make xp gained 2x permanently, the recent x3 event was fun but even I'll admit that was too much, x2 should be fine tho.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I really do not like the new game mode.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-27 11:37:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been with this game since the beta, so I know what disappointment feels like, I've waited for this game mode since EA Play 2018, etc etc. But this new game mode is just.... not good at all. Here are my problems with Capital Supremacy: - The map is so damn small. The Command Posts feel like they are there for the sake of fan service, they are literally only a 15 second run from each other. -Why even are there command posts? You capture them.... and then gain tickets? You can't spawn on them, all they do spawn wise is control where on the outer ring of the map you spawn, no spawning on a command post to defend a nearby command post, pray to RNGesus that you spawn close enough to defend. - The capital ship interiors are literally Galactic Assault, down to the map layout. Same objs for both indoor phases, and Battlefront 2's mouldy bread and butter, bottlenecks! -Light side has the better obj based heroes..... and Anakin. Obi, Ani, and Yoda all have a force push of some kind, which means they can drag off any droids attempting to arm/disarm and obj, only Maul can do that for the Seps. Yoda's health buff + ARC Troopers = Literally 6 extra heroes for the Republic. - Pipeline West isn't a map I enjoy, now this one is more my personal taste rather than bad gameplay design, but... you see, there's only this map for now, so while I enjoy this game modes concept, I really think it needs some balancing + new maps for it to keep me coming back. - Please nerf anakin, from, the majority of the playerbase. HOWEVER, I do like some things about this update: -PJ Dooku.... need I say more? -ARC Troopers are really fun, but just a lil OP imo. Commando Droids are super fucking fun to play as, the Vibrosword is what Phasma's Staff should be! Their blaster needs a small dmg buff tho. - Credit where it's due, holy fuck the AI is so good, like at first I thought they were players, until I realised they were AI, they are actually a lot better than some of the real players, think they need a little tweak tho, but I can't put my tongue on what they need changed... but they just feel a lil off to me, not sure why?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How the hell are solo queue healers meant to gain SR?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-02 13:18:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm an ex diamond player, but now I'm stuck in gold with no way out. I really do hate blaming other team mates, as I usually look for flaws in my healing and positioning to determine what went wrong, but lately, I think I'm doing everything right, and quite a few (not all, but quite a lot) of my team mates are just.... not making things easy. For example: How the heck am I mean't to keep a suicidal charge Reinhardt alive when all of the enemy team focuses him as he charges? How the heck am I supposed to heal you over there genji?! Find a healthpack or dash back here for heals! How is asking you to swap to a different hero that counters one of the enemies' stronger players blaming you? I've just simply asked if you could switch from Ashe to Mcree so that you can counter that Doomfist. You can say no, but don't accuse me of being toxic pls. I guess what I'm trying to say is, healing is not just the healers job alone dps. Healing is a two man job, you, and the healer, you don't just play and go on kill streaks while I follow in your trail keeping your limbs attached, be aware of you position or line of sight, so that an ana can shoot her piss shots at you or Zen can orb you, and please don't be afraid of using the "need heals" command, and don't get mad at the healers for not going behind enemy lines just to heal you because you over extended. Healing is a two man job, keep that in mind and hopefully we can all gain some SR :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I understand that I ain't perfect, no player is, but what I meant by that was like: Sombra on either side of the map needed heals, I was on the other side of the map, what was I mean't to do? Sorry if I worded that poorly in the post. I have tried just asking for a hero in general rather than asking someone specifically, but usually no one responds to it, so I usually go for asking directly, but making sure I ask for a similar style hero (Ashe to Mcree for example) but they are still entitled to say no of course</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by accidentally starting a hentai stash....</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-24 11:59:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, so have you ever had one of those days where you bought something because it looked like a good idea? Only to then find out how much of a bad idea it was later? Well that just happened to me today, and now I have a hentai stash. Our story begins at the start of this year, having just finished school, I decided to have a gap year to clear my head and see what I want to do with my life, but to make sure I wasn't just sitting on my ass, I started learning Japanese so that I was doing something, it's been going well so far, I do enjoy the language and the culture. I already watched anime, but now I've increased my anime doses and started watching subs every now and then so that I slowly learn the language alongside my Japanese lessons. Now today, I visited a Japanese bookstore, where they had mainly English Manga and Light Novels, but they also had a section of PURE JAPAN Manga, no translations at all, just pure Weeb. I thought that picking up a RANDOM, and I CANNOT STRESS RANDOM ENOUGH, Japanese manga, and translating it as I read would help be learn the language structure and maybe even start to speak sentences. Now, if you read the title, you cleary know how Lady Luck frowned/smiled upon me depending on your you look at it. So what I did to pick at a random Manga, I stared and walked alongside the wall of weeb before me, staring from cover to cover, I decided that I was going to pick a manga based on the front cover, this lead to me picking a manga that had a rather cute waifu material on the front, I thought: "Fuck it, I've already fallen into being a weeb, let's commit." I purchased, and on the train home I was excited to get home, crack out my notes, and start translating the bitch. When I got home, I decided to read some reviews on the Manga, I looked inside.... and was greeted by a *rather* revealing swimsuit drawing of 4 of the characters, I thought nothing of this at first, I just thought "typical anime, nothing unusual here". I typed the series title google, HxEros, and I'm greeted with the manga's English translation, titled "Dokyuu *Hentai* HxEros". So, I now physically own hentai, I've torn the packaging off, so I can't return it, oh and some of my family members can read Japanese.... so this book has gotta be hidden now so that I avoid the awkward "whatcha got there Eek?" conversation. This means I now have a hentai stash..... Anime really is a slippery slope that leads to ruin. TL:DR, bought Manga to assist me in learning Japanese, turns out it was hentai, and I am now committed to translating hot steamy Anime Sex EDIT: Cleared a rather interesting Typo....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So I just had one of my best gaming moments in Battlefront 2</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-19 07:31:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't care how cringey this is to read, it was fucking awesome, and I wanted to share it, and hopefully the devs see it too, so that they know their game is making star wars fans super happy. I was playing Kamino CS as the Republic, both teams were getting close to getting their boarding ships, we had 46, droids had 45, but we controlled 3 of the command posts. As I'm running on one of the walkways, I see a large group of droids coming from Command Post C about to push hard onto Command post D, this oncoming firefight was going to decide who got their boarding ships. I sprint as fast as I can to Command Post D to meet them, I'm alone at first, but then I turn around, and I see my brothers coming down the bridge to fight alongside me. At this point, this command post has 20 people on it, 12 droids, 8 clones. I deploy my squad shield as the enemy opens fire on us, that was fucking cool, seeing and hearing the shield take all of the fire for us, I then use my battle command to buff my team mates, and my clone yells: "We're Clones! We fight, we win!", one by one, we take all of the droids out, even a few that flanked us, and then, General Fucking Grievous shows up and slaughters everyone, I'm the last clone left, but then fucking Yoda shows up and gets the General's attention, as well as buffing me. More clones show up to hold the command post, and we all gun Grievous down, the command post is ours! And with that, our boarding ships came down to pick us up. Thanks for reading that cringefest, see you on the Battlefront.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>For CS, can we disable squad spawning in the OBJ room?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-28 03:35:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's honestly so irritating because what often happens is a hero will just yeet themselves into the obj room, and then wait at the back, and then have their entire squad spawn on them. The enemy team is like a virus in the obj room, you have to kill them before they multiple. Don't get me wrong, squad spawning is a must and a really cool feature, but maybe DICE should disable it in OBJ rooms to avoid the virus spreading effect? EDIT: The worst offenders are the rolly bois! They just roll on past your clone defense, and then sit behind the back pillar, because they are also speedy bois, they have enough of a headstart where the defenders can't actually reach them in time before the defenders have a chance to even reach them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd rather the Shock Trooper be a skin tbh, and Empire doesn't need another Enforcer, it needs a rework/replacement for their jet trooper, the Death Trooper is fine as is, maybe the blaster replacement like you suggested. And for the Rebels, copy and pasting reinforcements isn't the way to go I feel, every faction should be unique, so having basically the same reinforcements just with different skins doesn't sound too good. Sure, Bothon spys defs for Infiltrator, but make them different from the Caphex spies.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hey DICE, I think adding some form of jukebox for Battlefront 2 would do wonders.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-20 02:04:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>What I mean by this is basically: In the pause menu, they'll be a new audio tab titled something along the lines of "Cantina Playlists", and what this tab does is offer you the potential to create playlists from the music in Battlefront 2. You'll be able to make multiple playlists too, and set what game modes they play in. For example, say I wanted to make a playlist that plays during Hero vs. Villains, I would select "Duel of the Fates" and "Battle of the Heroes", add them to a new playlist, and then make it so that that playlist only plays in matches of Heroes vs. Villains. This would allow people to play the game in a more personalised experience, since the music is half of what makes this game so much fun! This could also lead to some more customizable options in the future, like we could set custom music queues for a Republic Victory, Empire Defeat, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I used the Acid Launcher for the Assualt, can shoot into into a major doorway and halt the enemy team's progress for a bit. I've had successful defensives of the Resistence Capital Ship, and honestly it's a bit of "git gud" and luck, luck that your team can divide themselves somewhat equally to defend both points, and "git gud" in the sense that you know the map layout, which in turn gives you routes to flank the enemy and pick them off from behind. Oh and be good at soccer because BB-9E is a fucking slippery bouncey menace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yes Telltale's Batman was my introduction to Batman and HOLY FUCK what a story, it's sequel series The Enemy Within isn't as good but is still worth playing in my opinion. Also don't forget to try out Tales from the Borderlands, it's regarded as their best game/story, which I personally agree with!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Japanese, "Kawaii" ( #12363; #12431; #12356; #12356;) means "cute". But, "Kowai" ( #12371; #12431; #12356;) means "scary". They are pronounced very similiarily, so if you are trying to impress your Japanese partner (or waifu for many redditors) by calling them cute in their language, be careful since they might get super offended when you accidentally call them scary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a mainly PlayStation guy, I can safely say who the fuck cares what you play on. Xbox Series X is more powerful than PS5, but I don't feel cheated or like I'm inferior, we're all here to play games, I just happen to prefer PlayStation cuz platnium trophies and their exclusives appeal more to me. That doesn't make me better or worse than any other gamer. Whether you play on PC, Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft, we're all gamers, let's just play games people!</TEXT>

And most importanly, we wouldn't of gotten the first ever hybrid console, which is perfect for a lot of gamers, a console that you can take with you to play anywhere, and you can put it on the big screen when you get home. I cannot wait to see what Nintendo brings to the table with their next console after the Switch</TEXT>
