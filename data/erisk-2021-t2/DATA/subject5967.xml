    <TITLE>I shouldn't want to die</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-29 19:02:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>i feel like i should be happy, i shouldn't want to die, i shouldnt hate myself so much, i have everything anyone would ever want, and i don't want anything more i really don't, i just don't want any of this, i just wish i never existed in the first place. i feel like every single day is too much, like breathing is too much, walking is too much, every little desicion is too much, i want a break of everything so that maybe i'll feel more ready to wake up every morning. i am doing well, nothing to complain about, i know, my studies are going well, i have people around me, they're great, i dont deserve them, they helped me through a lot of breakdowns although i should have never bothered them with this. i can keep on living for a little longer, but i dont see why, it feels like a duty that im not fit for. i don't want to keep feeling this way, i know i shouldnt feel this way, i should be happy and living my best life atm, but i'm barely holding onto it. i hope you can make sense of this cause it's hard for me to put it in a better way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no you're not in the wrong. you should always seek help when you need it. mental health issues can be especially hard to deal with and keeping them to yourself would only make it worse. don't take what she said personally she just seems to not be well informed about mental health that's it. it's really sad you had to deal with that, it must've been bad for you to get such an answer for the one you turned to when you needed help, but don't let them get to you. and don't be afraid to reach out to your friends or get professional help if needed, someone will listen and someone will try to help you out.</TEXT>
