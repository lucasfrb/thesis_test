    <TEXT>With full Armor Penetration, Spy deals 937.5 damage to a giant with one backstab. With max Attack Speed, he can backstab three times before the giant turns around, allowing him to deal 2812.5 damage to a giant (unless it's a Giant Medic, which never turns around to backstabs, allowing Spy to 0-death it.) Once the giant turns around, spy just needs to duck for cover, surf the damage or pop the dead ringer and redisguise, wait for the giant to focus on something else, and repeat. Spy can kill every regular giant in the game with only two backstab chains, and Giant Medics with only one 5 backstab chain. Spy is so much stronger than people give him credit for lmao</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People have played MvM so much that they're sick of anything wrong their teammates do. It sounds like you were kicked for being an "Idle Med," a term for Medics who prioritize support over constant kritz (i.e. buys Healing Mastery and Overheal Expert instead of Canteen Specialist and Uber Duration). Non-Idle Med is the most viable way to play Medic since it compensates for his worst weakness in MvM; lack of damage. However, I don't expect beginner Medics like you to be able to play at this level yet, and the kick was completely unjustified. Try not to let these toxic players get to you and I encourage you to keep playing and get better. MvM is a really fun gamemode and it'd be a huge shame if a couple of dumb people turned you off the whole mode.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, there's two ways to play each class in MvM, passive and aggressive, with aggressive playstyles being harder but much stronger. Passive playstyles are types that beginners fall into, and they more or less mean just fulfilling whatever your class can do without expanding past it. For example, a Scout who upgrades resistances instead of his primary can be considered passive, since he is only focusing on money instead of helping with damage. Aggressive playstyles is when you push your class' abilities to the extreme and make riskier but more rewarding upgrade choices. A Medic who upgrades Canteen Specialist, Uber Duration and Ubersaw swing speed has his Kritz charge up much, MUCH more often than a passive Medic. The Buff Banner is a passive banner. It only serves to help your team with a fairly small damage boost and isn't strong against tanks without another player helping (The time it takes to blow the banner offsets the potential increase in damage by yourself.) The Conch is a different story; it drastically increases Soldier's survivability by allowing his high damage to come back as health, and the speed boost allows him to dodge bot attacks much better. The longer you're alive, the more damage you will do. It also offsets the immediate need for resistances, allowing you to allocate more money into your primary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In MvM, the two upsides of the Eureka Effect are useless. Buildings you place in setup time are already put up to Level 3, and Teleporters should not be in a position to get destroyed by bots. Therefore the Teleporter upgrade discount is worthless. You can buy Teleport to Spawn Canteens if you desperately need to warp back to spawn midwave for a puny 10 credits. You buy a 2way Teleporter to get back to spawn quickly. Hell, you could even just killbind and buyback. There are more ways to get back to spawn fast without using the Eureka Effect. The wrench just ends up being slower at constructing buildings and getting less metal from your Dispenser. Just use stock.</TEXT>

Spy bots are not intelligent and give you more than enough time for you to react and kill them when they decloak and approach. Basic awareness is all you need.

    <TEXT>You're right that the QF can heal and revive really good, however, the QF doesn't have "infinite shields," it has faster shield build rate. If your team really badly needs your shield to be up as much as possible, you could just invest some money into Healing Mastery and still be able to kritz/instant revive. All the QF can do is be slightly better for a passive Medic who only heals and revives, which is a waste of a slot on competent teams. Also, sure, most Kritz Medics don't do jack, but that doesn't mean the Kritz itself is bad or should be placed lower than the top. It's able to be pushed into making Medic an actually worthy pick by multiplying his team's damage output consistently.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this is a clear testament to how little I play Med I guess. This is the first time I've ever been shown something even close to this. Can't find a video about it, I haven't seen it in practice and have never had a more experienced player recommend this before, which kinda makes me wonder if it's actually viable at all or it was buried by 2C boys. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I'll need to try this kind of playstyle out for a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're that low because you're sacrificing tons of damage by not using the Heatmaker. The Razorback is higher because not using the Carbine/Jarate is much, MUCH less of an impact of your overall performance than not using arguably the strongest weapon in all of MvM.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only real use I've found from Sappers is slowing Super Scouts for your team, but that's pretty niche and it causes them to turn around. I still think that's more of a use than anything his revolvers can do though. Idk, what do you think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well said. I've been trying to get better in MvM, playing missions other than 2C, playing on [potato.tf](https://potato.tf) and trying to get advice from their discord. You've been a big help in helping me see what's good and what's not in weapons and even introduced me to Shield Basher Med. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a MvM specific nerf to the YER that adds a 3 second delay before a backstab gives you a disguise. That's plenty of time for bots to turn around, notice you and attack. And since you can't disguise manually without deleting your entire Dead Ringer charge, it forces you to use one of the worse cloaks so you can recharge from ammo packs. You're better off with any other knife.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In order to be stunned by the Holiday Punch: \- The Heavy needs to have his melee out \- He needs to be in melee range \- He needs to be behind you (Actually behind, not spy 180 degree backstab hitbox behind) \- You need to not be jumping \- You need to not be a disguised spy \- You need to not be already doing another taunt  #8203; In order to be stunned by the Sandman: \- Scout needs to have his melee out \- He needs to be able to aim a projectile ... Comparing the two is dumb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's refreshing to see an enemy gamer not trying to kill me every once in a while, so I spare friendlies as long as they aren't directly between me and hostile enemy gamers. However, the second they start whining in chat about people killing them when they're friendly, I'm not going to restrain myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Medics should not be able to defend themselves well. If they could they'd be blatantly overpowered, being able to be a decent dps and also being able to put out tons of support. Being a Medic is sacrificing your own damage in favor of supporting the rest of your team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pumpkin Bombs should be at the bottom. They take too long to use effectively, they spread in a way that makes them impossible to hide, and they're so easy to nullify by just shooting them. Jump and Teleport at least give your class more mobility, Pumpkin Bombs don't have any practical use.</TEXT>
