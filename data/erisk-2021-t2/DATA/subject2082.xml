    <TEXT> gt;Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies contempt for the weak. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians without plebeians. In fact, the Leader, knowing that his power was not delegated to him democratically but was conquered by force, also knows that his force is based upon the weakness of the masses; they are so weak as to need and deserve a ruler. Since the group is hierarchically organized (according to a military model), every subordinate leader despises his own underlings, and each of them despises his inferiors. This reinforces the sense of mass elitism.  gt;-Umberto Eco, "Ur-Fascism"</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;**President Donald Trump has fired the intelligence community #8217;s chief watchdog, Michael Atkinson, who was the first to sound the alarm to Congress last September about an  #8220;urgent #8221; complaint he #8217;d received from an intelligence official involving Trump #8217;s communications with Ukraine.**  gt;Trump formally notified the Senate Intelligence Committee of his intention to fire Atkinson and remove him from his duties, to take effect 30 days from Friday, according to two congressional officials and a copy of the letter obtained by Politico.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Deutsche Bank is currently being investigated by the Justice Department over whether it failed to report suspicious activity that may have been linked to money laundering, the Times and Reuters have reported. A bank whistleblower said that she flagged transactions involving Jared Kushner #8217;s family business and Trump #8217;s former charitable foundation  #8212; since closed amid an ethics investigation  #8212; for suspicious activity in 2016 and 2017. But the whistleblower said the bank never reported her suspicions to authorities. Trump and a representative of Kushner Cos. have denied any wrongdoing.  gt;The bank, which was linked to a massive $20 billion money-laundering operation headquartered in Russia, paid millions of dollars in fines last year to the U.S. and Germany for other corruption and compliance violations. It #8217;s also at the center of a court battle as the House of Representatives seeks to obtain its records on Trump #8217;s loans.</TEXT>
