    <TEXT>What you need to understand is the immense importance of that specific land to jews. It's where Abraham and Sarah's tombs are. They were the first jews, the patriarch and matriarch of the jewish people who birthed the jewish nation. It's where the 4 holy cities of judaism are, and most importantly Jerusalem, in whose direction all jews pray towards. Jerusalem is the city that all diaspora jews said "next year in Jerusalem" on jewish New Year, for two thousand years. The most important parts of jewish history transpired there in the jewish ancestral homeland. It's not just any stretch of land. Israeli jews have no intention of abandoning it, and diaspora jews' worries are eased knowing it will be there for them if they need it. You can see their love of the land from space, as the re-forestation and re-urbanization of the land has carried on for a century: [Apollo 7's photo from 1968](https://i.imgur.com/FYDBgnF.jpg) [Columbia's photo from 2003](https://i.imgur.com/D3lQ0Ro.jpg) They have no intention of leaving.

    <TEXT>Oh no, they still had a problem. The PLO was founded in 1964, three years before Israel liberated Judea and Samaria. Back then, "palestinian liberation" meant conquering and destroying Israel within the 1948 ceasefire line, while saying that Jordan's illegal annexation of Judea and Samaria was OK. It's never been about a "palestinian" state where the "palestinians" live. It's always been about waging war on Israel instead of accepting peaceful coexistence. The PLO never had any issue with Jordan and Egypt's invasion of the Mandate in 1948 and subsequent illegal annexations of territories. They directed all their terrorism at israeli civllians, and none at the jordanaian and egyption government, which then still occupied Gaza, Judea, and Samaria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that summary is true, if glib. There are official ottoman censuses of the region with paltry population figures, and we know how underdeveloped the region was. The thing with that wording that's wrong, is that it ignores the jewish presence that was always there as a (often persecuted) minority in the region, and that it doesn't mention the religious olim who came during the aliyot. Here's something fun to stare at, two photos of Israel taken from space showing how the re-forestation project has progressed over the last century: [Apollo 7's photo from 1968](https://i.imgur.com/FYDBgnF.jpg) [Columbia's photo from 2003](https://i.imgur.com/D3lQ0Ro.jpg) Eretz Israel like other parts of the levant was unsustainably deforested under ottoman rule, particularly in the 19th century to build railroads.

    <TEXT>Absolutely no, the arabs of the region were never promised a state by any european power. Britain in WW1 induced a arab revolt in the ottoman empire emanating out of Hejaz by promising one, but their deal never included what became the Mandate of Palestine, which was always intended to be a jewish state out of a partition of the ottoman caliphate. The arab state Britian promised to the Heshimite clan who they later installed on the thrown in Jordan and Iraq, was supposed to consist of parts of modern say Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Iraq. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration Furthermore, jews did not just suddenly show up there out of nowhere after WW2. That region, Judea, always had a jewish presence since they emerged as a people and culture more than 4000 years ago. It's where the tombs of Abraham and Sarah are, the first jews, the patriarch and matriarch of the jewish people who birthed their nation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs Jews have always lived in Judea, but became a minority in the region sometime after the roman conquest due to the immense destruction brought upon in the jewish-roman wars. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish #8211;Roman_wars The arabs came later as colonizers after the islamic conquest in the 7th century. The next 1100 years saw jews living as second class citizens (dhimmis) who were often persecuted. Here are some relatively recent examples: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Ottoman_Syria Fast Foward to 1947 and the newly founded UN inherits the League of Nation's mandate to establish a jewish state in the jewish homeland whose mission was awarded to Britain. Following WW2, Britain unilaterally declares that they will imminently withdraw from the Mandate of Palestine, and the UN votes to partition the land into two states instead of a single jewish state. The jewish leadership agrees to the UN's plan, and the arabs don't. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine With many 100,000s of holocaust survivor jews in post war europe stateless and homeless still, the jewish leadership decides to declare independence so they will have a country to go to. The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Labanon, Syria, and Iraq under the Arab League invades a day before the vote on independence starting off Israel's War of Independence, which they win against all odds. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab #8211;Israeli_War Following the ceasefire which ended the 1948 war, Jordan and Egypt illegally annex the land they captured in their invasions. Jordan does things like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_East_Jerusalem_under_Jordanian_rule  #160; And as a final aside, until 1964 "palestinian" referred to the *jews* of the region, *not the arabs*. There would have been no reason for european states to have promised to make a arab "palestinian" state, because no such identity existed until the Arab League fabricated it in 1964 as part of their propaganda war on Israel in coordination with the communist block during the Cold War. https://i.imgur.com/8T23hWM.jpg https://i.imgur.com/tPxCFAC.jpg</TEXT>

The last two recommendations are of particular interest to anyone on this sub, because they're actually works of military history about specific wars/campaigns rather than the more encompassing first recommendation which has info about diplomatic and political history, and the second recommendation which tells the story of Israel with a tinge of a societal and cultural point of view.

When Israel fires back, their aim is to kill the aggressors and force a stop to the attacks on their people. Hamas attacks, Israel defends. The reason Hamas kills relatively few civilians is because every israeli home has a bomb shelter and Israelis are trained to go to bomb shelters at a moments notice. However, even a single israeli death is of course completely unacceptable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Israel doesn't aim to kill civilians. It actually puts a lot of effort into minimizing incidental civilian casualties by dropping leaflets and making phone calls to areas which will be imminently targeted for return fire. If you want to blame someone for civilian casualties, blame Hamas for holding Gaza hostage in its pointless war on Israel, and blame them for using schools and hospitals as launch locations because they want to volunteer civilians to be "martyrs" in their propaganda war on Israel. Blame them for the many dead israelis as well, of course. Hamas started their war in 2006 when they captured Gaza from the Palestinian Authority by force less than a year after Israel withdrew from it and transferred control of the territory to the Palestinian Authority. What a mistake that was, for all involved.</TEXT>

There is complete asymmetry between the IDF which follows the rules of the Geneva Conventions and responds reactively to attacks on their people, and the jihadist terrorists like Hamas and PIJ that follow no rules of war and actively aim to kill jewish civilians as a goal unto itself. In Israel we see a superior military defending against criminal barbarians who have put their genocidal aims into the Hamas Charter as an open statement of intent. If Israel were not the more powerful side, there would be a genocide of the israeli jews. As long as they remain the more powerful side, there is only "occupation" and overtures for ceasefires.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, the same explosives material was stockpiled in London and warehouses in southern Germany by Hezbollah, very possibly from the same stockpiled source in Beirut. This was confirmed by police raids which discovered the explosives stockpiles in both countries in separate incidents in the last three years. See the following articles for more information: article on the London incident: [Iran-linked terrorists caught stockpiling explosives in north-west London](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/09/iran-linked-terrorists-caught-stockpiling-explosives-north-west/) article on the southern Germany incident: [Mossad gave Berlin intel on Hezbollah ops on German soil ahead of ban  #8212; report: Unnamed Israeli official tells TV Germans were provided info on warehouses where terror group stashed materials for explosives, as well as money laundering networks](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-gave-berlin-intel-on-hezbollah-ops-on-german-soil-ahead-of-ban-report/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lebanon hasn't done an official census since the 1930s, but some experts believe that post civil war, Lebanon is only about ~30% christian at most. The state is ruled over by the jihadist terrorist group Hezbollah, or at least is impotent to stop them. Lebanon as a country is technically still officially at war with Israel from back when they declared war on Israel in 1948. Unlike Egypt and Jordan, they haven't signed a peace treaty yet. Hezbollah is also at war with Israel and has vowed to destroy it, and has more than 100,000 rockets aimed at Israel. Israel doesn't "hate muslims". They hate those that want to attack them and make war on then, and that includes the many jihadist militias running around the middle east, especially the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah. All this being said, neither Lebanon or Hezbollah say that they believe that Israel is behind this incident and have both issues statements declaring so, but conspiracy theories continue to abound in certain corners of the internet. Israel also has stated that it has no involvement in this incident, and despite being at war with Lebanon, has offered humanitarian aid and their hospitals have offered to admit injured lebanese to be treated.</TEXT>

The US overlooks a lot of the insanely heinous things they do that give it headaches elsewhere, such as their financing of jihadist terrorists and their financing of the inherently ideologically anti western and anti american ikhwanist islamists, all of which are hostile to its interests and those of its allies. I have no idea if the US's stance is because the country actually has calculations for what its willing to ignore here, or if it's because the US is on autopilot and isn't taking notice of recent developments such as Qatar's recent shift into being more Iran aligned than before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tel Aviv has a number of major israeli businesses headquartered there and has the most major stock market in the country, but the city is not an industrial center and nor does it have commercial port facilities. It's actually not that economically important IMO. Israel is not a hyper centralized country where one city is *the* economic engine. There is agriculture and industry scattered throughout much of the country, with major commercial shipping and manufacturing hubs being in places like Haifa and Ashdod, with additional manufacturing hubs elsewhere. Jerusalem is a city with a growing tech industry, and Yokneam Illit while small is where many of Israel's startup tech companies are launched out of due to proximity of Technion University, in a manner similar to how Stanford helped generate Silicon Valley in California. Additional cities of industrial importance are Migdal HaEmeq, Ma'alot, Petach Tikvah, Netivot, Sderot, Kirat Gat, Beit Shemesh, HaKrayot, and more. Kiryat Gat is where Intel chips that are in practically every computer and phone on the planet are manufactured. Tel Aviv's residents actually have a bit of a negative reputation within Israel in fact, being stereotyped as being a bit out of touch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tel Aviv only has 400,000 residents though. While it is a city of some renown, I wouldn't be too harsh on anyone if they didn't know where it is. It's not like Jerusalem which is the capital of the country and is a absolutely ancient city with tons of history and of course its biblical importance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think one can make such comparisons without being sightly misleading unintentionally. The social situations in the US and Israel have some stark differences. The US is very sharply divided between two socio-political sides with an exasperated and apathetic majority that doesn't bother to vote and just wants to be left alone. Israel is more unified in their mainstream with most every israeli sharing army experiences and having a fair bit of majority consensus on issues of the day. Israel's elections have recently been more about politicians' personas than they have been about policy differences. Israel has a national unity government and Netanyahu and Gantz agree on quite a lot. But Israel also has some sociological issues that the US doesn't with lots of terrorist sympathizers among its large arab minority and issues concerning religion that are more prominent than in the US. I don't believe Tel Aviv is really fully comparable to San Fransisco in the US, although it certainly has some residents who fit that stereotypical mold. Tel Aviv isn't wildly seditious and home to as many unabashed commies. Boston might actually be a better comparison IMO. Boston is a very overly educated and elitist place that's overpriced, but its more liberal proper than hyper leftist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The old confessional system dispossessed shias and druzes of political power (and lebanon's jews for that matter), but it was a power sharing arrangement between the christians and the sunnis that monopolized power between the two with a slight built in advantage for the christians. It was put into power under France's rule of the territory, but local actors helped craft the constitution and enforce it for their own gain. I don't think their agency should be overlooked. In particular, the christians decision to lobby France for a *Grand Liban* instead of the option of a *Petit Liban* where they would have had an unassailable majority is what necessitated the confessional system in the first place. So lebanese christian greed, and in particular maronite greed if I'm remembering correctly, was a massive determinate factor in how the history unfolded. Grand Liban ultimately lead to their civil war and the tilting of power away from the christians in the enlarged state and ultimately towards the shias backed by Iran. The inciting factors of their civil war, were the already present refugee camps of stateless outsider sunnis who were made ineligible for naturalization, and the addition of PLO agitators who were just kicked out of Jordan for attempting to overthrow the government there.</TEXT>

Israel is simply good at defending itself from those who want to murder them, and every israeli home by law must have a bomb shelter. *That* is the way that israelis live while murderous jihadists attack them, and burn every surrounding state in the middle east to the ground. Your complete and utter lack of empathy for their lives is what is mind blowing. You can't just handwave away Canada funding jihadist terrorists even by accident. That is significant and it has a cost in blood. Canada's profound negligence here is all the more damning given that Canada rightfully lists Hamas as a terrorist group, and Islamic Relief Worldwide's ties to them have been confirmed by numerous governments around the world. Canada agreed to give money to a organization that many countries ban for ties to a terrorist group that Canada recognizes as a terrorist group, and which many banks across the world won't even do business with. How did this even come to pass?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely delusional and ignorant. It is not possible for there to be zero collateral damage, but Israel does a lot to minimize incidental civilian casualties. Far more than any other country on earth, frankly. Israel drops leaflets and makes phone calls to neighborhoods before their return fire imminently arrives. Hamas volunteers civilians to be "martyrs" by launching their rockets out of schools and hospitals to wage their propaganda war on Israel, because they know how the biased international media will churn out those ragebait and clickbait headlines. Do you even know how many iraqi and syrian civilians Canada and the rest of NATO has killed in *their* bombing campaigns against ISIS? 10,000s. Media doesn't cover it as much because Israel is instant clickbait whereas this isn't. The NATO intervention against ISIS did not utilize incidental civilian casualty minimization strategies like Israel does when returning fire, and it shows in the number of dead. It goes without saying that Hamas doesn't try to minimize civilian casualties. They want to kill every last israeli jew and launch unguided munitions at israeli towns which is a war crime, and they intentionally use gazan civilians as human shields and sacrificial lambs, which is a double war crime. Killing civilians is Hamas's goal. Saving civilians is Israel's goal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not out of left field for those who follow middle eastern geopolitics closely. This was years in the making. Netanyahu's governments over the last three Knessets have been making impressive diplomatic inroads all over the world. Israel has long had clandestine relations with the gulf arab states, and especially the UEA, Saudi Arabia, and Oman have been warming to Israel at a governmental level, with quiet trade relations and cooperation against Iran's expansionism. [Two months ago, the UAE diplomat Yousef al Otaiba was actually the first ever arab official to write a OpEd in a major israeli newspaper addressed to the nation.](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/H1Gu1ceTL) It was long expected that if the Palestinian Authority refused to come to the table through this last offer for a two state solution, the gulf arab states would move on from requiring a solution to the I/P conflict as a precondition for establishing formal ties. The PA under Abbas however had elected to cut formal relations with the US, rejected the Oslo Accords, refused to stop incentivizing terrorism with their "martyr" fund, and boycotted the Deal of the Century conference. The arab world is losing its patience with the palestinians. I predict Oman will be next to establish formal ties, probably within a decade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is superb news for the US, and represents a diplomatic victory from the Trump admin's Deal of the Century initiative. Two of the US's key allies in the middle east are now patching up relations, which means US policy in the middle east can become more unified and coherent. One recalls how the George Bush Sr. admin had to actually bribe Israel to stay out of the first Gulf War to keep their arab coalition together, while Sadamm was launching scud missiles at Israel in an attempt to bring them into the conflict and fracture the enemy coalition. Now that the UAE will recognize Israel formally and is building stronger economic and diplomatic ties with them, the US will be able to count on being able coordinate with both at the same time.</TEXT>

The bonus is that the Palestinian Authority further isolated themselves by severing ties with the US, renouncing the Oslo Accords, and losing US substantive support by refusing to comply with the Taylor Force Act. The last three years of theatrics has been one long exercise in showing the world just how much the Palestinian Authority doesn't want to negotiate for a two state solution. Now the PA is on notice that the gulf arab states other than perhaps Qatar will no longer consider a solution for the I/P conflict as a precondition for normalized ties with Israel. The PA can no longer hold Israel's relations with the rest of the region as a hostage with their intransigence. They've just lost one of their only poker chips. In the future, they will have no choice but to negotiate with Israel sincerely if they want a two state solution.</TEXT>

The US will no longer subsidize them, and the democratic party's latest revision of their party platform promises no revision on aid for the PA or UNRWA. The gulf arab states are now free to upgrade their ties to Israel if they want to, with the I/P issue shelved as a precondition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say that Turkey and Iran's relations are the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of this age. The two regimes have massively conflicting interests and sectarian differences, and inevitably there will be more open conflict between the two of them, perhaps when Qatar's influence over Turkey is no longer enough to mediate the issues, but for now Erdogan has operated from a naive pan islamist worldview where any iranian gains were disregarded as only the infidel west's problem. With iranian ascent in Iraq and Syria over the last decade, this negligence is beginning to become impossible. Indeed, turkish troops have already skirmished with the SAA and their iranian and russian backers in northern syria. While the end of the iranian-turkish detente is not yet here, it's only a matter of time until their conflicting spheres of interests drag them into more pronounced open conflict.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ADL is an american organization that monitors antisemitic groups and gives advice to law enforcement on how to deal with them and better protect jews in their community. How does that have to do with Israel?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; And actually, if you are a jewish person running and want to visit the holy land, which airport would you travel through? Hell, if you're any religion and want to visit the holy land, you kinda have to pass through Israel no? (correct me if I'm wrong). Ben Gurion Airport is the closest international airport with routes to the US. Technically one could fly to Amman in Jordan and drive to the border into Israel, but it's less practical, and there's a lot less to see of biblical importance if you refuse to step foot in Israel proper, Jerusalem and Nazareth among the things you'd be avoiding. Anyone making a pilgrimage to HaAretz HaKodesh is invariably going to Israel proper. I can't imagine anyone just only visiting like Bethlehem and then leaving without seeing much of anything else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep. And in fact, one of the reasons why relations between Israel and the arab world are thawing is because the palestinians have burned bridges with much of the arab world. Hamas is openly aligned with Iran. The Palestinian Authority arrogantly flaunts gestures from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. Palestinian militants tried to overthrow the governments of Jordan and Lebanon in the 1970s. Gazans aid the jihadist insurgency against Egypt in Sinai. Many of the palestinian diaspora in Kuwait were a fifth column for Iraq's invading army in 1990. The list goes on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Malthus's assertion pertained to the carrying capacity of lands based on food production. The mechanization of agriculture, synthetic fertilizers, and dwarf cultivars only increased the productivity per acre, and thus the carrying capacity of land, but it didn't disprove his central point. These inventions and new techniques have only pushed the issue of starvation into the future, but without additional increases in productivity, that point will be reached. But that is relatively unrelated to this subject, which is about the full utilization of earth's resources beyond the point that they can replenish themselves at the rate of current consumption.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Green Line is just a ceasefire line from the 1948 war. It isn't a formal, official, and legal border.  gt; What I want is for Israel to retreat back to its internationally recognised borders (pre '67) and leave the Palestinians alone. When Israel did precisely that with their withdrawal from Gaza, their reward was for the gazans to not leave Israel alone, with them waging a forever war on Israel with more 10,000 rockets launched on israeli towns and cities from the jihadist terrorists who rule that territory. The reality is, is that its the palis that must leave Israel alone for there to be peace. They much abandon their warmongering delusion that they can somehow conquer all of Israel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hamas shouldn't use schools and hospitals as human shields while they launch rockets at Israel. It's a double warcrime: aiming to kill enemy civilians with terror bombing, while aiming to kill ones own civilians for propaganda purposes. Thankfully, Israel is getting very good at reducing the number of casualties on their side by building bomb shelters in every home and developing defensive systems like Iron Dome.</TEXT>

They don't want *a* independent state. They want the total conquest of the infidels next door. There could have been a pali state a long time ago, but the Palestinian Authority has rejected every offer for independence that Israel has ever made. There absolutely would be a Hamas and PIJ even if there was a two state solution, because they represent a large majority of palis who don't want there to be an independent Israel *as their core motivation and goal*. Just check out this poll:  gt;On broader questions of relations with Israel and the peace process, West Bank and Gaza Palestinians have very mixed views. On the one hand, there is majority support for the long-term goal of reclaiming all of Palestine, and for armed struggle as a means toward that end. Fifty-eight percent of West Bankers and 65 percent of Gazans say that even if a "two-state solution" is negotiated, "the struggle is not over and resistance should continue until all of historic Palestine is liberated." In the West Bank, 56 percent support "armed struggle and car attacks against the occupation" -- though just 23 percent feel "strongly" that way. And in Gaza, an astonishing 84 percent back such violent tactics, including 53 percent who voice strong support. https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/new-poll-shows-most-palestinians-for-practical-progress-tactical-compromise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hamas's first act in Gaza was throwing Fatah officials off buildings to take full control through force. And more than a thousand israeli civilians have been murdered by Hamas's rockets and bombs since 2005. Just watch this video of a rocket falling only a few meters away from an israeli elementary school which would have killed 100s of children. https://np.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/9tr9jc/iron_dome_intercepts_incoming_missile_fired_from/ The israeli city of Sderot is the closest to Gaza and has seen the most rockets, and notoriously its children have PTSD and require psychological medications. Every israeli home has to be built with a bomb shelter, and every Israeli is constantly drilled in how to rush to one at a moments notice because they only have mere seconds to respond when the sirens go off. You couldn't possibly be less informed on this subject and less blas #233; about the situation of the israelis in the face of these murderous jihadists. Who told you that no Israelis have died?? That's a lie. Israelis are murdered by these jihadist terrorists all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SS: An israeli firm called SaliCrop has developed chemical bathes to soak seeds in that manipulate gene expression in saline environments. They have conducted field trials in Israel, India, and Spain with numerous crops, and they report yield increases of 13-32%. here's a photo from one of their field trials in Maharashtra, India, with the treated seeds on the left and normal untreated seeds on the right: https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/08/salicrop-panoramic.jpg This is a major breakthrough, because ~20% of the world's farmland has saline soil, and that percentage is actually increasing. Normally saline soil reduces the types of crops and their yields that can be grown in that soil. In Israel where there is very high levels of brackish water recycling including for agriculture, there is a need for saline resistance in crops. This technique presents a solution without having to genetically engineer new cultivars. This technique is also valuable for coastal agricultural lands that frequently get flooded by saline water from the seas.</TEXT>

This has also been accompanied by a show of force with a turkish naval squadron of 15 vessels sallying out of their base to make a point. Also in the past, Turkey didn't have an expeditionary force in Libya to prop up a client state which they would use as a pretext to divide sea territories with, that exclude Greek EEZ areas under UNCLOS.</TEXT>

I see the JCPOA as essentially a capitulation, that was pushed mainly by the EU and many individual european governments with the aim of increasing trade opportunities with the Islamic Republic of Iran, with little regard for the increased destruction that would follow in its wake. In many ways, the billions that Iran received from the deal in 2015 helped them finish the job in Syria and pushed them over the finish line there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Israel wanted all the land, why did they offer independence to the Palestinian Authority numerous times, only for their offers to be rejected every time, and why did pre-state Israel agree to two state solutions when offered by the international community? https://i.imgur.com/M5uQFAr.jpg You have it backwards, it the pali side which wants all the land, and refuses to choose to live in peaceful coexistence. Just check out this poll:  gt;On broader questions of relations with Israel and the peace process, West Bank and Gaza Palestinians have very mixed views. On the one hand, there is majority support for the long-term goal of reclaiming all of Palestine, and for armed struggle as a means toward that end. Fifty-eight percent of West Bankers and 65 percent of Gazans say that even if a "two-state solution" is negotiated, "the struggle is not over and resistance should continue until all of historic Palestine is liberated." In the West Bank, 56 percent support "armed struggle and car attacks against the occupation" -- though just 23 percent feel "strongly" that way. And in Gaza, an astonishing 84 percent back such violent tactics, including 53 percent who voice strong support. https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/new-poll-shows-most-palestinians-for-practical-progress-tactical-compromise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see no reason to be optimistic here. The pali national ideology is a death cult where they only care about destroying Israel, not building their own country. They tell themselves that there will be a final victory somehow, and that they can just wait forever for it. They don't think about the day after (ex. they have no hope of matching or maintaining Israel's electrical, desalination, and agricultural infrastructure, which they rely on as much as israelis do). In addition, their corrupt political leadership would lose foreign aid money to siphon, if the conflict ever ends, so they won't allow it to. The Palestinian Authority's leaders have no motive to build a real country. Not because of a positive identity based on a real nation building motivation, and not because it would help them personally. Israel isn't dealing with a nation, it's dealing with a bunch of bickering clans that only agree on wanting to see Israel destroyed somehow.</TEXT>

Later on, some of Israel's formal borders have been set by treaties with Egypt and Jordan, but the Green Line between Israel proper and the disputed territories in Judea and Samaria are not and have never been formal borders. I repeat myself, as the successor state to the Mandate, Israel remains the only country with a legal claim to the disputed territories in Judea and Samaria. Jordan formally renounced theirs, leaving Israel as the only state on earth who can claim any of the land.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's also not what the palis themselves want:  gt;On broader questions of relations with Israel and the peace process, West Bank and Gaza Palestinians have very mixed views. On the one hand, there is majority support for the long-term goal of reclaiming all of Palestine, and for armed struggle as a means toward that end. Fifty-eight percent of West Bankers and 65 percent of Gazans say that even if a "two-state solution" is negotiated, "the struggle is not over and resistance should continue until all of historic Palestine is liberated." In the West Bank, 56 percent support "armed struggle and car attacks against the occupation" -- though just 23 percent feel "strongly" that way. And in Gaza, an astonishing 84 percent back such violent tactics, including 53 percent who voice strong support. https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/new-poll-shows-most-palestinians-for-practical-progress-tactical-compromise</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also "christian" is a broad category given the existence of different catholic and orthodox churches in the region. The map already divides islam sunni and shia, but doesn't mark the same broad distinction for christianity. More specifically copts and assyrians are functionally ethno-religious groups unto themselves, and should be specifically marked as distinct groups IMO, in addition to noting where the catholic and orthodox majority areas are among middle eastern christians. In general, the map is highly simplified, in addition to some outright errors that exist on it. Another issue is that it doesn't differentiate between twelver shias and alawi shias, even though twelvers consider alawis to be heretics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One advantage that the regime in Iran has that eastern block communist regimes did not, is that it is a theocracy, and doing one's part to support god's will is a strong motivational factor. The iranian regime doesn't necessarily have as much to fear from guilty consciences among its internal security forces, because these individuals not only benefit from the regime materially, but they also likely feel absolved of these sins spiritually, by ensuring the rule of the mullahs remains in place, who are exalted figures in that society. They go back to their families with the same sense of moral *superiority* as a spanish inquisitor did. They broke bones, but it was god's will to root out the enemies of the clergy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few things off the top my head: 1) Germany should have had at their disposal at least a portion of captured rolling stock and locomotives from occupied western europe. However the problem with different rail gauges would have applied, and they'd be of little use in the USSR where the rail gauge had not yet been shortened. 2) German trucks ran into unforeseen problems in the USSR. Their engines were giving out at unexpected rates due to the higher amounts of dust that was kicked up in the steppe, at a rate faster than german industry could replenish them (which also effected other vehicles including and especially Panzer 3s and 4s). And the further ahead of usable rail heads that german formations traveled, the more distance the trucks had to traverse which wore them out at faster rates. The second point is built off a interview with David Stahel on the New Books Network on his book [*Operation Barbarossa and Germany's Defeat in the East*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6536795-operation-barbarossa-and-germany-s-defeat-in-the-east), that I recall. I hope I'm remembering what he said correctly here.  #160; EDIT: I seem to have remembered right. I found a relevant section in Stahel's *Operation Barbarossa and Germany's Defeat in the East* in chapter 6:  gt; While the summer downpours caused many roads to simply disappear into the swamps, in other areas the thick mud quickly reverted to the army's other great encumbrance  #8211; dust. On 6 July Wilhelm Pr #252;ller wrote in his diary:  gt; gt; The advance goes very slowly. Numerous obstacles keep slowing down our charge. You can't really call what we're on a road. It's better than this in the tiniest hamlet in Germany. And we're marching on a main road! The shoulders of the road are all muddy from the previous rain  #8211; you sink up to your knees  #8211; but in the middle of the road there's dust already #8230;each vehicle [is] surrounded by an impenetrable cloud of dust.^27  gt; The same remarkable spectacle was observed by 4th Panzer Army's Chief of Staff, Major-General G #252;nther Blumentritt, who wrote after the war:  #8216;A vivid picture which remains of those [first] weeks is the great clouds of yellow dust #8230;The heat was tremendous, though interspersed with sudden showers which quickly turned the roads to mud before the sun reappeared and as quickly baked them into crumbling clay once again. #8217;^28 The commander of the XXXXIII Army Corps wrote on only the second day of the war:  #8216;Every step, every vehicle sends up an impenetrable cloud [of dust]. The march routes are marked by a yellow brown cloud, which hangs for a long time like mist before the sky. #8217;^29 For man, machine and beast the dust proved a torment for the German advance. It was ironic that the very roads upon which the rapid German blitzkrieg depended were also a primary factor in slowing their drive to the east. For the infantry, one soldier wrote of the summer advance:  gt; gt; Our feet sank into the sand and dirt, puffing dust into the air so that it rose and clung to us. The horses coughing in the dust produced a pungent odour. The loose sand was nearly as tiring for the horses as the deep mud would have been. The men marched in silence, coated with dust, with dry throats and lips.^30  gt; In the early days of the campaign the fine dust of the Soviet Union proved more deadly to the German panzer and motorised divisions than the Red Army's counter-attacks. **The dust soon overwhelmed the inadequate air filters and then infiltrated the engines, initially greatly increasing oil consumption, and ultimately immobilising the engines altogether.** Yet, for all the danger the dust posed to the German mechanised forces, it remained as unavoidable as it was pervasive. Claus Hansmann wrote that his motorised column drove  #8216;as if in a sandstorm #8217;, and he observed how  #8216;the wheels churned up fountains of sand that blackened out the sun #8230;The dust burnt in our nose and throat. #8217;^31 Not surprisingly, the fallout rate among vehicles of every kind soon began to rise alarmingly.  gt; In Guderian's panzer group, figures for the number of combat-ready tanks in his divisions vary rather widely, although all denote a striking rate of attrition which was eroding force strengths to critical levels. **Even the most optimistic assessment recorded on 7 July in the war diary of the panzer group classed the tanks in the 18th and 3rd Panzer Divisions as being at just 35 per cent combat readiness. The 4th and 17th Panzer Divisions were said to be at 60 per cent combat readiness, while the 10th Panzer Division was strongest at 80 per cent.^32 Yet, as an example of the difference in figures, the quartermaster's war diary for the panzer group claimed on the same day that the 18th Panzer Division was at only 25 per cent strength and the 17th Panzer Division at 50 per cent.^33 Two days earlier (5 July) the war diary of the XXXXVII Panzer Corps, to which both divisions belonged, claimed the 18th Panzer Division was at 30 per cent strength and the 17th Panzer Division at 33 per cent of its starting total.**^34 Obviously there was some confusion regarding the precise figures, possibly stemming from definitions of what constituted  #8216;combat ready #8217;, but what remains clear is the toll the first two weeks of operations took on the German panzers. Without question the bad roads and dust accounted for most of the high fallout, though reports show that the use of captured Soviet low octane fuel stocks proved highly destructive to German engines and accounted for a further noteworthy share of losses.^35</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Note how army group center can't move for the last few weeks and is just helping army group south. I assume you're talking about the decision to send 2nd Panzer Group southwards in mid August, which lead to the encirclement at Kiev. Wasn't that decision driven just as much by Hitler's strategic rational to prioritize taking the breadbasket of Ukraine, allow for the taking of Crimea which would end soviet bombing raids on romanian oil refineries in Ploesti, and also because the existing soviet armies in the south threatened Army Group Center's southern flank as it was extended further than the advance of Army Group South?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I tried finding maps of the Reichsautobahn for 1944-1945, and the best that I came up with is these: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E-0U8JjQAeI/TozT0ZuwV6I/AAAAAAAALqc/-cEbQd9491I/s1600/reichsautobahnen_1939spaet.jpg http://www.ostvermisste-1944.de/Dienstgrade/Dienstgrade-Wehrmacht%201941/Reichsautobahn%201941.jpg Granted the last one is for 1941, but it doesn't strongly suggest to me that the USSR had such a great logistical asset in 1944-1945. The filled-in stretches were what were completed by 1941, and the unfilled stretches were planned at the time. Even if you assume that all stretches were completed by 1944, there were only two roads from Poland, one in Pomerania and one in southern Silesia, and who knows what was available in Poland itself. It should go without saying that a force in that theater of ~3 million men, thousands of combat vehicles, thousands of guns, etc. would consume a great deal of supplies even when not in combat, and that two roads ~300 miles away from each other (I checked the distance between modern day Opole to Szczecinek) with a gap that wide between them, would only have facilitated the transfer by truck of only a small portion of such a force's consumption. I would say the Autobahn was indeed an asset, but it's not clear it was a major one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neither country having nukes would be good, to say the least. The reason Saudi Arabia may be at the beginning of a nuclear weapons program, is because of the threat posed to them by the iranian nuclear weapons program. It's setting off a regional arms race like dominoes falling. Turkey has even made statements about mulling over starting a nuclear weapons program. Given the geopolitical rivalries and the high levels of conflict in the region, and the relative lack of restraint in many of these governments, an actual nuclear exchange really could be in the cards in the future. Also what happens if a government there falls, and non-state terrorists get radioactive materials for a dirty bomb, or even an actual warhead?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You stated "Well that #8217;s anti-Muslim of you" to an accurate assessment of the "palestinian government" that you apparently agree with yourself, then. You're also arguing against a complete non-sequitur scarecrow. *No one* says that its antisemitic to dislike the israeli government. Many people accurately point out that pretending to be mad at the israeli government or the country itself is motivated by antisemitism, because "antizionism" is the one form antisemitism that can be laundered in public with a straight face. Those that make excuses for Hamas and the Palestinian Authority's acts of murder, or call for the destruction of Israel in general, are almost certainly motivated by their hatred of jews in general. There are actually evil governments in this world, such as Hamas, and those same people will never march in the street calling for an end to the Hamas regime. They generally speaking are psychotically obsessed with Israel, and naive and gullible people can be fooled into the reason why their sole focus are the supposed evils of that one country.</TEXT>

Also it's not illegal to buy land and build houses in land that no country claims. Jordan renounced their claim, Israel could formally use theirs to annex the territory wholly or partially, but legally speaking, the territory currently belongs to no country. It's legally equivalent to a island in the middle of the ocean that no country has annexed yet. Anyone could move in, and any country could plant a flag.</TEXT>

It boggles my mind why the EU hasn't banned and blacklisted the terrorist group in its entirety, instead of pretending that a so called "military wing" is separate from a so called "political wing" and that the so called "political wing" is a-ok. This leaves them open to infiltration by the group and reduces their ability to hamstring the finances and freedom of movement of the so called "military wing".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For one, *jews always lived in Judea*, before anyone else came. Some more in the late 19th century started immigrating into the Ottoman Empire. The ottoman authorities were happy with this because the jewish immigrants were buying land at inflated rates, clearing swamps, and building farms, which generated more taxes for them. Then WW1 happens and the british conquer the region from the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire also collapses. More jewish immigrants come but also many arab immigrants as well, because the region is starting to offer many economic opportunities thanks to the zionist movement's investments in the region. The british agree to help establish a jewish state, and the League of Nations agrees with this and formally entrusts them with doing so by granting a "mandate" to create a independent jewish state in the jewish homeland. Then WW2 happens, and the League of Nations dissolves and after the war it's replaced by the United Nations. in 1947 the UN votes on paritioning the Mandate to create a jewish state and a arab state. The jewish leaders agree to the plan and prepare for statehood. The arab leaders both in the Mandate and in arab countries nearby reject it, and in 1949 Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq declare war on Israel and invade. Israel survives the war as a victor. This is the tl;dr version of how Israel came to be reborn in 1948 as the first sovereign jewish state in the historical jewish homeland in 2000 years.</TEXT>

Should outright idolatry be beyond the pail of what can be criticized because it make make some apostates feel better? Having standards is a good thing.

    <TEXT>You have completely misinterpreted what I've said. Moshe harshly judged his fellow israelites on their idolatry when he returned to them from Mount Sinai. My point is that judgement of others is good because it maintains standards. If Moshe thought like you do, HaShem wouldn't be the god of Israel and judaism wouldn't exist. The fact that you say you have an apostate pagan friend underlines this truth exactly. Your friend is little different than the idol worshipers that Moshe found on his return, in this respect. Community intervention can avoid such outcomes, but that's not possible if you have a anything-goes mentality where you don't care about upholding halacha and the tenants of judaism in general. The end-logic of such a mentality is for ones' community and traditions to fragment and fade away entirely. Orthodox judaism will not fade away like that because orthodox jews maintain strict standards.</TEXT>

Your friend has broken this most important of commandments, and I judge that harshly and so should you. The arguments in those articles do not apply here, because there is no wiggle room of interpretation in such a violation of that commandment. There is no grey area here. The issue is clear and harsh judgement is deserved. This is why judgement of others is legitimate and important. Without retaining the capacity of judging others, there are no standards and eventually any practice and belief can emerge, no matter how starkly in violation of halakha and the tenets of judaism it is. The chabbad article essentially argues that dayanim and like are the ones who should judge and others should take a backseat. Perhaps for some complicated matters, but some things are simply common sense readings of basic and well established law and tradition. No dayan would ever not judge your friend to be an apostate who has taken gods other than HaShem and engaged in idolatry. No layman would not reach the same conclusion, because it is simply self evident. Even you, I have no doubt, would not deny this. You should go to your friend, and be like Moshe, and bring her back into judaism and get her to abandon her false idols and gods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And israeli internal politics has what exactly to do with the hilariously wrong charge that Israel "has been inflicting wholesale misery and death in the Levant"? For the last decade and a half that Netanyahu has lead israeli governments, Israel has maintained a cautious foreign policy that avoids conflict as much as it can. There are no israeli troops in places like Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, etc., but there are in fact iranian troops and iranian proxies fighting in those places *right now* and they have carried out massacres and war crimes in those places. The same can not at all be said for Israel. Furthermore as a point of clarification, Netanyahu leads a center right party, and the current government of Israel is a joint coalition between his center right party and a centrist party, so I don't know what this vague accusation of his supposed "actions on behalf of hard right supporters" is even supposed to refer to. Uninformed foreigners who comment on such issues, typically don't appreciate the situation that that country is in and its security needs, and they view many mainstream, normal, and sane opinions in that country as "far right" or [insert inaccurate buzzword].</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Israel hasn't built a new town in Judea and Samaria in two decades. That stopped soon after the signing of the Oslo Accords and the peaces talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that the Clinton Administration brokered. The reason why the "border" is militarized is because of suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks on israelis, especially between 2001-2005, that necessitated hard borders and security checkpoints in order to save lives from the murderous terrorists. As a final correction, the arab denizens of Judea and Samaria are not regularly attacked by the jewish civilians there or the IDF. When rare incidents of assaults and the like occur or are alleged to have occurred, IDF soldiers are investigated and then tried in a court martial if sufficient evidence is there, and israeli civilians are investigated and then tried in a civil criminal court if sufficient evidence is there. It's not some lawless hellscape of cruelty, like you seem to think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yup. The title is actually "Palestine quits Arab League role in protest over Israel deals" I have no idea why this was posted here. This story doesn't involve the US, and especially doesn't involve US politics. It involves the foreign relations of the various members of the Arab League and that of the Palestinian Authority.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Religion has little to do with any of this That would be news to [Hamas, the jihadist terrorist group.](https://i.imgur.com/KCNc2rU.jpg) That would also be news to the Palestinian Authority, which incentivizes terrorism through their "martyr" fund: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund  #160;  gt; and not all Palestinians are Muslim from the Palestinian Authority's constitution:  gt; ARTICLE 4  gt; **Islam is the official religion in Palestine.** Respect and sanctity of all other heavenly religions shall be maintained.  gt; **The principles of Islamic Shari #8217;a shall be the main source of legislation.**  gt; Arabic shall be the official language. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Palestine_(2003) When they talk about driving the israeli jews into the sea, do you not see how ludicrous it is to talk of "palestinian jews"? There is no jewish citizen of "Palestine", not under Hamas and not under the PA. They would be brutally lynched if they lived there without IDF protection. Not incidentally, the numbers of arab christians from areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas has been steadily declining due to persecution as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shechem (the native name for "Nablus") is where only a few decades ago some of the last samartians were ethnically cleansed out of in violent riots, let alone any jews living there now:  gt; Until the 1990s, most of the Samaritans resided in the West Bank city of (Nablus) below Mount Gerizim. They relocated to the mountain itself near the Israeli settlement Har Brakha as a result of violence during the First Intifada (1987 #8211;1990). Consequently, all that is left of the Samaritan community in Nablus itself is an abandoned synagogue. The Israeli army maintains a presence in the area.[21] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans#Israeli,_Jordanian_and_Palestinian_rule Whatever your hosts told you is almost certainly whitewashed of the actual history of that place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What are their opinions on things like this:  gt; On April 25, the terrified residents of the Christian village of Jifna near Ramallah asked the PA to protect them after they were attacked by Muslim gunmen. The violence erupted after a woman from the village submitted a complaint to the police that the son of a prominent, Fatah-affiliated leader had attacked her family. In response, dozens of Fatah gunmen came to the village, fired hundreds of bullets in the air, threw petrol bombs while shouting curses, and caused severe damage to public property. It was a miracle that there were no dead or wounded.  gt; Despite the residents #8217; cries for help, the PA police did not intervene during the hours of mayhem. They have not arrested any suspects. Interestingly, the rioters called on the residents to pay jizya #8212;a head tax that was levied throughout history on non-Muslim minorities under Islamic rule. The most recent victims of the jizya were the Christian communities of Iraq and Syria under ISIS rule.  gt; The second incident occurred during the night of May 13. Vandals broke into a church of the Maronite community in the center of Bethlehem, desecrated it, and stole expensive equipment belonging to the church, including the security cameras.  gt; Three days later it was the turn of the Anglican church in the village of Aboud, west of Ramallah. Vandals cut through the fence, broke the windows of the church, and broke in. They desecrated it, looked for valuable items, and stole a great deal of equipment.  gt; As in the two previous incidents, no suspects were arrested.  gt; According to its Facebook page, this is the sixth time the Maronite church in Bethlehem has been subjected to acts of vandalism and theft, including an arson attack in 2015 that caused considerable damage and forced the church to close for a lengthy period. However, even though Mahmoud Abbas himself was present on December 24, 2018, at the party to mark the church #8217;s reopening after it was renovated, the arson, in addition to acts of rioting and vandalism over the years, have received no coverage in the Palestinian media. In fact, a full gag order was imposed in many cases.  gt; It is unlikely that the latest wave of attacks will lead to the arrest, let alone prosecution, of any suspects. The only thing that interests the PA is that events of this kind not be leaked to the media. Fatah regularly exerts heavy pressure on Christians not to report the acts of violence and vandalism from which they frequently suffer, as such publicity could damage the PA #8217;s image as an actor capable of protecting the lives and property of the Christian minority under its rule. Even less does the PA want to be depicted as a radical entity that persecutes religious minorities. That image could have negative repercussions for the massive international, and particularly European, aid the PA receives.  gt; Though the Christians in the PA avoid saying so publicly, many of them fear  #8211; with good reason  #8211; that Muslim aggression against them will only escalate. Such fears are all the stronger in light of the thunderous silence of the Western (and Israeli) media in the face of the Christian minority #8217;s ongoing disappearance from the PA and Islamic lands in general  #8211; in striking contrast to the growth, prosperity, and increasing integration of the Christian community in Israel proper. The Christians of the Western world must demand that the PA arrest the suspects in the latest attacks and begin guarding the Christian places of worship under its rule. The ongoing international neglect of the plight of the Christians under PA rule can only lead to the vanishing of Christianity from the place where it emerged. https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/persecution-christians-palestinian-authority/</TEXT>

On the one hand, there is majority support for the long-term goal of reclaiming all of Palestine, and for armed struggle as a means toward that end. Fifty-eight percent of West Bankers and 65 percent of Gazans say that even if a "two-state solution" is negotiated, "the struggle is not over and resistance should continue until all of historic Palestine is liberated." In the West Bank, 56 percent support "armed struggle and car attacks against the occupation" -- though just 23 percent feel "strongly" that way. And in Gaza, an astonishing 84 percent back such violent tactics, including 53 percent who voice strong support. https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/new-poll-shows-most-palestinians-for-practical-progress-tactical-compromise The loss of confidence is more likely over corruption and a belief that the PA is an ineffective opponent of Israel.</TEXT>

Viewing it as a religious and ethnic conflict is closer to the truth than a "racial" one.

But its enemies made extremely poor use of what they had, and Israel made superb use of what they had. The 2006 war didn't show that Hezbollah could go toe to toe with Israel. The IDF inflicted a 5:1 casualty ratio on Hezbollah while assaulting prepared defenses and ambush points in mountainous and hilly terrain. That's nothing to write home about.</TEXT>

A retreating force wouldn't want to be retreating away from their own lines of communications and resupply, through yet more enemy held territory. This video of ambushes along the roads shows exactly why. A retreating force would want to retreat towards their own lines, and in this case it would necessitate eastward movement not northward movement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's premodern, but look up George Washington's campaign in New York and New Jersey in 1776-1777. Washington was able to successfully retreat with his army intact on like 5 separate occasions, many times over significant bodies of water without naval supremacy. I would go so far as to say it's a textbook example that maybe should be taught in military academies if it isn't. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign Washington's greatest asset was his ability to manage retreats without losing elements of his army in a pursuit. That's no small feat, and it requires good organization, deception, and timing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a counter point to what was said above, the food in the region of Lithuania and Belarus leans in general towards the sour flavor. A jewish example from the region is shav, aka sorrel soup, which has added lemon juice. I think there's an element of regional tastes at play, because this region actually should have had access to some sugar from sugar beet harvests.</TEXT>

It's questionable whether current turkish industry could create a similar system from complete scratch if it had to.

Taiwanese companies don't want or need sweedish kroner. To be a global hard currency, a currency has to be stable, freely convertible, and issued by a country in sufficient numbers that any foreign buyers who want some, can purchase them from them. In the year 2020, that narrows it down to only the US dollar. The euro, pound, yen, and yuan don't meet all three criteria, although currency baskets often carry them in certain amounts.</TEXT>

Amnesty thus demonizes Israel for its just self defense against *aggressors* who *intentionally* are bombing *its civilians.
