    <TITLE>No experience in IT - wanna get my CCNA - Advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-03 09:44:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I basically just finished college for marketing and have absolutely no experience with IT whatsoever but wanna get into IT now. I don't wanna go back to college so I just wanna get cisco certified. Everyone I know in IT tells me to get my CCNA. I started by watching CCNA study videos on youtube and built myself a little mini lab at home so far with a few switches and learning to use putty. That's all I have done so far. Any advice on how I can teach myself, especially with literally no IT knowledge except for the basic that any millenial has?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t have good answer for you because I often seem to annoy people as well for no reason. What I have noticed though is that there are certain people that just get offended or annoyed by literally anything. The people that are nice and worth talking to wouldn #8217;t do that unless you really crossed a line. So my suggestion would be to just directly communicate to them that you have a hard time with that and you do not mean to cause any offense at all. And that if you do cause them offense to please know it is not your intention and to please tell you so that you can learn to avoid that in the future. Kind people worth talking to will understand. The ones that wouldn #8217;t aren #8217;t worth talking to. IMO</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're doing really well. Just a few suggestions: While going over the jump you should already know where you want to go after it and then put more of your weight into the stirrup of the side you are trying to go. That way your horse can land in the correct lead. Overall using your weight pushing down into one stirrup more than the other and looking where you're going is a great way to get your horse to go in the right directions rather than using the reins when you're standing in the stirrups. (I hope that was helpful. Sorry for the bad way of explaining, English is not my first language)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's an immature thing to say in my opinion. I don't know how old you are but at a certain point in life you will realize that looks and love have very litle to do with each other. If I am being honest I believe that there isn't really true love in a lot of relationships between very beautiful people and they often date each other for the body not for the soul. I have seen many couples in which one person is by far less physically attractive than the other one. It doesn't matter. They love each other. love goes beyond looks. It's about compatability and finding someone that you have a great time with and you know they will always be there no matter what. I know i. e. that I am considered very attractive in societies standards but I would never want a partner that likes me for my looks. What if my face gets burned in a grease fire or I gain a lot of weight after pregnancy or I end up disabled from an accident. I want a partner that will always love me for me and I will always love them for them. Real mature people know that.  #8203; Of course theres a difference between "not exactly physically attractive" and just "doesn't take care of themselves" one thing you can't do anything about and it doesn't matter and one thing is your choice and makes you unattractive to people. But that is a different story.</TEXT>

So I walk up to him to ask him for a cigarette, he gives me one. I say thank you, he gets into his car and drives off. I turn around to my friends queitly staring at me. Turns out it was a famous german singer named Cro. I guess they knew more about him than me because he usually wears a mask so I had no clue what he looked like irl.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Instagram makes no sense for normal people anymore</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-09 11:18:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>I remember when instagram first started and it was about posting pictures about your life and what you're doing and your friend followed you and you followed them and it was just a fun and interesting way to keep up with your friends all around. Now it's all about influencers. People either ARE influencers or wanna be them and pretend like they are. It's a breeding ground for narcicissts. People just post for attention, likes, followers and comments. Noone cares about the content of their friends and the only reason people like posts and comment is because they're hoping to get likes and comments in return. I can't even spend a fun afternoon or a birthday with my girlfriends because everything has to be instagrammable. You gotta take a picture before eating and take a picture before leaving the house. Post that you#re spending time together and tag each other. It's sooooo stupid. It's like everyone is addicted to it and just staring into their phone. Even the conversations start with "have you seen what XY posted on instagram?" It's all about living a fake life for the gram and then gossiping about people living a fake life on the gram. Important life events are no longer communicated to your friends and family through a phone call or in person but posted on instagram. "We are pregnant" or "I said yes".I'm literally the odd one out and know nothing about my friends lives anymore because I deleted my instagram and it's really sad. sorry for the long rant.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I bought an iPhone X at Walmart while on vacation in the USA, worked with my sim until now, tried a different SIM and realized it's sim locked</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-02 12:20:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>My Sim was always from german t-mobile but now I tried a different provider and turns out my phone is sim locked but I bought it "unlocked" from walmart back then. Does that mean it's sim locked to t-mobile? how can I get it unlocked since I don't even know why it is locked and which provider it is locked on? Update: I have now figured out the model number and part number is MQA52LL/A / A1865 meaning it's a sim-free unlocked united states model that: "... doesn #8217;t ship with a carrier SIM card. The SIM-free iPhone sold on apple.com and at the Apple Store is unlocked. That means you #8217;re free to use a SIM card from any carrier that provides service for iPhone. " Which now makes me wonder even more. I have now tried a telekom sim card and a O2 Sim card, both german. Neither work in my iphone. Both are accepted by my android just fine. Any other ideas? Here are the three SIM cards. The one on top ist the old t-mobile Germany that works the other two don #8216;t work. Looks like it #8217;s about the SIM cards itself?

I flew back to germany a day later witht he phone and put my german t-mobile sim card in the phone, it worked fine. then I put a different german t-mobile sim card in the phone. it worked fine. now today I bought a new german prepaid sim card from t-mobile as well. It still shows the card as invalid. So it doesn't matter which card, it just doesn't accept any card except for the one I had. Could something be broken? It always worked with german cards before, always by t-mobile I put the card in my phone and it immediately says  #8222;activation required #8220; I accept It tries to activate and then says  #8222;SIM not valid - The SIM card that you currently have installed in this iPhone is from a carrier that is not supported under the activation policy that is currently assigned by the activation server. This is not a hardware issue with the iPhone. Please insert another SIM card from a supported carrier or request that this iPhone be unlocked by your carrier.

    <TITLE>Advice Needed: Moving + pregnant cat / kittens</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-03 13:19:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have two cats. One of them is currently pregnant. The babies should literally come any day now. All of a sudden now we have to move in the next 3 weeks and new people want to look at my apartment before we move. The landlords don't want the cats there when people are coming over and I honestly don't know if it's a good idea either. What should I do? should I bring the cats to my parents while people are coming over or is that way too much stress for the mama, especially once she has her babies? How can I move the mama and the kittens safely? it's a three hour car ride but we really have to move. Any advice?</TEXT>

If I put her in a room she will hear all the commotion going on and might get really freaked out. She is very easily scared so that's what I worry about. But then if I move her location twice home to parents to new home, she might even get more stressed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>that's great advice! thank you. We won't have any small rooms in the new home. Any advice on what I can put in the big room she will be in to make her feel safe. Not like she's in a big open space with nothing in there? She is a very nervous cat so I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It #8217;s been over 1 1/2 hours since my cat had her last kitten. She #8216;s nursing it but panting heavily since the last one. The first one was stillborn. Should I be worried? Everywhere online says call a vet but it #8217;s Sunday night.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Update for anyone interested: She had her second baby 6 hours later and the third came two hours after that. Those two came very easily and smoothly and they #8216;re all healthy and happy kittens so far. Thanks to the people who commented. I tried to get a hold of an emergency vet but couldn #8217;t get anyone on the phone. I #8216;ll call my vet again as soon as he opens in a few hours to make sure he thinks everything is fine. #9786; #65039;</TEXT>

All die Jungs die mich wollten als ich mich nicht mehr aufbewahrt habe h #228;tte man echt in den M #252;ll kicken k #246;nnen und das war so wertlos und hat mir nichts gebracht. Jetzt hab ich meinen Mann gefunden und ich w #252;nschte ich h #228;tte mich f #252;r ihn aufbewahrt. Ich hab mit ihm sofort gemerkt dass wir f #252;r immer zusammen sein wollen und zusammen passen und daf #252;r mussten wir nicht vorher miteinander schlafen um das zu wissen. Nur weil es nicht weit verbreitet ist hei #223;t das nicht dass die Mehrheit die richtige Entscheidung trifft. Du triffst f #252;r dich die richtige Entscheidung.

What shouldn #8217;t she do? 2. is it better to use treats or toys as positive reinforcement? 3. do I give her baths? How often? 4. anything that I should know that I absolutely should not do?

    <TEXT>So many people talk about hip scoring and genetics but doesn #8217;t it also have to do with how much you excercise them as puppies? Like walking, jumping etc? My gsd/boxer mix had it so bad he could barely walk by the time he was 9 and I #8217;ve always told myself it was because I walked him too much and let him jump around as a puppy. Was that wrong? Is it really mostly genetic?</TEXT>
