    <TEXT>When I was 19 I moved out of halls at college and got a flat. I then never went home. That was 1985. In 1999 I took I #8217;ll and my mum encouraged me to give up my flat and come home for 6 months to recover, my dad started his tirades again but I was too ill to resist. At the end of this period my dad started to loose his eyesight and it got really bad but I put up with it in order to support my mum through what was a terrible time. In 2003, I met my to be husband on the internet and when he came over in 2004 we decided to move in very quickly together ... my fathers behaviour got worse and worse. He tried to be very controlling from a distance. By this time he had alienate all of my siblings. His final act, just before he died, was to change his will on my birthday, to leave everything to my elder sister and her daughter (who he had only been talking again to for a year) and to cut out even my sister #8217;s own sin (shows that she and my father were so alike) because I wouldn #8217;t leave my husband to live with him and take care of him which is why you have an extra child you don #8217;t need. I #8217;m in therapy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is such a thing out side of all our experiences so I get why you are freaking out. Talk to her, on her own, and simply tell her what you saw. Don #8217;t Explain, don #8217;t try to do anything except state the facts. How she reacts and what she says will guide you as what to do next. remember that at 16, she doesn #8217;t have enough life experience to necessarily understand the consequences of what she is doing. Nor is this a case of what goes on behind closed doors. in the end, you wanting to help her through this is of lesser importance than you own safety both physically and mentally. What they are doing is morally Wrong and illegal. Think carefully about what you will do after you speak and don #8217;t be forced or blackmailed into Agreeing to things you are not happy with. It is OK to say that you need space and time to think things through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, someone doesn #8217;t finish with you over nothing. You may be oblivious to what their reasons are, and if they don #8217;t tell you, you won #8217;t know, but there will be reasons. these reason may be nothing to you and things that could be worked through, but if they say that they are insurmountable then they are telling you that it #8217;s over. what is cruel her, but unfortunately something we #8217;ve all experienced, is the it #8217;s over but let #8217;s meet up in a while when I #8217;ve have a think about it. it #8217;s either over and there is no way through or it #8217;s not over so let #8217;s meet NOW and sort this. When someone tells you that its over hen wants some time, they are trying to organise their thoughts so don #8217;t be shocked if you meet up and your boyfriend tells you that you can get back together if you agree to a list of his demands. This is so they can say that they tried but you were the unreasonable one because you wouldn #8217;t change if there isn #8217;t something going on in his mind to make him finish, then that is just as bad. Doing the I #8217;m leaving routine when they don #8217;t get what they want will out you in a cycle where they blackmail you to behave the way they want or they will leave. No on can or deserves to live like that. the worse has happened, he #8217;s walked out, and you know what? You are still here. Don #8217;t let him make this any worse. Any decision to stay together is now yours. He can offer to come back but it is your decision and yours only if you accept.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry but this is abusive behaviour and I know because my dad did this to me all my life and it took others outside my family along with my therapist to point it out. i travelled by public transport for 4 hours for what should have been a 50 journey because trains had been cancelled and bus service out on, to go to my parents for their anniversary. Staggered through the door and before I did anything handed over my present and card. My father stood there screaming at me how ungrateful my siblings were because they had not sent cards (post delay ... turned up the next day but apparently they should have know that) and they hadn #8217;t rung and told him how happy they received for him to have his anniversary. In the end, as I was on the verge of tears, on of his friends turned round, put his arm round me and said to my dad, mate, she bothered to turn up, you should be grateful at least for that. Dad said something under his breath and then wouldn #8217;t talk to either of us for the rest of the night. i wasted 30 years of my adult life trying to have a relationship with my father and I realise now that it wasn #8217;t worth it. I could have been a lot happier without him in my life. you need to do what is right for you. Don #8217;t do what is expected, do what keeps you safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You feel guilty because you have been manipulated for your entire life to believe you shoudl be grateful for having someone take you in. However you were not taken in a cared for. you were abused. You owe nothing. Let me give you a glimpse of your future. 6 years ago, my mum died after a short unexpected illness. She had waited on my father hand and foot all his life and he had thrown that back in his face. After her death, it was clear that he couldn't stay on his own and would need to consider going into a home as he had abused all of the carers that had been found for him. He would scream and shout at them. He called me up and told me that I would need to come and live with him and look after him as after all, that is why you have a youngest child. I pointed out that 1) I'm married and have responsibilities to my husband, 2) I lived 70 miles away from him and my job was where I lived 3) no that is not why you have children. I apparantly was an ungrateful bitch and after all he had done for me (actaully it was after all I'd done for him, taken him and my mother on holiday 3 to 4 times a year, had them to stay for all holidays over a 20 year period, organised their shopping for them and it goes on). Then the calls from his friends started, it was so sad that he was going to have to leave his home because I would come and live with him. This is where you are going. My dad had been on death's door step since 1949 when he was invalided out of the army ... he died in his 90s in 2016. Walk away NOW. You owe this man absolutely nothing. If his family is so worried about him then they can look after him. They are worried about them having to do it if you don't. That is totally different.</TEXT>

She made it very clear what she thought of your friend and he still thinks you should have given him her number like she has no choice in this because she is his. I've news for your friend, he is going to have to wait a very long time to find a girl as good as her because they will all see through him. Until he grows up, he will date vacous girls or ones he can dominate. You have a choice, stay with friends who would back this guy over you over something so stupid or give it a go with someone who could potentially be your soul mate or at least a fantastic night out. If it doesn't work out, you know you have a connection so it's likely she'll be your friend going forward. If it works out, you will be happy for the rest of your life.</TEXT>

He has survived skin cancer but has two massive scars around 2 x 4 inches square and a good 1/4 inch deep. They are very close to his spine and he is very proud of the surgeon who removed them and made sure that there was no damage to his spine.

You are definitely NTA here. And the fact that you also broached this with your SIL so that she is aware that her daughter has questions and wants help in understanding what to do means that you actually were the adult here.

    <TEXT>I would suggest that you first stop contact for a period and see if that makes your wife more able to cope. My father used his will to threaten his children and try to force them to do what he wanted. It didn't work and when he changed it for the umpteenth time just before he died, it had little or no impact on us because this had been threatened for the past 30 years. Cutting her out of your will won't change her behaviour, in fact it will simply antagonise her. What you need to do is remove her from causing your wife pain. Try that first and see if space and time give her more understanding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before lockdown, I attended a number of craft fairs as a supplier. I often have an extra area where I offer 1 on 1 crafting tuition. Usually, 2 or three times a day, someone will be looking at the stalls, eitherside of me and will wander over to me and try to pay for things that aren't from my stall. I usually point them nicely back to the stall that the items are from but there is always one who insists that they are from my stall. With these, if they are paying cash, I just give in and take their money then walk it over to the correct stall, tell them exactly what was bought (yeah for the photographic memory) and hand them the money. The only time that this doesn't work is when they want to pay by card!</TEXT>

I didn #8217;t meet my soul mate until I was in my 40s so having children earlier was not a decision I was willing to make. however, I had a friend who had had to have a hysterectomy as a lifesaving operation and she used to go on at length about how women who didn #8217;t have children should be forced, by law to be surrogates for those who couldn #8217;t have them. She was single and was obsessed that if she had a child all the other problems in her life would just disappear. What made it worse was that when I #8217;ve mentioned this to other people I #8217;ve seen them seriously consider it as viable. to trivialise your pain and experiences by playing the one Inman card (what about my pain) is just plain thoughtless. the discussions you had when you were younger were BEFORE you had gone through you pregnancies it is your body and your choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My heart goes out to you. This is probably the nightmare of every parent and care giver. It might not seem like it at this moment in time but You and your daughter are so strong for dealing with this and you will get through this. Your mum is in denial. She may never come out of it. even if your father is charged and coNvicted, she may still deny it. you can #8217;t do anything about that. what you can do and are doing is to be there for your daughter. She is such an inspiration for you. For a 12 year old girl to have the guts to tell you and start to deal with this will give you the strength to now support her and allow her, with the help of the therapist that you choose together, to regain her childhood. one of the fantastic things about reddit is if you feel that you have no one to turn to you know that the hive mind here has your back and you have a safe place to come and be reminded that you are a good parent and you can do this. I wish I could come over and give you a big hug because you need one right now. So just take it that we all think you and your daughter are amazing in standing up against this.</TEXT>

You have a greater bond with the dog because you have been together longer. Talk of seperation anxiety is just emotional blackmail to get what she wants. Not having the dog is not the root cause of her depression. She needs to focus on that rather than hurt you because it will 'make her feel better' to have the dog. It won't. She has bigger issues to deal with. It will hurt you. I would cut off contact with your ex and block her. Also make sure that she has no opportunity to dog nap your dog.</TEXT>

I would not wish this on anyone. It makes eating out and visiting friends really difficult and even being in the office if people aren't too good with moping up how they eat can cause me problems. To put you through this when you didn't need to is basically baffling to me. What I will say, is that don't go binge on the things you have had cut out of your diet ... you aren't allergic to them but you will be somewhat intolerant and your gut isn't used to them. Introduce them slowly and really enjoy the experience ... a freshly baked roll, just out of the oven is a truely wonderful experience</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a celiac (coeliac here in the UK) and if I'm attending a friend's house for something like this, I bring my own food with me because quite frankly whilst you might make this with Gluten Free (GF) ingredients, your house may have trace gluten in it (unless you basically scrubbed it down and washed everything on hot in the dishwasher). I'm so sensitive that cross contamination is a big issue for me. I wouldn't expect you to make them GF. If you bought something premade from a shop and offered it me I'd think you were a diety! And just to point out - changing the flour won't affect the chewiness of them because good GF flours will work ... but for me, unless you also found GF chocolate and GF baking powder, changing the flour makes no difference - I'll tell you that they look fab but won't eat them. If I eat anything that has a trace of gluten in it, I will be soooooo ill for a day or two but it impacts me for a couple of week and in some cases, up to a month. I'll have an upset tummy within an hour or so, so I'll be in my bathroom for a day, get severely dehydrated and then the fun starts. It affects my digestion so that I don't take in any nutrition. My dermititus will flare - I'll get bad patches on my hands, behind my ears and my feet. My breath will smell. My feet will smell. I'll itch all over. Then the depression will start. It's been liken to coming off heroine. Then the bruising. My blood stops clotting properly and I'll bruise from the slightest knock. Your brownies may be the greatest in the world but they aren't worth that. The person might be more A symptomatic than me, and not get the upset tummy but the other things will be happening to her, even if she doesn't realise it. The fact that the person at the BBQ tried to guilt you into making it for her next time makes her TA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA So, she doesn't want to do what you both agreed to and you are supposed to be TA? Nope. Simply, you aren't free on a saturday morning so you can't switch. She may have issues with making friends but that's not your problem. The key thing about using something like zoom is that it's intimate and also not intimate at the same time. I personally, if it was me, say that you went for the evening classes because you aren't free on a saturday. don't engage about saturday. She is going to fix on you only needing a bit of sleep which isn't true. I would instead say that breaking the class up into two evenings works best for your learning style. That is why you agreed to do evenings when you both first discussed it. 1. Short classes 2. couple of nights a week 3. fits in with your current commitments Saturdays don't work with this. Be encouraging for her to try out the saturday classes ... I think personally that she is using you not doing the saturday as an excuse to not actually take the class ... was she struggling before she stopped the evening classes? And say that you are really looking forward to seeing her posts of the things she's making on social media. Then hit her with the 'I'm sorry that your circumstances have changed but I'm just not in a position to move to a Saturday class at this time.'</TEXT>

We paid for it all. My father gave us a cheque which we told him would be put towards our honeymoon and NOT the wedding so that we kept control of who came. If you can, I would give your mum back the money she has paid. You need to talk to your mum though and tell her that inviting people because 'they are family' just doesn't work here. This is about you being with the people you have grown up with and have come to know well and them celebrating this time with you. It's not about ticking boxes to make sure that someone's nose isn't out of joint. Tell her that you appreciate her input into the wedding and have enjoyed planning the wedding together and you really want to carry on having this fantastic experience with her so you are begging her to not make this an issue.</TEXT>

And because of that, she was often included more in the kids life. She said that it hurt her to know that she wasn't going to have kids but that was for her to deal with and by being welcoming to her friends she got to have them and their kids in her life. Then there was the other one who told me I should have a kid for her because i was being selfish not having kids when she 'needed' one.

Back in the 60s when I was born, it was a case of get on and live and she coped with the pregnancy by people treating her like normal ... so I can understand why you wanted this to treated so. I can also understand his reaction but to be honest, I think it's more about he felt you didn't tell him something fundamental about you. If I was in your shoes, I wouldnt' have told him. TMA. I think you need to sit down and tell him about the experience and how it affected you so dramatically and that you don't want to be forever branded as the mother of a dead baby. This is your first child together. And the birth is going to be trying for you ... if you get this aired out with him, then the joy you will both feel when the baby is born will be unbounded.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA Wow. If you wanted to feel like you were just a way of her making money then she totally reinforced that with her behaviour. I was lucky enough to get a set of sessions with a therapist for free on the NHS, earlier this year. My 3 previous experiences with this (each in a different hospital region) were very successful. This time I just couldn't connect with the therapist. She kept trying to push me down a particular path that wasn't working for me and when we got to the end of the alotted sessions I was actually in a worse state than when I started. I contacted all the agencies that I had recommended to me but none had an opening, then lockdown happened. A month ago, I decided to fund it myself and went through an online agency. I did the assessment and was offered 5 different therapists to choose from, I read their bios and chose one. The first session went well and the subsequent ones have been even better. But for me, the fact that I'm paying puts me very much in charge of my therapy. I've realised that you have to be in charge of your therapy and if you are not happy then vote with your feet ... leave. Good luck with who ever you choose to work with.</TEXT>

That chat was where she was trying to do my old job but it was beyond her so she wanted to get me to tell her how to do it. It got so bad I had to block her on my mobile and social media.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was 18 and deciding what I wanted to do for a career, I went to a 'Women in Science' day at a local university. Shirley Williams, who at the time was an MP, came as the key note speaker. She started her speech off with the words that she was not there to talk to about politics, she was there to talk about women moving forward and understanding the glass ceiling. Now this was 1984, and I didn't even know that there was a glass ceiling. She talked about the experiences of her mother, Vera Brittain, in the first world war (she wrote Testament of Youth) and how she moved into a world where everything changed for women. I've never agreed with her politics but I often think back to sitting there and hearing her talk about the value that women have to make in society at all levels and how important education is to realising that value. She had a very profound effect on me.</TEXT>

I #8217;m seeing more and more  #8216;friends #8217; send out messages  #8216;asking #8216; as they put it for money to do the things they want rather than save for them themselves the first time I saw this was about 4 years ago where a woman who I followed on fb said she needed money to get out of an abusive relationship and move states where she would then restart her baking business new. People gave her around $15k Because she said she would need to leave everything. All went quiet then the next update was that she had reconciled with her husband and thank you all for the money, they were using it for a holiday to reconnect. One of her close friends called her out on it but it seemed she genuinely thought that rather than give the money back this was a valid use for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As my mum told me when I finished the man child who I thought was the love of my life, the reason he is with you is because you have so much to give, it's just that you are giving it to the wrong person. She was right. It was so painful when I told him I had had enough of his child like behaviour (expecting to be waited on hand and foot, worried about how people saw him and thought of him yet treating me like dirt, expecting me to spend my money on him but never putting his hand in his pocket). In the end, I had a physical breakdown from spending all my time driving back and forth to his house to look after him whilst his mum was in hospital. I gave my flat up to go live with my parents whilst I recovered and his reaction? That it was going to cost him an extra  #163;10 in fuel to visit me and that I didn't get his permission to move ... permission ... I was nearly hospitalised. You now have space to give yourself some time and regroup. Think about what you want in a relationship and then, when you are ready, go look for one and only accept someone who adds to your life rather than takes from it.</TEXT>

As to family using your work email address, the simple thing is not too. Most email policies discourage this or at worse, it's a sackable offence.

    <TEXT>I'm a newbie on reddit and the first time I posted this I was too early in my reddit obsession for it to get posted. So, here goes again I #8217;m coming to terms with the fact that my fathers behaviour was not necessarily normal. So, I thought that I #8217;d share one of the last things he did that I #8217;m still trying to process. my mum passed in Feb 2014 after a nasty year of illness. She was 82. I was 48, a late baby. My fathers behaviour during my mums final year had got more and more demanding. two years earlier, my husband had offered for them to sell their house and go halves with us on a place together so that they could have more support but my father threw a tantrum that he was not going to leave his friends and favourite hospital to live near our jobs (we were talking a move of 70 miles to a better neighbourhood where houses cost much less and would have freed up a significant amount of capital for them to treat themselves with and was near a major teaching hospital specialising in all my fathers perceived ailments). husband was so appalled by fathers behaviour that the subject was never raised again. so mum passes away. Dad hasn #8217;t spoken to me for the two months before she died as I wouldn #8217;t come down and take him out for day trips leaving my mother alone in the house to fend for herself. i get a call from him and here is the EP issue to beat all his previous one. He tells me (doesn #8217;t ask) that I he can #8217;t look after himself and he isn #8217;t going to waste money on carers so he needs me to come and stay with him. For how long? I ask. Permanently is the answer. I can #8217;t do that. I have a husband, two cats and a full time job along with other commitments. my fathers answer? If you think we had you because we wanted you, you have another thing coming. The youngest child is supposed to step up and look after their parents when they are needed. but dad, I can #8217;t leave my husband to stay with you. dad then told me that it wasn #8217;t a choice, it was my duty as his youngest child. His health was more important than my marriage and I #8217;d better think carefully about what I did next as it would affect my relationship with him. I put the phone down on him. He called back twice and I told him no and each time he swore and abused me. on the third call hubby answered and being a straight talking Aussie told him a few home truths. that was mid feb 2014. In October, on my birthday, he changed his will and wrote all his children and grand children out of his will except my niece and elder sister who had Windle #8217;s back in after an estrangement of over 15 years. He passed away the following June When we found out he had changed his will and my niece had known for months. I still have dreams about how he told me that I #8217;d only been born as an insurance policy for his care in old age. Really gives your life value</TEXT>

But what I don't understand is why so many parents think that it's ok to behave this way. My father once informed me that my other sister and my brother should have made their kids visit him because he made us visit our grandparents. I, in a moment of clarity said that the difference was that we wanted to see our grandparents. You can understand that didn't go down well and I was shunned for a couple weeks until he needed something else from me.</TEXT>

He had to go into a home. He found a fantastic one which was basically a 5\* hotel level and he couldn't behave, he decided that he needed a new wife or at least a woman to take care of him and when his advances were repeled by a poor lady with dementia he hit her. They threw him out and black listed him localy. He ended up in a far less hospitable home where he was treated more like an inmate.

    <TITLE>we don't eat curry because of the war</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 15:55:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I promised to share some more about my father and his bat shit crazy behaviour. For years, we had to have specific diet at home because my father had had disentry in the war. We weren't allow spicy food, because dad had had disentry in the war. He would cause a scene at gatherings, even at his friends house, if he didn't get his current fad of food ... because ... you guessed it .. he had disentry in the war. Now, here is where it get's difficult. We were all supposed to be telephathic as to what he was currently not eating. Mum would try to warn people but she did occasionally forget or worse still, we were avoiding somethign that he hadn't actually told us about. I was taking O Level Food and Nutrition - cookery to the rest of the world As part of this, i was supposed to make a curry. This was all about combining flavours and palate exercises. He went absolutely bat shit crazy over this and I had to take a letter to the school about how he was not going to waste money on something he couldn't eat. So, everyone is making curry and I'm making a beef stew with no onions ... just no flavour. Fast forward and I'm staying at my parents because my father has lost his eye sight and it's really hard on my mum so I moved in for a year (and yes, that's probably why he thought I'd leave my husband and look after him but I wasn't with hubby at the time). Dad is once again on death's door. He has terminal man flu. Yep, it's a cold. I said that he should have something with chilli in it as it helps to bring out any fever, followed by a hot bath. Now, my mum has been eyeing up the ready made currys in waitrose for weeks. She loves aromatic food but we've never been allowed to eat it in my father's house (and yes, it was his house, not hers). So she, in an act of rebellion, tells my father that she is going to buy a curry meal with me and she and I are going to heat it up in the microwave and eat it outside in the garden. Well, you would have thought armageddon has arrived. Hurricane father errupted. But mum held firm. We get home, she microwaves up a chicken dinner for him that he had chosen and then she and I retire to the garden with our chicken korma ... she wasn't that adventurous. Mum and I both loved boiled rice and so I'd introduced her to pilau rice and she was commenting on the cardamons and cloves and how lovely the smell and taste was. Each mouth full of the curry was like a revelation to her. She had found that this was a food she adored. About 10 minutes in, we realise that the tv is off inside and it's gone quiet. Dad is sat at the table no longer eating and looking at us like a kid who just had christmas canceled. Mum asks him what wrong. She gets that the chicken dinner is terrible and he needs food or he'll be ill (I'm a diabetic you know was his mantra to get food ahead of others). Mum says she'll make him a sandwich. Nope, that won't do. He takes mum's plate of curry and starts to eat it. I think my mum had used up her reserves of defiance because she just went into the kitchen to make herself a sandwich. I stopped her, bunged my plate into the microwave to reheat it and split it between the two of us. Becaue mum was a small eater, dad had got about a quarrter of a portion and I have more than a portion for me so it worked out. After he had finished, including basically licking the pattern off the plate, he sat back and announces: I don't know why you have refused to buy to these all these years (pointedly said at my mum) Currys became a weekly meal there after. And to my title - we don't eat curry because of the war - we finally got out of him what was behind this. He got dysentry from eating a curry but on further probing, it turns out he ate a prawn curry, in Burma, in the hot season and the prawns were (in his words) 'a bit green'. I kid you not. Oh and it turns out that his stomach problems were nothing to do with the dysentry. When my brother and I were diagnosed as coeliacs (celiacs in the US) which is genetic and inherited, he mentioned that when my gran had died 20 years earlier, it was due to issues related to being an undiagnosed coeliac and had never told either myself of my brother even though we had repeatedly asked if there might be something in his stomach problems and ours. Well, why would he? That would have made us more interesting than him! (His words thrown at me later)</TEXT>

It was a massive thing to have your kid stay at school until 18. My grandfather was a wonderful, caring man and my grandmother went through a harsh earlier years of her marriage when he was kicked in the chest by a horse and couldn't work for months.

    <DATE>2020-07-25 09:17:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Here is today's post about my father.** **Background** \- In 1999 I was in the end of a bad relationship and had a physical breakdown. At the time, my dad was loosing his eyesight (diabetes related but made worse from him not eating the way he should due to his faddy eating). My mum and discussed me coming home for a while to recover and also to support my mum as Dad was no longer allowed to drive so I could do things like take her shopping. In 2003, my mum was concerned that I would end up living with them for the rest of my life looking after my father (a prophecy that would have implications as in one of my previous posts which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hwn97u/you_dont_have_kids_to_look_after_you_in_your_old/)) so she decided that on line dating was the answer (it was in it's infancy). We would spend a little while each evening, upstairs in my room, looking at potential dates together. She thought this was very 'naughty' because it was covert (we kept it from my father). It was here that we found the man who would eventually become my husband and who mum adored. **The set up** A nice little flat had been found and everyone had been round to admire it (parents basically) and a move out date from my parents had been agreed. In the week before, my partner as was then, hubby now, was working nights so was sleeping at this digs. I had spent that week moving all of my things from storage and my mum had really enjoyed helping me. Partner and I had moved all the furniture in at the start of the week so it was about arranging books and nick nacks which my had such fun doing. We sat dad on a chair with a cup of tea, a biscuit and a book and she just enjoyed looking at all my books and things. So far so good. **The Incident** On the morning that I was moving my things out of my parents (bascially my clothes and a few books) my dad started up on his usual routine of demanding things be done his way. Honestly, it was two trips in the car to move everything. I had 8 storage boxes which had craft equipment in. I was taking them from the top of the pile and putting them in my car. The top four boxes were blue and the bottom four were pink. As I'm coming down the stairs with one box at a time (not allowed to carry two even though they are light because I might damage the wallpaper on the stairs - already been shouted at about that ... remember we are not allowed to be asked or reminded, we have to be shouted at because I am so stupid I can't accept a simple reminder). I get the second box into the car and go back upstairs to get another. As I come into the bedroom my father is standing there and I can see from his face that it's all about to blow up. Father: why are you taking out the blue boxes? Me: because they are on the top Father: I want the pink ones gone first Me: why? what does it matter? Father: This is my house and you will do what I say Me: And that dad is why I'm leaving. As I went down the stairs he just continually shouted at me that it was his house and I was to do what he said. I took the boxes to the new flat (just 15 minutes away by car) returned and as I came back into the house he carried on shouting that it was his house and I was to do what he said as I took every last thing out of the room. I kissed my mum good bye and reminded her that the bus from her house stopped outside my new front door and I'd be back on thursday to help her with the shopping. As I got into the car he carried on shouting at me. That time, he didn't speak to me for 2 weeks. Yes, I know it's about control. I left home at 18 and didn't come back until I was 33, leaving again at 36. Even when I left home the first time, he tried to control me from afar. I think in hind sight (which of course is 20/20) that he thought he had got me back permanently to control. Ho Hum as pooh bear would say! But remember, he'd been acting this way since before I was born and so I thought that this was normal behaviour. We had little or no friends and so I had nothing to compare my life with. I'd dated controlling men before and through that this was normal because that's how my father behaved. It took having hubby in my life for me to understand that this wasn't normal</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-25 19:19:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>TIFU - I now have crisps (chips) everywhere My first post on this sub thread and only a month on redit. My husband has tinnitus and so crunchy food has to be eaten out of the house or when he's not around as the sound makes his head hurt, really badly. We have a tacit agreement that he pretends that I don't eat crisps (chips in the US?) in the house but I do. Don't judge, it's been this way for 16 years. (I also sneakily eat raw bell peppers). Obviously, the crisps taste all the better for being illicit! Anyway, I buy packets of crisps and hide them. Normally I buy two packets of 12 every other week. Well, I'd been adding things to my shopping delivery over the past week and when it arrived today there was a bit of mess up. I had ordered just under 100 packets of crisps. I now have crisps everywhere in the house, hidden so that he doesn't find them. They are behind the trolleys in the kitchen, packets in my rucksack to go to work, in my wardrobe, my craft room ... just every where. TL;DR - meant to buy 24 packets of crisps - got 100 delivered and now have them hidden around the house from husband</TEXT>

    <TITLE>She has the right to torch anything she wants</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 19:45:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Quick edit - title should read ' she has the right to *touch* anything she wants' So I am a magnet for entitled parents ... perhaps my own entitled father branded me with something that they can smell. This happened 2 years ago. Before the lockdown, I had been attending craft shows as a supplier of craft equipment for over 4 years. 2 years ago I managed to get a spot at a major craft supply show here in the UK that I had wanted to be an exhibitor at for sometime. **Background** Over all the whole 3 day experience was traumatic - I was in a marquee and when it rained water flooded down the middle of the marquee washing a number of the stands out where they had their stock stored below their tables (luckily my boxes were waterproof so long as the water didn't go over 2cm). Then the winds started, the marquee started to lift off so they came round with pile drivers to drill holes in the school playground then hammer in 6ft long posts to hold the tent down ... result, every piece of my stock was covered in fine gravel from this this and we were still finding it months later. As you can imagine, I was not a happy bunny by the time the first person arrived at my stall. **The Incident** So, I strongly believe that touching craft equipment like scissors or yarn is the best way to understand if you want to buy things. I make a number of the things that I sell and I understand that they have to be quality controlled so if anything I create doesn't stand up to usage, I always offer to repair or replace. So up come EM and EK (Entitled Mother and Entitled Kid) and the kid makes a bee line for my scissor keepers. Now these are long dangly chains of sparkly beads that you hook onto your scissors so that when you drop them when on the sofa, they don't go down between the cushions and you have a chance to find them. Or as one of my friends said ... when your brother goes to knick your embroidery scissors to cut his toe nails with, you can see them in his hand because the dangly bit is too big to hide and you can go get them back off him. EK picks up one of my scissor keepers and taking one end in each hand pulls them really hard. Now I test everything I make and give things a good tug but they are supposed to be treated with a bit of respect. Naturally, when you apply the full strength of a 12 year old, the jump rings holding the cabochon to the beads just snapped. EK turns to mum with delight on her face and says - look what I just did. EM (distractedly): that great baby I am absolutely gobsmacked by this. My two assistants are absolutely gobsmacked by this. By reflect I grab the two bits of my now destroyed piece of work out of EK's hands and say; 'Please do not touch anything else' EM suddenly seems to wake up and thows the rather expensive kits she was looking at onto the display table EM: We paid to come into the show, she can touch anything she wants There is a collective gasp from my two assistants. Now I should explain that my two assistants are two of my friends who both know me as a patient craft teacher (I sell equipment because a number of my students were having issues getting supplies so I sourced them and then started being asked by other people to supply). They know that I rarely loose my temper and never infront of customers but I do have a very sarcastic side and don't suffer fools I lean forward over the table to be closer to EM and lower my voice making her lean forward towards me Me: Your child just broke something that I took pride in making and you both think that is OK. Now step away from my stand before I make a scene about you paying for what you broke. EM: You can't stop us ... Me (breaking into what she was saying and even quieter): go away before I do something you will regret EK moves forward to grab another scissor keeper and I don't know why but by reflect I slapped her wrist. I think it comes from when my cats get high on cat nip and try to swipe me, I move very fast and without thinking. EM promptly hussels EK away muttering about the type of people they let in. I turn round to see my two assistants wetting themselves laughing. They said, unprompted, in unison; 'We saw nothing'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seriously, she wants you to endorse something that is going to hurt people and have them possibly sue her? By selling the saddles, she is saying that they are fit for purpose under trading standards. Doesn't matter that she is the reseller, she is the person that the buyer will be contracting with. I'm sorry that this has affected you seeing her children. But, here is my suggestion on an olive branch. so with my digital marketing hat on (it's my day job) .... Why not suggest to your SIL via your mum that as she needs to now source a new saddle, why don't you work with her on cross posting about how she is looking to find the right saddle and then her process on the graphics. The reason for this as a campaign is that it adds a good story on care about her customers and how she is using user feedback to get the right product out there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm thinking that it may just be someone messed up. But go talk to the source and get the true story. Just an aside, I don't know how well unions support in Canada but for me, the less you earn, the more important a union membership is. (I'm in the UK). They have helped me out with free legal advice on a number of occasions and when I've not been working, they dropped my membership down to a few pounds a month (even the working payment isn't that much). You normally have to be in a union for a few months before they can help you so it's worth joining as soon as you can. I've mentioned this on a couple of other threads but if you are someone who doesn't like confrontation (that would be me), my therapist has got me using the [DEARMAN](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want) method for being assertive. It takes a bit of practice but boy it works when you get the hang of it. You can also use it to sort your thoughts out before you go talk to someone. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you and don't forget to let us all know how you get on ... we are rooting for you</TEXT>

My boss decided that they should be kept in an open cupboard so I put in writing that I was no longer responsible for them as I couldn #8217;t restrict access. Shortly afterwards I went on sick leave, came back 6 months later and a colleague had been lending them out without the paperwork (because she didn #8217;t like filling in forms). 8 were missing. I tracked down 7 of them and my boss demanded that I paid for the missing one. I produced my email to HR showing I relinquished responsibility at his request to put them in an open cupboard and told him to talk to my union rep. HR held him and my colleague responsible because of that email and my email trail whilst on sick leave reminding them that they were responsible now for the iPads and had to do the paperwork as per their contracts. Turns out they should not have been bothering me about work when on sick leave. I took package and left 2 weeks later</TEXT>

About 12 years ago, my uncle died and at the funeral two children of his cousins turned up (a man and a woman from different parents but distantly related). We thought how nice that they had come to say their farewells ... until we got back from the crematorium and they both tried to corner my Aunt (she was my mother's sister) individually, to tell her that my uncle had promised both that they would be looked after once he died. My husband had to almost drag them off my aunt when she told them each individually that the will left her everything and there were no other bequests. They both got nasty and were trying to get her to write a cheuqe to them. They were absolutely convinced that they were in the right. God only knows when they thought this conversation took place with my uncle as he hadn't seen either for over 20 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see now that I have not gone for promotions that I was definately good enough for was because of this. It's taken me years to finally get to a good level and be paid a decent wage yet I am always worried that I'll be found out even though I am outstanding at what I do ... I know I am because I have the results to sho it. I've suffered badly from having managers who suffered from the Peter Principle and tried to keep me in my place so that I would safe guard their job. The final straw was one who wasted a month of my time having me search for some information for me to find out he had been sent it 6 months earlier - when I challenged him, he told me that he wanted to know if it had changed. I told him that he could have just contacted the person who supplied it and asked them rather than have me search through out the company. Strangely, last year I worked for a complete bully and it started to get rid of my biggest imposter syndrome issues - the more he bullied me, the more certain I was that I knew what I was doing because he clearly had no idea. In the end, he decided that he could get someone to do my job for half the pay, only they couldn't start straight away so I was to hand over to an interim and finish my contract. I professionally handed over the work and left. I found out that the interim lasted 3 weeks and quit and the replacement started just after she left and lasted 2 days ... he didn't like the way he was spoken to and went back to his old job. After that, I decided that I did know what I was doing. But it's going to take a lot to cure me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OMG - YTA My parents caused me severe mental health issues and when I went to get counselling as an adult, my father's attitude was that all I needed was to pull myself together because it was all in my head. Yep - it is, it's because my brain destroys the chemicals that make me function. His behaviour caused me to decline even further. I now see therapy as a necessity and it's helped me massively. You haven't given your child enough time to get to the bottom of her depression and start to function properly, yet alone begin to claw back the education she has missed out on over her depression. What you are actually doing is setting her back and she will now need even further help to deal with your controlling and unkind behaviour. If your wife's money is 'ours' then your money is hers to and deciding on your own to stop therapy has cut your wife out of the decision. I cannot understand why you would do this however, from personal experience I've realised that you are unlikely going to change your decision so be prepared to become estranged from your daughter over the next few years as she blames you for her worsening mental health and has to deal with it on her own without your support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweetie ... so you were in the apartment that you and your BF live in and having sex in the place that you both live in with your long term partner. What on earth have you to be ashamed of? She has serious boundary issues. Yes, she is hurting but that is no reason to go and take that pain out on others.  gt; I got a call from my parents to forgive her because she was in pain and we were being happy in front of her. God forbid you should be happy because she is hurting ... have your parents listened to themselves (my parents said this about my eldest sister when her marriage broke up ... until they found out she had been cited as the other woman in her best friend's divorce and her hurt was because her friend's husband would not leave his wife for her ... and he was her husband's best friend .... so crazy) You cannot put your life on hold because she is hurt. You are not responsible for how she feels and most importantly, she should have no influence on your happiness ... only you are human and it hurts. You cannot solve this situation because you did nothing to cause it ... it is all in her head that there is a problem. Hold your other half tight and enjoy being together because you deserve every moment of happiness that you have together and try to put her out of your mind.</TEXT>

Go out there, get back to having a life and get over him. At least you learnt this at 21. I had a guy do this to me in my 30s and waste 10 years of my life with his tooing an froing. When he broke up with me the last time (ie the time I refused to get back with him) he told me that he did it so that I came to heel. Turned out he thought that holding my future with him as the carrot would allow him to use the stick of making me do what he wanted. I woke up and thought that what I wanted wasn't him.

    <TEXT>NTA at the moment and her is why im a coeliac (US celiac) so no gluten. It makes me really ill and will eventually kill me hubby as is now, BF them, ate gluten and I didnt. Was ok for about a year then started to get ill again. My markers were high. It was the cross contamination. We discussed it and decided to super clean the kitchen and go gf together.  gt;She says I shouldn't have brought home anything that has gluten because it will be very hard for her to not eat it She is an idiot. She #8217;ll do this a couple of times, make herself really ill and give up gluten for good. Each time you ho back to gluten the effects get worse. The last time I was accidentally glutenated badly was about 5 years ago and I honestly hoped that I would die and put myself out of my misery. My stomach was so upset, I was dehydrated, my skin was crawling from itching, my headache, my depression kicked in (side effect of gluten) and after 6 hours in the bathroom I was dry sobbing because I was so dehydrated. That was the last time I ate something a friend had made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why, oh why do people say 'lets be friends'. No, I don't want to be friends. I wanted to spend my life with you and you took that away. Please be gone. Depart. GO AWAY! My mum said the end of a relationship is like when someone dies but they end up being a zombie in your life reminding you constantly of what could have been. I was supposed to get married, he put it off 3 times, we went to look at flats together, he put it off again, then he said 'let's get married but no live together'. Do what? I told him to go and let me live my life. If he didn't want to be with me then he didn't get to keep me on a string to pull in when he wanted it. 'but let's be friends' NO. I wanted to be your wife that is what you promised me. I walked away. Then the texts started. Let's meet up. Let's spend time together. Let's go away for weekend. I gave in. I went away for a weekend with him. I booked the hotel because he didn't have a credit card. Not a problem I thought, the cost of the room would be the same as the two dinners. First night we go to have dinner, have a great meal and the bill comes ... and he just sits there. Me: are you going to get this? Him: Why? Me: because I paid for the room and breakfast? Him: No Me: Why? Him: Because you asked to come away Me: No I didn't. And I've got the text where you asked me to come away with you. I paid for the room. You pay for the meals Him: But you earn more than me Me: I'm walking out and you are paying I got up and walked out - telling the server that he was paying He came back about 20 minutes later and as he came into the room told me that if we were going to get back together I was going to have to pick up the bill like I used to and there were a number things I was going to have to do his way. It was then that he saw my bags were packed. I canceled breakfast on the way out and got a refund. He carried on texting, then the letters, then my cease and desist letter. WALK AWAY NOW</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-02 21:12:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>How do you create an entitled kid? Well you start with an entitled parent. As I have posted in the past, my father was an entitled person, who became and entitled parent then a TA. My eldest sister, as I have said before, is actually called Karen but pronounced Car - Ron. So perfectly named. My father had given her anything she wanted, even if it meant the rest of the family (normally my mother) would go with out things ... including food. I thought a salad cream sandwich was really food until I realised it was the only thing my mum had to eat most days. Anyway .... this is about when my sister failed her A Level (UK qualification taken when you are 18). **Background** My father was born into farming people but his mother wanted him to get out of that as she had seen how poorly my grandfather was treated so when he won a place at technical college where he could stay until 16 (usualy leaving age was 12 - 14 at the time ... pre WWII) she moved heaven and earth to be able to afford to get him there (it was the cost of travel that was the problem). My father decided that all his children would now be mechanical engineers - I will post how my sister got out of that one through sheer ingenuity another time. And I was pushed into subjects I didn't want to do My brother just complied but he is a nice person and just goes with the flow But not my eldest sister. Oh, no, she was special So many incidents but I'm going with this one, this time. **Incident** Eldest sister is 12 years older than me so at this time she is just 18 and I am six. I wake up to shouting. A Level results have arrived in the post and my sister is howling and my dad is screaming. My sister was intending to go to art college because she was sooooo talented and was going to be an artist and famous (this is 1970s before people just wanted to be famous for being famous) However, she has failed her art A Level. Yep, not just got bad grades ... she has actually failed it. Now, her final piece that she submitted was the infamous two headed cow picture ... nope the cow didn't have two heads, it was supposed to be a picture of two cows but the way she drew the cows, it looked like one cow with two heads. It was basically terrible. All her drawings were terrible. Very stylised and every person looked exactly the same. Now there is stylised as in Dali or Picasso ... these were basically cartoon looking but not really ... so they were just not good. Two months earlier, my brother had just had a piece of his art exhibited in a local borough wide exhibition and had won a top prize .. it was a pen and ink drawing of a chain link fence that was broken. He had to submit something but had run out of time so had gone to the back of the school grounds and drawn this picture. It was really good. A few lines here and there but it summed up the view across the fields. He really didn't care about the prize, he was just pleased with what he'd done and to this day, that drawing is still on his wall at his house. My sister was howling that she had been robbed of her rightful A grade by ungrateful, untalented assessors. She HAD to go to art college (remember this was a time when you didn't have to pay for your further education in the UK and you got a grant). Sister: I HAVE TO GO TO ART COLLEGE, WHAT WILL MY FRIENDS SAY IF I DON'T GO, I'VE TOLD THEM ALL I'M GOING mum (trying to keep peace): not everyone gets what they want, remember you have been accepted for a management training position at Marks  amp; Sparks (big UK department store) and you said that was your fall back Sister: MY LIFE IS RUINED Dad: darling, not ruined, just different. We don't all get what we want side note - my father always got what he wanted even if it meant my mother went without food or clothing so he got to buy what he wanted Sister: Daddie, you are going to resubmit my painting for reexamination so they give my my A grade PLLLLEEEEEAAAAASSSSSEEEE? Dad: of course sweetie. We'll go to the school now. Now, we didn't have a phone so he couldn't phone the school. We didn't have a car so it was a bus trip and then a 20 min walk to the school. Dad and sister go off. Mum starts to make breakfast for the rest of us as my brother and other sister emerge to find out what had gone on (none of us wanted to come down when the screaming was happening as it would only turn out to be our fault that she didn't get the grade as it was always our fault 2 hours later, father and sister reappear - sister's face is like sunlight glowing with happiness. Sister: Mummy I should explain here that NONE of us apart from my eldest sister called our parents anything than Mum and Dad. She always used Mummie and Daddie in a whiddlely voice and even today, grown up people who use those terms make me shudder .... seriously therapist says I have PTSD linked to those words!!!! Yes, I was shocked but it explains alot. Sister: Mummy ..... I can resubmit my painting, it's going to be alright..... I will only cost (enter price of entire months mortgage of house) to do .... Daddy is going to fill out the paperwork and then we can take it in tomorrow with the cheque. My mother was verbally abused by my father all of her married life and we realise now she suffered from the verbal version of battered wife syndrome, she never spoke back to my father EVER ... apart from this one time. Mum: NO Sister turning suddenly with a look of thunder: WHAT? Mum: NO. We are not spending money we don't have on something that is not going to work. You didn't just drop a grade and this will help you get a better grade. You FAILED. If you are reassessed, you will only get a pass. That's all they can do, raise you one grade. That isn't enough to get you into art college. Accept it. Sister: DADDIE!!!!!!!!! Dad: Now wifey, entitle daughter Karen is going to art college. We can talk to the examination board and tell them to raise her up to an A grade Mum: NO. We cannot and we are not going to. I've had enough of this. She can't draw and she can't paint and she isn't going to art college. I am not going to go without food in order for her to waste everyone's time any more. Now at this point, me, my sister and brother are trying to become invisible as we sit at the dining table eating our toast and cereal. This is quite a feet as I'm a tall 6 year old, my sister is 15 and my 17 year old brother is 6ft 4" tall. We are doing a good job until my eldest sister turns round and puts her full gaze on us and poof our invisibility spell wears off. Sister pointing at us three: IF I WAS AN ONLY CHILD I WOULD HAVE PASSED MY A LEVEL IT'S ALL THEIR FAULT FOR BEING BORN. I CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED FOOD Dad: Now darling, we can fix this, you are sooooo talented Mum: NO. That is my last word. We will talk no more about this, it is over. My Dad was so shocked he very quietly said: yes dear. Sister stomped out of the house and across the road to her best friend's house (who strangely enough was an only child .... and who, when they were together in town would ignore my parents in the street because we were seen as common ... which reminds me of a story about who were really the common people .... must share that one later). **Outcome** A week later my sister started her management course, became a manager for one of their flagship stores, met her best friend, through whom she met her husband then cheated on said husband with husband of best friend ... oh the irony of it all.</TEXT>

The people I knew who did so also kissed their agents in the lips which again, as a south Londoner freaked me out too. for me, it #8217;s as though your parents infantilise you by encouraging it. and yes, there are 49 years of stories from me and even more from my siblings. I #8217;ll share my nice sister #8217;s subject choice workaround tomorrow. It is fantastic and not only did she pull it offf once, but she did it again to my dad which was masterful.</TEXT>

She got pregnant, dumped by the baby daddy, went after my ex when he was still with me, they got back together and he now raises the other guys kid. I on the other hand live with my beloved grumpy Bald Aussie and am far, far happier. And the therapy helps too!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA ABSOLUTELY My father alienated all his children except me (he managed that eventually) and would scream and shout at me that I should have a kid so he could play with it at the weekend. You don't have children for other people You have a child because you want to have that child. If you are not in a place to have another child, physically, emotionally, finaciall, then any child that is brought into this world will be resented. What I am seeing on the threads here are people who seem to think that their wants and needs are not more important than yours ... that's always happened ... but that their wants and needs completely and utterly rub out your wants and needs. By putting her wants over you (I'm not saying needs, because she actually doesn't need a grandchild, she wants one) she invalidates you as a human being. She is saying that your life means less to her than her own. It took many years to understand that I have a right to my own needs, if you and by extension, your husband, do not want to to have another child, shouting at you and screaming at you and trying to emotionally blackmail you will not make you change your mind. And another thing ... why is it 'make you change your mind'. Again, why isn't your point of view valid? It should be ask you to change your mind or encourage you to change your mind. The language that our families and friends use is often coercive rather than persuasive. Your aunt is unkind in taunting your mother with her bigger brood and you mother is unkind with not accepting your boundaries about your family size and how creeped out by the whole idea you she is making you. You will need to willing to go cold turkey on your mother for a while until she understands that bullying you is not acceptable whether it's over the dress you wear or carrying your dead brother's surrogate child. Stay strong. Stay safe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another from my portfolio of stories about my father. Warning about my language at the end **Background** Back in 1999 I moved back with my parents ... I had a bout of ill health, and my mum asked me to come back for 6 months to sort myself out. I was hesitant because I alwa ys swore I'd never go back when I left but my mum, who I'd only started to have a proper relationship with, begged me to come home so she could look after me. Mum was a brick. She really helped me regain my physical and mental strength whilst battling my father who didn't like the fact that he was not the centre of her attention. By the start of 2000 I was much stronger and changed roles at work, and was thinking of moving out again but my father started to loose his eyesight. So I stayed to help my mother deal with his increasingly strange behaviour. My mum is also going through health issues and has a number of hospital appointments. **Story** Sept 2000 and the UK is experiencing a fuel protest. No one has any fuel. All essential travel has been stopped. I'm working from home with my lovely new state of the art broadband making calls to my people and keeping updated with them on line and on MSN messenger (remember that!!!!). I have just enough fuel in my car to do the few trips to the hospital appointments that my mum needs. My father announces at breakfast, one day, that he has bought a bench drill. Now this is something that you bolt to a work bench, is two foot high and use to drill holes in things. Remember .... he is going blind I ask if this is a wise decision .... I am promptly shouted at about his rights to buy things that keep him happy because ... after all he is loosing his eyesight Mum and I just shut up and make busy eating our cereal. After about 10 minutes my father starts again Dad: so we are going to pick up the drill at 10am I ignore him because I think he's talking about this with my mum .... after all .... I'm working and have no interest in getting a bench drill Dad shouting at me: ANSWER ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU LB Me looks up in surprise: Er, ok, so you and mum are getting the bench drill at 10am Dad: No, you and I are getting the bench drill at 10am Me: er .... I'm working Dad: you can take the morning off Me: no I can't. I have to work Dad: but you are home Me: and I've been working from home for the past 2 weeks because of the fuel shortage. I'm not using my car because I can't get fuel and have been told to work from home by work Dad: well, you are taking me to get the bench drill Me: no I'm not Dad: It's my house and you will do what I tell you Me: I'm 34, that doesn't work any more. Dad screaming at the top of his voice: you are taking me Me: no (at which point I walk out) All I can hear is him shouting and shouting. and my poor mum trying to quiet him down Mum comes up a little while later and knocks on my door. Mum: could you take him later in the week Me: not really mum, I only have enough fuel to do your three hospital visits. If I do this then I won't have enough Mum: I can take the bus (now bearing in mind the hospital mum had to go to was two bus rides away and she was having procedures on all three of the visits.) Me: you can't. He is being an idiot. Can't he get it delivered? Mum: it will cost him  #163;15. Me: it will cost me  #163;15 of fuel and he isn't going to pay. Mum: please, for me And of course, I can't refuse my mum The next thursday I've taken the morning off to take him to get the drill. Turns out the shop he's chosen you can't park outside. So we have to park a 15 minute walk away. he had managed to NOT bring anymoney for the parking ... so I end up paying .... we get to the shop and the box is huge!!!! about 4 foot square. I can't lift it. I'm not sure it's going to fit into my 21 year old ford fiesta. I just look at my father and say Me: What the fuck? Dad just turns to the guy in the shop and says: I'm going blind so my daughter will take this to the car Me: What the bloody, fucking, hecking fuck? The nice guy in the shop turns to me as I have gone a whiter shade of pale at the sight of this box Shop keeper: sweetie are you parked in the cattle market carpark? Me (whimpering): yes SK: I've got a big trolley and two big strapping guys who will take it there for you and you can be the manager of getting them into the car Me (still whimpering): thank you Dad: I'm blind you know, I can't help SK: Sir, we like to make sales but if you are blind, should you be buying this for yourself? health and safety and all that Dad: Oh, I'm going to get my wife to use it Me and the SK just look at him like he's an idiot Anyway, the two 'big strapping guys' were polietness embodied and very carefully brought the box to my car, helped me lower the back seats and carefully put it into the car. My father was already in the car, seat belt on ready to go home and play with his new toy. The two guys both patted me on the shoulder and wished me good luck. I waited for them to lead then turned to my father Me: That is NEVER happening again. You are a selfish, ungrateful brat and made me give up my leave and took away a trip to the hospital for mym by car who needs that far more than you need a piece of equipment. I am going to take you home, I will get this thing out of my car and then you can work out how YOU can get it to your shed. Mum is not helping you, she is seriously ill and cannot lift anything. Dad: I'm bl... at which I told him to fuck off **Outcome** Two weeks later at breakfast ... Dad announces that he is buy another piece of equipment Mum and I both turn to him and unanimously shout NO And the hospital appointments? Luckily a week later the fuel protests stopped and I was able to buy a full tank of fuel and take mum to her appointments .... on her own</TEXT>

It goes back to his not able to eat [curry](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hx49ec/we_dont_eat_curry_because_of_the_war/) crap. For 20 years he played the dysentry in the war card, then the stomach issues, then the diabetes, then the blindness. Don't get me wrong - crap what he suffered but it wasn't the dysentry that caused his stomach issues ... it was the fact that he ate the wrong things and was a coelaic but ignored it, then when he had issues over what he ate and was told to cut back on the sugar he went against it and the diabetes started which lead to the issues around that.

    <TEXT>**Background** My father had a 'squeeky heart', but because he basically did exactly what he wanted even though he liked to use his 'ill' health to get sympathy, he ignored it until one day he had a heart attack .... mind you, you can play on your heart attack for years so he enjoyed that one. This also takes place in the mid 90s when no one had a mobile phone Anway .... to the story .... **Story** When my father's heart murmur was diagnosed as [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/cardiomyopathy/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy) after his heart attack, he decided that he was going to be part of a study. Suddenly we all got letters from the study telling us that we were going to be part of the study too and go to hospitals to be examined. Our family Karen was not talking to father at this point so she didn't get one Me, my brother and my loverly sister refused to take part because of one thing. We never gave our permission for our home addresses to be passed to anyone. My normally quiet brother was really vocal about this. My father told us that when he went to the hospital for his part of the study, he was told that not many people were volunteering so he told them that his family would be part of it. Now, in normal families this would be seen as them supporting a cause and I applaud this. In our family this was nothing to do with that. Dad couldn't have cared less if the study failed or suceeded. He just wanted to show off his ability to control his children and show how he could command us to do things. These letter came just before one of the very last family gatherings that me and my siblings (excluding the family karen) attended. At the gathering, my father asked if we had received the letters. Us Siblings mumbling together: yes Dad: So when are you attending the study appointments? Brother: we aren't Dad: you are. I told them that you would attend Brother: well, they are going to be dissapointed. Dad: you will attend. I said you would. I won't have you making me look a liar by defying me *side note - seriously, who uses the word defying in the 20th century? Answer - my father* Sister: how did they get our private addresses Dad: I gave your addresses to them Sister: You had no right, that is our personal information. Dad: I have ever right. I'M YOUR FATHER Me: Dad, you gave them my home phone number AND my work number. I've been getting calls at work badgering me to agree to a hospital appointment. Dad: SO WHAT? Me: I'm rarely in the office. I've had complaints from my colleagues and my boss about the number of calls Sister (who was a teacher at the time): They've been ringing my school. Do you not understand how inappropriate this is? Dad: So when are you going to do the appointments Brother: we are not. If you pass our details out to anyone again we will never speak to you again. Dad: so you aren't doing the study? I actually face palmed myself. Shortly after this my brother and sister started to drop how much they did with my parents and how much contact they had with them. By the mid 2000s they had broken contact but .... I'll tell you more about that later. **Aftermath** He didn't learn. He put my husband on to his will at one point as an executer without telling him to a year later. Mind you, he changed his will and took me off as executer and wrote all of out without telling us a year before he died to exact his final punishment .... leaving it all to the family Karen and her mini me daughter ... even disinheriting the family Karen's son at her behest. What a pair those two made.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When an entitled parent raises an entitled kid who befriends an entitled kid of an entitled parent!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-05 18:59:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, one more tonight. **Background** I have mentioned that my eldest sister who is an EK (now EP herself) is actually named Karen (pronounced Car - Ron). Well, she befriended the girl over the road who was an only child of another entitle parent. So here are a couple of incidents of when EP + EK go up against another EP +EK **Incident one** As you know from previous [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/i2juud/how_do_you_create_an_entitled_kid_well_you_start/), my sister thought that she would have been better off if we had not been born ... her siblings My parents were in the next town shopping when they see my sister (EK1) walking towards them on the other side of the road with her friend (EK2). My mum smiles and waves at them (my mum's natural response to everything basically was to smile and wave or smile and chat) EK 2 says something to EK1 and the two of them completely blank my parents. Now my mum was hurt because although my sister is a total bitch, she was never anything but kind to her. My Dad though was now going into full EP mode. They get the bus home (it's the early 70s .... no car) and my Dad sits fuming for a good couple of hours until EK1 arrives home (by this point, we are all hiding in my brother's room ... a room that is only 6" bigger than my brother is tall and is filled with his bed and a very large chair swivle that he aquired. brother is in chair and me and other sister are on his bed. He's positioned the chair so the door can't be opened. In otherwords ... we barracaded ourselves in!!!) EK1 arrives home and swans into the house all happy with being out 'shopping' all day with her friend and meeting up with boys and being a teenager Now the house is well built but we can hear EVERY word said .... shouted Dad: YOU LITTLE SHIT - THINK YOU CAN BLANK YOUR OWN PARENTS EK1: I don't know what you are talking about Dad: YOU IGNORED YOUR MOTHER WHEN SHE WAVED AT YOU. YOU AND EK2 SAW US AND TURNED AWAY AND BLANKED US. AREN'T WE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE SEEN WITH YOU AND YOUR ENTITLED LITTLE SHIT OF A FRIEND? I'd like to point out that on this one, he was right that EK2 was a total snob and thought she was better something that will be debunked in story 2. EK1: EK2 was embarrasshed by you. I was embarrasshed by you. You are just so embarrasshing. You don't have a car. We don't have a phone and worse of all I HAVE SIBLINGS. If I was an only child I'd have these things Now, it's the early 70s in South London. NOONE had a car, we had great public transport. My great uncle (who worked for the Hudson Bay Company) had a car ... and EK2's dad had a car but EK2's dad was a used car salesman (or so he told us - turn out he cleaned the cars at the showroom but that's another story) My Gran had a phone but only because her husband worked for the railways and had to be called in at odd hours so the phone was paid for by his employers. for once, my father was speachless.. Mum quietly to EK1: I am very ashamed of you. For the next month you cannot go out apart from straight to school and home. No pocket money, no friends over, no treats. No books, no magazines, no sewing .... NOTHING. You will come home, eat, go to bed and think about how wrong you are. This was one of only a handful of times my mum stood up to anyone and we were all cheering for her. My father actually grounded my sister and used my mum's punishment. It was one of the few times he punished her. **Incident Two** Now I've introduced you to EK2 and her mother EP2 and told you of her father ... the second hand car salesman who wasn't. EP2 was at a social gathering in our road where she was boasting to some of her EP friends about how important she was and her family was. Now remember that my mum was a quiet thing who avoided confrontation ... we know now because she was verbally abused by father and was showing signs of battered wife syndrom which we realised too late, just before she died. I digress ... so back to the story .... Mum was listening to EP2 talk about how she was related to the mayor of Wimbledon. Her mum would attend all the dinner parties at the house and there were things like string quartets playing and it was all so wonderful. Mum's ears perked up. Now my mum didn't talk about it but her grandfather was the mayor of wimbledon for a number of years in the 1950s. She spent alot of time with him and met a number of local officals so knew many of the councillors over a 20 year period and wondered who this person was that she was related to. Mum wandered over and being my mum, she asked without being obvious Mum: wow, that's amazing. You must have some fantastic stories to tell. EP2: Oh, I do. It was my mum who was related. Mum: oh, tell me more about it EP2 bristles and preens and starts on: well, it was in the early 50s and there were lots of wonderful dinners and parties held at the mayors house .... my mum went to them all. Mum: oooh, I bet the house was wonderful EP2: it was lovely ... I went there as a child ... it was a big house, just by the railway, 4 stories high with a weather vane on the turret on Road name here. Now, even today that house is there. And it's a real landmark ... I knew it well because it's where my Great Grandmother and my Great Grandfather lived. And my mum lived there during the 1950s before she married my father and again when she was expecting EK1 because mum was very ill during that pregancy (the only one she suffered during ... which may explain something ... perhaps she was allergic to EK1). EP2 was really preening now: I know it's such a lovely house. The dinner parties were famous and the music ... oh it was wonderful ... string trios and quartets. Mum: now what was the family who lived there called? I remember the older man was the mayor ,... what was his name? EP2: oh, he was Dname Mum: yes, he was ... I remember now and his wife was EName. We used to call him Grandpa Duff (well she would, as he was her grandfather!) Mum: what was your mother's name at the time EP2: It was EP2name Mum: Of course, now I remember, she was my grandparent's cleaner ... she used to help out with serving at their dinner parties. And those string quartets were my aunts and uncles. EP2 just blanched Mum: so exactly how are you related to my grandfather? EP2 made excuses and left the party. Strangely after that EK2 didn't want to have anything to do with EK1 because my mum had embarrashed EP2. Of course, mum was accused by EK1 of 'runining her life' but don't worry ... my sister managed to do that again and agian over the years. And of course, with EK2 out of the picture, mum and dad didn't have to worry about being blanked in the street anymore by EK1 and EK2 **After thought** It used to make my mum chuckle that in all the people who could have been at a party EP2 managed to tell a story that she had been trotting out for years to the one person who actually was the real relative of the mayor. Every now and then she'd have a little laugh and I'd ask her what she was laughing at and she'd say .... oh, just EP2 and the mayor of wimbledon!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow so NTA. Why is it that people think that they are entitled to the bits of other people's lives that they like? They like the fact that you deal with people who have celebrity and they think that they have a right to access this. Unfortunately, these are friends. Friends would have been proud of you for what you do and instead of demanding access would have supported you. They would ask things like have you attended any swanky restaurants, what's the best business class meal you've had, what was your favourite hotel that you've stayed in. Things about you not your clients. And how do I know? Because my hubby has had to look after VVIPs in many of his jobs and he doesn't share personal things about the people he has worked with .. but he had always found a way to bring the events that he has attended to life without breaking NDAs. He's laughed with me when a VVIP arrive who he had no idea who they were (name on list to him as he lived most of his life in Australia and didn't recognise the name or person) but didn't disclose who they were. He's told me how he was dealing with other VVIPs (still don't know who they were) where he was surprised how pleasant they were when he met them and how he's met others who he didn't like but never any names or anything that would identify them. The only time he has told me about a VVIP was because he met David Attenborough but he wasn't directly involved in that meeting and was introduced to him because the person in charge knew hubby was a fan. Hubby never asked to be introduced. He wasn't told in advance. And it was done with permission by all involved. And his colleague who arranged it knew hubby would behave perfectly. That is how you repay a good friend and colleague who has supported you! Not the way your friends behaved. BTW - my normally cool, calm and collected hubby went all bashful and couldn't string two words together on that occasion as he was truely star struck. I think that's why he got introduced.</TEXT>

I know this sounds hard but it's true I always remember the Rock Hudson / Jane Wyman film : [all that heaven allows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That_Heaven_Allows) where her children were against her relationship with Rock Hudson and wanted her all to themselves then left her alone and did their own thing.</TEXT>

Why not contact the [National Library of Wales](https://www.library.wales/) and ask if one has been published and if there is an ISBN number (if it's within the last 30 - 40 years). They will be able to help that way. Does your father-in-law read welsh or does he just fancy having a bilingual version?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>You weren #8217;t abused as much as me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 00:12:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is something that has bothered me for a while and I #8217;m posting it here because my part of it is from having an entitled parent. **background** as you will have gathered from my previous posts I #8217;m coming to terms, 5 years after my father passed, with the legacy of his behaviour. i suffer very extreme dreams which I #8217;ve always called the  #8216;mares #8217; basically night terrors resulting in me sleep walking as a child and also not wanting to to sleep. As a child they involved my fear of drowning but since my father died they involve me shouting at him (the simpler ones) to me attacking him. I #8217;m dealing through these with therapy and learning to laugh at my fathers behaviour... and sharing here is doing me good because whether or not anyone comments, by writing this I #8217;m putting it in perspective and facing up to what happened. **issue** now I know that whilst my father never laid a finger on me, he did verbally and emotionally abuse me, my siblings and my mother. We also went without necessities and I now realise that more often than not my mother went hungry. Not because there was no money but because we were not the priority for it. Outwards dad spent money on us where people could see it. Behind closed doors it was a different story (who has only one set of sheets for their bed for 15 years! But their father has a wardrobe of new clothes never warn) as my hubby said, we lived a sad little cold life **incident** through a shared interest I got to know a lady and the first thing she told me about herself was that she had been sexually abused by her male relatives and physically abused by her female ones. now I #8217;m a grown up and I know that depending on where you are in you recovery journey you share different things with people. So, I put this down to rather than inappropriate first topic but her journey stage. after a few months, we were still in the same cycle of how much of a victim she had been. Now, I #8217;m a great fan of Eric Bern #8217;s games people play and when I #8217;m stuck in someone #8217;s narrative that I find is causing me mental pain (honestly there is only so much graphic stories I could deal with without them starting to trigger my mares) I tried to gently move her out of her narratives using Eric Bern #8217;s techniques. Now I #8217;m pretty good at these but they didn #8217;t work with her. So I tried empathy. The  #8216;I appreciate that my experiences are no where near yours but I can understand that if mine affected me so much just how much yours have #8217;. Especially when she started to tell complete strangers as a gathering at my house these narratives of her childhood and how everyone she has met hates her. BOY WAS I WRONG THAT ANY FORM OF EMPATHY WOULD WORK we were told that NONE and I repeat NONE of us had any idea how bad it was for her. Everyone else in her family were loved except for her. No one ever liked her even as an adult. Everyone she met treated her badly and in the end left her. She had no friends. her children were wonderful because she was the best mother in the world (this was not born out by the tales of woe she told about her children). I had thought that an entitled child became an entitled parent but now I was seeing a new version. The entitled parent. Related because they decided they had missed out in being the entitle child. It struck home because my father always claimed how unloved he #8217;d been as a child and that excused his behaviour as an entitled parent. and I had to open my mouth me: I watched my brother, sister and mother be put down every single day. Nothing we did was ever good enough. We could never meet my father #8217;s expectations. We were always being told we were a disappointment then being trolled out as performing monkeys to their friends and relatives to show off any skills we had (I was petrified of playing an instrument in public for years and speaking in public because I had to give impromptu recitals all the time or recite poetry). There was never a kind word, a hug in private, onky when people could see him bestow his benevolence we went without food, soap, even sanitary products because my father thought us not worthy. But have his friends over and there was food being thrown away. Sunday lunch he #8217;d take what he wanted and out aside his seconds then my mum would try to stretch it out for us. she turned on me. And I saw in her eyes the hatred that had caused the fall of nations and the burning of witches and heretics she: unless you #8217;ve been raped you can #8217;t even start to talk to me. you weren #8217;t abused. I was me: there are different types of abuse. Not one person here would dismiss the abuse you suffered and everyone here has empathy and support for you but you are showing none to the people here who have also suffered. we were at the end of the day and she left ... I got the typical text message, if you say you are sorry and stop going on about yourself and have a thought for me and my feelings then I will forgive you. other people present were horrified in what she had said. **aftermath** i broke contact with her shortly afterwards over something else (the story of how she was going to get me to pay for her to set up her new business ... another time) but this set me to thinking. Every person out there has some story to tell. Their can be no sliding scale of atrocity. After all we are not talking about stubbing your toe verses the Holocaust. for each person, their story is terrible. We help them by the empathy that we show them. somewhere, I #8217;m sure my Car- Ron sister is telling people that I #8217;m such an entitled kid because I thought that not leaving my husband to look after my father still allowed me to get a slice of his inheritance and the year that she put in looking after my father compared to the 30 years of doing everything for him except living with him made her better person. **conclusion** feels like I #8217;m writing a chemistry paper. I digress, it #8217;s late and I #8217;m avoiding going to sleep because I know tonight is gong to be a mare night Sharing here, telling you my stories and reading yours, it #8217;s helping me come to terms with years of my sad little life. I suffer very badly from imposter syndrome. I #8217;m actually really good at the things I do but I put myself down because I #8217;m not allowed to admit I #8217;m good. I still can #8217;t take praise. but knowing that what I experience and experienced isn #8217;t unique and that we are getting through this together by sharing experiences, help and a few laughs align the way... ell it makes it bearable and helps me work through this so, that #8217;s it for tonight. I wonder what the mares will bring this time. Last time I was trying to explain again to an old boyfriends mum that it didn #8217;t matter what re,if ion she wanted her grand kids to be brought up in as I was never going to have children. (That really happened and I still dream about it) night all. Stay safe</TEXT>

The dance mums park on our drive, down the side of our house As well randomly abandoning their cars anywhere down the one car wide drive or 4 car Parking for the church. Basically they regularly block us in and are basically rude. Hubby decided once when there was a mini van parked in our drive and no one would admit to owning it that he would block the church drive and go have a shower. 10 minutes later and no one can get I or out fo the church premises they were banging on our door (I was on my way home). He left them ther for another 20 minutes ... the time they #8217;d wasted of his ignoring his requests to move their cars. Then he swanned out and told that it sucked didn #8217;t it.

    <TEXT>You are so right about the  #8216;others have it worse #8217; argument. i talked about this with a therapist, a few years back, and she said that it #8217;s one of those responses designed to shut people down. There is no retort to it. You can #8217;t argue with it because basically, it #8217;s true. Other people have had it worse. sound like a familiar argument? It #8217;s the ine used by anyone arguing against a particular group of people getting focused on. I want to avoid politics here because we are trying to deal with things like PTSD but think about the arguments against BLM ... do they now sound familiar? so the only answer is that you have to challenge the person who says that their experiences are worse than yours.  #8216;yes, others may have had it worse but that doesn #8217;t invalidate what I have experienced and have to deal with. We should be supporting each other in dealing with our experiences #8217; but sometimes, people #8217;s whole identity is tied up in being the victim. Their self esteem is so small that they cannot see their value outside of being the victim. My therapist at the time liken it to munchausen. at first, they brought out their past in order to stop hiding it. People were sympathetic to them and then it became bound up as part of their identity. They become validated by that sympathy. now we, sitting outside this can see that they have more to offer than their past. But they get caught i that cycle of being the victim And getting validation for their struggle through people #8217;s reaction. but I #8217;m more than just the sum of my childhood and parental experiences. I struggle with actually seeing my worth and achieving things because of how I was treated as a child. But I don #8217;t go around telling people that all the time. It explains what I #8217;m dealing with but it doesn #8217;t define me. this particular woman used her childhood to excuse some terrible behaviour to other people and when they called her out she used the abused card. she told me that she was going to start up a little craft supply business the same as I had and that I #8217;d be giving her my suppliers and taking her to the events I went to and giving her half my space that I #8217;d paid for and basically paying to  #8216;help #8217; her start her business. When I called her out over this she told me I couldn #8217;t refuse this because she had been abused as a child. WTF? That so demeans every other survivor of child abuse.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>But that's not really disabled ...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 17:53:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Background  amp; Case** My Father - entitled person who had used his medical history to increase his entitlement Me - down trodden child of said Father EW - idiot entitled woman who worked at the local disabled support centre which is run by the local council Father was registered blind having lost his eyesight over a 2 year period due to him not properly managing his diabetes ... he was loving rubbing his sight loss in to everyone and playing on his diabled card. He had been given a blue badge (disabled parking permit) which is only available if you have a permanent disability that affects mobility and this has been certifed by your doctor. **Story** In the UK disabled people can access special public toilets that are bigger and easier to negotiate but you have to a special key to unlock them. These keys are available from local support centres and only cost a couple of quid but you must take proof. Anyone can go get it on behalf of the person but they must have the documentation. I have phoned the local centre, confirmed what I need to bring in order get my father one and arrive clasping his blue badge, passport, blind registration documents Me - I spoke to manaager this morning about a radar key and she said she would put one aside for me and to bring in my father's documents and my 2 quid. EW - I have it here. (Looks at paperwork) EW - he's blind Me - yes. EW - well, he's not properly disabled ME - you what? (I go very south london when surprised or angry) EW - well, it's not like he's in a wheel chair, he could use ordinary toilets ME - that is very discrimatory you know. He is legally disabled under the DDA (the act at the time) EW - well, there are more disabled people who need access to those toilets ME - and if they are using them, dad will wait until they are free. He has mobility issues too which is why he has a blue badge EW - well I'm not sure I should issue this ME -(going quiet which is an indication I'm about to loose it and you shoudl run away) You are discriminating against a legally disabled man over a  #163;2 key to a toilet. Now stop, and think very carefully whether you want to continue with this conversation or you want me to get in my car and go to the council offices and report you for discrimiation. EW - well, I'm only saying ... Me holding out hand with two  #163;1 coins in it - GIVE ME THE KEY EW - you don't have to be rude about it **Outcome** Of course I reported her to her manager the next morning and the council offices. And of course, nothing was heard back but I did get my key Which of course, my father always forgot to take with him anywhere. Still it was only  #163;2</TEXT>

If you don #8217;t earn money it #8217;s either a pastime or a passion but it #8217;s not a career. i am absolutely flabbergasted by people who say that their career is influencer or instagram model. WTF? i work in digital marketing and have seen the rise of people who think that basically they are owed a living for turning their lives into ads. What I find even more incredulous are the people who are influenced by these people.  gt;Last time they were all together she asked my MIL how many dicks she had to suck for the necklace she was wearing and, any woman who uses such slurs causes a suffragette to turn over in their grave. Women have fought for equality so when one woman puts another down she belittles that. I read back to see if you said how old she was but then again, jealously and immature behaviour has no gender or age limitations what a nasty piece of work. one born every minute eh?</TEXT>

Cut forward to when they started to get post ... no one could tell whose post was whose and rightly so, each sister would get upset when they other opened their mail especially things like banks statements. my father, being an entitled idiot solved this by him opening all post and reading it then lecturing us in the contents. * He would demand to know why letter X contained information ? * why was your bank balance so high? * why was your bank balance so low? * ehy do you have an appointment booked with the doctor? * why is this boy writing to you? Why did they say? now here is the creepy part. on my 18th birthday my voting rights kicked in. Suddenly I was in all sort of mailing lists. one Friday, my mum is away but I get a small padded envelope which I never get mail like that I get home from school and dad is waiting for me. It #8217;s a catalogue for sex toys! he makes me sit down whilst we go through the brochure together, in detail. then says that I #8217;m at fault for having it sent to me! And that he will protect me by not mentioning it to my mum. and my husband wonders why I am terrified of the mail to this day and lie about what it contains As I #8217;ve never told him about this. my therapist is good though</TEXT>

Boy, I know she is grieving and hormons and all that stuff but she lied to you in order to get pregnant - you made it clear that that was not something you had agreed to and now she is living in a fantasy world where you and she will be together, forever, and having another baby But the big issue here is not that this is something just linked to her having had a miscarriage ... this started when she got pregnant without discussing it with you first. She needs help. But you are not the one to do that. If you want to do the right thing, reach out to her parents and tell them that you are worried about her mental health following miscarriage. Then block her and move forward with your life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And I agree, there are models who are on instagram with the backing of agencies and are open about that. But I've also been on the other end of the wanna bees who are after you sending them everything they can get free in return for likes from their followers. New breed are now asking for the free things AND want you to pay them hard cash to promote it too. How are they different from the scammers who target the same people doing the 'money is tight and my kid sooooo wants x,y,z so you will send for free'. I'm in digital marketing and I can run audits to see how kosher the followers are ... remember it's very easy to buy likes and followers on social media. True following are very different. This issue is with entitled people who want to have things without putting any work or effort into it and want to be recognised as being 'someone' when they aren't. You are talking about the industry for modeling and you are right, as I have commented here. But I still have an issue with the wanna bee's who see the world as owing them a living. But then they aren't just on social media; I have had to work with them in real life .. they are very quick to take credit for things they haven't done by helicoptering into projects and not doing any work. Perhaps it the business I'm in ... and I'm also getting more and more cynical.</TEXT>

I was not allowed to use the bathroom after 9pm ... who does that to a 12 year old ... tells them they can't go to the toilet? I was up at 5am each morning to make sure it was all done. Afternoons I was to clean the house for her and play with the kid. I'd had enough and did something to upset my sister and was banned. Joy was unbound ...

You don #8217;t support him i had a friend as a kid, he had developmental issues and had to have a special diet as well. My mum I texted him to my birthday party and mad sure that kid felt like he was treated the same as the others. She worked with his mum to do so. she got shoeboxes and covered them in wrapping paper and put our sarnies and drinks crisps and jelly in them so when Rich got his meal it looked like everyone else #8217;s even though it had his special diet in it. mum chose games that rich could play and got a magician in and told him to make sure that he did a trick that Rich could help with. we kids didn #8217;t see his disabilities we saw a good friend. at the end, he hugged my mum and me and said it was his best party EVER. His mum was in tears. It is still one of my favourite childhood memories and to be honest the best birthday I #8217;ve had apart from my 50th unbirthday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue with FWB is that no right minded person would agree to it. So, when your about to be Ex says let's break up but be FWB your brain says ok ... what could possibly go wrong. Well, what you have done is give them what they want. They get no strings with you but still have the sex. I dated a guy for 7 years, was engaged and it fell apart. He wanted to stay friends and carry on FWB. I met up with him twice and this guy who couldn't be bothered with sex suddenly wanted it as soon as he saw me. Cake and eat it. But the thing that FWB ends up doing is keeping ties with a toxic relationship and that stops you grieving for the breakup and getting on with your life. They get on with their lives because they checked out of the relationship when they wanted and they get to STOP you moving forward because you come when the call. Seriously, the only way to do this is to block them. Tell them that whether you are alive or dead is of no interest to them because the moment they break up with you, they lose the right to take an interest in your life. If they really cared about you, they would not have put you through the shit that they have and they would leave you the heck alone. BLOCK HIM.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-10 21:17:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>As you may have gathered by now, I am a magnet for entitled people. It must be something my entitled father and entitled Car-Ron Sister injected me with as a young child This story comes to you prior to COVID when we lived near Oxford, in the UK. Now many of the people there are quite charming but there are great many of people who are not charming, weird, down right rude or basically on another planet. **The set up** I hate shopping, I hate crowds, I hate people who are 'going shopping' but strolling around supermakets doing nothing and I hate dealing with parking at british supermarkets. When ever possible I shop on line and have my groceries delivered. Hubby decided that I should go out shopping as 'it would you good' to get out of the house. So, where possible I would shop at 11pm at night. On this occasion, I had not been able to and had to go shopping at 8am on A SATURDAY. **How it started** I went and got my trolley and my hand scanner. The joy of using the scanner was that I could pack things into my bags as I went and keep track of what I was spending. I've arranged my bags in my trolley and am about to enter the fray of the first aisle. It is absolutely heaving with people. Now I'm in a very upmarket Oxfordshire town, in the very upmarket supermarket. The people here are all 4 year old parma ham and truffles. The champagne has it's own aisle. After 20 minues I have no feeling in my legs as I've rammed by more trolleys than I've had hot dinners. I'm considering abandoning my trolley and escaping as I'm only 3 aisles down but my british fighting spirit is kicking in and I'm determined to get to the end of my shop. Now I am very focused on finding the key things I need for my shop. Supermarkets like to make you think you've lost you mind by randomly moving items that have been in the same place for years. So, my focus is 99% on the shelves and 1% avoiding being hit again with a trolley. I have my headphones in because all the yummy mummies are out in their yoga gear and running pushchairs that cost more than my car and their delightful mini me's are screaming for whatever current thing they aren't allowed to eat. **The event** I'm starting to realise that whilst most people go up and down the aisles in the same way, there is an elderly couple who appear to be going in the opposite direction to everyone else. They are radomly tutting at random people. Arguing over the things they are buying and generally appearing to be enjoying this experience less than me. Let's call them EP1 (woman) and EP2 (man) I enter the household cleaning aisle. Now, I'm one of those people who has spent my lift ensuring that I have one in use and one spare for most things. As I finish the one in use and start the spare, this gives me a couple of weeks to source my replacement. This works well until this shopping experience because apparantly, there was a shorting of dishwasher tablets in the whole of Oxfordshire. Now I enter the aisle at the dishwasher end and out of the corner of my eye, I can see EP 1 amp;2 entering the aisle from the washing liquid end. The aisle is about 40 foot long. I can see, as I come into the aisle a single, solitary packet of my favourite dishwasher tablets in my favourite fragrance. **Side note** yes, I'm obsessed with cleaning products as I've spent many years professionally assessing them Hubby insisted we have a dishwasher because dishwasher tablets have a enzyme digester in them which means that as I can't have gluten, if we have anything that has been cross contaminated, once washed in the dishwasher, the crockery and silverware is completely clean. We rarely wash by hand in o **Back to the event** I pick up the packet (EP1  amp;2 are still over 30 feet away and plodding down the aisle slowly), scan it and pop it into one of my bags. I'm at this point, congratulating myself on finally tracking down a packet after weeks of looking AND that it was  #163;2 off ... joy was unbounded!!! Remember I said I had headphones on? Well through the sound of my favourite play list I can hear shrieking. Not the sound of a whinging entitled kid but of an elderly person. EP1 is now barrelling towards me in what can only be described as slow motion to me but high speed for her and is shrieking at me something that I can't hear but can feel inside my brain as it is vibrated to death I stop and take out my ear buds Me: Er? EP1: Give me those tablets Me: Er? EP1 getting louder (which I had not thought possible): GIVE ME THOSE TABLETS! Me: Er? I have to say that I'm kind of trying to go backwards with my trolley but apparantly I'm not very good at this and I manage to walk into a shelving unit with bits hanging off it that now impale my arms so I'm bruised all over. This does not make me a happy bunny EP1: GIVE ME THOSE TABLETS Me: No I start to actually turn my trolley round as EP1 finally closes the gap on me and starts to grab the tablets out of my bag. **Side note on how hand held scanners work** Now apart from the fact that this is downright rude. If she takes my tablets without me giving them to her, I'm going to have to pay for them because I've already swiped them and they are on my bill. I have to re-swipe the tablets in order to remove them from the bill ... if she 'runs' off with them I can't remove them and will have to have my entire order re-scanned which defeats my using my scanner. **Back to the story** I put myself between my trolley and EP1. EP2 finally catches up with EP1 and looks like he is going to pass out with the exertion. EP1: Give me those tablets Me: No I've learnt when dealing with EP to say no and not explain myself as they use this as a ruse to have a go at you. OK, my therapists over the year have taught me this. EP1: I want those tablets. You have no right to them Me: No. I reached them before you. I have scanned them now. I go to turn my trolley and she grabs me this time Now bear in mind she is about 109 ... ok, late 80s, hubby looks older. I know that I should treat my elders with respect however, I also know that EPs come in all ages and they deserve the same amount of respect as they show me ... which is non. Me, slowly and quietly (I drop my voice level when I'm getting angry, always have done. Mum said it was like the calm before the storm and if you didn't run, then it was time to take cover. I don't loose my temper often and it's not a pretty sight .... I take no prisoners and being a bright, well educated person I have the vocabulary to back me up) Sorry ... I digress .... Me: Take your hands off me. EP1: NO - GIVE ME THE TABLETS Me: I am going to walk away now and pretend that you haven't made a scene. EP1 still holding onto me with talons that are now bruising my one arm that wasn't bruised from teh collision with the stand: I'M A PENSIONER, GIVE ME THOSE TABLETS NOW Now remember I've lived with my father and had ever one of his sob stories as to why he should have whatever he wants. And this is post him [telling me to leave my husband and look after him](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hwn97u/you_dont_have_kids_to_look_after_you_in_your_old/) so me keeping a packet of tablets is nothing. I'm bruised, I'm miserable and I want to go home. Me, removing her hand from my arm, finger by bloody finger: Take ... Your .... Hand ... Off ... Me. I don't care if you are Jesus Christ arrived for the second coming you are being rude and aggressive over a packet of dishwasher tablets. You could have asked nicely and you know what, I'd have let you have them but NO, you just had to demand them. I have had one of the worst weeks of my life this week (I was dealing with major bullying issues at work and my workplace was really toxic) and have had to come to this hell of shopping here on a saturday morning dealing with people driving cars that are too big for them, that they can't park and that they seem to think it's ok to shout at me because apparantly they want my parking space so I should move. I've come in here, been attacked by yummy mummies with their shopping trolleys, dealt with the supermarket randomly moving items I have bought here for 9 years so I can't find half of the things I want and now I want to go home, fill up my lovely dishwasher and put it on with these new tablets as I am completely out of dishwasher tablets but NO, I'm not allowed to do that because YOU think that you are worth more than me and DESERVE something that I picked up before you even though the entire concept of self service at supermarket is that it's first come, first served. (last word said as I finally manager to unhindge her last finger from my arm, which I start to rub to get the blood flowing again). EP2 (hubby) finally catches his breath as says: EP1, let the nice lady have the tablets, we still have 2 boxes at home. Me now doing impersonations of a gold fish (open and closing mouth in astonishment) EP1 turns to hubby: EP2 we are pensioners, we deserve respect, she is supposed to give me them when I ask EP2: but EP1 you didn't ask you demanded. EP2 to me: sorry love, hope you day gets better. Me to EP2: it will now, I can put my dishwasher on for the first time in 2 days. Thank you. EP2 and I smile at each other and I make my exit to the last 3 aisle damn quick. As I start to run away I can hear EP1 going at EP2 and EP2 telling EP1 that he's not listening to her. **Aftermath** * Went to go pay for my shopping and I had been specially chosen for a random check which resulting in ALL my shopping having to be taken out of the bags and rescan * Go to my car and as I was ambling back to my car I realise I'm being following by a car trying to work out where I'm parked so they can snipe my space so I, being in a foul mood, start to radomly cross paths so they can't follow me. * Get to my car and start to bags in car and keep being interrupted by the yummy mummies in their range rovers asking me if I'm putting my shopping away (no I'm baking cakes in teh middle of the car park). When I say yes, I'm putting my shopping away, they all tell me to hurry up as they want my space. To which I say I'm putting my shopping away but I've not finish shopping so I'm not leaving the car park. I get continuously sworn at. * Put everything in the car, lock it and then go to do my other shopping - BTW car park is for the town NOT the supermarket so I'm in my rights to do this with my ticket for 4 hours that I've bought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think sometimes when people are encouraged to embrace their abuse it starts to become their identity. For most survivors, the need to get past that is massive and they want to form a new identity and become more than their abuse. for this person, that I wrote about he, her abuse is very much her identity. It #8217;s the reason that everything has happened to her. Even now, in her 50s, if something goes wrong, it #8217;s because of the abuse she suffered until she was in her late teens. She also won #8217;t break off contact with her family and I never got to the bottom of that. if you say that you can #8217;t do something with or for her, she brings up how she is an abuse survivor asa why you should do it. I dint understand this psyche. For me, all I want to do is get away from the abuse and the behaviours that #8217;s it has caused me to develop and I have a need to become more than a survivor of abuse. I want an identity that goes beyond that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a tale of a long gone boyfriend. **Background** Ex BF was a bit off a snob as well as being an Entitled Prick. He thought that he knew alot about food and wine and went on and on and on about the meals he used to go out for with his parents and sister when they lived in Scotland (just to point out, it was only one restaurant they used to go to and he always had the same thing). I love to cook and years later ran and taught at a cookery school. I've developed my own recipes and worked on published recipes. Whenever I've had the chance, I've tried new restaurants, even going on my own to develop my understanding of food. When I was dating Ex BF he did the same thing as he had done with his parents. He found one restaurant and went there all the time and had the same meal. Me, I'd try anything on the menu and in the end they would start to suggest off menu dishes for me to try. **The Story** Each friday Ex BF and I would go to the same restaurant and he would order the same things. The restaurant was family run italian ... the food was magical, grandma was the chief waitress, daughter and grand daughter helped her, grandpa, hubby and son were the chefs. There was the standard menu and then the specials. We had been going there for 3 years. I had eaten different things every time. Once again, he was having the breaded mushrooms, steak, chips and sorbet. The same bloody meal. I was having garlic king prawns and squid, stir fried with fresh chilli and lime, sea bass, pan fried with capers and warm zabaglione. Only the zabaglione was on the menu. As always, as we came to the end of desert, nonna comes over to us and asks if the meal was to our satisfaction. Ex BF says what he says every , single time ... It was satisfactory. Three bloody years he's been saying this. Satisfactory. The food was out of this world. Once again nonna sighs turns her back on him and asks me what I thought about the capers with the sea bass. We chat about the new capers she's found from a small supplier back in her home village. We chat, I pay, we leave. On the way home, I finally crack and ask him why he always says that this amazing food is 'satisfactory' and he says: If I tell them it's good, they'll stop trying and I'll get a mediocre meal. I look at him in bafflement. 'mediocre,' I say, 'each meal I have there is better and better and I always tell them so' Him: that's because I tell them it's safisfactory. I face palmed. **Aftermath** It wasn't long after that I found out that he had been saying that he was working overtime when infact he was knocking off early and was over 240 in deficit on his flexi time. It was the last straw and I kicked him out. Some 20 years later, I was asked to attend a michelin star restaurant for work. We had the tasting menu. Each of the seven courses was accompanied by a wine and each course and wine was better than the previous one. Around me were press who were all being 'oh I eat this all the time, it's ok'. when they had left, I went over to the Maitre D' and said that his waiting staff had been wonderful (I'm a coeliac so they had to remember to give me the food that was ok) and had been kind and made me feel part of the experience (I've often been looked down on for my no gluten), so would he thank them for me. I then said that the food was astounding and so beautifully paired with the wind and I would be grateful if he thanked Chef and the kitchen staff for me. I was the only person who thanked them, everyone else went to the bar to carry on drinking. A little kindness and recognition goes a long way</TEXT>

I ignored it as I didn't want to play games and it was obvious that this is what he was doing. After a couple of years, these games was getting a bit tired. I asked if the next time he was coming to stay, would he like to go to the cinema to see a movie that I wanted to see and I got a 'oh, I saw that last week when I couldn't come down to you ... sorry, but I'd promised someone else that I'd see it first with them, but I can't say who it was with'. I just looked at him and said I'd had enough of these games. I knew full well that he'd gone with a male friend of his because he's let slip (if you are going to lie, remember what you've said). I was fed up of him after all this time together trying to make out that I wasn't his only girlfriend when he came and stayed for weekends with me in my flat. It was childish. He stomped off in a huff and went home. I didn't invite him down or call him for a few weeks ... probably should have finished it then rather than waste the next 3 years but hind sight is 20/20</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Interview techniques - you aced the interview but didn #8217;t get the job ..</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-18 19:20:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have seen a couple of posts on here about how people aced the interview but didn #8217;t get the job and as I used to teach interviewing techniques It made me think BTW I #8217;m in my iPad which hates me and adds in random predictive text so sorry for any strange things that appear So, I used to teach interview techniques for long term unemployed and after their interviews I would go through how they thought they had done. They had always aced it. Then when I got feedback from the prospective employer they hadn #8217;t yes, there will be interviews where basically your face didn #8217;t fit in and from the moment you walk in, you know that. No matter how hard you try you know that it isn #8217;t working. other times, you meet the panel and you know that there is no way you like them ... and the same thing happens what I can tell you is even the most competent interviewee with the best skills and experiences rarely aces the interview. We all know that e could have been better. the reason that most people don #8217;t get the job isn #8217;t someone better it #8217;s the following * Your examples of how you demonstrated skills weren #8217;t relevant enough * you failed to give enough evidence in your answers that you could do the job * the examples you gave we #8217;re not from your work or were too old ... I don #8217;t want to hear about how you planned your wedding as a project management example or about how you did something 10 years ago in the scouts. * it was obvious that things you claimed to have done were either a group project or someone else did it as you wrent able to elaborate properly in how you did it * you were asked if there was anything you would do differently and turned round and said no. Everyone can do things differently even if it was simple as offering more progress reports, getting experts in earlier, being more collaborative * you weren #8217;t able to explain gaps in cvs in a way that made sense. before the interview, look at the job description youve been sent. See the key skills that they are asking for, think of an example for each of something you #8217;ve done at work that shows that skill, know why you did it, what you were expecting to achieve, what you did achieve and what you could have done better SOARA * Situation * objective * Action * results * aftermath this is the best way to phrase your answers And helps to ensure that you have given enough evidence of the skills. if you have gone though an employment agency, they will often offer you a mock interview ... do it. hoe this helps.</TEXT>

She regretted not leaving my father and she was my biggest cheer leader when I realised I was dating a man-child who was a little too like my father. i would cut all contact and get on with my life. Go back to the things that I enjoyed and give myself a space. Then a few months in open myself up to try again. the last time, 17 years ago, internet dating had just happened and my mum who had no ability with computers, decided that this was the answer. She helped me deliberately choose someone who was nothing like my father and you know what, it worked. changing who you choose to be with helps too.

    <TITLE>a year of hell whilst the chutney matures</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-22 06:54:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Another one about my father, this took place in 2000 **Background** I love making jam and chutney. There are always jars of it in my house. I started making it when I was at school and each year I enjoy using whatever I've grown. In 2000 I was staying at my parents whilst my Dad was going blind, so that I could help my mum. The blindness was a result of him not taking his diabetes seriously and although a terrible condition, he made it worse by playing on it as another of his excuses ... The more I write about this, the more I realise he was bordering on Maunchausen in his behaviour. Now, my way of making chutney or jam is to gather enough fruit / veg to get the ratio of it to the sugar and / or vinegar. I've been making chutney and jam for years so I know when to add extra things like lemon juice or the minimum acidity that is needed for chutney. For me, it's a great way to use up things in the house and end up with some fab preserves that I can give as presents to people. I also make sloe and other flavoured gin and flavoured vodkas. Now what you need to know about chutney if you are not a home maker of it, is that you need to leave it in it's happy little jar for about a year before you eat it as it has to 'mature'. In otherwords, for the harsh vinegar (which with the sugar retards the bacterial growth) to mellow out). The results is normally a fantastic piquant spread that makes a cheese sandwich heavenly. **The Story** So, my parent had two apple trees which were at this time, over 45 years old and one year they'd have a glut of cooking apples and one year a glut of eating. This year it was cooking. Mum wanted to make chutney ... surprisingly, she never did preserving, it was something I picked up in my school cookery lessons so it had been a thing we did together when I lived at home before I moved out in the 1980s. Mum and I are happily grating apples, cutting onions and adding in some tomatoes that were in the back of the fridge. In all, we have enough for about 6 medium sized jam jars. I'm rummaging around in the cupboard and find a bottle of raspberry vinegar so we decide to add that as well because heck, it's about the experimenting and the fun. The vinegar was a left over from my experimenting with salad dressings and one that I had bought. My dad is upstairs having his afternoon nap. We make the chutney and bottle it all up. Clean the kitchen and are having a well earned cup of tea. Mum and I are excitedly talking about what other things we could make with our next batch as there are lots of apples yet to ripen on the tree. Father appears Father: the chutney is making the whole house smell Mum and I look at each other because we are scared this is going to become one of his rants Father: it smell fantastic. I want some now in a cheese sandwich Mum: it won't be ready to eat for atleast 6 months. I have some pickle in the cupboard, I'll make you a sandwich Father: I want the chutney Me: No, you can't. You know it will be sharp and taste foul until at least Christmas (six months maturing is the minium) Father: but it smells so good Me: it will take your eye balls out Dad mutters but agrees to mum making the sandwich with the pickle she has Dad eats sandwich and goes into the kitchen He comes out with the empty raspberry vinegar bottle Father: WHO PUT THIS IN THE CHUTNEY, IT'S GOING TO BE RUINED AND TASTE OF RAPSBERRIES Me: I did and no it won't. The flavours will just mingle. It will be OK Father: you don't know what you are talking about (This is my father who has never made churney in his life but of course knows EVERYTHING) FAther: you've wasted my money on this Me: no I haven't, I paid for the ingredients Father: you've wasted my apples on this Me: no I haven't, there are loads on the tree still Father: you've wasted my gas using my cooker to make this Me: SERIOUSLY? You are going with that one Dad stomps off I had him moaning about this for the next 6 months until we opened one at Christmas **Aftermath** We opened a jar at Christmas to have on Christmas Eve with a cheese selection I'd bought my mum (she adored cheese). It was absolutely beautiful Father: Why can't I taste the raspberries? I should be able to taste the raspberries? That was a waste of raspberry vinegar? Why did you waste expensive raspberry vinegar on this? Mum and I just sat there looking at him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a friend (ex friend now) who turned round and said that unless you've been sexually abused and beaten then you didn't suffer abuse. This was a woman in her 50s who would not get help for the trauma she suffered and then belittled the trauma that anyone else had suffered. This statement came out when I tried to show her empathy by saying 'I know how much my father's behaviour hurt me and that was only a small thing compared to what you went through, I can't start to grasp how much your parents' behaviour must have hurt you' And that was when she said it. Even calling what I went through as a kid 'trivial experiences' And you know what? I beat myself up for a long time that I must have caused her hurt by not appreciating how badly she had suffered. Got a great therapist now and she is helping me understand that my 'trivial' experiences were far from that. Hey ho.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA - he probably really enjoys being able to properly debate with you and wants to behave normally with you to try and put you at ease. I'd go with; 'you know I love it when we sit down and put the world to rights and I want to do that with you but I'm just so exhausted from everything that has happened recently and I right now, I just want to shut the world out for a while and enjoy being here, right now, with you both. Can we put the debates on hold for a while until I'm back to my fighting weight?'</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you noticed that many of these people  #8216;wallow #8217; (for want of a better word) in the identity of being abused? All I want to do is change the terrible behaviour my father installed in me (like being terrified of the post : story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/i5u59z/you_have_no_right_to_the_post/)) and put it all behind me. She would bring out the same stories every time I saw her. And go into more and more graphic detail. At first I thought it was because the abuse caused her to have boundary issues but I honestly believe that she was so caught up in the identity of being a victim and getting sympathy that she couldn #8217;t move on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NAL but a coeliac so I've had to deal with this in my previous jobs over my issues with gluten. I would suggest that your sister also joins a union such as unison or unite (I joined unite and it's worth it for the  #163;16 a month I pay). She will need to be in the union for at least four weeks, but will then get free legal advice as part of her membership. It's the best thing I did as I have had issues with toxic managers and workplaces and got fantastic support. She needs to talk with her boss and explain the situation. She does have a right to a safe workplace under the HSE. The key thing here is that the nursery will weigh if keeping her as a good worker is worth loosing parents. There is a good chance that your sister is covered by the Equality Act 2010 (which replaced the DDA) which would also offer her job protection. The bigger issue here is that if they go nut free, then this can be a marketing point for them that they offer a safe space for kids and workers who are allergic to nuts. Because if they don't get a handle on this and they get a nut free kid then they are going to be heading towards a law suit from that child's parent as they have demonstrated that they can't keep their own employee safe. Good luck and do keep us updated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sweetie, I'm going to break it to you gently ... checking his social media isn't No Contact. You are just putting the knife into yourself and turning it. I have had my heart broken 3 times in my life and thought each time I couldn't do it again. I got together with the hubster in 2004 and married him in 2007. I was 38 when I met him, thought I'd never find true love. You just have to get out and do things for you. Honestly, it sounds like a cliche but it really, really is true. You have to be happy with yourself and value yourself before you can let yourself be with someone who values you and wants to be with you as your equal.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How I get very petty revenge on my husband</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-28 23:24:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Background** I love my husband and he loves me but every so often we get on each other #8217;s nerves and more so being stuck with each other through lock down. now, I #8217;m a fan of Agatha Christie and love her use of poisons in her books **Story** I love to cook so I cook and he is in charge of clearing up and loading and unloading the dishwasher When we have one of our petty arguments I get my very petty revenge by carefully choosing one of my plates that has a toxic plant on it and serving his dinner on it. i personally enjoy using the foxglove plate which he now considers to be  #8216;his #8216; plate as I #8217;ve used it so much! edited to add in plate for clarity and to point out that I #8217;m British so passive aggressive revenge is hard wired into my genes **Update Edit** Well, whilst it seems that we have managed to share a number of passive aggressive ways to get our own back on our partners, there have been a couple of people who think my behaviour shows toxic tendancies. Not sure what they would think of the comment my husband made to a letting agent when she asked why were moving from a flat to a house; 'well I need a garden incase I need to bury her body'. Actually, I have discussed my plate choices with my therapist and she thought it was very funny. If I get angry, doing something really, really petty but not obvious that will get it out of my system by laughing at myself and the situation is a good way to deal with things. It's a great way to deal with anxiety. There is no real issue between my husband and myself and we have a great dialogue however when you are cooped up with someone 24/7 for 6 months little things annoy you. This way I get to vent my thoughts and put everything into perspective. I have qualifications in counselling, NLP and CBT so I know exactly what I'm doing and why I do it. I don't blame my parents for any of my behaviours, they are mine and I own them. I know their origin and having been raised by a very [narcisstic parent](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hwn97u/you_dont_have_kids_to_look_after_you_in_your_old/) I strive to be a better person. As I said at the start, this is a very, very petty revenge. And in it's way, very passive agreesive and british. To those of you who enjoyed my post, have a great day. to those who need to have an argument over my behaviour, I'm sorry that your life is so boring you have to go look for an argument where this isn't one to be had. This is what it is. My very, very petty revenge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I fully accept that I can change and am doing that. I take personal responsibility for my behaviour. My therapist knows I do this one and thinks it funny.  gt; Attacking and using such poor behavior towards your own spouse, who had nothing to do with your upbringing, demonstrates how manipulative, juvenile, and immature your behavior is. It doesn't bode well for your relationship. And as to my relationship? We've been playing these silly games for 16 years and are very happy. It is our juvenile behaviour that actually keeps us sane. Being adults all the time can get to be too much. With my counselling hat on I feel that **you** have more issues than I do as you seem to have a need to troll through posts where people are sharing silly observations on life and read far more into it; accusing the poster and the commentators of toxic behaviour and telling them that they are bad people. I don't need you to do that, I have family who will do that for me for free! Your comments are noted but you know what? Don't care.  gt; I'll bet you don't mention this to your therapist do you? No, you do not, since it makes you the bad guy, and that cant be true, since you're the victim here, so nothing is your fault.  gt;  gt;Although your behavior may seem harmless to you, it isnt. Next time you see your therapist, tell them you're doing this, if you have the integrity to do so, and see what you say. Woah. I really, really hope that you don't practice with your pysch qualifications that you have mentioned because there is one thing here you are missing ... empathy. Someone really hurt you and you seem to have a need to hit out at others projecting your hurt onto them. I talk openly and honestly with my therapist (at what I pay it would be bloody stupid not to) and I don't play the victim. I take repsonsibility for my actions completely. Anyone with an ounce of training in counselling or psychology knows that behaviours are rooted in experience and it is breaking the behaviour that causes you to move away from the trauma and experience. I really, hope you don't work with anyone with PTSD telling them that they shouldn't play the victim!. Please go annoy someone else because I really don't care to engage with you any more.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How I failed to iron to the specified standard over a significant period of time</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-29 17:04:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, having put the cat amongst the pigeons with my post on my [china choices for tea](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/iihxwk/how_i_get_very_petty_revenge_on_my_husband/), I thought I'd share another of my petty revenges with my husband. This one happened when we have only been together for a few months. **Background** I hate ironing. I see it as something that is an ordeal that should be avoided at all costs. I have always hung things on coat hangers to dry so that I have to iron them. Hubby hates ironing. He was in the forces (both army and air force) and has given himself a very high standard for ironing. **Story** Hubby and I had been living together for about 2 weeks when this happened. (three years before we married). Hubby asked me, because I was working part time, if I would iron his shirts and hankies for him. I expressed that this was in my opinion, the task from hell and that whilst I loved him very much, this was a sure fire way to end our relationship. Hubby begged me to do it as he was shift working and was very tired after his shifts and travelling to and from work whilst I worked literally 5 minutes walk from my work and worked 3 days a week. He would do all the washing on his off days if I would do the ironing. Would I just give it a three month trial? I was talking about this to my mum who I knew hated ironing as much as I did. She said that after my father told her that she didn't iron properly, when they were first married (at this time, 45 years earlier) she had put tram lines up his shirt sleeves ever after. So, I ironed hubby's shirts, trousers and hankies relentlessly for 3 months putting the most horrid extra folds in places you wouldn't think you could put folds in to. After three months, he came to me in absolute frustration and said that I was right. I had no ability to iron a shirt and there was no point in me doing it any more. So, could we swap ... I would do the washing and he would iron. I grudgingly agreed. **Aftermath** About 7 or 8 years later, my mum let slip to my husband about the tram line ironing. Hubby said that he had hoped I was sabotaging his ironing rather than I was really that imcompetent. He also admitted to me and mum that actually, the real reason that he hated ironing was because he didn't iron to his own standards! Oh, and he irons all my tee shirts because he hates that I don't think it's necessary and they annoy him. I never asked for that. He just does it. I happily repay by washing all the clothes and folding up the clean clothes and putting them away. He is very happy with this situation.</TEXT>

And as they say, when you point the finger at someone, four fingers are pointing back at you. So, the person with the issue says more about themselves than I have done about me! Stay safe</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don't like the concept of abortion however I strongly believe that everyone has the right to a choice. You have just gone through a traumatic experience where you needed support whilst you considered every choice. The fact that you have decided to make your infertile friend a massive gift is unbelievably kind and empathic of you. You are taking a very nasty experience and turning it into a massive positive. This child is going to be so wanted and loved. This will totally wipe out the conception because how can that survive so much love. The people calling you a murder are despicable. I have friends who are pro life campaigners and their entire methodolgy is about offering support to women who are pregnant. The people you are having to deal with are not pro life because if they were, they would be trying to connect with you and support you through this. They are simply nasty and trying to control you. Worse still that you have chosen to carry the child to term so your friend can adopt. You are a wonderful person who is doing such a selfless thing. Good on you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My gran made sure that my mum, who was very left handed, was able to do things whichever way was most comfortable for her. My mum wrote left handed, even had a left handed fountain pen from my gran (which in the last 1930s cost a bomb) and learnt to sew. Then at school she had a teacher who tied her hand behind her back and made her sew with her right hand. After a couple of months, mum was failing in sewing and was redoing her written work in the evenings with her left hand. Gran got the report from school, asked mum what was up and mum told her. Gran went down to the school and told the teacher that this ended here and now and if it didn't things would 'get nasty' (her words when she told me the story). My mum was allowed to go back to writing left handed but she never sewed again as she was so self conscious as she lost the ability to sew left handed.</TEXT>

You are being supportive with her and helping her to set small goals. There is a fab app called bearable where you can log how you are feeling, what you have done etc each day. It's free. I use it when I'm in a bad bout and it is good to just log and then after while, you can look back as see that you have logged improvement. It also allows you to log medication so you don't have to worry about did you take it. Good luck to you both</TEXT>

The issue here is that you are seen as her property so that she can do what she wants and that you are at her beck and call to reinforce her position in the family by the hugs. I know that sounds really harsh but in effect that is what it is. My father insisted on hugging me and giving me a kiss but ONLY when there was someone to witness how loving he was being. It took me years to understand that body autonomy is a thing and you are allowed to say no. Espectially when you are over the age of puberty!! It is creepy but even if it wasn't, you saying no and her ignoring it is what is fundementally WRONG here. She isnow being upset because your father has said enough is enough and she is not able to show her control of the situation anymore. You, your sister and your father have to stick this out so that she learns that there are boundaries in life. In the long run, it will be worth it.</TEXT>

When I was in my 30s, she told me about it and I made a special effort to always leave her a little present that day from her rainbow baby. You and your husband have to grieve this through. Then you will decide together what to do next. The people who truly love you will rally round and help. Stick with them and let them help you as much as you need.

He isn't your manager. You need to sit down with your manager and tell them the truth. Then say either reassign you to work with someone else or that you have the meetings together on the monday rather than separately as this would certainly save time for your manager. But, I would start looking for a new job now. I had this situation and the person involed went to their friends in the company and started to tell them and anyone who would listen that I was 'difficult'. I am far from difficult and in fact very easy going but when I got pushed into a corner with them deciding that I could make no decision in my area of work without their permission I pushed back and they turned round and said that vindicated their saying I was difficult. Karma is a bitch. I got pushed out. She stayed. Company got taken over 8 months later and she wasn't needed in the new organisation and got pushed out herself. I'm in a better job now.

Most times they can #8217;t transfer you because it #8217;s blocked from doing so (the company would have to pick up the transfer part of the call cost so they physically limit who you can transfer to and secondly, the fed up person who is answering your call knows that #8217;s what you #8217;ve done and isn #8217;t going to be sympathetic because you are most likely the 9th person today and saying you don #8217;t have a pen to write down the number is just going to get you told to ho to the website or if we are feeling really fed up, we #8217;ll email it to you because we have it in a template. the guys in the call centre are targeted to answer x number of calls an hour and only be on the call for y number of minutes. You shouting at them to transfer you just makes their day worse</TEXT>

He may be totally innocent in his behaviour with her but from her reactions, I don't think the relationship she has with OP's husband is healthy. I have no advice. This is a total mess.</TEXT>

Before lockdown I would have suggested sending her on a fantastic holiday but that isn't really an option now. Why not put an amount aside and once G has decided where she is going to live, offer to pay to decorate and furnish a room for her so she always has a bolt hole to remember the good times she shared with your father.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Working in a project that is not in your remit without your line manager #8216;s permission is basically wrong. It #8217;s taking you away from your work. you need to talk with your manager and be honest. Say that this is something that really interests you and would be great experience for you. you need to stress that you wont let this project affect your day to day work and be prepared to make up the time spent on the project each week so you don #8217;t miss your deadline. Then ask your manager to help you become part of the team, if a member of my team came to me and wanted to be part of a project but it meant that I or the rest of the team ended up doing their work because they were now in the project my answer would be NO. It #8217;s not fair in your manager or colleagues. And be prepared for your manager to take you off the project if your day job starts to suffer. that said, I #8217;ve seen people do really well doing projects on top of their day job and others who shirked and got called out for it.</TEXT>

The time it takes to choose the plate is the time it takes me to stop, think about what we were talking about, put it context and get over it. there are subjects that are out of bounds in our family from religion to politics and we, as individuals have our own ideas and opinions and strangely we sometimes have to agree to disagree in things ... I #8217;m a pacifist and he is ex military for instance. where you have got the wrong end of the stick is that this is not about resentment towards each other, it #8217;s about NOT resenting by putting my thoughts in context without harming my relationship with my husband.

    <TITLE>Gifts to placate the ungrateful god</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-01 23:18:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>It was Father #8217;s Day back in 2013. BTW on my iPad which hates me and randomly changes words to comical effect and removes capitals **background** as those of you have read my other post, my father was narcissistic and basically left me with many EP stories and behaviours to work through with my therapist and of course to share with you all. **Story** as always I had spent the past month looking to buy just the right presents for my father. Putting in thought to what I got him. Searching shops and online to snag just the thing. hubby and I arrive and we had planned to give him the presents after lunch but no, like a spoilt 3 year old he wanted his gifts as soon as we were through the door. i give him the gift bag which had a number of small exquisite things in it. ripping off the paper on the first one he started dad: of course no card or present from your siblings mum: well you know the post can be strange it might come tomorrow dad: not even a phone call bear in mind it #8217;s 0930 in the morning and all my siblings have children of their own ... and naive sister will be at church and brother is actually at work as he did shifts, at the time. hubby trying to change subject: well, we #8217;re here and LB (me) has really gone to town this year to find you things youd like dad chucks first opened gift onto coffee table with no comment about it (chocolate bar with no sugar rather than diabetic chocolate which it took me 9 weeks to track down and buy as he won #8217;t eat diabetic food cause it #8217;s crap! And so his sugar levels are crap instea) starts on next gift: I used to make you all go and see your grand parents whether or not you wanted to. They should make them come here and see me Note: we weren #8217;t made to go because we actually wanted to see our grandparents and he would trot this one out every few meets. mum: well it #8217;s Father #8217;s Day so your grand children be with their fathers dad throws next present onto the coffee table after opening it (a rare model he wanted that was discontinued but I #8217;d used my connections to track one down) dad: I #8217;m their father, I #8217;m more important chucks third gift on table (pair of cuff links with a first class stamp in enamel as he was a avid stamp collector) this goes on until he #8217;s opened up all the presents. hubby has had enough. I #8217;m just withdrawn now, completely shut down as I always was when we would go see him there is silence as dad has blustered himself out hubby: well, what do you think of your presents? LB has spent a lot of time finding you things you has asked for or that she thought you would like dad: they #8217;re ok SILENCE I #8217;m now trying to blend in with the sofa as I #8217;m so withdrawn hubby: ok? She spent every evening for the past two months trying to find you nice things! at this point I want the earth to swallow me. mum: cup of tea anyone? (My mums go to when my dad was in a rant was to run off and make tea) dad turning to hubby: well so she should. I #8217;m her father. and that was that. We sat through the rest of the day in silence, had lunch and left. we stopped half way home at the services and hubby insisted on getting me a posh strawberry based iced drink from a famous coffee chain which is an indicator that he is worried about me. We sat in the car ready to head home and he turned to me and said: hubby: you know your father doesn #8217;t deserve you buying him anything. He doesn #8217;t deserve the money you spent on him but more importantly he doesn #8217;t deserve the time and the care? me: slurp Hubby: why do you do it? me: I #8217;m throwing gifts to placate the ungrateful god. hubby: you can stop me: slurp .... really? hubby: yes. and that was the last present I bought him because 5 weeks later my mum took ill and I spent a week with him whilst my mum was in hospital and 3 weeks after that he threw me out of his house in a visit because I refuse to force my very ill mum to go to a restaunt so he could have a meal out. i only spoke to my mum after that until she passed away 6 months later and to my father once after my mum died when I [refused to leave my husband and go be his live in carer](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hwn97u/you_dont_have_kids_to_look_after_you_in_your_old/) he died in 2015 and I should have gone NC years earlier</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My father taught me to knit. Only problem was that he couldn't knit but refused to admit this. I was naturally traumatised by this experience. Fast forward 35 years and I learn to crochet through a fab friend. She and another friend tried to convince me that I could knit. I didn't believe them. Last Christmas I wanted to knit a hat for hubby, so naturally I chose to make him one that was on circular kneedles, using magic loop and cables, followed by two hats for Brother and BIL using stranded work, in the round. I still maintained that I'm not a knitter. I crochet and make bobbin lace. Last weekend I took the plunge and cast on a blanket and now I'm 4/5 of the way through a single bed blanket that will be embroided after I've finished the knitting. I'm going to admit that I might be a knitter. https://preview.redd.it/wghyi8uqill51.jpg?width=2016 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=ded5d0ebc21033e0b23b0396ee4e1a80ea11dbc0</TEXT>

I prefer wool but as I want this to me machine washable (it #8217;s a xmas pressie) I thought acrylic was a good choice and it #8217;s a dream to knit. Very squishy and soft. Even better that the whole blanket will cost less than  #163;15 in yarn so I can afford to make one for brother / SIL and one for sister / BIL and one for me. So at Xmas we all one yo snuggle in. I #8217;ve splurged on pure wool to make slippers for them too. does the fact that I might have also bought all different sized cables for my interchangeable needles mean I #8217;m a knitter?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>apologies for strange capitalisation here but my iPad hates me When I first went into the job market I applied for a job as a data manager with a telecom company. Took the tests and at the interview they asked if I #8217;d considered engineering. I had a levels (uk) in Maths, maths and physics and had been doing nuclear physics at uni before I dropped out. i asked why they brought it up and they showed me my test results where I #8217;d aced the tests. I said I #8217;d give it a go and I spent 8 very happy years as a senior telephone exchange engineer. I was one of only 13 women in London working in the exchanges amongst a couple of hundred men. Because this was a technical post we all treated each other with respect because we only got those roles if we knew our stuff. then I was asked if I #8217;d like to apply for another role which was about writing marketing materials that had to be technical too. I went through the application, had two interviews and got the job. One of my colleagues who had been dying to get into marketing and out of the exchanges turned round and said I #8217;d got the role over him because I was female. now, I #8217;d had to fight to get into the school I wanted because of politics where they took the top group of 11 year olds and put them into a failing school to buck its results. Getting to the grammar school I wanted changed my life. I was told that if I was good at something to pursue it and if I wasn #8217;t to go find something I was good at. uni I fought for the subjects I wanted to do. I got places on merit then worked hard to show I deserved them. i was really upset that I might have got this role on positive discrimination and went to HR. So did the guy complaining. They did a review of the interview process. I #8217;d scored much higher than him in the tests for that role and had also scored the highest in the interviews. It wasn #8217;t that I had taken his role, there were three posts in offer, I #8217;d come top and he had been beaten by me and two men. I do like a transparent HR process. so, when companies don #8217;t employ on merit it hurts people like me who keep their qualifications and experiences up to date as we get branded as the token woman</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop for a moment. Your image of yourself is being skewed by your parents telling you that your best is not good enough. this is NOT true. your best is perfect. i don #8217;t know why people have since time started, thought that telling someone that they could do better will actually cause them to do better. Your give 100%. You can #8217;t give 110% because that isn #8217;t physically possible and telling you to do so is just a throw away line that is said as a habit. At 15 I was a nerd. Went to an all girls school. Had only a couple of friends. Not part of the in crowd. I had to have my jaw widen and from 12 to 16 had to wear braces. I was tall and lanky ... I was 5ft 8 at 12 when all my friends were just 5 foot. go forward 2 years arts and we had boys come to our 6th form for maths. 8 girls in the class (all nerds) and 4 boys (all nerds) so who do the boys want to hang with? Yep, us. Suddenly all the cool girls are spitting blood because we know the boys and are gettting invited to parties. just being around guys who thought I was a human being gave me confidence. so, my advice to you is the same I would give my 15 year old self; stop looking for for the one. Make friends with girls. Start to understand how they work, what they like, learn to be a friend. And relax. The most attractive thing about any boy or man when I was a teenager was that he was interested in me the person. Actually, heck, nearly 40 years on and that is still the most attractive thing. don #8217;t go straight for the ask out. Get to know the girl first and see if you both find each other attractive. You are going to get friend zoned a lot. But it #8217;s going to be worth it because those girls who are turkey your friends will start to look out for you and set you up with their friends for dates As you move through your teens and into your 20s. And, you are going to get your heart broken. But when you find the one, it will be sooo worth it. my brother married my sister #8217;s best friend. Met when they were 14 and have been married for 42 years. My sister married in her 20s and got divorced. fell in love with a guy she met at work and has been married to him for just under 30 years. i had two disastrous partners and married my hubby when I was 41. Couldn #8217;t have married him earlier as he lived upon a different continent And we didn #8217;t know each other. oh and the study bit? My sister was even more of a nerd than me. Married, two wonderful grown up kids and a PHD. Now a senior university lecturer at a world renown university. Nerds do inherit the earth! you can do this. Your 100% is just perfect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry that I don't have any advice, only an observation. What is it now with ghosting people? What happened to simply saying that there is no connection or just that you don't want o see or chat with that person any more? It's as though social nicities have been removed. I've asked people about why this has happened to them or why they've done it and what gets me is that the people who ghost try to legitimise doing this as being for the benefit of the person they ghost. How on earth can that be for your benefit? You're left there wondering why they broke contact whilst they go off and do what they want? Often, it's just because they don't have the balls to actually tell you it's over. But what annoys me is more often than not it's because there is something going on in their life which they don't want to share with you. Ghosting stops you from having closure and learning how to move on and that is cruel ... yep, know that is hard but I think it's warranted. If you aren't ready to go back out there then give it a little while. That's ok, but don't let this guy, and what are obviously his problems, stop you from living your life. If he isn't at a point in his life to share why he can't continue talking with you then that is definitely HIS problem and not yours. You are worth more than this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Letter to my father</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-15 19:29:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Update** \- I shared this with my therapist today and she says it's what she calls an 'angry letter' and she recommends it as a way to get the thoughts out of your head. I have to say, since I wrote it, the nightmares where I attack my father have stopped. **The letter** This is the conversation that I should have had with my father .. it's 5 years too late as he died in 2015 but it needs to be written Dear Dad You have spent your whole life working out how to get one over on your own children. You changed your will constantly as a way to punish us for the transgressions that you perceive we have done to your rules. Through out our childhood we fought to make sure we didn't break your rules. The only issue with this was that we never knew what the rules were. But that didn't matter because you moved the goal posts not just monthly, not just weekly, not even daily but during a single conversation. You punished me for doing something one week then punished me for not doing it the next week You told us how bad your childhood was then would repeat the same story with a different ending that showed you were not the victim that you made yourself out to be. You bullied and verbally abused my mother who was, in the end, so frightened of you that in the last weeks of her life, she was planning to discharge herself from hospital and go to live her final days in a nursing home just to get away from you. You caused me to develop the ability to make stupid lies because I was confronted by you so many times and put before your judgement seat accused of the transgressions that I had done to your rules. I would be so frightened that I would babble anything in order to stop the tirade of shouting that you subjected me to. Because of this, I had to learn how to behave in the workplace that when faced with agression I shouldn't just babble anything to make them go away. I didn't know what a proper relationship looked like so I made extremely unwise choices in partners. These people abused me in the same way that you did. Treated me as less than them. Saw me as a source of income and a servant ... remember how you told my mum, when she was in the cardiac unit that unless she discharged herself and came home to fulfill her wifely duties (looking after your every whim) you would cut off her allowance .... and that allowance was her state pension and small income from her mother's money which you insisted was yours by rights then gave her a pitance back. Three long term relationships where I played out your idea of how a relationship should be. Then, when I finally find my true love, the man who treats me equally and has encouraged me to be who I can be, you decided that I should leave 8 years of marriage, 11 years of partnership, walk away from my job and be your full time carer because 'that's what you have children for ... to look after you in your old age'. I have suffered from depression and anxiety through out my life because I lived in fear of what you would punish me for next. I would spend time trying to lay gifts before an angry god to placate him. Taking time to find you just the right gift, trying to make you proud of my achievements ... but you always put down what I did, always told me I could do better, that I was never good enough. I thought my habit of remembering things from over the years, where I relived situations where I was unhappy and was bullied by people, including you, was just that, memories ... but now, having sat with a therapist and gone through, in detail, these episodes and how they cause me to freeze and have anxiety attacks, I realise that this is PTSD. I'm an educated woman who grew up in the home counties and you have caused me to have a condition that I thought only soldiers in combat zones had. I'm scared of what the post will bring. I'm scared of who will come to the door. I distrust people. I don't want friends because I am convinced I will be used or let down. You had an unhappy little life where you put yourself first yet still couldn't be happy. I will not allow you to wreck my life from beyond the grave. I will not let you ruin my marriage. I will not live in fear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;modsRwads Well you had me there for a moment with your user name implying you were one of the mods! If you cannot see the entitled behaviour of my father in the post then I will just add your voice to those who told me to suck it up when I told of these same examples. Oh let me count the ways 1. Changing will to use as blackmail to get their own way 2. creating rules for the household but not telling people what they were until they were broken then changing the rules to fit themself 3. bullying 4. verbal abuse 5. threating my mother when she was in hospital 6. demanding I leave my husband to look after him I'm not complaining ... that would be against the rules of the subreddit ... although, you complaining that I'm complaining would be complaining which woudl be against the rules of the subreddit ... oh the irony of it all! But then your goal is to bait and troll and get people to argue with you so you get karma points for those arguments. I may be new to reddit but I'm not an idiot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This reminds me of when the UK implemented GDPR I flagged to a friend that their ecommerce shop wasn't GDPR compliant and it would be worth working with their web designer to plug the holes. Her husband called me up and tried to get me to list all the things that they should be doing so 'he could tell their designer what to do'. I asked him if he was asking me to consult for him (as this was one of the services I offered), he said that he didn't need that, he just needed me to go through and make a list of all the things that they should be doing ... I told him that that was a consult and it was would take an hour and cost him  #163;60. No, he didn't want a consult ... just for me to make a list ... I said no, that's what he paid his web team for. Then he tried to keep me on the phone to go through his web site so HE could make the list. I told him to go to the ICO website for guidance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have the flip side to my first example - at the same time, another friend, who was setting up their business, asked me if I would consult so that they got GDPR correct. As they were starting up, they had no website, and all their previous customers were on a spreadsheet. So I said, it would be no charge and to ensure that they password protected the spreadsheet and the pc then when they were further on, they could use the money then for me to consult when they needed it. I got a fantastic bouquet of flowers the next day for 'saving their sanity' and two further paid jobs from them. And I think I've bought more from them than they have paid me for work .... but then her hand dyed yarn is to dye for (pun intended).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How my sister got round my entitle dad choosing her career</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-16 00:28:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>*TLDR - dad insists my sister follows his chosen career path she ignores him and get what she wants one petty move at a time* **Background** my father decided that we would all be wonderful engineers as he was an engineer. Of course we couldn #8217;t be better than him or that would be a crime. My sister is 10 years older than me so I was 6 when she started this plan and she only told me about it when I was 50, 3 year ago. I think it is fantastic. **Story** my father signed my sister up for a levels in science and maths. My sister wanted to do English and history so she simply got the timetable off a friend and started attending the classes she wanted. by he time the first exams came round and the results were published the school and subsequently my father realised the mistake but it was too late to correct so they all decided that she would have to continue. off she goes to university but my father will only agree if she does history as  #8216;we all know that English is a useless subject as you can only become a teacher #8217;. Bear in mind, this is the 70s so she gets state funding for her education and the small amount my dad was suppose to pay to support her he refuses so she basically starves. End of third year and dad asks how the history degree is going ... sister tells him that there was a problem but not to worry as she is getting a 2:1 upper class degree but it #8217;s in English. He hits the roof but then she says its not his problem as she is getting married and won #8217;t be staying the any more and has a job and all is fine. she worked her socks off to finance her degree and after a year supporting her husband, ince he got his first job she did her teacher training and has made a very successful career in education and I mean very successful. She has written books, developed teaching methods and lectured at universities around the world. She is highly respected in her field. **Moral / Aftermath** I so wished my sister had shared this with me when I was 16 and being forced to do the subjects he chose for me but I realise now that when I did my a levels she stepped in and pushed for me to go to uni away from home (to get the full experience) because my dad was trying to get me to stay at home to keep the control there. but I have to admire her dogged persistent to get what she wanted. The moral is to make the little changes until you can escape.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; We've been married for five years now. She has spells of depression but it's not "proper" depression (for lack of a better term) cause she still functions 100%, she throws herself into her work and she remains super productive but she has told me that she feels dead inside and she feels like she isn't actually there (her words). This is proper depression. I have depression and have had for over 20 years. I go to work, I am productive, I go out, I meet friends and I have times of crippling depression where I feel as though I have died and just haven't found out yet. She needs to seek professional help and you need to support her.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I give up. I really do</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-18 18:48:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Background** I live in a vicarage which is 20 foot from the church and 30 foot from the church hall. We rent privately from the church. There is a very small car park that takes 4 cars apart from our 2 (we have an agreement that we can park our two cars as part of our tenancy). Our house, the church and hall are reached by a 300 ft drive which only one car can drive down at a time. The church and the church hall have been closed due to COVID and last week the dance mums descended again as the dance lessons have restarted. Hubby has an ongoing feud with the dance mums because they block him in, park in our space and ignore his please to move. It came to a head when I was in hopsital and they blocked his car in so he couldn't come and get me after my op. He begged them to move and they simply wouldn't speak with him or acknowledge that he was in the room. This has led to mailcious compliance on his part ... must post those. You'll love them. So onto why I give up. I really do. **Yesterday evening** Went to take the bin up the drive ready for the bin men tomorrow. Put on face mask as the dance mums are out in force. I get to the top of my drive but can't get my bin infront of the gates because a gaggle of dance mums and associated sproglets are standing around a car chatting .... yep, three mums and 6 kids. Next door neighbour can't put his bin out either because they are blocking him. We do the british thing shrugging shoulders at each other and passive agressively shaking our heads. Can't tell if he was smiling as we both had masks on. I stand to one side and wait, and wait, and wait ... they are obivlious to me as they HAVE to catch up. Then they amble down the drive, stopping every so often to do I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT And NONE of them had masks on. They get to the church hall and they start to chat to the other dance mums. Apparantly the rule of 6 doesn't apply to dance mums. Only good thing is that they parked at the end of the drive as there was no where for them to park outside our house ... but sorry for the nice people who live in the house where they parked as they won't be able to park outside their house when they got home</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Christmas fun with NC father</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-26 21:55:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Background** my father #8217;s narcissistic behaviour had got to the point that we had to go NC with him and LC With my mother Because of my fathers behaviour. we had had my parents to stay for Xmas every year since 2004 but my fathers behaviour had got so bad in 2012 that instead of having them stay, we went to them and I cooked Christmas dinner there. I was up at 4am that Christmas Day peeling potatoes, making pigs in blankets and getting everything ready to transport the 140 mile round trip and cook it. my father moaned about everyone and everything that day and never said thank you Once. Hubby put his foot down and said no more as it was killing me dealing with his behaviour this story takes place christmas 2013. At this time my mum was very ill and had inky 2 minths to live. My father had cut off her access to her money as she wasn #8217;t doing her wifey duties of looking after him. **Story** christmas eve, our heating went out. We had one convection heater we moved from room to room, an electric fire. Christmas Day, Hubby surprised me by heating up water in every pan we owned so I could have a hot bath when I got up. Refreshed I cooked lunch and we had a quite day watching old movies and drinking our home made sole gin about 5pm the phone goes and it #8217;s my mum wishing us a happy christmas. Hubby answered it and laughed and joke with mum Told her about the heating being out. He passed the phone to me and .... I got blind sided. My father took the from my mum. it threw me. I hadn #8217;t spoken to him in 4 months. dad: so you have no hot water or heating? me: yep, nothing until the new year dad: well, you should have come down and cooked us dinner. i just handed hubby the phone back And walked out of the room. When he took it, my mum was in the phone apologising. **aftermath** my mum went back into hospital a few days later and never left. after She died my father decided I should leave my husband, job and cat and become his full time career because that is what you have kids for. You can read more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hwn97u/you_dont_have_kids_to_look_after_you_in_your_old/). I had no further contact with my father who changed his will in my birthday, 2014, with the collusion of my eldest sister so that she received all his money with her daughter after a 20 year estrangement, cutting out my myself, my siblings and my siblings children, including eldest sister #8217;s own son, all against my mothers wishes. He died in 2015 **An aside** day after Boxing Day, neighbour asked how Xmas was and I said really peaceful at hime but a pity about the heating and lack of hot water. Her response? Why didn #8217;t you come over and use our shower? Ah the comments of non narcissistic people which make your soul cry with love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I did my first interviewing course I was told that the reason most people fail to get a job is not that there were better candidates but because they failed to actually provide the evidence requested at the interview. I thought this was an exaggeration until my first interview ... and just died. Out of the 6 people I interviewed, only 3 tried to answer the questions and only one actually answered them with examples of the behaviours and skills I was seeking but even then their examples were terrible ... Q: can you think of an example where you demonstrated your project management skills (PM was a big part of the role) A: Yes, when I planned my wedding Me: do you have any work related examples? A: No, I've never managed a project at work OK - so I learnt that you need to do your own paper sift and don't let HR fob it off on the intern even if that is company policy. What makes this worse is that when I worked with long term unemployed, they were encouraged to use out side of work examples like the one above. I can understand if you have done charity work or voluntary work but to use your own wedding as a PM? There was another dozy a while back. I agreed to do the paper sift for my boss at the time as I was trained in interviewing and understood the role we were interviewing for. I pulled out a short list of 3 but said that I didn't have confidence in any of them. The rest just didn't meet the standards. However, my boss liked the look of one of the rejected candidates (so why ask me to do the shortlist) as they had loads of qualifications. I pointed out that these all seemed to taken as though they were reskiling and there was no linked experience to back them up. Anyway, boss did the interviews and I asked how they went. It seems her preferred canidate had done exactly what I had said - they had been made redundant and part of that package was  #163;X to spend on retraining. They had spent the last 6 months with their old company doing every training course they could to become a trainer because people said they had a 'great way with showing people how to do things'. They had taken the money and stopped working. Then when the money ran out looked for a job. They had NO experience in training, no examples of proper training course design and delivery and all their answers were hypotheticals. Now my boss wasn't the best trainer in the world - she tended to shout alot thinking this would cause the knowledge to be forced into the trainee's brain. She turned round and said this guy was not a good trainer. Pot - kettle - black</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something I was told by a previous manager of mine and I've always explained it to any of my staff looking for promotion is: Just because you are great at your job does not mean that you would be great at mine. He went on to say that if you haven't shown the skills and abilities needed for the promotion then HR and management have no evidence to consider you for even an interview. Yes, in most countries, companies have to demonstrate that they have looked internally to fill a post and if they have not found the right person they will look outside. What you should have done is had a sit down with HR afterwards and asked them what prevented them from considering you for the position and used that to go get the skills you need or to have made sure that you showed your new manager that you have those skills. If you have been there 6 years and there have been 3 managers, then the turn over is fast and you would have had time to put this into action and been the slam dunk for the next opening.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why I'm pleased that there are travel restrictions due to COVID</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-03 22:48:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hubby's sister came to visit from over seas and the first time (stayed for 4 weeks and brought his mother) we paid for everything as we thought this was a once in a lifetime visit (his mum had started to show dementia and we moved our wedding forward to coinside with the visit). Except that she has come twice more staying for 6 weeks at a time and informed us when she was coming not asking. I used to attend craft shows as an exhibitor and would have to cancel shows loosing money from deposits and sales because we had to go to the airport or she had 'booked' us to take her somewhere. when my parents were alive I was the only one of their children still in contact with them and I made it clear that once my father started to want to come and stay for EVERY holiday and multiple weekends then he had to share gas and food costs because apart from the cost, that was right thing to do. By the second week of the last visit hubby wanted me to approach her about her paying for food after she had announced that on a three day visit whilst she was over she had taken out and paid for her aunt and uncle and their children to have a meal. I explained to him that she was his sister and he had to have the conversation. He didn't. Hubby would go to bed to get away from her insessent talking so she would sit up with me. At the time, I had a dressing room (I know, sounds posh but basically we had a 3 bed house. Bed 1 was where we slept, bed 2 was hubby's safe space with his PS4 and where we put his sister on that visit, bed 3 was much smaller and hubby put my craft books in there with my dressing table and a comfy chair so I had a safe space to go - we called this my 'dressing room' as a joke), so I tried going there when hubby would announce he was going to bed and getting out a book and putting on my headphones but she would come in and just carry on the conversation. I was literally going out of my mind as couldn't relax. As she left us at the airport to go home, she announced that she would be coming back to visit in the summer for 4 weeks and would be staying for 8 weeks at Christmas. I told hubby that I couldn't do that. I wasn't willing to give up all my leave to ferry her around shopping and having to deal with the cost of her eating me out of house and home. Hubby said that it was simple, he had actually told her not to book any tickets until she had spoken to him as we were planning to go travelling again that coming year including Christmas. The interesting thing here is that if you really wanted to come over you'd suggest that you house sat whilst we were away ... wouldn't you? But my main role in her visit was to ferry her around the places she wanted to visit. She would dump a list of places she wanted to go and wanted to know when I'd take her there. I'm sorry to say that 2 months later I suffered a dibilitating condition that lasted for a year and hubby used that to put her off from visiting. I unfriended her and her family on social media and blocked them to force hubby to deal with her direct (that was 2017 and none of them have noticed). The final straw for me, and why I blocked them, I was off work sick and could not use any form of computer, phone or tablet as it made me physically sick from the condition. I started to get messages from her son about how he was planning to come over to stay with us and wouldd be coming with hubby's sister and his new wife. They were all planning their tickets and would let me know when they had booked it. My messenger was blowing up with this. I told her son simple; not to book and pay for any tickets until he had spoken to hubby as it would be a shame for them to have paid for everything only to find out we weren't there. You have to remember that they expected us to collect them from the Airport (4 hour round trip) and we actually don't have a spare bed in our house - we have an emergency air bed incase we someone needed to sleep over for a night but not for 3 people to come and stay for 4 - 6 weeks (and no ... no one gets our bed ... my father tried that one and got short shift from me). Her son wasn't happy about this but I insisted that he had to talk with hubby to arrange anything. That was when I unfriended them all and blocked them. Then hubby used us moving to put her off and then me having a new job. Hubby has gone LC. She hasn't contacted him in 18 months and I sometimes I think that ITA because the first thing I thought about COVID travel restrictions was how she can't just announce that she is coming over. When I joined reddit, her daughter-in-law messaged me saying she thought she knew me from somewhere ... so blocked on her too. For the first year, I used to ask hubby if his sister had contacted him and he would sigh and say no. I went NC 2.5 years ago, he hasn't heard from her in 18 months, not even an email on his birthday last year so he didn't bother contacting her on her birthday this year and so it seems like NC has been established. I can say that there is NO way he'd let her in the house during lockdown ... after all, he locked me out of the house for 2 hours when he thought I got too close to the guy delivering my shopping. And before you worry about me being locked out, it was April, warm and I had the back door unlocked just incase ... I just sat in the garden for a while with the cats and then let myself back in. He came down after two hours to let me in and found me in the house anyway. Nothing malicious, he was just having a freak out ... I have had to ban him from reading all the ways you can catch viruses ... he gets very paranoid. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant here ... I've been wanting to get this one out of my head</TEXT>

    <TITLE>No Biscuits? This isn't good enough</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-04 09:59:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, last night I made some [choc chip cookies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/j4l3bp/the_chocolate_cookie_dilema/) for hubby which is another story but it reminded me of this tale ... then this morning there was an update post from another redit user regarding coookies and I thought it was time to post this **Background** I belong to a craft group which every October has a gathering where other craft groups from within 50 miles come along to meet for the day. When groups do this type of day, they all have their own 'signature' thing that they do ... our group provides hot and cold drinks and cookies during the day then at 3pm they put on 'afternoon tea' with a massive spread of cakes. The members get into the event for free but pay a cake tax by providing a homemade cake if they can or just bring a nice shop bought one. I joined in 2009 and each event I would bring a biscuit barrel stuffed with my gluten and dairy free chocolate chip cookies because 1) I'm a coeliac (celiac) so I could eat them, 2) two of our members were on a gluten free so they could eat them and 3) one of our members had a dairy intolerance like hubby so they could eat them (I would make sure that hubby had a biscuit barrel full as my cake tax to him too). I had been doing this every year until 2015 when I started up my little craft supply business. This is important because in 2015 I was asked if I would like to attend the event as a supplier rather than a member and sell my stuff. This was my very first event as a supplier. I'd had a bad year with narc parent and had thrown myself into creating things and having ended up with more stuff than I could use, it had been suggested I sold them. As a supplier, the arrangement was I didn't bring cake but instead made a donation from my stock to the raffle. I was fine with this as their was no charge for the table I was using and very happily gave two generous prizes to support their charity that year (air ambulance - how can you say no?) **The run up on the day** So, it's lunchtime at the event. I'm munching my way through a nice salad and chatting with the two of the suppliers next to me, who I've known for a long time, and who was giving me tips on table cloths, setting up my items so people can see things and sharing stories of the strange people they had met at shows. I had been really anxious about my first event and they were making me laugh and dialling down my anxiety. I'd had a sneaky count of my takings so far and was really surprised with how much money I'd taken (I'm always careful never to count my takings infront of my customers as I think it's disprectful) **The story** Everyone at the event is sitting at their tables eating their lunches and I'm starting to think that I can do this. Then out of the corner of my eye, I can see this woman at the counter where they are serving the tea. From her body language I can see that she is NOT a happy bunny. She grabs her mug and turns to look directly at me. She then makes a bee line to me. Because of the lay out of the hall this took her 10 minutes to get to me, which was rather comical as during this time she kept eye contact. **The conversation** She reaches my table and I politely put down my lunch and stand up (good manners cost nothing as my gran used to say). Woman: There are no chocolate cookies Me: Erm ... sorry (totally caught off guard as I'm selling scissors and sewing accessories) Woman: They (pointing at the tea counter on the other side of the hall) said you didn't bring any chocolate cookies this year Me: Erm ... no, I'm a supplier this year and gave a couple of prizes to the raffle instead Woman: Well, what am I going to eat? Me: Erm ... I don't know? Woman: I always have 6 of your biscuits for my lunch. I'm a coeliac. I don't have anything to eat now (Now I like a cookie as much as anyone and I probably could eat them for lunch but who goes to a day out without taking anything to eat with them when you have a dietary requirement. I travel everywhere with spare provisions incase of emergency. My desk at work is stuffed with emergency food) Now, at this point, I've eaten most of the food I have brought with me because I had planned my snacks and lunch. But I have a gf wrapped chocolate biscuit, from a local supermarket, in my handbag for later that afternoon. I pull the biscuit out and offer it to her Woman: well, that's not much. Me: you are welcome to it if you want it. It's all I have. At this point her friends have come up to see what is going on and I think a light bulb goes on in her head that she is being an idiot. Woman (meekly): are you sure Me: yeah, it's ok She meekly takes it and walks away. Her friends look at me shocked and start to apologise. Me: well we all get hangry some times! **Aftermath** I see her each year at the event and she dilberately avoids eye contact with me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Checkov's Gun - or why I can't watch some tv programs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-04 10:16:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have had an issue with a number of tv programs that cause me massive anxiety and in discussing it with a friend she said that I suffered from Checkov's Gun. Now you might think that the programs I can't watch would be disturbing documentaries or plays but it's not. I'm terrified of certain comedy shows. It started with Some Mother's Do Have Em when I was a child. I would watch it with my parents as we raised by narc children know, you were not allowed to choose what you watched, you were told. In the show, the character would suffer set back after set back which would end in a final scene where everthing would go wrong. I would know that it was going to go wrong but obviously because this was tv, I was unable to stop it. I can't watch any tv show where there are signals that things will go wrong. It makes me increadibly anxious. So, this friend, when we were discussing this, told me that this is called chechov's gun. The idea is that nothing can be shown in a play without it being used later. You see a gun on the wall in scene 1 ... well someone is going to get shot in scene 3 ... otherwise, the gun would not have been shown. It's used as a plot device in situational comedy LOTS. Of course, all us raised by narc parents have been raised to be permanently on the look out for anything that will signal the next outburst, gaslighing, abuse etc. We live constantly in a play where we are looking for chechov's gun. Hope this insight helps some of you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find that there is less signalling of bad things to come in action movies or police procedurals. With sit coms, I get really, anxious because I know something bad is going to happen. What makes it worse is that normally in a sit com you have the fall guy who doesn't deserve to have bad things happen to them and knowing it's coming makes me really anxious. Sienfield makes me physically ill ... hubby noticed that I was getting twitchy and said it was because none on the characters were sympathetic so bad things would always happen to them and I was getting more and more anxious watching it. So, back to my diet of CSI, NCIS and war movies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Background** Started trauma therapy this year to try and get over, once and for all, being raised by my narc father (who died in 2015) **Today** So today, I spent this morning having flashbacks, panic attacks, anxiety attacks and obsessive thinking. My brain decided to replay a selection of it's favourite memories of my father, bosses and colleagues telling me how incompetant I was and I just went into freeze mode. By lunchtime, I had done nothing but was completely exhausted. All the coping strategies that I have been practicing with my therapist failed. I couldn't stop the voices shouting in my head long enough to enact any of them and in the end, the only reason they started to quieten was because I was so tired and had gone bck to my classic way of dealing with this ... watching tv programs on the nazi's and world war II (it works because apparantly my brain copes with documentaries that show bad people being punished or getting their just deserts). I know that I'm not incompetant but can't get that through my brain when I'm in one of these sessions. I slept all afternoon and now feel guilty because I have done nothing but am exhausted. On the positivie side, I'm 7 programs in and have learnt about two french nazi hunters and the guy to who developed the saturn rocket for the US.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I spent the whole of saturday having panic attacks over fears that I wasn't doing well in my job. By noon, I was so exhausted I fell asleep on the sofa for 5 1/2 hours. Why? Because being raised a narc father my best was never good enough, working for narc bosses, my best was never good enough. My sucesses were down played, I was blamed for their mistakes. Being shouted at and bullied in the work place was normal and accepted because that was how I was treated growing up. I have worked for managers who have gaslighted me and shouted at me in public. Today, I was given the heads up on the agenda for my weekly meet so I could have time to come up with some ideas. I went into the meeting and was told that the processes and mechanics that I had put into place since I joined were working and that they wanted to help me focus now on refining the processes and strategies which they would do by giving me their knowledge of our business (I came into the business in Feb). I outlined the next stages I wanted to focus on and they asked who would do that ... I said that because we needed to be careful with money I would do and you know what? They offered me budget because 'now is the time to spend' ... so that I can get in extra help so I don't overload myself. I came out of that meeting almost in tears because I was treated like an adult by two people I have immense respect for and who listened to my concerns for the business and support how I want to move my area forward. I am trying really, really hard to learn to trust people but it sooooo tiring.</TEXT>

It was my first proper knit project, in the round, using cables and a magic loop ... and I am hooked</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My narc dad used to blame anyone who wasn't around any more as the reason everything was sh\*t in his life. They weren't around to defend themselves or to tell their side of the story. Made him the victim all the time. Was supposed to get him sympathy. Of course, we remembered all the other versions of the stories and where he had messed up with his narrative so he would happily gaslight us by saying this current narrative was the true one. Oh, so glad he is dead. And I'm in therapy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA Being a brit, I didn't realise that it is common in the US for bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses. During the 70s and 80s when I have been a bridesmaid, the bride paid for the dress which did result in some vile choices but you sucked it up as you were being 'given' the dress. It came as a shock watching wedding programs from the US to find that brides could choose a terrible dress and expect their bridesmaids to pay for the privildge of wearing something that they would never use again. You were clear from the start on the budget you could afford. She went ahead and chose something more expecting you to pay for it. In the current climate, where jobs are at risk, people are worried about money, it is inconsiderate at least and down right nasty to expect you to foot over double your budget. And, it's not just the cost of the dress, you still have shoes, travel, accomodation, present etc to buy. Get out fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>wow. Just wow. You have made me (53F) think about my shopping habits. Prior to lockdown, I would go shopping and it would take me 90 minutes to do my shop as I would get 'lost' and forget what I was looking or where it was, even though I had a list that I made aisle by aisle. I would often have to go back two or three times a week to get the things I had forgotten. I think hubby thought that I wanted time out of the house when i went shopping, I hadn't the heart to tell him that I just got paniced in the shop. Then late last year I moved to shopping on line and having it delivered and it changed my life because now I had the things that I actually needed. I now get my shopping delivered each saturday at the same time and I can go back into my shop and check that I've not forgotten anything. Even better, site lets me set up my weekly essentials and they are there ready for my basket each time I set a new delivery. I have told the story before of my narc father walking out of the supermarket, more than once and leaving my mother unable to pay for the shopping because he had one of his tantrums for no reason than he wasn't getting his own way on something none of knew about. I'm sure that has caused me to hate shopping. You have achieved at 25 something I didn't realise I hadn't at 53! You go!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Teaching a kid to read a bus time table isn't a life skill - it's being deciteful to potential employers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 21:06:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Another stroy about my narc father** **Background** My sister spent many years working in special needs education when it was in it's infancy. She is a fantastic, caring person who has dedicated her life to helping people reach their full potenital and in many cases, exceeding it. This story takes place in the early 80s **Story** On this occasion my sister was explaining the (new at the time) concept of teaching life skills. One of which was teaching the kids how to read a clock and then use that to read a bus time table so they could go to a job interview or just get to work on time. My mum and I were interested because this was a skill that we had picked up from our mums as had my sister and we were asking why these kids didn't have this skill. My sister explained that it was two fold. For many of the kids, their parents took them everywhere so they never had to get a bus (I had to get two buses and a train to get to school since I was 11 so had pretty much worked out to read a timetable with help from my mum) and many of them had issues with numbers so even with a digital watch, they couldn't tell the time, let alone translate that to a time table. If you can't work out when the bus is coming, you don't know when to turn up to get it then you don't get to work. It seems like a simple skill but suddenly you realise how important it is. **My father then delivered his authoritive pronouncement on the subject** Father: You are being deciteful to potential employers. You are making out that these kids are competent when they are clearly idiots. I don't know why you are wasting your time on this. My sister, who like us never learnt to shut up and not engage the wrathful one tried to protest. She got put down with the following: Father: No, nothing more to be said. I've told you what to do. And with that the subject was now officially closed. **Aftermath** Strangely, as teaching bus timetables was part of the curiculum my sister carried on teaching it regardless of my father's pronouncements!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can't afford equipment then go for unusual spices and herbs that she might enjoy cooking with. Saffron, the most expensive spice at one time would be a great present. Then some of the more interesting ingredicents. Another idea would be small but actually really useful gadgets * hubby bought me a fish de boner - it's a small fish shaped item that you use as tweezers to take bones out of salmon. * A microplaner grater in different sizes for zesting and grating, * a mandoline for fine slicing .... Not sure which country you are in but look out for the uk kitchen site - [lakeland](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/) for inspiration</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a ki, I was enthralled by the film gaslight. I never realised that my father gaslighted me over my memories. I have a  #8216;photographic #8217; memory for things I #8216;ve read or heard and he would trot me out to perform this at parties but course nothing I remembered that he said was true. He gas lighted me all m life until I didn #8217;t believe my own memory and in that path lies madness. Keep a diary. Trust your memories</TEXT>
