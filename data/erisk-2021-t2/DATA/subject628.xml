    <TITLE>I feel like I #8217;ve had a demon follow me ever since I was a child</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 00:23:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry if this is hard to read because I wrote it weird and it #8217;s a bit long. I haven #8217;t told anyone this and I haven #8217;t thought about it for years but now I #8217;ve been having horrible nightmares of me being tortured and pretty much just horrible things happening in my dreams and it #8217;s been affecting my sanity honestly. So this all started probably when I moved into the first house I can actually remember being in when I was six. I know when you #8217;re that young you can have an overactive imagination but I #8217;ve never been like that and it felt so real. So it started out small like I would have constant nightmares of demonic things that I can #8217;t describe much but I remember it? Like I see it but I can #8217;t describe it. It started escalating with feeling like I wasn #8217;t alone and just constant paranoia that is probably not normal for a six year old. The first actual experience I had that I saw was honestly the most horrifying thing I #8217;ve ever seen. I was sitting and waiting for my mom and our roommates to get done with getting dressed so we could go out to eat. While I was sitting in the living room I felt compelled to look towards the dining room like I HAD to. When I did I saw this gray head poking out of the ground with an unnaturally wide smile with basically shark teeth in its mouth and it had long black hair and white eyes. Behind that thing was a tall shadow of a man with no head. They felt like separate entities like the head felt like it meant me harm and the shadow just felt sad. I know I #8217;m probably sensitive to that stuff because I still pick up those types of energies. When I saw it I snapped my head back forward and stayed as still as I could I was terrified to move and it felt like I was there for hours even though it was like twenty minutes. Ever since I saw that things got worse in the house. It started to sort of decay? Bugs started to live there and it was so bad that exterminators couldn #8217;t get it to stop. One of my roommates who I cared deeply about just ended randomly dying one night like there was nothing wrong with her or anything and it hurt me so much I don #8217;t suffer as much from it anymore since this happened 12 years ago but I miss her so much. Things became so tense like you could cut it with a knife it was so bad. I had kittens and they randomly died even though they were in good health. After that I started to wake up with scratches and something would touch me occasionally that was very cold. I ended up moving out when I was eleven with my mom because of reasons I will not say and when I would walk by the house it just had this aura of death. Things were fine for awhile until my mom passed away when I was thirteen that is when things started again when I moved in with my aunt. In my room at night I would see this shadow occasionally just in the corner of my room and then it would randomly disappear. I had to move to another room and had a walk in closet and I was honestly afraid to go into it because I would feel something there and I would see shadows in my mirrors. I ended up getting my room blessed because it was starting to affect my health. I had sleep paralysis for two months straight and I became an insomniac from it and I still am one somewhat to this day. From these experiences I recently became a Christian and I pray to try protecting myself. At first it worsened my nightmares and left me physically drained when I would wake up. I had lucid dreams of me being attacked and I could feel it and I had a dream of my mom dying in front of me. I #8217;ve since strengthened my faith with god and it has helped but I still get the nightmares every other night but they aren #8217;t as bad and it doesn #8217;t drain me anymore. I feel like this is the same thing that I saw when I was younger and I think it attached to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you I #8217;m sorry that you also had to experience those things but I am happy you are okay now. Definitely for me things got better after I started to pray and when anything would happen I would usually tell it to go away that it isn #8217;t welcomed here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely will try that mainly what I #8217;ve been doing is whenever anything happened I would pray or tell it that it isn #8217;t welcomed here and tell it to leave. Usually every night I ask god to protect me while I sleep and I feel like he is even if I get the nightmares because they don #8217;t affect me as much now even if it is something horrible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you I will see what I can do about it but I doubt I have a Jungian in my area because of how it is. Definitely me becoming a Christian has helped because I ask god to protect me before I sleep and even though I still get the nightmares they don #8217;t hurt me like physically now. Again thank you for the advice I #8217;m grateful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most America fast food chains fucking suck man. When I was 17 I was working my second job which was my first food service one at KFC. I was still in freaking school and they were having me come in as soon as I got home until 12 at night almost every damn day. I know that #8217;s illegal but I didn #8217;t know then so I dealt with it for three damn months and then I finally said fuck it and quit. I dealt with the labour at first because I enjoyed it and I was new so you know I didn #8217;t want to show I had no ethic or anything. I wasn #8217;t allowed to take a break which is illegal especially since I wasn #8217;t 18 hell even the older people there got to take a damn break but I didn #8217;t and I was pulling everyone #8217;s weight pretty much. I remember once I got sick with some type of stomach bug and I called in and explained the whole thing and my damn manager told me that if I didn #8217;t come in I was gonna be fired so you know what I did? I came in because I needed money. And the thing was I hadn #8217;t missed a day and her reasoning is I was still on a probation yet there had been no call no shows who got to keep there job. I didn #8217;t touch anything except for money because I was not getting anyone sick. Every five minutes I was running in and out of the bathroom to either puke or shitting my guts out. I had a bit of help luckily because the good manager was in when I got there but when my night manager got there all hell broke loose. She was pissed off at me and yelled at me because I wasn #8217;t pulling my weight and not doing things I ain #8217;t even supposed to do in the first place that I usually do. I #8217;ve always been yes ma #8217;am no sir etc but I went off on her and I didn #8217;t get fired from it instead she let me get off two hours early off my shift which was after another two hours. I can #8217;t believe how some fast food chains will just completely use you like that. When I finally left three people left with me and I #8217;m glad I left. Also if you live in Southeast Georgia do not fucking eat at the KFC it is disgusting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A year ago I was an absolute mess. I was abusive and I self harmed constantly. I wanted to die because I didn #8217;t know how to stop being the way I was. The big one was when I got into a fight with my cousin and I did it for a way of punishment I didn #8217;t expect it to go that deep honestly.

    <TEXT>In some places they circumcise the female by removing the clit and inner labia and sew it all shut and only leave an opening for the vagina and urethra to prevent the loss of virginity before marriage. It #8217;s so freaking awful and they usually do it while she #8217;s still awake and everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to bite my nails and pick the skin so bad that I have scarring especially on my thumbs. It takes so much will to stop but once you start making progress it gets easier. How I stopped picking them is I started religiously moisturizing and caring for my hands and nails and because my nails were healthy they got thicker and broke less so I didn #8217;t need to bite it off and I had nearly zero hangnails and just pieces of skin starting to peel off I didn #8217;t have to pick it and so I got used to not messing with it. Plus I had started medication and it definitely helped. You will get to a point where you will stop I believe in you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to do that so bad that walking was painful. Try to let it heal up and when it does do a daily exfoliation and moisturize it should help with the urge to do it since there will be no snags or anything. You also have to somewhat cold turkey it I know that may seem impossible but I was able to do it and I think you can too. Another tip is wear socks very often like don #8217;t take them off or you #8217;ll see your feet and you might pick at it.</TEXT>

It #8217;s what I did to stop mine and I think you can do it. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lost both of my parents at a young age but when my mom died it hit me hard. I accepted that she died but it didn #8217;t feel real at first and in the beginning when school ended for the day I always thought I would walk home and see my mom. I have PTSD from it because I was the one who found my mom and I have to block the memory out of my head to not go into an attack. The pain never goes away but it gets easier. It #8217;s been 8 years since my dad died and 5 since my mom. Recently I lost a friend to suicide and it was a bit difficult because it didn #8217;t feel real to lose someone your age since we #8217;re just highschool students. I always knew how life can just be taken like that but it somewhat hits harder for someone your age. I always wish I could have done something for my friend, my mom, and my dad but I realized I couldn #8217;t and it hurts but I accepted it. My advice for anyone who needs this is to just take it day by day and that the pain lessens over time but it will never fully go away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me it was when I lost my virginity. I was saying I wanted to do it with him but when it finally came to it I had doubts and he pressured me into doing it. It didn #8217;t bother me much at first but now 3 years later (I #8217;m 18) it affected me bad because I felt like at that point I had to do stuff for guys. I #8217;m a lot better now luckily and my self esteem is much better. I have other experiences but that is the one that caused it all pretty much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Atleast they were a decent human and apologized instead of being a poor excuse of a human who has nothing better to do than be rude to people online since no one else loves you or gives you attention. The only way you can get attention is by being mean I guess so I am sorry for you I hope you actually find someone who loves you. It #8217;s okay that you #8217;re taking your issues out on me I understand. Now go back to fucking your waifu body pillow.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;ve had someone stalk me on Snapchat since last year and I need help to end it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 05:53:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay so this guy I met on a dating app probably a year or a bit more ago has started to basically stalk me. When I first added him on the original account all was good until he got weird. Asking inappropriate stuff pretty much. I blocked him short after and then another account added me and guess what? It was him again. This has been going on and on and finally it stopped for awhile because I figured out in the settings you can prevent randos from adding you. Not even thirty minutes ago I got a notification that someone added me and I did not recognize it and btw when he made new accounts they were different names with a initial for the last and it was random letters for the username. My heart sank when I saw this because I knew it was him. I gave it the benefit of the doubt but I made sure to ask for a pic after he gave it to me and confirmed it was indeed him I #8217;ve blocked him again. It #8217;s been so long and I don #8217;t know what to do about this. I don #8217;t know why he won #8217;t stop. I checked my settings and they were the same didn #8217;t reset so he managed to add one of my friends then. I need help please just someone help. I know he #8217;s only doing that but what if he eventually escalates? I don #8217;t know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because of the outbreak I have an option to do online school and my whole family is upset because I want to go to school physically. I #8217;m a senior and this is my final year of school that I have to go to. Final year of seeing my friends in person nearly everyday. Final year of seeing all the teachers and staff I built relationships with. I #8217;m going crazy without seeing my friends honestly. I know my best friend is going and he #8217;s my rock pretty much. I want to attend this school year in person so badly but I also feel so bad about this. I feel like I #8217;m selfish for this even though I #8217;m going to take precautions. I #8217;m so freaking stressed about this and I would like your opinions please.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-28 01:15:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;m religious and I believe that some deaths that are considered preventable are destined for a reason. I also feel that some can be prevented because god didn #8217;t intend for them to die then. Why I say this is because my mother died from a preventable overdose and one of my friends from suicide. I feel like these things happen for a reason. Like helping someone grow as a person or to bring people closer together or to show more awareness of that kind of death. Personally it made me stronger as a person to handle these things and it showed who my true friends were and it made me value the relationships I do have. I would like to hear your views to potentially change mine or to at least alter it. (I hope this is five hundred characters I can #8217;t tell honestly.)</TEXT>

I tried convincing my mom to cut back at least one what she was doing and she ending up overdosing anyway because she refused to listen. That #8217;s what I mean when it #8217;s destined is if it happens even after you try to stop it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like some things are destined and some things are not. You know? Like let #8217;s say you become famous that was most likely destined. Last year on the anniversary of my moms death I ran into her old friends, my teacher that was there for me the day she died, and I got in contact with our old roommate that was there when I found her. That wasn #8217;t at all a coincidence thing it was destined. You have the free will to do what you do with your life but I feel they #8217;re destined to go to a certain thing you just choose how you do it. Like how I feel that some preventable deaths cannot be prevented because it is what god intended. My mother had the choice to get help from her family and I tried convincing her to do it as well and she still ended up continuing and then overdosed. My friend had a support system and people checked up on him and he still killed himself. They #8217;re destined for a reason. It may suck a lot but it happens for a reason to better you or someone else. That #8217;s my take on it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Things may happen to people who don #8217;t deserve it but I believe god does it for some sort of reason or it #8217;s possible that evil won in that instance. They do something for a reason to better you or someone else or many people. Like I said about my mother definitely her death could have been prevented but it didn #8217;t happen at all and it made me stronger as a person. When my friend committed suicide he had people there for him and he still did it and it made me realize my mortality and to cherish the people you have at the moment because it #8217;ll be gone like that. I also believe that god can #8217;t prevent every single thing because with good there #8217;s bad and I #8217;m not saying it #8217;s like Satan or anything but it #8217;s something and it can win sometimes when something bad happens. I #8217;ve had stuff happen to me that was clearly destined to be. For example on the fourth anniversary of my mother #8217;s death I ran into her old friends, ran into my teacher who was there that day, and got in contact with our roommate who was there when I found her. I hadn #8217;t talked to her since she had died and on the exact fourth anniversary I did. I also turned 18 then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t mean to not take action to prevent something sorry if I misconstrued it or something I had a similar thing with someone else. I tried taking action to prevent what happened with my mother and it still ended up happening. My friends and I tried helping my friend and he ended up still killing him self. I #8217;m not saying don #8217;t take action but they #8217;re not going to always work and I feel like that is something that is then destined. Thank you for taking your time to type all of that I will definitely think about what you said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think you have a set number of things that happen to build you. It #8217;s just what god felt was right. And I don #8217;t believe it #8217;s always their doing and it could be evil because you can #8217;t have good without evil. I feel my mothers death was a destined thing because of how a grew as a person and it actually took me out of poverty that I would have most likely lived in for all of my life. What I mean by my friend dying for a reason is yes he could of had that free will to fight it but he chose not to and maybe that was an instance of evil winning. All I know is it made me realize my mortality and how I should cherish my friends much more because they can be gone like that. I know my views may not be perfect in understanding honestly so I #8217;m sorry if it #8217;s confusing a bit or contradicting at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like god or let #8217;s say just good and evil are separate entities that cannot destroy one another. God can do what they can do and evil can do what they can do both have a good and a bad in them like the ying and yang thing. God decides some destinies and evil does as well or they decide to do something. God can try to prevent but always can #8217;t. I don #8217;t believe they work in mysterious ways there #8217;s a reason for everything good or bad and it may take time to realize what it is or you may instantly realize it. The god works in mysterious ways is bullcrap honestly. If that came out exactly in the mysterious ways thing then I didn #8217;t intend that at all just let me know if it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you have to be so rude? Do you? Go somewhere else if you #8217;re going to be fucking mean. It is not wanted here. I hope you learn to not be so rude to strangers online for simply not knowing or finding something strange. Also my camera is not shitty you #8217;re just finding something to say to bring me down. Matter of fact I have one of the newest iPhones that has one of the best cameras sorry that it apparently doesn #8217;t meet your standards. How about you make a video and we can compare camera quality. :)</TEXT>

I don #8217;t go on this sub very often so I don #8217;t see this often. I even apologized to someone about it. Maybe if you had said it #8217;s just a bug instead I would have reacted better towards you. Have a wonderful day and grow the fuck up. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay if trans women aren #8217;t actually women then how are trans me actually men? You do know what the acronym means right? It #8217;s Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist and it #8217;s fucking stupid. It #8217;s used because they think all men who want to be women are just perverts which is mainly untrue. Why would a man pretend to be a woman to be a perv? They experience hate and exile and even assault from people who don #8217;t agree to who they are. It also takes an excruciating amount of time to be able to fully transition as well I saw a comment earlier about how it took three years of therapy for them to be considered to transition and it cost a lot of money for them. Please rethink your mindset and have a great day.</TEXT>

Plus we should be able to make babies in the CAS instead of just being able to make a toddler I always disliked that and THEY SHOULDNT BE OBJECTS! And in base game there should already be weather I mean heck in the sims 2 console version we had rain! Gosh I hope sims 5 won #8217;t be a flop like 4 was/is.</TEXT>

When it came down to it and he was on top of me he legit shoved it in me with no warning and it was the worst pain ever and he didn #8217;t care and I have to literally kick him off me. We still ended up doing it after I made him warm me up first but I can #8217;t forget that pain and it caused me some issues with sex for awhile and I felt like shit because I was no longer a virgin. I was 15 btw and he was 14. They learn young I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the second friend I #8217;ve dealt with who killed themself. This one hit the hardest because I #8217;ve known him for so long. He was always a troubled kid who had problems but he was actually pulling around. He had just gotten out of an abusive relationship too and I had even just gotten back in contact with him and feelings started flourishing. I hadn #8217;t talked to him since ninth grade. I don #8217;t know what to do but all I want to do right now is to not exist. This has hit me just as hard as when my mom died. I loved him dearly and I didn #8217;t even get to tell him maybe then stuff would have been different. I don #8217;t know what to do at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not autistic but I get sensory overload from loud sounds or certain sounds so I have to listen to stuff at a low volume. Again this doesn #8217;t mean I #8217;m autistic and the way she behaves doesn #8217;t mean she #8217;s autistic either so self diagnosing yourself with autism is a shitty move. My best friend almost diagnosed me because I show the same symptoms as her ex fianc #233; but I didn #8217;t allow her to do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No that #8217;s perfectly understandable. I have my days honestly where I don #8217;t smell that great despite cleaning because funky smells can stick. So my partner is usually turned off by it and doesn #8217;t want to do anything then that has to do with my stuff. Never had anyone go down on me mainly because I refuse since I have those days where I didn #8217;t keep up to par with hygiene. Women can #8217;t control their odor completely because that #8217;s their natural smell usually but hygiene is key to atleast be clean.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently a good friend of mine committed suicide and I have bipolar disorder and PTSD and it #8217;s honestly made everything ten times worse. I #8217;m on medications to help but it honestly feels like now it #8217;s doing absolutely nothing. I #8217;m back in my manic episodes and either in a low depression or suicidal feeling but I have no plans or I #8217;m irrationally angry. I #8217;m trying to use my coping mechanisms but it feels like nothing is working. I feel like my old self and I hate it. I would like some advice if you can give it thank you and if you can only offer condolences that #8217;s okay too just thank you for trying to help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your pain that you feel. I lost a good friend of mine six days ago from suicide and it #8217;s a very painful experience. I know for yours it wasn #8217;t something that was an intentional death but it still basically throws you into the middle of the ocean and you forget how to swim. I don #8217;t know how you #8217;re handling the grief or if you aren #8217;t it might come at a later time. I know this because I had another friend do it awhile back and it took me until the lock down to finally grieve. Just know it #8217;s okay to cry it #8217;s okay to feel whatever you #8217;re feeling. You won #8217;t  #8220;get over it #8221; like people say but you will slowly heal but the wound will never fully close. It will always be a little open and it can be fully ripped open again at random times but just know it will try to heal again with help from you and others mending it. You won #8217;t come out the same things will be different but you can make it a good different. DM me if you need someone to talk to I #8217;m here to help the best I can.</TEXT>

Gentle didn #8217;t work for me when I was cutting so it probably doesn #8217;t work for you. Stop looking for people to feel sympathy for you on the internet and get some fucking help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should just lay it straight with her about how you feel. I told my crush I liked him but we stayed friends but something else happened with me and him and after we decided it shouldn #8217;t happen he started talking to me less so I laid it out flat to him about how I feel and he told me he was actually super busy and wouldn #8217;t do that. If she gets upset for you for telling her how you feel then she doesn #8217;t need to be your friend. I did that with another guy who I felt like only wanted me for sex because he wanted me to come over so badly and instead of just saying no he didn #8217;t want that he was such a dick to me about it. Just tell her how you feel like she #8217;s ignoring you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s better ways to help correcting something than bullying I don #8217;t know where you thought that #8217;s where bullying is right. Bullying is never right it only causes more trauma and could even push someone to commit suicide I know from personal experience with both of those. Please correct your way of thinking if you do this because you could cause someone even more problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m on lamictal and luckily have not had the symptoms and now I #8217;m on the higher dosage. A year ago I had a scare of SJS because I had this spot on my back where it had a rash and the outer layer came off. No clue what it was I went to my doctor and told him my medication and he checked it out and prescribed an eczema cream. It went away and I didn #8217;t have anything else pop up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m lucky my psychiatrist like kept saying the first time she prescribed it to me to immediately stop if a rash appears I did that when that thing appeared on my back but I was able to take it again after it went away. It was not great those few days because I take it for my bipolar disorder. God that syndrome looks horrible and I hope my body doesn #8217;t randomly turn on it I know someone whose it did and she got off it fast enough luckily.</TEXT>

This beaut is still apart of her pack despite being fully grown and at this point she would venture out in the wild. Woah there gal! She just became aggressive despite just being docile. She might be one of her species that has  #8220;bipolar disorder #8221; but she still seems to get along fine with basic survival and socializing. This one has had many failed and successful mating attempts but has not found her lifetime partner and will most likely not if she doesn #8217;t fend for herself and leave the pack. Now I #8217;m gonna leave ya be alright? What a beauty. If you come in contact with one be very cautious and approach from the front because she could become startled and attack. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was taken advantage of by an older man when I was 16. He knew I had sexual trauma from when I was younger yet did it anyway because I started it. He has a daughter and she #8217;s only a year younger than me too. I could tell her but I know it would destroy their relationship. I #8217;m also afraid to tell my friends since I went on about how I got to fuck an older guy. They #8217;ll probably think I #8217;m just lying because I was upset he got bored of me. It took me two years to accept that he did take advantage of me and it only ended when he found another girl my age. I still feel like it #8217;s my fault this has happened since I was the one who started it but I know he is an adult and he should have denied my advances.</TEXT>

If you choose me I #8217;ll go more in depth on how to do it because I know words don #8217;t work but also if you want to do it still just ask. :)</TEXT>
