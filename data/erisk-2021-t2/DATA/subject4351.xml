But he #8217;s made it clear he hasn #8217;t and won #8217;t do that. At this point anyone voting trump has deep racial anger towards minorities, or they simply don #8217;t care and they like seeing the circus continue.

    <TEXT>Everyday I think about how screwed up our lives are all around the globe. I #8217;m not religious, so in my view we get one life and maybe if we #8217;re extremely lucky we might get something after (no guarantees I don #8217;t bs myself). Normal citizens are forced to go to a job they couldn #8217;t give two fucks about everyday. The most disturbing jobs are warehouse jobs like fedex and amazon. The work these people have to do everyday is basically slave labor. I know it #8217;s a choice, but I really do feel for these people. They deserve so much more. The company will give them some horseshit line about how they #8217;re a  #8220;team environment #8221;. Sure. The fat cats are billionaires and basically just sit on their ass all day while the employees are paid relatively nothing in comparison and they #8217;re cheated whenever possible. Some days I #8217;m just over it. I often think about walking into the woods and never coming back. I mean shit, at least you #8217;d have some freedom. But anyways, so many people are forced to just suffer and destroy their body day in and day out just to make the corporation more money. I #8217;m not gonna give a solution here, I don #8217;t have a great one. I just know something is seriously fucked up here. I shouldn #8217;t be thinking to myself very often that being dead is more worth it than continuing on in this horribly depressing world. I know it #8217;s probably better than Africa or Venezuela, but it #8217;s still pretty fucking bad to me. Unless you #8217;re lucky enough to find something you really enjoy doing, it will eat away at your soul everyday. Life wasn #8217;t meant to be this way.

    <TITLE>Joe Rogan is the new Howard Stern</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-04 07:26:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just had this connection in my mind. While not nearly as good as Stern in his glory days, Rogan is basically Howard #8217;s successor. He has a huge audience and he has signed a 100 million dollar deal with Spotify. He #8217;s now known as the podcast king basically. I preferred the old Stern show to Rogan any day but for my generation they really just see Howard as an old man that did shit a long time ago now. Howard should probably just call it quits in the next few years. He #8217;s had a great career and he deserves to live his life out in peace. I very rarely watch anything from the Stern show now because I honestly don #8217;t like it anymore. No hard feelings. It #8217;s to straight line, there #8217;s no fun anymore. I really liked Artie #8217;s dynamic on the show so I #8217;m probably a little biased.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Joe Rogan Experience is boring and isn #8217;t nearly as interesting as people say</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-10 04:58:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I find Joe to be an incredibly boring host. If you #8217;ve watched enough episodes you know he plays both sides nearly all the time (except when it comes to weed) and it #8217;s nearly impossible to nail down his true beliefs. He almost never has a bad thing to say about someone, which is good in a way but with him it comes off extremely fake. And his buddies are not interesting either. They #8217;re typical comedians that just bullshit for a couple hours. I #8217;m not sure how this podcast became so big, it #8217;s really just about as straight down the line as you can get. The most edgy thing that will happen is they #8217;ll occasionally smoke weed and drink. Even the interesting guests are forced to follow Rohan #8217;s down the middle style of interviewing. It #8217;s really never interesting even with someone like Elon Musk. Rogan is just a shit interviewer that #8217;s the main problem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bill Burr is not funny. He #8217;s basically a hack in my opinion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-13 20:54:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see bill burr as someone with a loud voice and a bombastic personality that overrides the fact that what he #8217;s saying isn #8217;t that funny. Someone like Louis CK or George Carlin could be funny as hell while being subtle. This is what puts them on another level. Burr can #8217;t pull that off. I #8217;ve watched all of his specials on Netflix and his appearances on Joe Rogan and it #8217;s basically that. He has to be loud and outrageous to be funny. Some people like that but there #8217;s very little to his act other than  #8220;look at me I #8217;m the drunk guy at the bar who isn #8217;t that smart and yells about everything #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s no good way to put this but here goes. My son, who is 16 years old and was a star athlete on his high school basketball team before covid is saying some very nasty things on his phone. He was sitting on the couch and I saw him typing into his phone and I quote  #8220;the fucking black dude deserves to be poor #8221; and posted it to some forum I #8217;m guessing. I have no idea what app he #8217;s using and I #8217;m pretty sure he didn #8217;t see me looking over his shoulder. So I decided to peek at his phone again the next day and the loading screen was just a yellow smiley face with a black background. Does anyone know what app he #8217;s going on and should I approach him?</TEXT>

If you want the cookie cutter middle class suburban life then yes go to college. If money isn #8217;t that important to you it #8217;s really not that necessary.

    <TITLE>Action/Superhero movies are the worst genre of film by far</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 02:49:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>These two specific genres I #8217;m going to attack because they #8217;re shit out every year and make a ton of money for almost zero creativity or realistic basis. I #8217;ve always personally despised how unrealistic these films are. When I #8217;m watching one I like counting the amount of times they #8217;d die in real life. And the emphasis on one person beating the shit out of everyone and destroying any obstacle in his path is not only impossible but narcissistic. Horror and psychological dramas for example can #8217;t rely on some dude just beating the fuck out of everyone and using special effects. They use true human drama and the dialogue really matters. I feel like you need a real story line with good horror films and dramas. I know some of those are lazy as well, but they #8217;re rarely as poorly made as action films. Most films require at least some personal depth of the character. Psychological dramas and films that could actually happen in real life appeal to me much more because they require creatively and good writing to keep the audience entertained.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s stupid how many people own a truck, especially in the south. People will complain about money problems yet they own a pickup truck that guzzles gas twice as fast as a Camry would. I think a lot of it is small dick syndrome but that doesn #8217;t make it any less dumb. If you #8217;re tight on money the last thing you should be driving is a lifted truck with a bunch of new shit attached to it. You really only need a truck if you #8217;re hauling shit on a regular basis but people that go to work at an office are the majority of truck owners nowadays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I moved to Mississippi in January of 2020. I originally lived in Reno, Nevada for a majority of my life. I came here to live with my mom (who is thankfully a good person). There #8217;s a huge difference between Mississippi and Nevada. The main one is a good majority of people here act like huge bitches and purposely try to intimidate you. I #8217;ve gotten my third job here because I #8217;m not used to such a strange work environment where everyone is trying to one up the other instead of working together. It #8217;s really strange. As an outsider I felt completely disrespected and even bullied at times. Living here has caused me to almost always have my guard up (especially at work) and develop much thicker skin. To be honest, I despise living here. I also despise a vast majority of the people I #8217;ve come across here. But for now I can #8217;t leave. I #8217;m saving up some money and investing it into the stock market so I #8217;ll eventually have some dough so I can go back to Nevada if I want to. Living here is the furthest thing from hospitality I #8217;ve ever experienced in my life. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend moving here. Much lower cost of living, but the average person here is awful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Living in an apartment complex beats living in the suburbs any day. I #8217;ve lived in both apartment complexes and suburbs so I can speak on this subject. Apartment complexes have a really cool vibe to them. You can almost always hear someone talking or playing music and you really never feel alone or shut off from society, even if you live alone. With cool roommates it #8217;s even better. Occasionally you may have a loud neighbor that stomps around but that #8217;s usually the extent of the annoyance. Suburbs are incredibly quiet and almost nothing is going on most of the time. And your neighbors usually aren #8217;t as outgoing or willing to do anything to stand out. In fact they #8217;re much more likely to call the cops on a minor inconvenience. People at apartments usually just mind their own business. The only pro is obviously a bigger area to live in and I guess a nicer part of town to live in. But you definitely lose that excitement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve seen people say the quote  #8220;you can #8217;t fix stupid #8221; a lot throughout my life. Well, it #8217;s actually possible to fix it. We hear turnaround stories all the time about how people turned their life into something when it used to be in shambles. And I think people are greatly influenced by the people they surround themselves with. If you begin to surround yourself around more mature and balanced individuals you will naturally learn self control and in turn become smarter.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Joe Rogan a right wing agent or just kind of dumb?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 10:31:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I asked myself a question yesterday regarding Joe Rogan. He plays both sides very well and will typically agree with the guest he #8217;s speaking to. He does have sanders type left wingers on along with clowns like Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, and others. I wonder if he just legitimately likes talking to people and holds no real opinions on anything or if he #8217;s trying to do a  #8220;slight of hand #8221; to brainwash his audience into thinking right wingers aren #8217;t bad. He also relocated to Texas because LA was getting too liberal for him he says. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-06 20:43:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>For a few years I was kind of  #8220;stuck #8221; in the left wing youtuber bubble. I #8217;m mainly referring to people like Kyle Kulinski, David Pakman, and a few others. These people present themselves as left wing but they really only tackle very small and meaningless issues. For example  #8220;holy shit trump said xy and z #8221;. Kulinski has even said he #8217;s still a capitalist at heart but wants socialist policies in place. These people are educated and I feel like they know way more than they let on. I think a majority of their audience legitimately thinks the only problem in the world is American right wingers and corporate democrats. A majority of the audience also sees Bernie sanders as some sort of savior. They never mention communism or even encourage you to research it yourself. They #8217;re mainly focused on promoting the American liberal agenda in my opinion. A majority of them also encourage their viewers to vote Biden to stop Trump. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-07 20:22:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bill Burr isn #8217;t funny anymore I think you can make argument old bill burr was great. But the last few years his podcasts and specials have just sucked. He just talks about what #8217;s going on in the world and yells about it. Pretty much anyone can do that and it just isn #8217;t funny anymore. Women bad hasn #8217;t been funny in like 5 years. Come up with some new material please. He does this podcast with Bert Kreischer where they just sit around smoking overly large cigars. It #8217;s just cringe man. Also, he seems to get bitchy way too easily and when he #8217;s got a special he #8217;ll go on another dude #8217;s podcast just to promote it. He even made Ethan Klein read a script and show a preview of it. Then he went on Theo Von #8217;s podcast and stopped mid conversation to say  #8220;at any point can I promote my special? #8221; 5 minutes into the podcast. He was also just an asshole throughout that podcast, he pretty much berated him for not wanting to sellout. This ain #8217;t the same dude anymore. Plus he still goes around pretending to be a blue collar dude. Nah man. You #8217;re rich as fuck drop the act. And yes, I think his wife is probably making him less funny.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve read a bit on the differences between socialism and communism. From what I can understand socialism is not as far left as communism and that it is willing to make more concessions to capitalism in order to make change. For example they may want universal healthcare, free college etc but not necessarily an entirely new system of government like communism. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-14 12:28:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hope to see more tests of this car in the future. I like the addition of sequential transmission and the technological improvement of using spec chassis because it will put the driver closer to the center of the car, which will even further improve safety. The sound of the next gen is also cool and I #8217;m curious to what 35+ of these cars would sound like on the track at Bristol or Daytona. The exhaust pipes coming out of the side of the car are also a cool look along with the overall sleeker and less boxy design. I like the push back towards a more aerodynamic car, it sort of reminds me of the gen 4 car but it #8217;s not quite to that level, however it #8217;s still a very nice improvement over what we have now. I #8217;m a little bummed it #8217;s not debuting until 2022 but I think it will be a change many fans are looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m pretty sick of sports announcers acting like they know everything, especially when they never even participated in the sport they are commentating on. I give former players a bit more of a pass but they #8217;re guilty too. If someone is performing bad they #8217;ll suddenly go into coaching mode and say every problem the dude has and how he could #8217;ve done a play better. The worst is when they disagree with a play call and they then say  #8220;why didn #8217;t they run ... #8221;. To me it #8217;s super arrogant for some guy in a suit and tie to be bitching about performance by athletes that are working their asses off. It #8217;s getting rarer but there are still a few good ones. They just call the game like they #8217;re supposed to without inserting their dumbass opinions/biases.</TEXT>
