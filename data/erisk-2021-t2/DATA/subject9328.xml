    <TITLE>A subreddit to share my short story for the fun of it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-10 08:04:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I love writing, but I am in no way a serious writer or making any money from it. I recently finished my first short story in english and wanted to share it to the world, since maybe some people enjoy a short read. However I seem to struggle to find a subreddit where it would be appropriate to post the story, as all writing related subreddits seem to have the rule to not actually post any finished stories in there or are meant for serious, commercial writers. I would highly appreciate, if someone could recommend me a subreddit, where I can share my story (and future stories) simply for the fun of it. Thank you in advance! =)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Disclaimer: English is not my native language, therefore you will likely find grammatical errors and even spelling mistakes in the story. I am also no professional writer, therefore don't expect a masterpiece of written art. I write and share stories for fun and since my friends liked this one, I thought I could share it for some other people to enjoy. That said, I should probably also mention, that the story has a quite scary atmosphere and is therefore not suitable to be used as a goodnight lecture for your kids. Feedback on the story is appreciated as long as it is constructive. Enjoy! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The light flickered when the huge man entered the room. His huge silhouette left the shadows casted by the few lights in the control room and I could see it clearly: The brown beard, the scars on his cheek and his deep blue eyes, cold like the arctic winter.  #8220;Here is your coffee Mark #8221; he said and put down a huge cup filled with a dark brown substance, which smelled and tasted like toilet water but at least managed to keep me awake.  #8220;Thank you Dimitri #8221;, I answered, as I lifted the cup and took a long sip from the horrible drink. I frowned for a moment, when the horrible taste twisted my tongue, but then I smiled and took another sip.  #8220;I still don #8217;t understand why you Americans love this shit. #8221; Dimitri took out his flask and took a sip. I could smell the vodka through the whole control room. I should have told him to not drink during duty, but I really didn #8217;t care at all. We both had spent too many nights in this control room, guarding god-knows-what. I took another sip of the terrible coffee and almost spilled it all over the place, when suddenly one of the control lights started blinking and an alarm started. I quickly ran a system diagnosis while Dimitri looked over my shoulder.  #8220;What is it Mark? Another one of these sensors going rogue? #8221;  #8220;Unfortunately not, the system reports a problem with the door-lock of door 34b. We will have to go and check this. #8221; I gave him an apologizing smile; we both weren #8217;t keen on heading all the way down to the door to replace something that was likely just a rusty lock. Another unfortunate thing was the fact, that one person had to stay at the control room at any time. Means one of us had to make all the way down alone, which I always believed to be at least slightly creepy. I looked at Dimitri, who had found a coin in the pockets of his coat.  #8220;Head or tails? #8221;, he asked.  #8220;Tails #8221;, I said, watching the coin rotate in the air. Dimitri caught it with a swift move of his giant arm.  #8220;Head #8221;, he said and smiled. I cursed my luck as I headed down to the giant elevator.  #8220;Test, 1,2,3 #8221;, that was Dimitri through my headphone.  #8220;I can hear you, Dimitri #8221;, I answered.  #8220;Roger Mark. Let #8217;s check this quick and come back soon. #8221;  #8220;Will do Dimitri, will do #8221; The elevator was a relict from another time, when our facility was still in use and hundreds of people worked here every day. Scientists, engineers, guards and the unavoidable charwomen. Around twenty people were able to be in this elevator at once. Now it was only me, alone in an oversized cabin with only a small emergency light on the wall. Most of the facilities power had been cut and we were running on low energy mode. I selected the lowest floor and waited until the elevator stopped. Once its doors opened, the emergency lights in the long corridor in front of me turned on. The walls and floor were white but appeared grey under the influence of the slim light. Door 34b was at the middle of the corridor, to the right. I headed there and pushed down the pawl, expecting the door to remain closed. To my surprise it didn #8217;t. Instead it opened up and I saw a huge, empty, white room. Well, it would have been empty, if it wasn #8217;t for the broken tank in the middle of the room. Broken glass and a strange greenish liquid were spread all over the place. I didn #8217;t dare to come too close, maybe the liquid was radioactive of some sort? I am just an ordinary security guard and therefore I had no idea what kind of experiments the scientists attempted in the facility back when it was still running. But anyways, I didn #8217;t get paid to ask questions. Probably the tank just exploded due to high pressure, built up over time. I checked the door. To my surprise I found the lock completely intact. Whatever had happened with the tank, it must have had somehow unlocked the door, like with a key. I scratched my head.  #8220;What is going on down there Mark? Have you found the rusty lock? #8221; Dimitri pulled me out of my thoughts.  #8220;Some kind of tank exploded and the door got unlocked. Pretty strange, if you ask me. I will just lock it again, I guess. #8221;, I explained.  #8220;What kind of tank? #8221;, Dimitri asked, seemingly worried.  #8220;I don #8217;t know, some kind of glass tank with a green liquid in it? Why do you ask, is it radioactive? #8221;  #8220;Mark, forget about the door and come back here immediately. #8221; Now Dimitri sounded even more worried, almost afraid. I frowned. Whatever scared Dimitri had to be some kind of extremely toxic liquid.  #8220;Oh my god, is it toxic? #8221; I asked quickly.  #8220;Worse #8221; Dimitri replied.  #8220;Worse!? Radioactive? #8221;  #8220;No time to explain, just come back here for fucks sake! #8221; Now Dimitri was seemingly afraid. I decided to follow his orders, opened the door and headed out to the corridor, just to find it completely dark.  #8220;Dimitri, the light is off. Can you turn it on again? #8221; I heard something, that sounded like Russian swearing, then the full lights turned on. I was disoriented for a moment, flashed by the sudden amount of bright light.  #8220;Argh! #8221;, I shouted, blinking my eyes in the hope to normalize my vision. As it became normal again I suddenly noticed a movement. Something just went into the elevator!  #8220;Dimitri, there is an intruder! He is coming for you! #8221; I said, then I drew my pistol and headed towards the elevator. A short silence in my headphone, then Dimitri #8217;s voice:  #8220;I am sorry Mark. #8221; The corridor suddenly turned all dark again. I cursed.  #8220;Dimitri, what the fuck are you doing? #8221;  #8220;Mark, I am sorry. I will have to lock down the facility. #8221;  #8220;Dimitri, tell me what is happening, right now, or I swear to god I will kick your giant ass to the moon the next time I see you! #8221; No response. I cursed again, then I took out my flashlight and turned it on. The light casted creepy shadows at the walls. I checked the elevator. Due to the lack of power I wouldn #8217;t be able to call it. And only god knew what went through Dimitri #8217;s head at the moment. I sat down for a moment, thinking. An intruder, a strangely worried Dimitri and a green fluid, that had potentially already poisoned me. And also no way out of here. Or was there? I stood up.  #8220;Mark, you are genius! #8221; I facepalmed. Of course, the ventilation system! I could simply use my facility plan, get to the next vent and crawl through the ventilation system to the emergency stairs! I went to the other end of the corridor and used my screwdriver to open the vent when I suddenly heard a huge crash. It sounded like something very heavy had just hit a huge metal plate. I quickly turned around and put my flashlight towards the elevator. I gasped in shock: The elevator doors were bent, like some kind of giant fist hit them from inside. Did the intruder throw a grenade? I decided to not think too long about this and continued to loosen the final screw of the vent cover. Just as I finished, I heard another huge crash. I didn #8217;t look back, I entered the vent, crawled to the vertical vent and took the flashlight between my teeth. Then I started to climb the ladder, step by step. Suddenly I heard the noise of footsteps on metal. The intruder had entered the ventilation system! The flashlight between my teeth wasn #8217;t really able to light my way, so I had to rely on my other senses to feel the ladder and climb further and further. The rungs became more slippery the further up I went. Some water had probably found its way down into the ventilation system due to lack of maintenance. I was forced to climb slower and slower, always afraid of missing a rung in the darkness and fall all the way down to the dark heart of the earth. The noise of steps on metal had stopped a while ago, the intruder had probably also discovered the ladder and started to climb. I started to sweat, from the long climb and from the idea, that a crazy intruder with grenades was following me on the ladder without me being able to even see him. The sweat ran into my eyes and I had to resist the urge to raise my hands and rub my eyes clean. I couldn #8217;t afford to stop, maybe the intruder was right below me already? Suddenly my hand grabbed into nothing and I almost slipped and fell into the deep. Was a rung missing? I raised my hand, searching for the wall, but there was none. I reached the end of the ladder! Quickly I pulled myself over the edge and started to crawl into a random direction. There was no way I could figure out where I was in this darkness and with an intruder following me. At least I could use my flashlight now, searching the vent walls for a way out. Suddenly I heard to noise of steps on metal again. The intruder was closer than I thought! I crawled faster, always expecting the intruder to catch up. I was probably easy to spot, since I was using my flashlight all the time. Should I draw my pistol and just shoot into the darkness? I considered the option for a moment, but then I figured, that it would be far easier for me to leave the vent and then shoot at the intruder as he would leave it. Suddenly I felt a cold breath in my neck. I screamed in shock, then I rolled on my back and drew my pistol  #8211; just to discover, that it wasn #8217;t breath but rather fresh air: I had reached a hatch and (I couldn #8217;t believe my luck) it was open! I quickly rolled through the vent and got back to my feet. The corridor was dark, but I didn #8217;t care. I drew my pistol, got into position and pointed it to the vent, listening to the noises, which came closer and closer. A hand reached to the opening of the vent, then a head followed. I gasped  #8211; this head don #8217;t look like the head of a human at all. For a moment I was too shocked to react, a moment, that I should have used. Because the *thing* spotted me with something, that were probably his eyes, let out an indescribable mixture of howl and scream, launched itself from the vent and jumped at me. I fired the full magazine of my pistol, but either I didn #8217;t hit or the monster was immune to bullets. It hit me with full force and launched me through half the corridor. I slid through several meters until I stopped, gasping for air. My whole chest hurt like it got hit by a hammer and I saw small sparks dancing before my eyes. I had lost my flashlight half the way and it casted the shadow of a human sized being at the wall. The monster took a step closer and the light revealed it to me in all details. The monster was about the size of a human, but its head was oversized compared to the body, its green eyes strangely oversized and its mouth filled with sharp teeth. Its hands were equipped with claws and its whole body was covered in slime and muscles. All these details got burned into my brain while the monster approached me, slowly, waiting for an opportunity to strike. I suddenly remembered my pistol, raised my arm and pulled the trigger. *Click. Click. Click*. The magazine was empty. I started to crawl backwards and the monster increased its speed. I jumped to my feet and turned around, started to run. The monster howled, then I heard its step, strong and fast, following me in my useless attempt to escape. I reached the end of the corridor, where I saw a door, that I knew just too well. The control room was close! I reached the door to the control room, the monster was only a few steps behind me. I pushed it and  #8211; it remained closed.  #8220;Dimitri you motherfucker! Open the fucking door! #8221; I slammed my fists against the door, angry and frustrated. Then I turned around and looked right into the eyes of the monster. I saw all the details of its huge eyes, I smelled the putrid smell of its body, heard its heavy but slow breath. The monster came closer and closer to my face. Then it raised its claws and slightly touched my forehead. I started to shiver as I felt some kind of energy flowing through my whole body from the tip of the claw. Then I suddenly fell backwards, as the door behind me suddenly opened.  #8220;Not this time #8221; Dimitri! Never in my life had I ever been so happy to see these cold blue eyes. Dimitri stood at the door, a shotgun pointed to the head of the monster. Then he pulled the trigger and the full load his the monster, blowing its left eye straight out of its head. But Dimitri didn #8217;t stop. He pulled the trigger again, then reloaded and continued to shoot at the dead monster. Finally I grabbed his arm from below:  #8220;It is dead Dimitri. We are save now. #8221; He looked at me for a moment, then he shook his head.  #8220;We aren #8217;t. Not until we destroy its whole body. #8221; Then he reloaded and blew another load into the dead mass. I grabbed his arm again, stronger this time.  #8220;This leads nowhere. If you are really that afraid of it, then we should just burn it. #8221; Dimitri looked at me, then he smiled.  #8220;You always were the smarter one #8221; he said, then he lowered the shotgun, gave me a hand and pulled me back to my feet. Then he went back into the control room, just to return with a gas can. He spilled the gas all over the monster, which already started to regrow parts of its head, then he took out his lighter, flipped it and threw it on the smelly mess. The gas instantly lit up and we watched the whole thing turning into charred coal. After we were sure, that it was gun, Dimitri took out his flask, emptied it, then look at me, pulled out another flask and handed it to me. I gladly took it and started to drink. The vodka burnt my throat and I started to feel warm all over my body. After a short while, I regained my confidence.  #8220;What in the devils name was this thing? #8221; I asked. Dimitri shook his head and for a moment I feared he would remain silent. But then he started to talk, slowly and quietly:  #8220;During the cold war, the government wanted to create the perfect weapon. A superhuman, superior to all soldiers on the battlefield. Immune to acid, bullets and radiation. More intelligent than even the greatest human minds. They wanted to create nothing less than a human god, expecting it to follow their commands. And indeed they succeeded. They created a being, that was almost immortal and stronger than any human being. But it lacked intelligence. It was a mere beast, killing everyone, who attempted to tame it. I thought they killed all of the subjects, when they left this facility, but they must have overlooked a part of one of them, which eventually regrew to full size and started to break free from its prison. #8221;  #8220;So you are saying we just killed a #8230;*god*? #8221; I must have looked more than just slightly puzzled, because Dimitri started to laugh.  #8220;Not a god, Mark, a monster. A scientific abomination. And it is dead now, gone once and for all #8221;  #8220;Are you sure? What if it regrows? #8221; Dimitri shook his head.  #8220;We burned it. It is gone. Forever. #8221; We both quit our job at the facility and got paid a huge amount of money to keep our mouths shut. Seven years passed since this fateful night and I am living a happy life with my family. There is just one thing that still bothers me, at night, when I dream. It is the moment, when the monster slightly touched my head and I could feel its presence, like pure energy. And I still ask myself, why the best didn #8217;t just kill me. Did we truly kill a monster this night?</TEXT>

Dimitri stood at the door, a shotgun pointed to the head of the monster. Then he pulled the trigger and the full load his the monster, blowing its left eye straight out of its head. But Dimitri didn #8217;t stop. He pulled the trigger again, then reloaded and continued to shoot at the dead monster. Finally I grabbed his arm from below:  #8220;It is dead Dimitri. We are save now. #8221; He looked at me for a moment, then he shook his head.  #8220;We aren #8217;t. Not until we destroy its whole body. #8221; Then he reloaded and blew another load into the dead mass. I grabbed his arm again, stronger this time.  #8220;This leads nowhere. If you are really that afraid of it, then we should just burn it. #8221; Dimitri looked at me, then he smiled.  #8220;You always were the smarter one #8221; he said, then he lowered the shotgun, gave me a hand and pulled me back to my feet. Then he went back into the control room, just to return with a gas can. He spilled the gas all over the monster, which already started to regrow parts of its head, then he took out his lighter, flipped it and threw it on the smelly mess. The gas instantly lit up and we watched the whole thing turning into charred coal. After we were sure, that it was gun, Dimitri took out his flask, emptied it, then look at me, pulled out another flask and handed it to me. I gladly took it and started to drink. The vodka burnt my throat and I started to feel warm all over my body. After a short while, I regained my confidence.  #8220;What in the devils name was this thing? #8221; I asked. Dimitri shook his head and for a moment I feared he would remain silent. But then he started to talk, slowly and quietly:  #8220;During the cold war, the government wanted to create the perfect weapon. A superhuman, superior to all soldiers on the battlefield. Immune to acid, bullets and radiation. More intelligent than even the greatest human minds. They wanted to create nothing less than a human god, expecting it to follow their commands. And indeed they succeeded. They created a being, that was almost immortal and stronger than any human being. But it lacked intelligence. It was a mere beast, killing everyone, who attempted to tame it. I thought they killed all of the subjects, when they left this facility, but they must have overlooked a part of one of them, which eventually regrew to full size and started to break free from its prison. #8221;  #8220;So you are saying we just killed a #8230;*god*? #8221; I must have looked more than just slightly puzzled, because Dimitri started to laugh.  #8220;Not a god, Mark, a monster. A scientific abomination. And it is dead now, gone once and for all #8221;  #8220;Are you sure? What if it regrows? #8221; Dimitri shook his head.  #8220;We burned it. It is gone. Forever. #8221; We both quit our job at the facility and got paid a huge amount of money to keep our mouths shut. Seven years passed since this fateful night and I am living a happy life with my family. There is just one thing that still bothers me, at night, when I dream. It is the moment, when the monster slightly touched my head and I could feel its presence, like pure energy. And I still ask myself, why the best didn #8217;t just kill me. Did we truly kill a monster this night?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>GM needs advice on balancing combat encounters</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-29 17:36:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys! First things first: I recently created a new PnP system for my group since all players are new to the game and therefore I wanted to create something that's easier to learn than the traditional systems (also gave me the chance to finally make the idea for the world I had in my head come true). We already had our first session and everyone had a lot of fun. Now to the point where I need help: I have zero clue on how to properly balance a fight with the new system. When playing DnD or TBE, I could usually just use monsters or NPCs who were already included in an adventure and just change them slightly to fit the setting. But with the new system, I can't take anything existing and slightly change it, I have to create the encounters from scratch. Now some may say: "Why not just experiment a bit?" Well, I don't want the first fight of the new group end with a TPK, but I also don't want it to be ludicrously easy. So my question to the experienced GMs out there: Are there any tricks on how to balance encounters? How would you approach this situation? Are there any general advices you can give me in regards of balancing combat encounters?  #8203; TL;DR: Created new PnP system, have no idea how to balance combat, need help</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Getting threatened by raiders</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-15 18:44:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I'm the owner of a pretty active gaming guild server and naturally this provokes all kind of trolls and raiders to try and cause trouble. Normally we prevent this by doing an entrance test with potential new members on a seperated server. However apparently someone slipped through and we don't know who it is. We luckily got to witness a conversation, where the raiders were talking about an alt account they have on the server and how they would be able to "delete the server" (I supposed they mean delete all channels). However noone besides the mod team and the bots has any perms that would actually allow for this. Do you guys have any idea on how to prevent this? I put two years of work into this server and don't want it to get destroyed this way. I am truely desperate. PS: Discord support is aware and the main accounts of the raiders got banned, however they still have the alt account in the server.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I need to tell someone. It sounds crazy, but believe me, it's real!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-27 20:16:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>All of this happened seven years ago. They paid me to keep my mouth shut, but I can't stand it any longer. I need to tell you, tell anyone. Not even my wife knows what happened back then. She wouldn't believe me.  #8203; It all started with a boring shift in the facility.  #8203; The light flickered when the huge man entered the room. His huge silhouette left the shadows casted by the few lights in the control room and I could see it clearly: The brown beard, the scars on his cheek and his deep blue eyes, cold like the arctic winter.  #8220;Here is your coffee Mark #8221; he said and put down a huge cup filled with a dark brown substance, which smelled and tasted like toilet water but at least managed to keep me awake.  #8220;Thank you Dimitri #8221;, I answered, as I lifted the cup and took a long sip from the horrible drink. I frowned for a moment, when the horrible taste twisted my tongue, but then I smiled and took another sip.  #8220;I still don #8217;t understand why you Americans love this shit. #8221; Dimitri took out his flask and took a sip. I could smell the vodka through the whole control room. I should have told him to not drink during duty, but I really didn #8217;t care at all. We both had spent too many nights in this control room, guarding god-knows-what. I took another sip of the terrible coffee and almost spilled it all over the place, when suddenly one of the control lights started blinking and an alarm started. I quickly ran a system diagnosis while Dimitri looked over my shoulder.  #8220;What is it Mark? Another one of these sensors going rogue? #8221;  #8220;Unfortunately not, the system reports a problem with the door-lock of door 34b. We will have to go and check this. #8221; I gave him an apologizing smile; we both weren #8217;t keen on heading all the way down to the door to replace something that was likely just a rusty lock. Another unfortunate thing was the fact, that one person had to stay at the control room at any time. Means one of us had to make all the way down alone, which I always believed to be at least slightly creepy. I looked at Dimitri, who had found a coin in the pockets of his coat.  #8220;Head or tails? #8221;, he asked.  #8220;Tails #8221;, I said, watching the coin rotate in the air. Dimitri caught it with a swift move of his giant arm.  #8220;Head #8221;, he said and smiled. I cursed my luck as I headed down to the giant elevator.  #8220;Test, 1,2,3 #8221;, that was Dimitri through my headphone.  #8220;I can hear you, Dimitri #8221;, I answered.  #8220;Roger Mark. Let #8217;s check this quick and come back soon. #8221;  #8220;Will do Dimitri, will do #8221; The elevator was a relict from another time, when our facility was still in use and hundreds of people worked here every day. Scientists, engineers, guards and the unavoidable charwomen. Around twenty people were able to be in this elevator at once. Now it was only me, alone in an oversized cabin with only a small emergency light on the wall. Most of the facilities power had been cut and we were running on low energy mode. I selected the lowest floor and waited until the elevator stopped. Once its doors opened, the emergency lights in the long corridor in front of me turned on. The walls and floor were white but appeared grey under the influence of the slim light. Door 34b was at the middle of the corridor, to the right. I headed there and pushed down the pawl, expecting the door to remain closed. To my surprise it didn #8217;t. Instead it opened up and I saw a huge, empty, white room. Well, it would have been empty, if it wasn #8217;t for the broken tank in the middle of the room. Broken glass and a strange greenish liquid were spread all over the place. I didn #8217;t dare to come too close, maybe the liquid was radioactive of some sort? I am just an ordinary security guard and therefore I had no idea what kind of experiments the scientists attempted in the facility back when it was still running. But anyways, I didn #8217;t get paid to ask questions. Probably the tank just exploded due to high pressure, built up over time. I checked the door. To my surprise I found the lock completely intact. Whatever had happened with the tank, it must have had somehow unlocked the door, like with a key. I scratched my head.  #8220;What is going on down there Mark? Have you found the rusty lock? #8221; Dimitri pulled me out of my thoughts.  #8220;Some kind of tank exploded and the door got unlocked. Pretty strange, if you ask me. I will just lock it again, I guess. #8221;, I explained.  #8220;What kind of tank? #8221;, Dimitri asked, seemingly worried.  #8220;I don #8217;t know, some kind of glass tank with a green liquid in it? Why do you ask, is it radioactive? #8221;  #8220;Mark, forget about the door and come back here immediately. #8221; Now Dimitri sounded even more worried, almost afraid. I frowned. Whatever scared Dimitri had to be some kind of extremely toxic liquid.  #8220;Oh my god, is it toxic? #8221; I asked quickly.  #8220;Worse #8221; Dimitri replied.  #8220;Worse!? Radioactive? #8221;  #8220;No time to explain, just come back here for fucks sake! #8221; Now Dimitri was seemingly afraid. I decided to follow his orders, opened the door and headed out to the corridor, just to find it completely dark.  #8220;Dimitri, the light is off. Can you turn it on again? #8221; I heard something, that sounded like Russian swearing, then the full lights turned on. I was disoriented for a moment, flashed by the sudden amount of bright light.  #8220;Argh! #8221;, I shouted, blinking my eyes in the hope to normalize my vision. As it became normal again I suddenly noticed a movement. Something just went into the elevator!  #8220;Dimitri, there is an intruder! He is coming for you! #8221; I said, then I drew my pistol and headed towards the elevator. A short silence in my headphone, then Dimitri #8217;s voice:  #8220;I am sorry Mark. #8221; The corridor suddenly turned all dark again. I cursed.  #8220;Dimitri, what the fuck are you doing? #8221;  #8220;Mark, I am sorry. I will have to lock down the facility. #8221;  #8220;Dimitri, tell me what is happening, right now, or I swear to god I will kick your giant ass to the moon the next time I see you! #8221; No response. I cursed again, then I took out my flashlight and turned it on. The light casted creepy shadows at the walls. I checked the elevator. Due to the lack of power I wouldn #8217;t be able to call it. And only god knew what went through Dimitri #8217;s head at the moment. I sat down for a moment, thinking. An intruder, a strangely worried Dimitri and a green fluid, that had potentially already poisoned me. And also no way out of here. Or was there? I stood up.  #8220;Mark, you are genius! #8221; I facepalmed. Of course, the ventilation system! I could simply use my facility plan, get to the next vent and crawl through the ventilation system to the emergency stairs! I went to the other end of the corridor and used my screwdriver to open the vent when I suddenly heard a huge crash. It sounded like something very heavy had just hit a huge metal plate. I quickly turned around and put my flashlight towards the elevator. I gasped in shock: The elevator doors were bent, like some kind of giant fist hit them from inside. Did the intruder throw a grenade? I decided to not think too long about this and continued to loosen the final screw of the vent cover. Just as I finished, I heard another huge crash. I didn #8217;t look back, I entered the vent, crawled to the vertical vent and took the flashlight between my teeth. Then I started to climb the ladder, step by step. Suddenly I heard the noise of footsteps on metal. The intruder had entered the ventilation system! The flashlight between my teeth wasn #8217;t really able to light my way, so I had to rely on my other senses to feel the ladder and climb further and further. The rungs became more slippery the further up I went. Some water had probably found its way down into the ventilation system due to lack of maintenance. I was forced to climb slower and slower, always afraid of missing a rung in the darkness and fall all the way down to the dark heart of the earth. The noise of steps on metal had stopped a while ago, the intruder had probably also discovered the ladder and started to climb. I started to sweat, from the long climb and from the idea, that a crazy intruder with grenades was following me on the ladder without me being able to even see him. The sweat ran into my eyes and I had to resist the urge to raise my hands and rub my eyes clean. I couldn #8217;t afford to stop, maybe the intruder was right below me already? Suddenly my hand grabbed into nothing and I almost slipped and fell into the deep. Was a rung missing? I raised my hand, searching for the wall, but there was none. I reached the end of the ladder! Quickly I pulled myself over the edge and started to crawl into a random direction. There was no way I could figure out where I was in this darkness and with an intruder following me. At least I could use my flashlight now, searching the vent walls for a way out. Suddenly I heard to noise of steps on metal again. The intruder was closer than I thought! I crawled faster, always expecting the intruder to catch up. I was probably easy to spot, since I was using my flashlight all the time. Should I draw my pistol and just shoot into the darkness? I considered the option for a moment, but then I figured, that it would be far easier for me to leave the vent and then shoot at the intruder as he would leave it. Suddenly I felt a cold breath in my neck. I screamed in shock, then I rolled on my back and drew my pistol  #8211; just to discover, that it wasn #8217;t breath but rather fresh air: I had reached a hatch and (I couldn #8217;t believe my luck) it was open! I quickly rolled through the vent and got back to my feet. The corridor was dark, but I didn #8217;t care. I drew my pistol, got into position and pointed it to the vent, listening to the noises, which came closer and closer. A hand reached to the opening of the vent, then a head followed. I gasped  #8211; this head don #8217;t look like the head of a human at all. For a moment I was too shocked to react, a moment, that I should have used. Because the *thing* spotted me with something, that were probably his eyes, let out an indescribable mixture of howl and scream, launched itself from the vent and jumped at me. I fired the full magazine of my pistol, but either I didn #8217;t hit or the monster was immune to bullets. It hit me with full force and launched me through half the corridor. I slid through several meters until I stopped, gasping for air. My whole chest hurt like it got hit by a hammer and I saw small sparks dancing before my eyes. I had lost my flashlight half the way and it casted the shadow of a human sized being at the wall. The monster took a step closer and the light revealed it to me in all details. The monster was about the size of a human, but its head was oversized compared to the body, its green eyes strangely oversized and its mouth filled with sharp teeth. Its hands were equipped with claws and its whole body was covered in slime and muscles. All these details got burned into my brain while the monster approached me, slowly, waiting for an opportunity to strike. I suddenly remembered my pistol, raised my arm and pulled the trigger. *Click. Click. Click*. The magazine was empty. I started to crawl backwards and the monster increased its speed. I jumped to my feet and turned around, started to run. The monster howled, then I heard its step, strong and fast, following me in my useless attempt to escape. I reached the end of the corridor, where I saw a door, that I knew just too well. The control room was close! I reached the door to the control room, the monster was only a few steps behind me. I pushed it and  #8211; it remained closed.  #8220;Dimitri you motherfucker! Open the fucking door! #8221; I slammed my fists against the door, angry and frustrated. Then I turned around and looked right into the eyes of the monster. I saw all the details of its huge eyes, I smelled the putrid smell of its body, heard its heavy but slow breath. The monster came closer and closer to my face. Then it raised its claws and slightly touched my forehead. I started to shiver as I felt some kind of energy flowing through my whole body from the tip of the claw. Then I suddenly fell backwards, as the door behind me suddenly opened.  #8220;Not this time #8221; Dimitri! Never in my life had I ever been so happy to see these cold blue eyes. Dimitri stood at the door, a shotgun pointed to the head of the monster. Then he pulled the trigger and the full load his the monster, blowing its left eye straight out of its head. But Dimitri didn #8217;t stop. He pulled the trigger again, then reloaded and continued to shoot at the dead monster. Finally I grabbed his arm from below:  #8220;It is dead Dimitri. We are save now. #8221; He looked at me for a moment, then he shook his head.  #8220;We aren #8217;t. Not until we destroy its whole body. #8221; Then he reloaded and blew another load into the dead mass. I grabbed his arm again, stronger this time.  #8220;This leads nowhere. If you are really that afraid of it, then we should just burn it. #8221; Dimitri looked at me, then he smiled.  #8220;You always were the smarter one #8221; he said, then he lowered the shotgun, gave me a hand and pulled me back to my feet. Then he went back into the control room, just to return with a gas can. He spilled the gas all over the monster, which already started to regrow parts of its head, then he took out his lighter, flipped it and threw it on the smelly mess. The gas instantly lit up and we watched the whole thing turning into charred coal. After we were sure, that it was gun, Dimitri took out his flask, emptied it, then look at me, pulled out another flask and handed it to me. I gladly took it and started to drink. The vodka burnt my throat and I started to feel warm all over my body. After a short while, I regained my confidence.  #8220;What in the devils name was this thing? #8221; I asked.

    <DATE>2018-12-25 17:13:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Many people tend to overthink their actions a lot. "Can I do it?", "What if I fail?", "How will people react to what I do?", "Will I regret it?". Ofc you can do this your whole life, but then you will end up realizing, that you have never truely lived. You can always ask yourself, if something is too hard to do, if you should even try, if you are doing it the right way. But then you won't find true happiness in your life. Don't focus on the consequences of your actions, don't be afraid of trying. If you try it and fail, then at least you tried and know, that this way won't work, so you can maybe find another one. If you always doubt yourself and feel insecure, if you are dong the right thing, then remind yourself, that noone is able to live a perfect life without mistakes. Mistakes are nothing one can avoid when living their life. Mistakes are things that build our character, that help us to improve and that make us feel alive. One day you might look back to your life and remember all the things you did and did not do. And you will end up regretting the things you didn't do the most. Because "What if?". So don't always overthink, just try it. Jump into the cold water and learn to swim. And you will find, that true happiness lies hidden behind hundreds of mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When driving home at night, I noticed a car at the side of the road close to my home village. I stopped and asked, if the driver needed any help. The driver turned out to be a foreigner, who asked me, if I was there to "buy car". I noped out of there real quick and drove off. Still not sure, if someone legit met there to sell his car or if he was trying to scam me/sell a stolen vehicle. Definitely made me more cautious when driving at night though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I achieved in life has always been either me helping myself or my friends helping me out. If someone I care about struggled, then I was the one helping them. Where was "god" then? If god is all-loving and all-caring, then why does he let people suffer to the point they commit suicide? Why does he allow for a child to be abused and traumatized? Why does he allow for people to turn sick and lose it all, when they never did anything wrong? I used to be a very religious person, heck I could quote passages from the bible, because I read it multiple times. But as I turned older, I eventually saw so much shit and so many people suffering, that I came to my own conclusion about god and turned an atheist. I admire people, who can find strength in their beliefs, but for me the whole religion is just a shallow reflection of our hopes, that someone out there cares about us.</TEXT>

I get, that people are upset with the Dany issue, but as someone who knows what sudden rage can do with a person, I actually was able to understand her and her motivations. I understand, that it was hard to understand, if you never experienced blind rage yourself or had someone close to you experience it, but I still believe, that the most controversial element of the show wasn't as bad as everyone believed it to be. Was the ending a bit rushed? Yes. But was it bad? I don't think so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do think, that her life hurt her a lot. She lost pretty much everyone, even her own brother just saw her as a mean to an end. She was basically "sold" and then raped. I doubt, that anyone would remain completely sane after such a treatment and she even had some sort of genetic disposition towards madness. Whenever she felt like she was treated wrongly or in danger, she simply slaughtered and burned those, who opposed her. Oc the viewer cheers for her, because she was killing the "bad guys", but they fail to realize, that for her, the people of kings landing ultimately were "bad guys" too the moment they followed Cersei. That's how the black/white world view of Dany works and always worked throughout the series and her decending to madness and ultimately giving in to her rage, to "release the dragon" was only a matter of time. Yes, it could have been done in a more understandable way for the average viewer, but I don't think it was completely out of the blue.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-11 06:49:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I got a problem. Ater every new windows update, windows installs an even worse version of the touch keyboard. This version features: \- ugly white colour \- even smaller keyboard size \- The inability to hold down del and delete several letters at once \- An autocorrect feature, that can't be turned off in the settings anymore (like srsly?)  #8203; So what I normally do, is to copy my old version of TabTip.exe and tipskins.dll over the new ones and I can use the old and well working keyboard without issues. However this fix suddenly doesn't appear to work anymore. When I vopied them this time, the old TabTip.exe didn't run and I wasn't able to use the Touch Keyboard until I restored my backup of the new version. Does anyone have any idea how to restore the old version? Do I maybe have to change something about the files to get them to work or do I have to restore/delete additional files?</TEXT>

This version features: \- ugly white colour \- even smaller keyboard size \- The inability to hold down del and delete several letters at once \- An autocorrect feature, that can't be turned off in the settings anymore (like srsly?)  #8203; So what I normally do, is to copy my okd version of TabTip.exe and tipskins.dll over the new ones and I can use the old and well working keyboard without issues. However this fix suddenly doesn't appear to work anymore. When I vopied them this time, the old TabTip.exe didn't run and I wasn't able to use the Touch Keyboard until I restored my backup of the new version. Does anyone have any idea how to reatore the old version? Do I maybe have to change something about the files to get them to work or do I have to restore/delete additional files?</TEXT>

Maybe he has kids waiting for him at home or a little kitten? Noone should have the power to decide about life and death and if you have it, then it should never be taken lightly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try and take long walks away from people. Try slowely approaching and identifying what makes you feel bad and try to reflect on it. Try to find and list the positive things you have going on. If things get grim, then don't feel ashamed to ask friends or family for help and to seek professional help. There is no recipe on beating depression. Everyone has to find their own medicine. It will be a hard and long fight, but you will eventually get there and beat your inner demons. Best of luck mate, may you find the light for your way again!</TEXT>

Note: I do agree, that a mass shooting is a horrible thing to happen to you and I truely hope, that you will get all the professional support and help you need. However this is unrelated to my judgement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unpopular opinion here: YTA, but only a very very little bit. I was going to go with NTA, since I agree, that someone with dementia doesn't really have the capabilities to make an educated decision on a vote. However it sounds to me, like you mainly don't want to remind him, because he would vote for a political party, that you disagree with. Therefore I will call you TA, except if you had done the same, if he would have likely been voting for a party you completely agree with. (To sum it up: NTA for not reminding someone with dementia to vote, but YTA for doing it due to the party he'd vote for.)</TEXT>

Would you have liked your parents to know everything you do and say? Reminds me of a guy I know, who got controlled by his parents all the time. Well, he didn't get abducted, but ended up depressed and got addicted to drugs, because he didn't know what to do with his freedom once he finally turned 18 and moved out. Piece of advice: If you truely love your daughter, then give her some freedom and space, this will help her take care of herself. If you are really that worried about her getting abducted, then offer her to take basic self-defense training, but monitoring her every step is not gonna get her nor you anywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A friend and me made a bet about playing a game of drinking chess. We are both extremely competitive in our bets, so I'm sure she is preparing special tactics to beat me and make me completely drunk on the way. I have used the last months to practice bullet chess, to simulate playing drunk, but I often end up losing quite a lot of material, even if I win, which I would prefer to avoid in the actual match. Any advice on how to avoid material loss and maybe some special openings, which could trick a medium skilled player with minimum material loss?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA. This is gonna be an unpopular opinion, but this is why: Having some mythical figure give kids presents for christmas is not an evil tradition in any way and it is not lying to pretend and play along with some mythical Santa existing. Kids get inspired by all sorts of things that could count as "lies". There are Disney characters, Santa Claus, the easter rabbit, tooth fairies, etc. Your kid is 4 years old. Let kids be kids and have fun with believing in mythical beings that help them. This is not gonna harm anyone, contrary to you ruining the fun not only for your kid, but also for his cousins and their parents.</TEXT>

But the only restriction here was a religious one. Imo everyone has to choose their religion themselves and also the way, they want to follow this religion. Forcing a religion and a religious diet onto a kid is just wrong and I appreciate, that you let the kid eat the food it wanted to try. It's not like the pizza was completely out of the line or harmful to the kid in any way. Also for those, who will call discrimination: I would have made the same statement about any religion with dietary restrictions. Having your kid follow a diet out of health reason - completely fine. Any other reasons - not fine.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>About the Free Gamers United</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-26 06:51:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Welcome to the official subreddit of the Free Gamers United \[FGU\]!** If you have no idea who we are, then please read this post first.  #8203; **Who are we?** The FGU are a multigaming guild. Our main goal is to provide a community for like minded players to socialize and have fun. For us, the game is the way and friendship is the destination. This simple concept has lead to a long tradition as a guild, who emphasizes fairplay, friendship and team spirit. **Why this subreddit?** This subreddit can be used to discuss anything related to the guild. Since discussions in Discord are sometimes short-lived, this subreddit can be used for longer discussions. Also this is a chance for those, whoa re not a member of the FGU to learn more about the guild. **Basic facts:** The FGU has been founded at the 17th of March 2014. The founder is subject9328, who is also the current guild master of the guild. The co-leaders are James, Michael and Senpai. The guild has around 80 members (October 2020). We mainly play Terraria, Payday 2, Minecraft, War Thunder, Omniwar and OGAT, but also all sorts of other games, e.g. Brawlhalla aswell as minigames such as Werewolf, Chess, our own dice RPG and our custom Pen 'n' Paper, if someone is up for them. **What we offer:** We are a huge and open-hearted guild with members from all over the world. We love to play, chat and talk with each other and want to have fun with each other. Our main goal is to create new friendships between the members and to allow them to have a place, where they can feel at home and be save to trust the other members. We mainly play OGAT, Omniwar, Terraria, Minecraft, War Thunder and Payday 2, but also many other games and will also organize events and tournaments within the guild. We have a long tradition and consider ourself a pretty mature, friendly and fair community. We communicate through Discord text- and voicechat and have a complex moderation system to keep the guild healthy and friendly. We are open-hearted towards new recruits and are happy to see new faces, as long as they share our values of fun, friendship, trust and fairplay. We have a ranking system with two ranking trees to give every member a position in the guild. Every member has the chance to make his way to the top, if he/she is interested in our guild. **What we expect:** We expect you to have a good knowledge of the english language aswell as good manners and a certain maturness. The members should follow the rules and the serverrules and should act mature and friendly. We also expect our members to behave fair ingame, as sportsmanship is very important for playing. We want: Mature, friendly, open-hearted members with a decent knowledge of the english language, who are looking for a long term guild. We dont want: Spammer, scammer, trolls, immature kiddies looking for ruining the fun of others or short-hearted members, who only plan on staying some days or weeks. **Constitution of the FGU** *I'm now founding this clan - FGU* 1. The Free Gamers United is an accepting guild, we treat every person with respect, we do not discriminate against anyone, and we never bully people, be they from inside or outside the guild. 2. Everyone is welcome, if sufficiently active. 3. The guild is lead as a democratic constitutional monarchy. New rules and important changes concerning the guild are voted on by every member of the guild. However, the Guild Master and staff have final say in the matter. 4. Every new member needs to be approved by the Guild Master, as well as a majority of the Co-Leaders. However, the Guild Master can reject (veto) any application. 5. We do not share personal info or private discussions with people from outside the guild. 6. The main language of the server is English. If there are people from different countries chatting in a channel, it is mandatory to speak English. However, if the people chatting are from the same country, they can speak their language. 7. We demand fair play and sportsmanship from our members. 8. People from outside the guild are always welcome on our ingame servers, unless stated otherwise. 9. If you wish to create a side-server with other guild members, it is mandatory to inform and ask for permission from the Guild Master before doing so. 10. You are not allowed to be part of any other clan/guild-like servers that are based on OGAT, Bombtag or Omniwar. Exceptions are made for official game servers (i.e. created by the devs). If you are not sure whether this rule applies to a certain server or not, please consult the staff. 10.5. When you read this rule, please contact your recruiter and tell him "Droggelbecher". They will know. This rule doesn't have any actual effect 11. You are required to attend official guild meetings. These will always be announced beforehand via DM #8217;s. If you cannot attend them, inform a staff member beforehand. This does not include weekly meetups like Tea Time and Redwine. 12.

    <TEXT>one can say, are the following: I accept my flaws. They are mine. I own them, but they don't own me. Why are they important? Many of us try to change by trying to eradicate their flaws and ignoring them away. But this way you might be able to burry them, maybe even deep, but you won't be able to grow. Be it fear, greed, anger, anxiety, weakness, the first step to a better self is to accept our flaws and accept, that we have to live with them. Only this way, we are able to grow with our flaws. Not by burrying them, but by learning to own them in a way, that they won't control us anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know a guy, who thinks he is Jesus. I could probably write a novel about all the crazy shit he did. One day, I was browsing the newspaper and saw, that he was announced dead. I was kind of sad for him, because while pretty insane, he was always a kind person, who would talk with people, give them little gifts and try to teach them about christianity. Imagine my surprise, when I saw him alive and well some weeks later. That mad genius faked his own death to be "reborn".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by microwaving a cup of milk</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-10 16:30:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Obligatory this didn't happen today but rather yesterday. After a long and stressful day, I decided to get myself a treat and warm myself some cinnamon milk. I have a wide variety of cups, since I like to buy cups, that look kind of fancy, so as I reached into my cupboard, I managed to pull out one cup, that happened to be a vacuum cup, designed to keep your drink warm for a long time. You probably see where this is going. I put the milk and cinnamon in the cup and put it into the microwave to heat it up. As I return to my microwave a few minutes later, I stand in awe, as the whole inside of my microwave is covered with milk and cinnamon. Turns out, that heating a vacuum cup leads to the content basically boiling over. I spent the next ten minutes cleaning my microwave, which also happens to be on top of my fridge. On top of the microwave, there is also a container with sugar. As I finished cleaning the microwave, I opened the fridge, to get myself some new milk. During my cleanup, I must have somehow pushed the container of sugar closer to the rim of my microwave, because opening the fridge door somehow got it enough energy to fall down and land directly in the eggs, that I keep in my fridge door. So now I had to spend another 10-15 minutes also cleaning up a bunch of broken eggs. Oh and I also ended up not having enough cinnamon left for another cup of milk. Fml. At least I now have a good story to tell.  #8203; TL;DR: Tried heating milk in a vacuum cup. It boiled over, causing me to knock down a container of sugar right into my eggs.</TEXT>

Not that one should point this out to an elf, except one is prepared for a rant over how  #8220;humans smell like dirty pigs #8221; and how I should wash myself  #8220;more than once a month #8221;. Not that I #8217;d mind her scent, but it for sure seemed strange to me. But hey, I never was one of those elf-haters and she for sure proved a worthy apprentice.  #8220;Did you hear that Gorn? #8221;, she asked and put me out of my thoughts. I slightly shook my head and then started to listen closely. At first I thought it was just the wind going through the trees, but then I picked up the sound she meant. A distant whispering, like someone was quietly speaking to himself.  #8220;A whisper wolf #8221;, I answered in awe. She looked at me with a big question mark on her face:  #8220;A what? #8221; I looked at her slightly puzzled.  #8220;A whisper wolf. White pelt, super rare, worth a fortune? Come on, you never heard of them? #8221; Apparently she did, because her face lit up.  #8220;You mean a Dr #224;- #235;ron? #8221; I had no idea what this was supposed to be, but since I doubted, that there were more than one kind of super rare wolf, I nodded. She seemed to get super excited and looked at me with fire in her eyes:  #8220;Will we hunt it? #8221; I was unsure for some moments. True, I had been hunting in these woods for many years, but she was still quite inexperienced. A whisper wolf was rumored to be a very intelligent prey and I had never actually had the chance to hunt one. However, this could be my one in a lifetime chance to actually do so and I for sure wasn #8217;t going to waste it.  #8220;We will hunt it, but watch out. You will follow me and stay quiet and you will do exactly as I say. This is our chance to become the most famous hunters in Ev #224;lidon and I won #8217;t take a risk. Understood? #8221;, I looked her straight into her green elvish eyes. She nodded:  #8220;You can rely on me, Gorn. Don #8217;t worry. #8221; I followed the whispers while already preparing myself for the encounter. I felt the green magic of the forest flow through my body and saw the green glow of the tattoos on my arms. Normal people often got a shock when I did this (I already ruined several attempts to hit on beautiful bar maidens by starting to glow in unfitting situations, but that #8217;s another story), but Myrana didn #8217;t mind. She in turn started to concentrate on her elvish magic and I noticed her eyes becoming even more green than they already were. While before they resembled the colour of jade, they now resembled a leaf in spring. By the light, I shouldn #8217;t have smoked these mushrooms yesterday, I was starting to become poetic! I focused on the whisper and closed my eyes. I let the energy flow through my arms into my body and then into my head, where I imagined it to flow to my ears and eyes. I opened my eyes and the world around me turned grey. The leaves, the trees, Myrana, even the few sunrays reaching the mossy ground were all grey. When I first experienced this, I got a shock, slipped and fell on my back, causing my old master to have a good laugh at me. But nowadays I was used to the world turning into an insipid place. I focused on the whispers and suddenly I noticed a small trail leading through the woods. It looked like small floating sparks, aligned to a trail, who would lead me to the source of the noise: The whisper wolf. I looked to Myrana and she pointed into the direction of the trail. Good girl, she was a fast learner. I slowly started to follow the sparks through the woods, while signaling Myrana to watch my back. While I had a straight way to mister white pelt, it was still possible to overlook another danger in the grey world I was seeing. While advancing through the forest, I could hear the sound louder and louder, resulting in the sparks to become more and more, until I finally decided to close my eyes and end the spell. I found myself close to a small opening. Beautiful red flowers were blooming close to a small spring, sending clear water from a white rock, that was covered in glimmer. And on the rock, I saw it, the most noble beast I had ever seen: A pelt white as snow, white claws like marble and red eyes like freshly spilled blood. By the light, I should pay this druid a visit and ask him to return my hard-earned copper, those mushrooms definitely messed up my sense of poetry. When I looked at Myrana, I noticed, that she was also awestruck and looking at the majestic beast with a slightly opened mouth. For a moment I imagined salvia running out her open mouth and had to stop myself from chuckling at the thought of it.  #8220;It is so #8230;beautiful #8221;, Myrana whispered,  #8220;I have never seen such beauty! #8221;. I nodded:  #8220;I gotta admit, that it has a nice pelt. A pelt, which will turn us into wealthy legends. I will cast a spell to keep him on the opening, you will draw your dagger and try to draw his attention. #8221;  #8220;Yes Gorn. And then, what do we do? #8221;  #8220;We improvise. Just make sure to not damage his pelt! #8221; I kneeled at the edge of the opening and touched the earth with both my hands. I could feel the cold dirt running through my fingers and I inhaled the aroma of the fresh dirt. I closed my eyes and felt the energy flow through my head, my body, my arms, my hands, all the way down to my fingertips. I felt it flowing through my fingertips into the earth itself, building a small magical wall around the opening, not visible by the eye, but for sure noticeable for anyone or anything dumb enough to touch it (At this point I should probably admit, that I didn #8217;t believe my old master, that such a barrier could exist, when he first created one. I bumped right into it and gave him another reason to laugh at me. Thinking of it, he laughed at me quite a lot, meaning I was either a pretty dumb apprentice or he was a mean old man. Or both. He was a good mentor though, that I gotta give him). Once the wall was set up, I opened my eyes, rose from the ground and drew my trusty short sword. It had served me well in all the years of hunting and while most trappers laughed at me for not using a bow, I laughed even harder, when they ran from the great iron snake, because their arrows couldn #8217;t pierce its scales. I still have the snail head nailed to the wall of my cabin to this day to remind them of this incident, when they come to visit me. (Yes, I can be mean). I stormed onto the opening, where Myrana was already cycling the beast with her dagger drawn and a ball of magic in her left hand. The whisper wolf was still standing at its stone, its red eyes focused on Myrana. Suddenly he opened his muzzle and raised its head. What followed was the most horrifying howl I had ever heard in my life. The sound gave me goosebumps and I saw Myranas face turn pale from horror. The howl touched something deep inside me, that just wanted me to turn around, run from this opening and never return. But hey, I also survived Fat Molly singing at the bar and if I could do that, some horrible howl wouldn #8217;t scare me.  #8220;Let #8217;s get him! Take its flank! #8221; I shouted, then I rushed forwards, hoping, that Myrana would follow me. I charged the beast from the front, my short sword raised to the level of its head. The wolf turned around and jumped at me, its claws extended, ready to hit me. I, however, was prepared for its attack and made a quick somersault, dodging its claws by millimeters. The wolf hit the ground, just to run into Myrana, who tried to stab its eye with her dagger. Now it was the wolfs turn to do a quick roll and dodge the attack. I got back on my feet, just to slip on the wet stone and fall onto my back again. Damn spring. The wolf was circling Myrana now, its eyes focused on her throat, ready to leap. My apprentice in turn raised her left hand and let a green magic ball fly towards the beast, who promptly dodged it and jumped towards her throat. Myrana didn #8217;t make a motion to dodge and right before her throat, the wolf suddenly stopped and its teeth snapped, making an awful crunching sound. The magic may have missed the wolf, but it hit the ground behind the best and several thorny tendrils emerged from the ground, grabbing the whisper wolf and rendering it immobile. The beast seemingly floated for a moment, then it hit the ground. Hard. I managed to get back up and raised my short sword:  #8220;Die, beast! #8221;, I screamed, then I thrusted my sword right through the red eye of my foe, which resulted in blood splashing from the impact. The wolfs body shook for a moment, then it came to its final rest. Breathing heavily, I slowly pulled my weapon from the corpse and started to clean it in the spring, turning the water red for some moments.  #8220;That was close! #8221;, Myrana exclaimed. I nodded:  #8220;For a moment I thought this beast would kill you. Good job with the tendrils, very impressive. #8221;  #8220;Thank you Gorn. You taught me well. #8221; She lowered her head in respect. I sighed inside, even after three years she still felt the need to be at least kind of formal against me. I rose from the spring and sheathed my blade. Then I walked up to her and put a hand on her shoulder to make her look at me:  #8220;You did a great job there and that #8217;s not only due to my teachings. You showed initiative and strength and I am proud of you. #8221; Then, noticing the awkwardness of the situation, I added:  #8220;Also it would have been a shame if I had to find a new apprentice after all that we went through. It took me a year to teach you how to make a proper oakleaf tea! #8221; It took her a moment to realize I was joking, then she burst into laughter. I couldn #8217;t hold back and also started to laugh. The sound of our happiness, hers lovely as a birds song and mine deep as a rolling thunder mixed while we stood at the opening, a dead wolf and hundreds of red flowers to our feet, laughing like I had just told the funniest joke ever. All the tension from the hunt went away while we laughed, flying with our voices and disappearing into the blue sky above. Then, I noticed the wind. The day had been generally warm up to this point, but now I suddenly started to shiver as a cold breeze hit my skin. Myranas laughter started to falter and then stopped and so did mine. I looked up to the sky and noticed dark clouds covering what used to be a clear blue sky. And then I felt it, a fear emerging from inside of my body, making me shake in terror, goosebumps all over me. When I looked at Myrana, I could see tears running through her face and her eyes showed pure terror. Then I saw something moving, slightly blurry and just out of my vision. I could smell rotten grass and flesh and this is where I realized, that we were under attack.  #8220;RUN! #8221; I shook off the shock and grabbed Myranas hand, dragging her towards the edge of the opening. When I reached it, I made sure to lower my barrier and made a step into the forest  #8211; just to get thrown back into the opening. My head hit the ground and for some seconds I could see cute little stars dancing in front of my eyes. Then I got back to my feet:  #8220;Watch out Myrana, there is a new bar- #8220;. Too late, Myrana had already tried to reach the forest and now hit the ground just as hard as I did moments before. I could hear a dull sound, when her head hit a stone and she stopped moving.  #8220;Myrana! #8221; My scream was filled with pure terror. I quickly jumped to my feet and grabbed my trusty short sword, that I had dropped when I fell. I quickly made my way to Myrana, who laid motionless in the midst of hundreds of red flowers, her golden hair slowly turning red from the blood flowing from a wound at her head. No, this couldn #8217;t be! This couldn #8217;t end like this! I dropped to my knees and shook her shoulders:  #8220;Myrana! Myrana? Wake up! You can #8217;t just die on me! #8221;. Tears ran from my eyes and blurred my vision. A shadow towered over me, blocking the faint light from the clouded sky. I slowly looked up and looked at an incarnation of pure terror. A mouth with incredible sharp teeth, six legs with razor sharp claws, two red eyes glowing with hatred and a breath that smelled like horror itself. This was a living terror, a nightmare come true. I had always believed the terrorclaw to simply be a legend, a hunters fairy tale to scare rookies at the fireplace at night. Oh how wrong had I been! I looked into the face of my grim destiny and my innards and head screamed at me to jump up and run. But those screams got muzzled by the overwhelming wrath flowing through my veins. I softly laid Myrana back into the flowers.  #8220;We will meet in the golden halls Myrana. But first I will send you this bastard. #8221; Then I jumped up, pure adrenalin pumping through me. I rushed at the monster, my short sword raised, my whole body glowing bright green from the magic flowing through me. A scream of pure anger escaped my throat as I used my magic to leap towards the terrorclaws horrifying face. My sword connected with its plated forehead, but it got deflected without leaving as much as a scratch. A claw caught me midair and I felt its pressure crushing my ribs. Pain replaced my anger and I felt my magic fading away, as drops of my blood hit the ground. The beast lifted me towards its mouth, slowly, as if it was enjoying my pain. Its eyes looked at me, filled with an evil craving for blood. I closed my eyes and accepted my faith. Then she started to sing. Myranas voice was weak and shaking with fear, but the melody filled the opening, the air, the grass and my heart. She sang an ancient elvish tune, a lullaby, telling a story of a loving mother putting her child to sleep. It was so beautiful, I forgot my surroundings and even myself for a moment, floating within an eternal void, that was filled by her voice. Then I snapped back into reality, as the creature loosened her grip and I hit the ground. My whole body was hurting and Myrana still kept singing, slowly walking towards me and offering me a shoulder to lean on. We slowly walked away backwards from the creature, that was standing still in awe, completely caught in the tune, like entangled in an invisible net of music. My whole body was hurting, as we reached the edge of the opening. Myrana looked me into the eyes and I nodded. She stopped singing and we turned around and started sprinting. We ran faster than we had ever ran in our whole lifes, followed by the terrible screams of the confused terrorclaw, as it snapped out of its trance and started following us. We ran for about ten minutes, until we were sure, that we had shook off the beast, then we stopped, breathing heavily. I leaned against a big tree and tried catching my breath, while checking my ribs and making sure, that none of them were broken.  #8220;Damn girl, you for sure saved our asses back there #8221;, I said to Myrana, who seemed to still be quite shocked from the encounter, her beautiful eyes wide and breathing heavily. I could almost see her heart beating in her chest from the rush of adrenaline and the insanely fast sprint.  #8220;I gotta say, you have a pretty nice voice. Maybe you should have become a bard, then you wouldn #8217;t have to run through the woods with an old madman, such as myself. #8221;, I tried reaching her with a joke. She just stared at me. Damn it, I really wasn #8217;t the best with people, wasn #8217;t I?  #8220;Listen, seriously though, thank you for saving us. I really thought, we were de #8212; #8221; I didn #8217;t get to finish the sentence, as Myrana jumped at me and pulled me into a big hug, tears running down her face all of sudden.  #8220;I thought you are dead! I thought it would eat you and me next. Gorn, I was never so scared before ever in my life. #8221;, she said sobbingly. I had no idea, what to say, so I just pulled her into a big bear hug and held her for a minute.  #8220;Don #8217;t worry my girl, you are safe now. Old Gorn will always watch out for you, I promise. #8221; She nodded and one last sob escaped her, before we awkwardly realized that we had been hugging for about a minute now and let go of each other.  #8220;Alright,  #8216;Old Gorn #8217;, how about we go back to town and you buy me a drink or better a whole fucking tavern for saving your ass today. #8221;, she said, her voice still a bit shaky, but with newfound energy in her eyes.  #8220;That #8217;s only fair #8221;, I said, as we started to head back to town, hand in hand, an old human ranger and an elvish woman that people would at first assume to be his daughter, even though she, being an elf, was actually several decades older than me. But to us both, that didn #8217;t matter today. The clouds had parted and small rays of sunlight glanced through the thick forest and left little bright spots on our smiling faces, as we walked, glad to be alive after a day of excitement and terror.

    <TEXT>German here: This means, that the issue has to be debated in the Bundestag, but there is actually no way for a petition to turn into a public voting of some kind, so in the end, it is totally up for the Bundestag to decide, if they follow through with the content of the petition and if yes, in what way they choose to do so. This petition might however, regardless of the results, lead to an increased news coverage of the events, though I gotta say, that the news are already covering the topic in a decent frequency (though reading through some of the comments on the articles makes me lose my faith in humanity, given how commenters like to call the protestors "rioters" and defend police action. It should be noted though, that protest culture here in Germany is different to the one in Hongkong, therefore some people here seem to simply assume, that the Hongkong police works the same way as the german police, which would, if it was the case (which I know it isn't), make the protests indeed look like riots. Therefore I think, that the increased news coverage might benefit your cause, as it would help to make people aware of the actual issues at hand). Please note, that this is my subjective view on how Germany processes the events and I am but one guy and can't possibly fully describe, how other Germans adress the issue. This is just what I perceived from reading about the issue in some german newssites and the comments to said articles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am sorry to hear, that you receive so much hate dude. I can't even imagine how hard this has to be for you. However I admire your strength to go through with you transition, despite people telling you not to. You said, that it is your choice and I agree with you in that. However there is one thing I disagree with you: You said, that you want to change how you will die. As you. I think, that someone as strong as you can go a step further and **live** as yourself. Look at it this way: You managed to get this far, despite some assholes on the internet hating on you. Do you really want to give in to them by taking your life? I am sure, that is exactly what they would want to achieve with their hate. Show them, that you are bigger and stronger than their little reatrded asshole brains can even imagine and live as the man you want to be. You might have been born female and you had no choice in that. But you can choose to live as a man and noone in this world can stop you from doing so. Go out, enjoy the sun on your skin, the rain in your face or the snow in your hands and **live.** Llife is beautiful and you have all the right to enjoy it. Stay strong dude and best of luck  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As others already said, simply put it back the next time you are there. Additional advice: If someone actually talks to you about the pencil (very unlikely, I mean, it's just a pencil), then just say, that you found it and didn't know who it belonged to, so you kept it safe, to return it to the owner, once you find them. But again, it's a pencil, I lost so many of them already, I probably wouldn't even care, if someone took mine right before my eyes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Happiness is different for everyone. There is no "guide" or "recipe", that will make you achieve happiness. What works for one might not work for another. For me, happiness comes from understanding yourself, your motivations and your emotions and accept all of them the way they are. Once you can do that, which is by no way an easy task, you can learn to enjoy the things you do and to do the things you enjoy. Be up for experiments and also try things that normally scare you.</TEXT>

Cue my surprise, when a bunch of my studymates gathered, gave me a birthday cake and some presents and wished me a happy birthday. I was so happy that day, I almost cried from joy.

    <TEXT>A friend of mine swallowed pills in an attempt to overdose. I managed to convince him to puke them out and not make a second attempt. He survived. I have no contact with him anymore nowadays, but I truely hope, that he is doing alright. Last time I met him, he seemed to have gotten himself help and do better at life, so there is hope. After that, I frequented r/SuicideWatch with an alt account for some time, because I felt like it was my responsibility to help the people there, who might not be lucky enough to have friends to convince them to live on. I eventually couldn't take the stress of talking with suicidal people anymore though and decided, that I did my part and that self-protection comes first. I would still do it again though, if a friend really needed my help.  #8203; I would also like to use this as a chance to make people aware, that r/SuicideWatch exists. It is no replacement for a suicide hotline, but the volunteers there are doing their best to care for those, who have nowhere else to turn to. If you are completely mental and emotional stable, have experience in talking with suicidal people and want to help, then check out the sub, they can really use the help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I run a gaming guild for almost six years now. There was this guy, who made it up to becoming a mod member. Always had a very weird gut feeling about him, but he seemed to generally be kind and responsible. Turns out he was secretly harassing a female staff member, who noone believed, that he harassed her, because he was extremly good at hiding every trace and then blaming every accusation on her simply not liking him. That was until we managed to catch him in the act while harassing her in a voicechat. He was banned. I later found out, that he also joked in private about drugging and raping girls and he also pretended to have nudes of said staff member, in a (luckily fruitless) attempt to scare her. I have been listening very closely to my gut feeling ever since, because a lot of this could have been prevented, had I never trusted him in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of the stuff that bothers you seems to come from insecurities over your height and therefore turned into insecurities about yourself. It is not easy to get out of this alone and I definitely recommend seeing a therapist to help you planning activities, that can boost your self-esteem and self-worth. Some stuff you can start doing right away: \- Try approaching people you don't know yet and start casual conversations with them. Worst case they don't like you, but you didn't know you anyways, so what does it matter? Best case you start a great friendship this way \- Allow yourself to do things, that scare you and experience situations you are uncomfortable with. It might be hard hanging out with others or asking them to hang out with you, if your insecurities tell you, that they hate you. However just allow yourself to try it and see how it goes, even if it will feel scary and shitty at first. You might discover, that others see you as much better than you see yourself. Overall I can only advice you to not lose hope and to keep on going. Seek help and learn to be yourself without having to be afraid to be you. Best of luck mate!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know where you come from, cause I have been there. I recommend you first try to love and trust yourself. You might deep inside think, that you are a bad person and then project these feelings onto others and automatically assume, that they might think the same about you. The first step to break this cycle, is to accept yourself, even if you have flaws. Nobody is perfect and we all have our rough edges. But you probably wouldn't judge someone by theirs and neither will your friends judge you by yours. Be positive about yourself, don't be afraid to make mistakes and be who you are and your friends will love you just as the person you are. If you are unsure, if this is true, think about how you see your friends. I am sure, you like them despite them probably having their rough edges too. Your friends feel the same way about you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Scratching. Nails on metal. The floor cold beneath my bare feet. How long had I been here? Minutes? Hours? Days? Years? I didn't know. Who am I? Why am I? No answer. Just darkness around me. My hands are touching the walls. Cold, lifeless metal. I have to get out. My hands are scratching along the walls. A sheer endless hallway. My lips open, I try to scream, but there is no sound. I stumble forward. It is so cold. Shivering. Searching. All that darkness. Stars. The word slowely flows through my numb mind. Stars. Stars. STARS. A piece of memory. A day in spring, a roof, beautiful blue eyes and sky full of stars. Then the memory starts fading. I try to catch it, my hands reaching out, but it slips from me and I fall to the cold metal floor. Nothing. It is gone. I can't see it anymore. I just remember the word. Stars. I have to see them. I manage to pull myself back up again. My hands and feet are hurting from the fall. I have to keep going. I can't stop now. I stumble forwards, my nails scratching on the wall to give me direction. My numb feet challenged by every step I take. Suddenly a barrier. I hit my head. Pain. My fingers are exploring, searching, freeing. A door. I pull the handle and step outside. Cold, fresh air, wind blowing in my face. My head darts upwards, my hand reaching towards the sky. I look up. Darkness, no stars. Just void around me. I am blind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. I absolutely detest violence and war. Conflicts shouldn't be solved by killing others, but rather by talking and finding a compromiss. I have friends from all over the world and we are all not that different in the end. We are all humans full of hope, love, mercy, but also fear, anger and insecurities. We are different but equal and I firmly believe, that kindness is to always be chosen over violence. The only instant I would ever even consider violence, was, if someone got me cornered and I would fail to convince them to step down and they would directly pose a threat to my life, if I didn't defend myself. I would never actively search to get into such a situation and that is what joining an army feels like for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going against the flow here. I don't care, if this gets downvoted into oblivion, but I need to say this. I do not think, that mental conditions, especially depression, justifies supporting the right to suicide for a person. I say that as someone, who has interacted with suicidal people and talked a friend out of killing himself. Those who live and those who survive a suicide attempt, usually regret their attempt afterwards and are grateful to be alive. Life can lead you to a point, where you will feel no hope, especially, if you are suffering from mental conditions, that make you feel pain, fear, worthlessness or let you hear negative voices in your head. However there are ways to treat these conditions and help the patients to feel better and live a somewhat fullfilled life. To sum things up: Instead of supporting suicide for people with mental conditions, we should do much more to remove the stigma for these conditions and make help far easier and cheaper to access, to help these people help themselves. Suicide can't be reversed and should therefore not be a solution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Time to get downvoted into oblivion. Holy freak guys, is everyone here out of their mind? Pursuing a friend romantically, can indeed ruin a friendship and sometimes people can be great friends but simply not work as romantic partners. So if you have a feeling, that pursuing a friend romantically will ruin your friendship, then think very strongly twice, if it is worth it. A solid long term friendship, in my opinion, can be far more valuable than a romantic relationship. And some friendships can indeed last for a very long time, even longer than your romantic relationship with someone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take yourself time to be with yourself. Be it meditation, long hikes or just sitting on your couch. Make sure you reflect on what you do, how you feel and why you do it and why you feel it. Try to understand your own motivations and emotions. This is the key to fully understanding yourself and why you are who you are. Once you have that figured out, learn to accept yourself and the things that make you who you are, because by knowing and accepting them, you can control them and yourself completely. This way, you might find your inner peace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My one eye has very bad sight, while the other one works pretty much normally. My brain kinda compensated this by "turning off" my bad eye. I had no idea, that this isn't normal though, since I could see and didn't know, why anything should look different. I only got a bit weird out by how people seemed to like 3D movies and they didn't really seemed special to me, since a normal movie looked like real life already anyways to me. It eventually got discovered, when I had to take an eye test for starting driving lesson. I got glasses and got lucky, because my brain started using my bad eye again thanks to the glasses. I started with low correcting but got it up to normal sight now, while wearing my glasses (when I put them down, everything appears to be completely blurry though, but I happily pay that prize for being able to see in 3D while wearing them. It was so amazing, when I first put on my glasses and suddenly everything seemed to have so much... substance. Sry, I don't really know how to describe this feeling.)</TEXT>

You will realize, that men and women are not as different as you might think. Just see it from another perspective: Imagine, a woman told you, that men just wanted "chad women" and that you had unreasonable standards and would immediately start talking down to you and belittling you. Would you really want to go out with said woman? I suppose not. But that wouldn't make her accusations true. I get the feeling, that you have been rejected a lot in your life and this might have lead to an unreasonable view on women from your part. I can only give you the advice, to look further than this and try a fresh start without any prejudice, even if it might be hard for you to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, I would like to know, what "scientifically support" you have for your claims about women. Secondly, if what you said was true, then how come, that most people are able to get into a relationship? Not to forget about the part, that there is a pretty much equal amount of women and men. Let's assume for the sake of your argument, that said "chads" actually exist and women only wanted to date them. Since you describe "chads" as unrealisticly good looking, I will put there looks for the sake of the argument at being at the top 1% of looks compared to other men. That in turn means, that 99% of men would not qualify as "chads". Now we have already established, that there is an almost equal amount of women and men. Most women, in the long term, as well as most men, are willing and able to get into a relationship. This in turn means, that it is impossible, that women would only want to date "chads", because that would leave 99% of women unable to find a romantic partner. Therefore your claim concerning "chads" is mathematical impossible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been running a gaming guild for almost six years and have seen some scary shit over the time. What stands out is the one guy, who had been in the guild for some months, until he started to tell us, how he had to go to the hospital a lot. After some concerned questions, he told us, that he was suffering from cancer and would need to undergo treatment. We knew him for some time already at this point and he used to be a sincere and mature guy, so we believed him and tried to emotionally support him as well as we could. He told us, how his cancer would become worse and worse and how he felt weaker and weaker and was sad, because he was getting closer to dying. We in turn tried our best to cheer him up and make his last weeks on earth as nice as possible. It was heartwarming to see, how much people cared for him, it was almost like he was part of a family. Until the day, when a message got sent through his account, claiming to be his brother and that he indeed had died. However something about this message was odd and one of my moderators caught on to it. Also we soon noticed, that the account was shown, just for a short time, as playing a game. We questioned the "brother" and it turned out, that the whole cancer story was completely fake. This incredibly low piece of human waste (sorry for the swearing) had pretended over the cause of several months, to suffer from endstage cancer and fooled all of us, just for his very twisted sense of humor. I don't even know, what might motivate someone to do something like this. Needless to say, that I immediately banned him from the guild and tried to block all contact to him. He later returned to me and pretended to have "found to god" and asked me for forgiveness. I denied him any forgiveness and I made sure to inform everyone who I knew about what a lowely scammer this guy was. He proceeded to change account names and make new accounts even, but I would always catch on and inform others about his deeds, until he eventually completely vanished from the games' community. I haven't seen him for over a year now and I truely hope, that he is gone from the community for good.</TEXT>

The speed is hard to reach with most cars and it is very hard to react to anything and come to a stop due to the high speed. I think, you did the right thing by slowing down and I don't think, you meant any harm, so I will say, that while you are technically an asshole, you are a very small one and moreover an accidental one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't say, that I have the recipe for a perfect social life, but I can speak from experience what worked for me. If you have trouble talking with others, then usually the reason is, that you are subconsciously afraid of them disliking you for what you have to say, thus blocking you from actively interacting with them. This problem, once you realize it, is best tackled by learning more about yourself and why you feel this way. Maybe something in your past damaged your selfworth, maybe there are internal reason, why you feel like you will say the wrong thing. Try to identify these reason, try to reflect on yourself on learn to accept yourself. If you are able to respect yourself, then you will be able to accept, that others respect you. And if you are able to accept that others respect you, then your subconscious won't block you from interacting with them. This is not an easy or fast path by any means, it requires the ability to self-reflect and to take yourself time to just think and sort through your thoughts and emotions. It is a very rewarding path though, as it will help you grow to be the person you aim to be. Best of luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can only tell you, that you need to come to peace with yourself, before you can start to grow. From my experience, growth can't be forced, it is a process. Don't be afraid to ask for help, if you feel like you can't do it yourself and don't give up, if things don't work out or you hit a low. It takes one step at a time. Sometimes the steps are small and sometimes you stumble and fall. But if you keep going and improve one thing after the other, you will eventually get there. That's sadly all advice I can give you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make sure to get the angle right. The right angle can make all the difference in the world. Take the picture from below, if you want to make something seem bigger or the other way around. When taking a picture of a far away object, make sure to have something or someone up close to make things more interesting. Pay a huge attention to lights and colours. You can use the sun to make pictures with glares, but normally it is better to take your picture away from the sun. I have found phone cameras to work very well with low light, so taking sunset/sunrise or night pictures, especially with your phones night mode can lead to very nice results. Overall, pay attention to details and don't be afraid to try taking pictures of things that might seem "boring" at first. Sometimes you just need the right perspective to turn a simply trashcan into a piece of art. Also if you think something could maybe work, then always take the shot. Worst case you discard it, best case you get a suprising and amazing result. Have fun! =)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Battle Map Design</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-06 11:37:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello fellow DMs, I could really use some advice on battle map design and would be glad, if you could help me out. I am a fairly new GM and this is the first time I will GM for 5e. I GMed for another system before, that didn't use battlemaps for encounters, so I am a bit overwhelmed with the task of designing interesting maps for my group. I am currently using roll20 to create the maps, but I can't help but feel, that they are all kind of dull and similar to each other in design. What are things that make for a good battle maps? What are some things I should pay attention to when creating the environment and how can I make the maps more interesting for the players? Thank you in advance for any advice!</TEXT>

So I decided to get myself a coffee to help me keep awake. Now if I say coffee, I mean an espresso. Double. Now thing is, after drinking it, I still felt extremly tired, so I wanted to get another one. My bff warned me, but I didn't listen to her and got myself a second espresso. Double. Half an hour later, all hell broke loose. I was literally unable to sit still and was pretty much jumping around while solving chemical equations in high speed while my bff desperately tried to calm me down and somehow make sense into my fast babbling and writing. She almost lost her mind that day. She still reminds of this day whenever I want to get myself a coffee.</TEXT>

So I was just kinda standing there, contemplating my life choices, when a punk girl showed up and just wordlessly handed me the needed change. This literally saved my ass this day. I paid it forward by giving change to some japanese tourists some months later, who wanted to use the same toilet, but also had no change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hallo ihr Lieben, kennt jemand von euch Zulieferer f #252;r Mundschutzmasken in Dresden, bei denen eine kleine Arztpraxis Masken bekommen k #246;nnte?

Zwar haben wir f #252;rs erste noch ein paar Vorr #228;te (wir gehen sehr sparsam mit unserem Material um und tragen es teilweise  #252;ber mehrere Tage), aber wir werden eher fr #252;her als sp #228;ter Nachschub ben #246;tigen, sonst m #252;ssen wir schlie #223;en. Ich w #252;rde mich sehr  #252;ber Hinweise freuen, die ich an unsere Chefin weiterleiten kann.  #8203; Update: Wir haben Dank eines freundlichen Kommentares gen #252;gend Masken bekommen.

    <TITLE>Corona time is not the time for petty neighbourhood disputes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-07 13:19:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>A little rant. For some reason my landlord decided, that this is the perfect time to get some trees cut, which coincidentally are directly above my parking spot. Means I had to move my car. I moved it to the visitors parking space. I work in a doctors office and given the current situation, you can certainly imagine, how stressfull things are. So when I returned after a 10 hours shift (which is unpaid btw, since I am still a med student), I really did not feel like moving my car back to my old spot and decided to do so today after my shift (which I knew would be shorter than usual). Cut to today. I return from my shift, just to find an angry note at my car, written by a neighbour, who complained, that I dared to park at the visitor parking spot. Nothing better to come home to than an angry note. How about showing some sympathy, because I will be the one who cares for you or your relatives, when you eventually catch the virus (which seems likely, if you got the time to run around outside and write angry notes). Some people smh. Sorry for the rant, just had to let off some steam. Stay safe and healthy everyone!</TEXT>

Does it also lead to quite drastical change in eye colour during adolescence?

    <TEXT>I respectfully disagree. While your statement does hold some truth, violence and wishing death upon someone does not give you the moral highground nor will it solve any issues. History has shown, that peaceful revolutions (think Gandhi, MLK, Germany 89, etc...) have been much more successful and impactful than violent riots. If there ahould be action taken against someone who is doing injustice, the best way to do so, is to peacefully rally the masses. Because in the end 100000 peaceful protestors will reach more than 1000 violent rioters, especially since no protest can win without having the majority of the population backing it - which it will never do, if the protests escalate into violence. So while violence sometimes had to be the solution (see WWII, Osama), it should always be the last resort and only happen out of self defense. Preemptive violence on the premise to "do good" has never brought true and lasting peace (see Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have backup generators. If they should fail too and there really was no more electricity at all, we still have batteries in some essential machines (defi, ekg, etc).

    <TEXT>It really does dependon the illness. Operations could still be done without power, but people would have to be manually ventilated. Monitoring would become pretty hard admittedly. Depending on the weather, some drugs could still be kept cool, in the worst case through endothermic reactions with chemicals from the clinic lab (at least thats what I would go get, I am not sure, if there are official plans for keeping medication cooled in the event of a blackout). You can still treat patients with drugs and perform basic operations, which should hopefully provide enough time to either get the power back on or to move the patient to a hospital with power remaining.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, I don't have a solution for your issue, I can only give some advice from someone who has been cheated on in the past on how I dealt with trust and finding trust again. Being cheated on has probably left a lasting mark on your partner. A mark, that only they themselves can ultimately learn to deal with. There are different ways they can go about this, be it through self reflection, building their self-esteem, constant control (not advised, this does not resolve anything) or even through seeking therapy. All you can do for them is to be there for them, understanding and helping them to find their path and to support them in the path they take. Ultimately you can make the path easier for them, but it is on them to come clean with their past and accept, that you aren't the one who cheated on them and that you never will. Best of luck to you and your partner!</TEXT>
