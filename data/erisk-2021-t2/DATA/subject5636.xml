    <TEXT>Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition is trash compared to other editions (besides 4th edition). 5th edition is actually so plain and bland just because they wanted more people to play it. Even though THAC0 was pretty much confusing it added more variables to attacks and stuff. Now we got dumb dumb AC and 20 = instant win and critical. Also the amount of books they release is nothing compared to when 2nd edition was around. I have a whole bookshelf of D amp;D books my dad gave me, he said they came out monthly in box sets. Now we got these campaign settings that no one asked for. Where's more ravenloft, spelljammer, planescape, dark sun and etc. I have officially moved on past 5th edition D amp;D and have moved onto Star Trek Adventures, which is just a tabletop RPG based on my favourite tv show. What do you guys think of D amp;D 5e?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Modern science fiction shows are shit and here's why</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 09:49:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I believe it started with Star Wars, this movie made people think that science fiction means space battles and alien fights, and also made the average idiot get mixed up with science fiction and science fantasy. Star Wars also lacked the inclusion of science for example hyperspace and the force, this brought in a dumber audience that would later shape science fiction media in today's age. Now in 2020 and a couple years before we have seen many science fiction franchise die. Star Trek is the best example, as now it puts political views and space battles above good characters, story and science, as well as trying to imitate the MCU to lure more viewers. Also not to mention Star Trek always has been political but it has always shown both sides of the argument unlike the new shows. In conclusion science fiction was made for nerds and should still be for nerds in this day and age. Now we have these shit political shows for 'tards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I mean science I m e an theoretical science. If you watch 2001 it's rather quite realistic, what I mean by star wars is that it brought in a generation of movie makers who believe that science fiction is all about space battles and fights. If you look at the great science fiction books that came before that era, many of them were about the complex characters and their development, like most other books. This is mostly a rant about why new star trek is so shit and me just wishing it was like the golden age.</TEXT>
