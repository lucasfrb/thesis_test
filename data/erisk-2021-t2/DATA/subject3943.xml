    <TEXT>Namecoin isn't a currency. Cost is designed to decrease, since economic scarcity is provided by the limited number of unique IDs in the namespace of the TLD instead of the limited number of answers in Bitcoin. The "coin" itself has no intrinsic value on the Namecoin network, only the name has value. Namecoin isn't designed for people to "compute4cash" at home, or use it as a financial tool. It's designed to make sure governments can't arbitrarily seize domains. Namecoin's critical flaw, in my book, is that it doesn't satisfy human greed in the same way that Bitcoin does. Namecoin doesn't enrich the miner, where as Bitcoin has a built in notion that it "earns" you money. If you're looking to "get rich" from your "idle computer time", stick to Bitcoin. If you've got an idealogical issue with governments seizing domain names and wish to see registrars and DNS decentralized for the health of the Internet, then support the Namecoin effort with a few Mhash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having been arrested in Ohio before for cannabis possession and now working for a cannabis company -- this is certainly near and dear to my heart. What the cannabis community cannot risk is setting a bad precedence like this. As you pointed out, other states sometimes look to Ohio to take cues on how to build their legal policies. ResponsibleOhio would encourage other states to adopt similar monopoly-creating legislation around marijuana. That's how these rich-people-funded ballot measures end up everywhere. They get one state to 'fall', then it's easier to get others in line. "Ohio schools made $X in taxes from cannabis, weed pays for our schools!" Which could be true -- but it's happening by lining the pockets of already rich people. We've worked for too long, we've fought too hard, and we've been treated like criminals for no good reason. RO's proposal is far from what we're fighting for. We're fighting for the potential for cannabis to change lives, create jobs, and to end a senseless war on a plant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off -- I'm not a lawyer, I just listen to ours -- so obligatory "don't trust some guy on the Internet for legal advice" warning. That said... My understanding is that there are two major dates that will impact everyone in the industry. The first is the March 31st date, which is a cutoff for compliance under the current regime. The second is Jan 1st which, obviously, the full effect of the law will be felt. It seems to me that the second half of 2016 is going to create some odd 'black blip' in the industry where those who don't make the March 31st requirements turn back to the black market. It's also my understanding that we got what is often referred to as a three tier system, so depending on what your company does or wants to do in the future, you will need to make (legal) plans accordingly. We got a little of Colorado's laws, a little of Washington's laws, and a dash of California goodness to keep it weird.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Grower/manufacturer in CA here... the terpenes in marijuana begin breaking down almost immediately after its cured AND has been exposed to light/oxygen. Most consumers don't realize how old pot is by the time it gets to them. Hint: it's a long time. Vacuum sealing works up to a point (I wouldn't do it) but if you're serious about storing marijuana you need to do so in an oxygen and light free container.

    <TEXT>A recreational user generally wants an effect that's induced by decarboxylating all the terpenes at the same time -- which is done almost instantaneously with smoking and vaping. The terpene profile is certainly most robust immediately after it cures, so I'd think most people would consider that the peak of potency. Is it better? That's up to the consumer! Like you said it's mild, but it's experiencing the plant in a way that's uncommon, which is nifty. Things have a shelf life though, so beyond calling it nifty, I'm not sure what the point is.

    <TEXT>1. It depends from state to state, but it's semi-difficult in all of them. Long term, cannabis will end up like alcohol and be sold in corner stores and Whole Foods -- so ask yourself if you want to compete with that. You don't see stores dedicated to alcohol, do you? The only place you see that is where there's a state law that props those businesses up. In less regulated markets they don't exist. 2. Get lawyers to do that work for you and always do what your lawyers say. Part of operating a business that requires a license is ya don't get to run that business if the state takes your license away. 3. Not at all! I mean, if you're selling dirty CBDs full of heavy metals from China to medical patients then that's not good -- but I've found it's been a net-positive for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100% MITM. Distributors exist for the purpose of taxation and liability -- which makes law makers comfortable -- so the state has nearly copy-pasted the alcohol regulations. Edit: I'm not opposed to having distributors, but I do think the regulations on cultivation are out of touch. Edit2: It's also worth noting that these laws were signed nine days ago and aren't yet in effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Friends  amp; family money is the worst money you can possibly take for a startup. Figure out how to bootstrap, work a part-time job to pay the bills, find a NON-FAMILY member that's an accredited investor. The road you're about to travel has been traveled many times before you. And many friendships were ruined and many a families lost money on something they didn't understand and shouldn't have invested in in the first place. Don't do it. Source: have professionally raised (and closed) for three startups and did M amp;A for a Fortune 500 company.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow I don't know why you got down-voted so hard for that. I completely agree -- if the idea is good enough then it should be easy to find non-family money. (Banks are a bad idea though :-) Every founder should earn equity based on merit and contribution to the company. Having rich parents isn't merit-based.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbh, I don't think this really fixes anything. At the end of the day -- even if equity is drawn up without taking financing into account -- s/he who puts in the most money has the loudest voice and the biggest impact. It doesn't matter if they have a board seat or majority voting control -- because if shit goes wrong that stuff is only enforceable by a court. Shockingly, most startups cannot afford such a legal battle and this is where friends  amp; family money goes horribly wrong. Why would anyone WANT to negotiate with their co-founders mom and dad? Talk about huge waste of time/energy. Apply to some accelerators in SF if you're that hard up for funding. They'll accept anyone with a half-baked idea and a decent team. Don't lose your friends, your family, or your idea over deluding yourself into thinking F amp;F is the only path forward. Sorry if this sounds stern or rude... but taking F amp;F money is the most easily avoidable mistake for a startup. Given all the other pressures that cause startups to fail, why take on the burden (and, frankly, stupidity) of F amp;F money? Fight the real fights, not manufactured ones like dealing with your co-founders parents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of the three rounds I've closed, never once did the investor end up with more equity than the founders and never once have said founders put a penny in. I don't have a link handy to prove this, but I'd guess this isn't factually true for most successful startups in SF either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That only happens to companies with no leverage. Of course in fire sale situations where you can't command multiple offers on good terms you can end up in bad spots like this. This is why I qualified my earlier statement by saying "successful startups" shouldn't hemorrhage that much equity in this early of a round.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a former Ohio-an and the CEO of a cannabis company, I can't stress enough how BAD this law is. It's been under prohibition for so long that another 12 months doesn't matter. Get the right law, fight the right fight. Don't fuck it up Ohio, vote no and wait until you can do it correctly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who cares if it's a good shot? A good shot at a bad thing is still a bad thing. Building a sustainable industry is much more important than getting yolo420high with a legalized cartel behind it. It makes me incredibly sad that stoners are getting duped into supporting this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work in the cannabis industry -- everyday with AIDS and epilepsy patients... you're preaching to the choir. The war on drugs is deplorable times a thousand. That doesn't make this law the right way forward. The next generation will look poorly upon everyone who votes for Issue 3 and forces them to put up with a shit cannabis industry in Ohio. From my vantage point: * The CEO of the most important cannabis company in Ohio has come out against Issue 3. * Nearly everyone who has a day job in cannabis (around the country) is against Issue 3. Tbh, saying "think of the kids" is a lame scare tactic used by people pushing shitty laws :-\</TEXT>
