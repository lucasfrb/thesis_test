    <TEXT>Bullshit. Nobody is forcing you to proclaim you want a rapist to be President by voting for him. There are other non-rapist candidates. If you ever condemned Trump's attitudes towards women but then turn around and vote for another rapist, that's the very definition of hypocrisy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Although abhorrent, Trump's view on women is not in the top 3 reasons I don't want him in office. If that's the case, then at least it would mean you're not among the many hypocrites on this. Fair enough, then.  gt; He is doing much more harm in other places that Biden will not. Unfortunately, this point is debatable. Biden has never been known for being stable. For my part, there is an invisible but quite real line that, once crossed, disqualifies any candidate, regardless of who they're running against. Past this event horizon, there is no longer any such thing as "better" or "worse". Anyone who crosses this threshold is, for all practical purposes, infinitely terrible. The fact that [one infinity may technically be larger than the other](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/182186) doesn't mean I'm inclined to vote for either. In this case, both rapists are well past that line. So neither can receive my vote. That directive takes precedence over the flawed notion that your vote only matters if you pick the winner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The two party system is ~~designed~~ rigged that way. There is no such thing as the "two party system". No laws exist that establish our government as such. That's why we have more than two candidates. The idea that only one of two corrupt parties can ever win no matter how despicable the choices they produce, which is certainly being put to the ultimate test now, is a fairly recent one conveniently engineered and distributed to this day by those same corrupt parties. And it's bullshit, as candidates who are not D or R are winning more and more elections across the country. So take that self-serving and increasingly debunked talking point elsewhere because it won't gain any traction here.</TEXT>

Lol yet again ignoring the fact that this cheap rape culture talking point has been repeatedly refuted in numerous threads here already. Such an obvious troll.  gt; Karen Hamilton is a university spokesperson No, she's not. She's a marketing employee speaking from her own personal recollections without official sanction from the university. Hence Karen in marketing, but nice try.  gt; Bwahahahahahahaha.

    <TEXT>Bernie Fucking Sanders. I can vote for whomever the hell I want, got it?  gt; Is Biden great or even good? No. Stop right there. The rest is irrelevant. **You just admitted that Joe Biden is unworthy of the Presidency and has failed to earn our votes.** So he won't get them. But don't worry, neither will Trump. If there are enough neoliberal centrist voters left out there and Biden can energize them, he may win. If not, then the DNC will need to pick a less shitty candidate (or better yet, let the voters make the choice like they currently pretend to do). That's how this works. Either way, our votes don't belong to the Democrats just because they used to be a little bit progressive on some issues. Nor do they belong to the Republicans just because the DNC has been waging war against us. So the outcome between the two rapists will be decided by those who actually think voting for either is somehow a smart thing to do. Our votes don't matter, remember?  gt; offer alternatives. Howie Hawkins. Bernie Sanders. Nina Turner. Tulsi Gabbard. Kshama Sawant. We've been offering alternatives. But now that our numbers have grown, the Democrats have turned to Republican tactics like voter suppression and bullying to keep those alternatives in their place (and us in ours).  gt; our goals and cause Bullshit. We do not share the same goals and cause. The Democrats abandoned the cause long ago so they can fuck off.  gt; Be realistic. We are. Realistically, a vote for either is a vote to continue down the cliff. You're just offering to take the scenic route. What part of "NO MEANS NO!" don't you Biden supporters seem to understand? You lost our votes. Deal with it.</TEXT>

And you responded with even more aggressive trolling, saying there are too few of us for our votes to matter. ProTip: You don't tell an entire voting bloc that they don't matter and then expect them to vote for you.

    <TEXT>Oh, so you did see my response. Then stop spamming that comment on other threads. This is the kind of thing that makes you a troll.  gt; Of course a troll would say NPR is a Biden shilling site. More cheap appeals to authority. Pathetic. Given NPR's behavior in recent years, you're certainly not going to win any hearts and minds here by quoting them lol. But feel free to keep trying.  gt; I #8217;m not sure why you #8217;d find it  #8220;creepy #8221;. Forcing someone to sign a loyalty oath that obligates him to urge his supporters to vote for a candidate who may not represent their values is inherently creepy. Not to mention dishonest.  gt; you have proven to us you are disgusting troll Obvious troll is obvious.</TEXT>
