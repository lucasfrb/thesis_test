    <TEXT>No. Your 8 gauge wire is hooked to a 2pole 50amp breaker. So some light rewireing would be needed. To get this to work you could use the 8 wire but you would have to attach one leg (black) to a single pole 15 or 20 amp breaker and the other leg (white) to the neutral bar. Then at your outlet you would probably have to add a small piece of 14 or 12 gauge wire to each 8 wire just to be able to land it on the receptacle. If this is beyond your comfort level hire a professional. It shouldn #8217;t be an expensive repair.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I am no expert on our standards by any means. But as far as I understand it the two main benefits of metal are 1) should anything happen the entire enclosure is grounded and bonded, the electricity has a uninterrupted path to ground, which, if everything works correctly would trip the circuit breaker and eliminate any further risk. The second benefit and I think this may be more why their standard, is that they #8217;re 100% fire proof for all intents and purposes. Most of our studs are metal and fire rating is like a huge deal around here. I could be wrong and am not saying our stuff makes sense. But that #8217;s what I think is correct</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hey guys, I #8217;m new here and semi new to the diesel world. I #8217;m hoping you can help me avoid making a bad purchase of a 7.3 I #8217;m looking at.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a 2001 4 door, 4x4 with 100k miles. The asking price is 7,800 which feels like a real good deal compared to comps, it #8217;s a work truck with bad interior and Dings and stuff. I know to check for rust etc but I #8217;m hoping you guys could give me a few other things that maybe frequently go bad or signs to look for. I kinda know a little about trucks, enough not to be dumb. But I know you boys know your stuff. Hopefully it #8217;s an ok deal I just don #8217;t want to be fucked by the deal. Thanks in advance anyways.</TEXT>
