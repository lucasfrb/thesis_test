    <TEXT>the list are too long from mg 7.62 penning centurion turret to going outside the map and ghost shell.the more i play the game the problem i encounter, gaijob also like to balance vehicle by increasing their repair cost, tank like ferdi has 14k repair cost while top tier t-64 has 3k repair cost. ironic. there are alot of op tank like object 279 that has same br as is-7 but with stabilizer,better armor and mobility and ka-50 choppa that can kill tank within 10 km radius and has no counter to it. also alot of map are unbalance and small considering tank like leopard 2a5,t-80u,challenger are super fast.this game use br system instead of tier like wot and alot of vehicle need br change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i find its frustrating when germany 7.7 is already bad enough but thats not the point, my main point is those grass absorb 400mm heat shell even the top of the grass absorb it and the hitbox is completely off. when i face russia or british tank that use AP or APHE, they have an advantage especially when im hull down and all i can see is bush in sniper view. if i want to shoot them, i either have to shoot down the bush, exposing my position or let my teammate die. its the one map i hate the most just because of its grass. im kind of a new player 1000 battle.</TEXT>
