    <TEXT>Let us remember... Dr. Li Wenliang warned colleagues on social media in late December about a mysterious virus that would become the coronavirus epidemic and was detained by police in Wuhan on 3 January for  #8220;spreading false rumours #8221;. He was forced to sign a police document to admit he had breached the law and had  #8220;seriously disrupted social order. #8221;  #8220;They owe you an apology, we owe you our gratitude. Take care, Dr Li, #8221; said a Weibo post from Xiakedao, an account under the overseas edition of Communist Party #8217;s People #8217;s Daily.  #8220;Good people don #8217;t live long, but evil lives for a thousand years, #8221; said another post mourning Li #8217;s death, with a candle emoji. An image also posted on Weibo showed a message,  #8220;farewell Li Wenliang #8221;, carved into the snow on a riverbank in Beijing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Moscow will enact an indefinite citywide quarantine starting Monday, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin #160;said #160;as the city's number of coronavirus cases surpassed 1,000 over the weekend. The self-isolation order will apply to all residents regardless of age. According to the decree, Moscow residents will only be allowed to leave their homes for: Emergency medical care; Traveling to work if one is unable to work remotely; Going to the nearest grocery store or pharmacy; Walking pets within a 100-meter radius from their residence; Taking out the garbage. People who leave their homes are ordered to maintain at least a 1.5-meter distance between themselves and others. #160; The Moscow mayor's office will deploy a "smart monitoring" system to enforce the new rules, Sobyanin said, and the city will develop a special pass system for people to get permission to leave their homes. He #160;stressed that there will be no restrictions on entering or leaving the city. Public transportation will also remain open. "The extremely negative turn of events that we are seeing in the largest cities in Europe and the United States has caused great concern for the lives and health of our citizens," Sobyanin wrote on his website. His decree also introduced measures to support those who lose their jobs as a result of the quarantine with unemployment benefits of 19,500 rubles ($250) per month. People with mild cases of coronavirus will be treated at home and will receive anti-viral medication for free. Russia's capital has confirmed 1,014 cases of the coronavirus so far, making it the epicenter of the pandemic within the country. Last week, Sobyanin warned President Vladimir Putin that the number of cases in Russia could be much higher than official numbers suggest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 2019-nCoV coronavirus has caused an epidemic of 28,060 laboratory-confirmed infections in human including 564 deaths in China by February 6, 2020. Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis #160;1,2. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 41 people in Wuhan were found to have the acute respiratory syndrome and 27 of them had contact with Huanan Seafood Market #160;3. The 2019-nCoV was found in 33 out of 585 samples collected in the market after the outbreak. The market was suspicious to be the origin of the epidemic, and was shut down according to the rule of quarantine the source during an epidemic. The bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were normally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated district of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the bats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus, yet little proof has been reported. Was there any other possible pathway? We screened the area around the seafood market and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus. Within ~280 meters from the market, there was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control  amp; Prevention WHCDC hosted animals in laboratories for research purpose, one of which was specialized in pathogens collection and identification #160;4- 6. In one of their studies, 155 bats including #160;Rhinolophus affinis #160;were captured in Hubei province, and other 450 bats were captured in Zhejiang province #160;4. The expert in collection was noted in the Author Contributions (JHT). Moreover, he was broadcasted for collecting viruses on nation-wide newspapers and websites in 2017 and 2019 #160;7,8. He described that he was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin. He knew the extreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days #160;7. In another accident, he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him. He was once thrilled for capturing a bat carrying a live tick #160;8. Surgery was performed on the caged animals and the tissue samples were collected for DNA and RNA extraction and sequencing #160;4, 5. The tissue samples and contaminated trashes were source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market. The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic. It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study. The second laboratory was ~12 kilometers from the seafood market and belonged to Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences #160;1, 9, 10. This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic #160;9. The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using The SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence #160;10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory. In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety level may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these laboratories far away from city center and other densely populated places. Contributors BX designed the comment and performed literature search. All authors performed data acquisition and analysis, collected documents, draw the figure, and wrote the papers.

    <TEXT>April 6 21: 06 from iPhone XR #160; "Man-made Disaster" #160; My father just a few days off life support, today unexpectedly scheduled to leave hospital. You read correctly he is "discharged!" The reason is my father #8217;s Nucleic acid test is negative. New Crown cured must be discharged. My poor dad, tracheotomy, lot of sputum. Beijing harmony doctor said there must be an hour of inhalation, otherwise there's a risk of reinfection. #160; His head #160; amp; body still have all sorts of tubes, who is, unexpectedly releasing him? Caidian epidemic prevention command called me in the morning, said "Your father is Nucleic acid negative, there are other complications we are arranging for him to go to the central hospital in Caidian, mother  amp; child health care," I wonder, my father is still very serious, is the mother  amp; child hospital capable? #160; The hospital said "Rest assured, they can not treat us. We will report to the central hospital, the superior unit. They will treat him properly. They promised me that my mother can accompany him, will arrange them a room. #160; I feel stupid. I believed them  amp; when I took my mother to the Tsai Dian Women/Children's hospital, I found that it was basically a quarantine. Help!! Where there was no medical equipment, the doctors could not treat them, and I couldn't help it. #160; It was easy for them to figure out how to suck sputum. Maybe they realized that my father really couldn't be cured. My mother, my poor mother. She thought seeing my father out of danger would help him improve his cerebral infarction by spending another 14 days in isolation  amp; talking to him slowly. #160; She knows he is so miserable, I carefully hid it a month, my father #8217;s right hand necrosis thing, she also found. Crying Yangchun, this is your piano hand! My character would never let me sit idly by. #160; From 2 to 9pm #160; I called the district epidemic prevention command, city epidemic prevention HQ, mayor hotline, health committee, Tongji zhongfa hospital, all calls, every place is called! Every response seems to make sense. Mayor hotline: you don't worry, we are urgently handling this! #160; City epidemic prevention headquarters: We are all regional management system, transfer hospital is right in Caidian district. District epidemic prevention headquarters: New crown discharged patients, the city requires only a designated hospital isolation. #160; This is the only hospital in our district. #160; Tongji Zhongfa hospital: We just transfer patients now, the hospital will be clean. My father, difficult days he has survived, medical workers run the most serious hospitals. #160; Now, each hospital wants to empty today and unexpectedly no one can treat him and no hospital can accept him! #160; You should feel sorry, Beijing harmony medical team. You fought hard to keep my father from death, but now because of regional restrictions, forced clearance of hospitals, all departments push my father in the door of death, struggling on the line! #160; Man-made disaster! You are only sorry that the country has spent so much human, material and financial resources to help Wuhan!!!

On January 21, China's head of state Xi Jinping during a phone call with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked to withhold information about a person-to-person transmission and to postpone a pandemic warning.

    <TEXT>**\[For those behind paywall\]** **Over 100 Million in China #8217;s Northeast Face Renewed Lockdown** Bloomberg News May 18, 2020, 2:58 PM GMT+8 #160;*Updated on #160;May 18, 2020, 5:42 PM GMT+8* Some 108 million people in China #8217;s northeast region are being plunged back under lockdown conditions as a new and growing cluster of infections causes a backslide in the nation #8217;s return to normal. In an abrupt reversal of the re-opening taking place across the nation, cities in Jilin province have cut off trains and buses, shut schools and quarantined tens of thousands of people. The strict measures have dismayed many residents who had thought the worst of the nation #8217;s epidemic was over. People  #8220;are feeling more cautious again, #8221; said Fan Pai, who works at a trading company in Shenyang, a city in nearby Liaoning province that #8217;s also facing renewed restrictions.  #8220;Children playing outside are wearing masks again #8221; and health care workers are walking around in protective gear, she said.  #8220;It #8217;s frustrating because you don #8217;t know when it will end. #8221; While the cluster of 34 infections isn #8217;t growing as quickly the outbreak in Wuhan which started the global pandemic last December, China #8217;s swift and powerful reaction reflects its fear of a second wave after it curbed the virus #8217;s spread at great economic and social cost. It #8217;s also a sign of how fragile the re-opening process will be in China and elsewhere as even the slightest hint of a resurgence of infections could prompt a return to strict lockdown. The government of Shulan, a city in Jilin, #160;[said](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI0NTE0NTg0Mw== amp;mid=2657453613 amp;idx=3 amp;sn=bc8306fdca32a21a326282ce21cb72ae amp;chksm=f2c22fb1c5b5a6a7ad7a2a9a313fff5a26d1b2f67fc2778c53c70f9401994db506a22a545aa0 amp;mpshare=1 amp;scene=1 amp;srcid= amp;sharer_sharetime=1589777881140 amp;sharer_shareid=8188a18791dc8accdfc7b34b5c91b124 amp;exportkey=ARHh7ONWGDsYBaA4%2FxlpHb4%3D amp;pass_ticket=W%2BmhHduOIiQpXoknih2u2l8LSjSkeeML%2FWuimYy9kBDLrv1CgN7S5RnzIISDzCEq#rd) #160;on WeChat Monday it would put in place its strictest measures yet to contain the virus. Residential compounds with confirmed or suspected cases will be closed off, with only one person from each family allowed to leave to purchase essentials for two hours every two days. Shen Jia, a Shenyang-based salesman at a life sciences company, canceled a three-day business trip to Jilin city last week because he would have been quarantined for as long as 21 days on his return. A state-owned restaurant he visited last week separated his party of three because only two people are allowed at each table, a restriction that had been eased weeks ago before being re-instated.  #8220;You can #160;feel #160;that control is stricter, #8221; he said. People  #8220;have been more careful and reduced outdoor activities. #8221; A sense of deja vu is permeating Jilin city, which underwent the same strict lockdown implemented in most of China in February and March despite only reporting daily cases in the single digits then. Overall, Jilin province #8217;s total cases stand at 127; Hubei province had 68,000. Still, delivery services have been mostly halted and anti-fever medication is banned at drugstores to prevent people from hiding their symptoms. The tension has spread to nearby areas, even if no cases have been reported officially in those places yet.  #8220;Everyone is #160;jittery, #8221; said Wang Yuemei, a pharmaceutical factory worker in neighboring Tonghua.  #8220;I never ever expected Jilin province to be a hard-hit area when the whole country is getting back to normal now. #8221; After facing global criticism for its delayed response to Wuhan #8217;s outbreak, President Xi Jinping #8217;s administration is taking visible steps to stop the spread of the virus in the northeast. Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who led the central government #8217;s virus task force in Wuhan, #160;[arrived](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QAF3WBMB2SJO) #160;in Jilin city on May 13. The highest-ranking Communist Party official of Shulan, where the new cluster #8217;s first infection emerged, was removed on Saturday along with five other cadres. Pressure to contain the infections is even greater with China #8217;s annual political meetings scheduled to commence this week in Beijing after being delayed from their usual March date. Thousands of political delegates will gather in the capital to endorse the government #8217;s agenda from Friday and the central leadership is determined to project stability and calm during this period. Health officials do not yet know how the new cluster started, but suspect that the patients may have come into contact with infected returnees from Russia, which has one of the worst outbreaks in Europe. Those in charge of transporting potentially infected arrivals from abroad to centralized quarantine centers need to do a better job, said Wang Bin, a National Health Commission official, during a briefing on Sunday.  #8220;Imported cases from overseas and clustered infections domestically have created dual pressure on us in containing the virus, #8221; she said. The new cluster is also a reminder that much of China still remains vulnerable to the virus because its first wave of infection was largely confined to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, thanks to a lockdown that sealed the region off from the rest of the country in January.  #8220;The majority of Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to the Covid-19 infection #8221; because of a lack of herd immunity, top Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan #160;[told](https://us.cnn.com/2020/05/18/asia/china-world-health-assembly-investigation-intl-hnk/index.html) #160;CNN over the weekend. The nation is facing a  #8220;big challenge, #8221; he said, adding that the situation in China is  #8220;not better than foreign countries. #8221; Videos circulating on Chinese social media showed some senior high school students in tears when they were told to leave their campus because they #8217;d lose precious time to prepare for their college entrance exams due in two months.  #8220;It #8217;s really unfortunate for us to encounter the epidemic at this point of time, #8221; said Zhou Han, an 18-year-old student in Jilin.  #8220;I #8217;m anxious because I can #8217;t prepare for the exam well without last-minute instruction and supervision by my teachers. #8221;  #8212; With assistance by Sharon Chen, Claire Che, and Feifei Shen</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At least 5,505,307 infections including 346,188 deaths have been recorded, notably in Europe, the hardest-hit continent with 2,047,401 cases and 172,824 deaths, and the United States with 1,662,768 cases and 98,223 deaths. The number of declared cases in the world has doubled in a month, and more than one million new cases of COVID-19 have been registered in the last 11 days. The number of diagnosed cases however reflects only a fraction of the actual number of infections as many countries test only serious cases or lack testing capacity. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>COVID-19 was announced in Wuhan (China) in early December in 2019 and it would reach every place worldwide later, including Europe. The first case in Europe was announced in France in late January 2020. This chronology on the evolution of the disease can change according to a study led by the University of Barcelona, in collaboration with Aig #252;es de Barcelona.  #160; Researchers detected the presence of the virus that caused the disease in samples of waste water in Barcelona, collected in March 12, 2019. These results, sent to a high impact journal and published in the archive #160;medRxiv, suggest the infection was present before knowing about any case of COVID-19 in any part of the world.  #160;  #160; This study, which counts on the participation of the researchers of theGroup on Enteric Virus #160;of the UB Gemma Chavarria Mir #243;, Eduard Anfruns Estrada and Susana Guix, led by Rosa Maria Pint #243; and Albert Bosch, is part of the project on sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. This initiative is coordinated by this research group, in collaboration with Aig #252;es de Barcelona and funded by the REVEAL project, from the company SUEZ, in order to detect the virus in waste waters and adopt immediate measures considering future COVID-19 outbreaks.  #160; An early detection tool  #160; Although COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, researchers proved there are large quantities of the coronavirus genome in the excrements that reach waste waters. This situation made the waste water-based epidemiology a potential tool for an early detection of the circulation of the virus among population, especially considering the important presence of asymptomatic people, especially considering the important presence of asymptomatic and asymptomatic people who transmit the virus. As part of the sentinel surveillance project, and after April 13, the researchers analysed weekly the obtained samples in two big water treatment plants in Barcelona.  #8220;The levels of the SARS-CoV-2 genome coincided with the evolution of COVID-19 cases in the population #8221;, notes Albert Bosch, professor at the Faculty of Biology of the UB and coordinator of the study.  #160; COVID-19 cases hidden by the flu.  #160; Later, researchers analysed frozen samples from previous months to the systematic sampling, which revealed the growing apparition of SARS-CoV-2 genome between early January and early March in 2020, bringing the chronology of the coronavirus arrival in Spain even earlier: the presence of the virus was detected in January 15, 41 days before the announcement of the first case of COVID-19, which was announced on February 25. According to the researchers, these results show the validity of the surveillance of waste waters to anticipate cases, specially considering the significant contribution of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers in the spreading of the virus.  #8220;Those infected with COVID-19 could have been diagnosed with flu in primary care by mistake, contributing to the community transmission before the public health took measures #8221;, notes Albert Bosch, also president of the Spanish Society of Virology.  #8220;In the specific case of Barcelona  #8211;the virologist continues #8211;, having detected the SARS-CoV-2 spread a month before could have improved the response to the pandemic #8221;.  #160; Analysis of frozen samples from 2018 and 2019  #160; These results encouraged the researchers to analyse some frozen samples between January 2018 and December 2019, with the shocking results of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in March 2019, before any notification of COVID-19 cases in the world.  #8220;All samples were negatives regarding the SARS-CoV-2 genome presence except for March 12, 2019, in which the levels of SARS-CoV-2 were low but were positive, using two different targets #8221;, says the researcher.  #8220;Barcelona receives many visitors for both tourist and professional reasons,  #8211;continues Bosch #8211;, and it is possible for a similar situation to have taken place in other parts of the world, and since most of the COVID-19 cases show a similar symptomatology to the flu, those cases could have been disguised as an undiagnosed flu #8221;.  #160; Models in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological surveillance  #160; The Group on Enteric Viruses is also in charge of the scientific coordination of a project on the SARS-CoV-2 sentinel surveillance in waste waters in Spain, funded by the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge. This task counts on the participation of two groups from CSIC, the Institute of Agrochemistry and Food Technology (IATA-CSIC) and the Centre of Edafology and Applied Biology of Segura (CEBAS), as well as a group from the University of Santiago de Compostela. Moreover, together with the research group Microbiology of Water related to the Health (MARS) of the UB, led by Anicet Blanch, coordinates the surveillance of the same virus in Spanish waters. Last, this group also takes part in a monitoring project on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in waste waters in the entrance of Catalan treatment plants, funded by the Catalan Water Agency and coordinated by the Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA). Another participant in this project is the Research Group on Virus, bacteria and protozoans of water interest in and food (VIRBAP) of the UB.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THE DEPARTMENT OF Health has confirmed that a further six patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have died and there are 23 new cases of the disease in Ireland. The figures were released by the Department this evening. It brings the total number of confirmed cases here to 25,437. It also brings the death toll from Covid-19 in Ireland to 1,734, including two denotifications of deaths which were previously reported as a result of the virus. #160; The increase in the number of new cases to 23 has prompted concerns within the Department of Health. #160;  #8220;High levels of compliance to public health advice to date has enabled further reopening of economic and social life, #8221; Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan said. #160;  #8220;However, of the 23 cases reported today, 10 cases  #8211; 43%  #8211; are in younger adults aged under 35 years. A further 8 cases  #8211; 35%  #8211; are in those aged between 35-54. This is now a real concern and a worrying trend at a time when many people are reconnecting with friends and loved ones and may be gathering in larger groups.  #8220;In recent days, for example, some cases have had large numbers of close contacts that have required testing and self-isolation for 14 days. Covid-19 is an infection that affects all ages and it is incumbent on all of us to take our individual responsibility seriously. #8221; We are two days out from entering Phase 3 of the roadmap out of lockdown. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and barbers, are all preparing to reopen within public guidelines.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This coronavirus mutation has taken over the world. Scientists are trying to understand why. When the first #160;coronavirus #160;cases in Chicago appeared in January, they bore the same genetic signatures as a germ that emerged in China weeks before. But as Egon Ozer, an infectious-disease specialist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, examined the genetic structure of virus samples from local patients, he noticed something different. A change in the virus was appearing again and again. This mutation, associated with outbreaks in Europe and New York, eventually took over the city. By May, it was found in 95 percent of all the genomes Ozer sequenced. At a glance, the mutation seemed trivial. About 1,300 amino acids serve as building blocks for a protein on the surface of the virus. In the mutant virus, the genetic instructions for just one of those amino acids  #8212; number 614  #8212; switched in the new variant from a  #8220;D #8221; (shorthand for aspartic acid) to a  #8220;G #8221; (short for glycine). But the location was significant, because the switch occurred in the part of the genome that codes for the all-important  #8220;spike protein #8221;  #8212; the protruding structure that gives the coronavirus its crownlike profile and allows it to enter human cells the way a burglar picks a lock. And its ubiquity is undeniable. Of the approximately 50,000 genomes of the new virus that researchers worldwide have uploaded to a shared database, about 70 percent carry the mutation, officially designated D614G but known more familiarly to scientists as  #8220;G. #8221; Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a series of characteristic spikes surrounding its core. These spikes are what allow the virus to attach to human cells. A mutation affecting the virus's spike protein changed amino acid 614 from  #8220;D #8221; (aspartic acid) to  #8220;G #8221; (glycine). Research suggests that this small change  #8212; which affects three identical amino acid chains  #8212; might make the spike protein more effective, enhancing the virus #8217;s infectiousness.  #8220;G #8221; hasn #8217;t just dominated the outbreak in Chicago  #8212; it has taken over the world. Now scientists are racing to figure out what it means. At least four laboratory experiments suggest that the mutation makes the virus more infectious, although none of that work has been peer-reviewed. Another unpublished study led by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory asserts that patients with the G variant actually have more virus in their bodies, making them more likely to spread it to others. The mutation doesn #8217;t appear to make people sicker, but a growing number of scientists worry that it has made the virus more contagious.  #8220;The epidemiological study and our data together really explain why the [G variant #8217;s] spread in Europe and the U.S. was really fast, #8221; said Hyeryun Choe, a virologist at Scripps Research and lead author of an unpublished study on the G variant #8217;s enhanced infectiousness in laboratory cell cultures.  #8220;This is not just accidental. #8221; But there may be other explanations for the G variant #8217;s dominance: biases in where genetic data are being collected, quirks of timing that gave the mutated virus an early foothold in susceptible populations.  #8220;The bottom line is, we haven #8217;t seen anything definitive yet, #8221; said Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

The insertion PRRA together with the sequentially preceding seven amino acids and succeeding Arg (fully conserved among  #946;-coronaviruses) have been pointed out to form a motif, Y674QTQTNSPRRAR685, homologous to that of neurotoxins from #160;Ophiophagus (cobra) and Bungarus genera, as well as neurotoxin-like regions from three RABV strains.

They seem to use anger and bitterness as a way to hide from reality. I'm also certain some of them are being paid to come on here and downvote anything Wuhan Lab related. That Ireland sub is full to capacity with the stupidest cunts I have ever encountered. Remember they had that banner of a bottle of corona mocking coronavirus. Rusty Remembers. They removed any posts we shared from here in the beginning too. Outrageous carry on altogether. We were laughed at for wearing masks in January/February. Now we can go to prison for not wearing one. Called conspiracy theorists and doomers when we talked about it being Airborne, Wave 2, HIV and it being leaked accidentally on purpose from the Wuhan institute of virology. Keep up the good fight my friend. Never give up, never surrender.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sign the petition today to:  #160; Condemn the CCP for its crimes against humanity. Demand that your government begin investigations into CCP subversion within your country; and hold the CCP responsible for the damage it has caused both financially and in terms of lives lost around the world. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is directly responsible for the current global pandemic that has caused a staggering death count and the loss of businesses, jobs, and income.  #160; The CCP lied about the origin of the outbreak and covered it up, costing the world six valuable weeks of preparation. The virus started in central China, and might have been contained there #8212;but instead, it was allowed to spread, creating a global pandemic.  #160; Unfortunately, the virus is only the tip of the iceberg. For decades, the CCP has been actively undermining the economies, national security, and moral fabric of nations around the world.  #160; It steals from wealthy nations, such as the United States, through cyberattacks and intellectual property theft, and enslaves developing countries through debt-traps.  #160; It has infiltrated vital institutions around the world #8212;such as universities, news media, governing bodies, and international organizations like the United Nations. Furthermore, the CCP uses its propaganda channels to promote its wicked ideology and lies around the world in an effort to sow discord and cover up its own crimes.  #160; Those who have been the greatest victims of the CCP have been the Chinese people. An estimated 65 million Chinese people have died as a result of the CCP #8217;s tyrannical rule over the past 70 years #8212;with the real number believed to be much higher. To this day, the CCP #8217;s persecution campaigns continue, including the forced harvesting of organs from prisoners of conscience.</TEXT>

Under the measures agreed by cabinet, people will be advised to work from home and to avoid using public transport, unless absolutely necessary.

    <TEXT>It's the biggest load of shite ever. They're definitely making this up as they go. We're going to end up closing the restaurants and hotels due to greedy fucking management taking as many bookings as possible to make up for lost profits. Lots of places not giving a shite. No time for proper hand washing when you're up the shits with too many booked in. This isn't going to end well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two Swedish laboratories have discovered deficiencies in a CE-marked so-called test kit that was used to show if you have an ongoing covid-19 infection. #160;Due to the error, the test method could not distinguish between low levels of covid-19 virus and negative sample. The error has led to about 3,700 people sampled with self-sampling in nine different regions (see list below) have probably received false positive answers. #160;They have thus been incorrectly informed that they have a covid-19 infection. All concerned will be contacted no later than Thursday 27 August about what happened and have their test results withdrawn. #160;Since it has been several weeks since the current samples were taken, it does not make sense to take a new sample for the then suspected infection. #160;However, those concerned will be offered a free antibody test by each care provider in their region. #160;An antibody test can in some cases detect the covid-19 review. #160; The two laboratories, with the support of the Swedish Public Health Agency and the regions concerned, have investigated the shortcomings and can state that the test kit does not maintain the quality specified by the supplier. #160;The two affected laboratories, the National Pandemic Center at Karolinska Institutet and ABC-labs, have rectified the identified deficiencies and all samples that have been analyzed after 15 August are correct. The error occurred in a CE-marked commercial test kit made in China by BGI Biotechnology (WUHAN) Co. #160;Ltd. #160;CE marking means that the product must comply with basic requirements for, for example, health and safety and that a certain control procedure has been followed. #160;The test kit has been exported from China to many other countries besides Sweden. #160;The Swedish Public Health Agency has informed the corresponding authorities in Europe and the WHO of what happened. #160;The incorrect test kit has also been reported to the Medical Products Agency. The two laboratories have analyzed samples from several regions, including Stockholm and V #228;stra G #246;taland. #160;It is mainly people who have had mild symptoms or have not felt any symptoms at the time of the test who have received false positive answers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to neuropilin in the same location as the vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which has been linked to cancer and other serious diseases. As corresponding author Dr. Rajesh Khanna explained,  #8220;we stepped back and realized this could mean that maybe the spike protein is involved in some sort of pain processing. #8221; Khanna and his team performed various lab experiments on rodents, using VEGF-A to induce pain. Then, they added the SARS-CoV-2 protein. This  #8220;completely reversed the VEGF-induced pain signaling. It didn #8217;t matter if we used very high doses of spike or extremely low doses  #8212; it reversed the pain completely, #8221; said Khanna. https://www.inquisitr.com/6310246/virus-covid19-relieve-pain/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The State needs to move to Level 5 in the Covid-19 roadmap as measures currently in place are not sufficiently controlling the disease as evidenced by the  #8220;high volume of community transmission #8221;, public health officials have told the Government. The letter sent on Sunday by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, seen by The Irish Times, warns of a  #8220;significant and deteriorating #8221; epidemiological situation. It recommends that Level 5 measures be introduced from midnight tonight for four weeks. It says NPHET is sensitive to the impact on businesses, individuals and families but that the action is  #8220;the only opportunity to get this disease back under control while keeping schools open #8221;. It says a graduated approach would ultimately result in Level 5 measures being put in place, whereas an immediate enactment of the harshest measures will prevent deaths, protect vulnerable people and enable schools to remain open.  #8220;The proposed measures will only be effective if there is broad societal buy in and adherence over the coming four week period, #8221; it warns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It can go two ways. China already has a vaccine and let this out on purpose. Or worse again, WIV didn't have enough research done on the virus and were left clueless about a vaccine once it leaked. I believe we can get a vaccine once China provides all the CORRECT information about SARS-CoV-2 or we send an independent investigation team to Wuhan that isn't the W.H.O.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two theories: One is the nature theory and the other is the theory of lab origins. The existing scientific publications supporting a natural origin theory rely heavily on a previously discovered bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which shares a 96% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2. However, I contest the existence of RATG13 in nature. Also, we live in a time when viral genomes can be engineered and manipulated to create novel coronaviruses. There has been a highly probable pathway for the laboratory creation of SARS-CoV-2 and the evidence is present in the viral genome. Also, let me tell you that as per the natural evolution there may be a chance that the virus comes from animals through an intermediate host and jumps onto humans but that takes a very, very long time and coincidences such as bat meets a suitable intermediate host and bat virus luckily adapts to the new host, etc. Meanwhile, nature origins can also be mimicked in laboratories. Here, the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is suspiciously similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories and the RBM that is, the receptor binding motif within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 which determines the host specificity of the virus is suspiciously similar to that of SARS-CoV of 2003 and so between these two viruses there is a series of laboratory procedures that have happened. The genomic evidence suggests that the RBM has been genetically manipulated. Also, SARS-CoV-2 contains this unique furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction of the lineage B of Beta coronavirus, which is otherwise completely absent in all other coronaviruses that can be found in nature. So then there is every possibility that this furin cleavage site has been inserted by man into the SARS-CoV-2 genome. So all that is needed is a backbone to create the virus and for this particular present novel coronavirus, a bat coronavirus ZC45 and/or ZXC21 come to be the closest backbone or shares the highest sequence identity with SARS-CoV2. Now, this backbone or template has already been existing with Chinese authorities ever since they were discovered in 2015 by labs in China. Once the template is available, it is just a matter of reconstruction of all the procedure of the virus from the bat coronavirus to the one that targets human beings. I'm also certain that although SARS-CoV-2 is created using Zc45/ZXC21, during its creation, changes must have been introduced to obscure the genetic connection between the two. From the very beginning, the scientific world tried to ignore the man-made lab origin theory. But they cannot explain why the bat coronavirus can travel into human and become much like humans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Researchers at Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, found that the Sars-Cov-2 virus remained infectious for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as plastic banknotes and glass found on mobile phone screens. By comparison, Influenza A virus has been found to survive on surfaces for 17 days. The study was published in Virology Journal. CSIRO's research involved drying the virus in an artificial mucus on a range of surfaces at concentrations similar to samples from Covid-19 patients and then extracting the virus after a month. Experiments done in controlled laboratory environments at 20C, 30C and 40C showed that the survival time declined as the temperature increased.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coronavirus #160;is being spread through people #8217;s homes by visitors pressing doorbells, using towels and sharing cutlery, T #225;naiste #160;Leo Varadkar #160;has warned. Explaining why there was a need to ban home visits across the country, Mr Varadkar said there was a fundamental difference in people #8217;s Covid-behaviour in domestic settings.  #8220;At home people aren #8217;t [taking safety precautions] so much. Some people think it #8217;s the student house parties . . . there #8217;s a bit of that but actually what is happening in much greater volumes is the family dinner at the weekend, it #8217;s the few friends over for drinks, #8221; he said, including children #8217;s play-dates in the mix of scenarios responsible for potentially dangerous, otherwise normal social interactions.  #8220;People are getting too close to each other, they are staying together for too long, #8221; he said.  #8220;They #8217;re passing the virus by pressing the doorbell, by sharing a spoon, by using the bathroom and leaving it on a towel. All of those things have spread disease and that is why we #8217;ve had to do this. #8221; The T #225;naiste was explaining the latest set of social restrictions brought into play by the Government on Wednesday in a bid to curb increasing case numbers, which #160;breached 1,200 on Thursday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;One of the world #8217;s biggest trials of COVID-19 therapies released its long-awaited interim results yesterday #8212;and they #8217;re a letdown. None of the four treatments in the Solidarity trial, which enrolled more than 11,000 patients in 400 hospitals around the globe, increased survival #8212;not even the much-touted antiviral drug remdesivir. Scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) released the data #160;as a preprint on medRxiv #160;last night, ahead of its planned publication in #160;The #160;New England Journal of Medicine.  gt;Yet scientists praised the unprecedented study itself and the fact that it helped bring clarity about four existing,  #8221;repurposed #8221; treatments that each held some promise against COVID-19.  #8220;It's disappointing that none of the four have come out and shown a difference in mortality, but it does show why you need big trials, #8221; says Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust.  #8220;We would love to have a drug that works, but it #8217;s better to know if a drug works or not than not to know and continue to use it, #8221; says WHO #8217;s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan.  gt;The prospects of two of the four treatments #8212;the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the HIV drug combination ritonavir/lopinavir #8212;had faded after another large study, the United Kingdom #8217;s Recovery trial, #160;showed they did not increase survival #160;in June. After analyzing that study and its own data up till then, WHO decided to drop both from the study.  gt;Remdesivir, which attacks a specific enzyme in several RNA viruses and was previously tested against Ebola, was initially seen as a promising candidate. In a U.S. trial with more than 1000 COVID-19 patients #160;published last week, those who received remdesivir had a shorter recovery time than patients in the control group, but there was no significant difference in mortality. Two smaller trials found few significant benefits. Remdesivir received an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May for severe COVID-19 patients that was later expanded to include all patients.  gt;But the Solidarity trial suggests the drug does little in severe cases. Of 2743 hospitalized patients who received the drug, 11% died, versus 11.2% in a control group of roughly the same size. The difference is so small it could have arisen by chance.  gt;When the authors pooled Solidarity #8217;s data with those from the three other trials, they found a slight reduction in mortality that wasn #8217;t statistically significant either. "This absolutely excludes the suggestion that remdesivir can prevent a substantial fraction of all deaths, #8220; the authors write. "The confidence interval is comfortably compatible with prevention of a small fraction of all deaths but is also comfortably compatible with prevention of no deaths. #8221;  gt; #8220;This trial doesn #8217;t help remdesivir, that #8217;s for sure, #8221; says Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute.  #8220;It's not a dead duck as much as hydroxychloroquine, but it certainly is not the hope that was initially signaled. #8221;</TEXT>
