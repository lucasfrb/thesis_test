    <TITLE>I fucking regret harming to the point of nerve damage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-07 10:58:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Long story FYI and fuckton of swearing lol Basically my biggest regret is getting serious fucking nerve damage. It was a c#t on the inside of my wrist about 1/4 of the way up my forearm. The second I did it there was this lightning bolt feeling that shot from the c#t all the way up my wrist, through my hand and up my finger tips. I instantly went oh shit I have absolutely fucked up this time. Went to emergency as usual to get stitches, and as per normal they do the whole  #8220;bend your arm, bend your hand, put pressure against me, can you feel everything when I touch here etc #8221; and I basically sitting there shitting myself and went  #8220;I can #8217;t feel half my hand #8221;. The triage nurse kinda sighed and basically said the feeling won #8217;t come back. I hit the median nerve and I #8217;m SO fucking LUCKY it affected the back of my hand not the inside of my hand. Part of me didn #8217;t even compute what the nurse said. I was so shitty with myself for letting it happen. It #8217;s hard to explain it #8217;s feeling. It #8217;s both numb and constant pins and needles. I can #8217;t feel temperature with it and have accidentally burnt myself with hot water because I didn #8217;t realise it was too hot. It fucking KILLS when there #8217;s pressure anywhere from where the c#t and wrist to the back of my hand. Anything from a light touch to a firm push is agony in certain spots. Honestly I #8217;m still in disbelief I #8217;ve lived with this for like 5 years now. It #8217;s just...there. I can touch my finger tips on the outside under the nail and feel this tingling in my wrist, and I can touch my wrist and feel a tingle in my fingers. It #8217;s fucking weird. I hate that my hand will always be like this. Most fucked up part is even after I did this c#t I kept c#tting lmao but never in that spot on my arm again either left or right arm. Too fucking risky because I #8217;ve done irreversible damage now and don #8217;t want more serious nerve damage (I #8217;ve got lots of random spots of nerve damage on my arms but my hand is the worst shit). TL;DR nerve damage fucking sucks and my hand is just gunna be fucked forever over a single c#t I made 5 years ago rip Sorry edit because I forgot how italics works here - EDIT: Holy crap this rant got a lot more attention than I expected. Can I just say thank you for the kind words, this hasn #8217;t been easy for me to deal with at all. I #8217;m a year clean now from harming. I also want to raise this though. THIS WASN #8217;T EVEN THAT DEEP OF A C*T. You might think I #8217;m just saying that, but trust me, my arms have had much deeper wounds, and this was kind of at the  #8220;start #8221; of me harming (I #8217;d only been harming a year and a bit and then harmed another 4 years after that sadly). You are literally DANCING AROUND IMPORTANT NERVES every time you do this, especially on your arms. I #8217;m being incredibly serious right now. Nerve damage is no joke, and I think the SH community doesn #8217;t have enough visibility on this. I wasn #8217;t just left with a scar this time. I was left with lifelong nerve damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, I really don #8217;t wish this upon anyone else. I had the same mindset of  #8220;it #8217;s not like anything bad will happen to me #8221; and thinking all that comes out of self harming is scars. I #8217;m a year clean now and have just started uni after never finishing school :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is a very odd feeling. The worst part for me is how bad pressure on certain areas are and I need to be careful to avoid the sting feeling that comes with it. Oddly, this wasn #8217;t a terribly bad c#t. I wasn #8217;t at any risk of bleeding out at all, and since it was stitched the infection chances are low. This was just me hitting the wrong place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly! It #8217;s just this total conflict of numb and sensitivity and when it #8217;s in a large area different areas are more sensitive or more numb but overall it just feels  #8220;off #8221;. Obviously after dealing with it for 5 years your subconscious kinda forgets it, but when something touches it unexpectedly it #8217;s such a jolt of pain. I feel like the luckiest person alive that it affected the outside of my hand and fingers and not my palm and inside my fingers, honestly life would be so different and hard I cannot imagine coping with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s hard because I know arms are one of the main targets for people. All I have to say is just 1 mistake and the harm goes from being just a scar that fades with time to permanent damage that won #8217;t go away</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s the stinging pins and needles I find the hardest, if it was just numb I #8217;d find it easier. I have random spots on both arms of nerve damage but it #8217;s generally just affecting a small area around the scar and often just completely numb, no pain at all. But I have a sensation on my hand that you get when part of your body falls asleep and it #8217;s just fuzzy and hurts, but instead of going away after the blood flow returns, it #8217;s been there 5 years and pressure on it amplifies the pain. It sucks so bad. Hopefully having numbness on your hip isn #8217;t really uncomfortable, please be careful though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven #8217;t done it for a year now, and last year I only did it a couple of times. Before that I #8217;d been 2 years or so without it. But after I did the hand nerve damage I was still doing it heaps around that time. I was just very unwell and didn #8217;t care enough that I could make it worse or do more</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been on a lot of different meds over the years and seen psych services regularly/weekly for a fair bit of that too (and still do). Honestly I #8217;m not really sure how I #8217;ve gotten better than I was. I think what helped was having a lot of reflection? Really analysing my past and accepting things for what they are, and I finally after 6 years had a goal in life other than to die</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When we #8217;re unwell our mind really doesn #8217;t view the world right. There #8217;s no better way to put it. I know you feel they #8217;re not that bad or think you can barely see your scars, but you #8217;re still harming yourself. You #8217;re causing damage. You get in a cycle of hurting yourself and still not realising that it #8217;s bad. You might not view them as prominent now but later things could change and you #8217;ll realise that even though you say  #8220;not that bad #8221; they were worse than your mind told you to believe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m actually trying to get off my medication, reducing them gradually in the hopes one day I won #8217;t need to down pills in the morning and night. I know some people find meds really help but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s always the answer. And I don #8217;t think meds alone can ever fix you completely. My goal is to try and do art, I want to be an artist, so I #8217;ve started studying again. I #8217;ve had a lot of therapy, different people different techniques. I love my current psychologist, I met him in 2015 and he #8217;s been a huge help. Finding the right psychologist makes a big difference. I met a lot of shit ones before him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could pass it off as a surgery scar? Often surgery scars that are required on forearms are long and have been stitched back together in a similar fashion. If someone asks what happened you could say  #8220;I just had a bad arm injury that needed to be repaired #8221; (technically not even a lie). And if they want more details you can just say  #8220;It was awhile ago and I #8217;d rather not discuss it anymore #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Legit don #8217;t want to melt in this summer, it #8217;s spring and already getting warmer and warmer. But the thought of classmates and teachers seeing my harm gives me such panic. I dunno if I can do it. I posted a story in /selfharm but I #8217;m fucking freaking out about the fucking scars and legit just more scared than ever. I hate my scars with a passion. Fucking sick of having this constant reminder on my body. Yet still wanna bloody do it every day lmao even though I haven #8217;t done it for a year. Sometimes I just have the mindset  #8220;my arms are already fucked anyway lol why does it matter if I just hurt them even more #8221; but after every relapse I #8217;ve had I just wish I fucking didn #8217;t. It #8217;s never as good as I remember. Every time I hurt myself after a break I #8217;m just like  #8220;wtf why do I do this, this fucking sucks #8221; because I hate cleaning up blood and going to emergency and wound care and having to shift my whole life around waiting for healing to happen. I really think the negative outweighs the positive for me. Yet still something about it made it worth it and idek what the fuck that was. Wanna cry though thinking about classmates and teachers seeing my arms. You guys that have enough confidence to just go  #8220;fuck you world I #8217;m sick of hiding #8221; are beyond brave.

    <DATE>2020-09-13 00:31:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I started losing weight awhile ago and it was actually going incredibly successfully. I was mainly restricting, would liquid/water fast once/twice a week, and 1 day a week I allowed myself to eat a bit more than usual. Had a steady decline in weight, was feeling amazing. I felt like I was doing it ~safely~ but I don #8217;t think I was lol idk at the time my whole life revolved around food, calories, body checks and my scales. But then whenever anything becomes really stressful in my life, I just eat absolutely everything I can. I might just have a stressful day and eat so much, or if my stress levels are high enough it can last days or even weeks. I recently moved and started uni and I #8217;ve been eating like crazy. It feels like I only have willpower if my life isn #8217;t too stressful. Once I #8217;m stressed all self control goes out the window. As a result I #8217;ve gained back nearly 1/3 of what I lost since May/June, and feeling like shit about it. I was doing so well. I felt like I #8217;d be able to continue with my plan of eating and fasting but I #8217;m so stressed over uni and the only thing that helps is food. I hate myself for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry your binge eating is also linked to stress :/ Your year doesn #8217;t sound like it #8217;s been a great time. I was in heavy stress when the Aus bushfires hit but got it under control. Then the idea of uni came along and I was preparing and stuff to find a house and packing/moving. Covid hit and I struggled. Then actually being accepted into uni scared the crap out of me. And it was time to actually move. Now I #8217;m doing uni I #8217;m literally so fucking stressed all the time. Also doesn #8217;t help I started a contraceptive to stop my periods (they #8217;re fucked) and I had a period lasting 19 days and that was horrible and stressful and I just wanted to eat to stop thinking about it.</TEXT>

Down bags of chips, way too many toasted cheese sandwiches (could eat like 6 in a day, 12 fucking pieces of bread), multiple bowls of just pasta and cheese, 2min noodle cups, a fuck ton of Uber eats where I #8217;d get burgers and chips, and savoury biscuits and dip.

When you #8217;re unwell and can ignore/deflect that hardwired desire and instinct to be safe, it #8217;s very dangerous.

Sometimes having it physically distanced (especially if you live with your parent/s and you want to harm at night) makes it harder to do it because you have to go a decent way to retrieve it.

    <TEXT>Tattoos have a different sort of feeling than self harm imo. If it #8217;s just a small semi-colon it #8217;ll be done super quick (maybe like 15min or so) it won #8217;t hurt much at all. It kinda feels like firm scratching with your nail onto skin. Idk but I think a lot of people overreact? One of my tattooists said  #8220;if it really hurt too much then no one would ever come back to get a second one #8221; which basically sums it up. The pain is more severe the longer a tattoo is being done like it builds up, and for me it felt more like scratching at sunburn when the lady had to go onto my scar tissue over and over and over to get the ink to really sink in Edit- actually it #8217;ll probably be less than 15min. And pretty much once it #8217;s done it doesn #8217;t hurt anymore. Unless it #8217;s a big one then it feels like sunburn and takes awhile to heal</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had times they didn #8217;t bother with anaesthetic, especially when they want me out ASAP and just staple me and say goodbye. I remember times where even though they were holding the skin together the staple wouldn #8217;t catch the other end and it #8217;d claw into the wound and the doctor would look at me real quick but I wouldn #8217;t even flinch so he #8217;d just pull it out and try again. I #8217;ve had a similar problem where they under-stitched wounds, definitely needed more than they gave me. It #8217;s like what #8217;s the point of me coming in if you #8217;re not even going to close it right.

    <DATE>2020-09-14 08:58:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Basically, I found out that someone successfully killed themselves in a ward I used to be in. I found out through someone I know that works there. I was honestly so surprised someone managed to pull it off. When she told me I was already so curious as to how they did it because that ward was incredibly well built to be safe, nurses do their rounds often, and you get checked if you go out on leave (if you #8217;re allowed leave) to make sure you haven #8217;t brought anything back. My first thought was that they smuggled in something sharp and bled to death. I know people have tried hanging themselves with their bedding (or clothes) by ripping them up but there #8217;s no real hanging points so it doesn #8217;t work. I thought maybe they brought drugs in and ODd. But it wasn #8217;t any of these. *He managed to split his head open by essentially throwing himself onto part of the bed frame, more than once, with the impact on his head.* I was literally shocked. I never would have expected that to work. He must have been so fucking determined. He got found on one of the nurse rounds who obviously fucking freaked out as the floor was covered in blood and there was a massive event filled with fear. He got rushed to intensive care since he was still alive, but they couldn #8217;t help him, he lost too much blood and died. Originally they thought maybe he had a seizure and fell and hit his head. But the death was investigated and determined to be a suicide after they realised he would have needed to land on his head more than once to do it, and the force required would #8217;ve been immense and a simple fall wouldn #8217;t have sufficed. I was just like damn. Middle aged man split his head open by throwing himself at the bed frame. Fucking wild.</TEXT>

I only really have 1 friend that would be like umm wtf because she also used to harm but she #8217;d make me feel shit for posting it online When I lived in a youth residence place I #8217;d cut in the bathtub too. No water on, just made it so much quicker to clean. Before that I just cut in my bedroom but they weren #8217;t severe and I could manage them. My most recent ones from last year I sat on the shower floor, also no water. But I #8217;d hit arteries and it #8217;d fucking spray the walls and shit. My most frustrating part was wound care. After I #8217;d get stitched, it would just take soo long. I was spending hundreds on first aid supplies. Changing covers and bandages sucks so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I #8217;ve been in treatment a heap. One small outpatient place I #8217;ve been to like 8 times, maybe more, had to leave multiple times for harming. Then I was in an out of one ward bouncing between that and the first outpatient, went to the youth residence place, got kicked out for harming, and then stuck in that ward for 14months. Then we moved across to a new ward and I was there for nearly a year. Went to this seperate treatment place, was there for like a month, back in the ward. There for a long time. Transferred to a new ward for a long time. Finally got out. All in all, the last 5 years probably 3.5 have been spent in wards. Fucking sucks. My last stay was late last year. Somehow I #8217;ve never passed out, I #8217;ve come very close multiple times, but never passed out. In the youth residence the 3rd time they called the ambulance on me (which was also what got me kicked out) the paramedics were shocked I was still conscious. Lost around 2L of blood, generally that makes anyone pass out, often 1.5L makes people close to passing out. I #8217;d lost a lot of blood in previous ones too, making me incredibly dizzy and I can #8217;t hold myself up. My last ambo trip they had to wheelchair me out of the house, just so pale and weak, again they were surprised I hadn #8217;t fainted. Idk my body just deals with it I guess? But I definitely have had all the symptoms you listed, nausea, feeling hot, change in vision, I also have had some paralysing shock reactions. For whatever reason doesn #8217;t matter how fast the blood has gushed or sprayed out of me, I don #8217;t pass out. I think though the nightmare-ish experience you had after passing out could just be this overwhelming fear you had in the moments before you passed out, basically continuing? I definitely know the moment your body goes  #8220;oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck #8221; and your mind races</TEXT>

Also can #8217;t have your phone or any other device. The ward had 2 sections, one is less intense, and the less intense one you can have your phone and generally strings if they trust you.

    <TEXT>The ward I was in there were no door handles, and we didn #8217;t get chairs. There were legit no hanging points whatsoever (everything was rounded for taps and shower heads etc, and absolutely no bars obviously). People do still try though if they feel like they #8217;ve got a chance. In a different ward that was pretty shitty I almost died then for 3 days had a nurse arms reach from me 24/7 lmao</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did the shower have a bar? That #8217;s pretty dangerous. This ward everything was rounded off, the shower head was more like a knob sticking out of the wall with the holes in it that sprayed luke warm water at you.

    <TEXT>I moved out for this exact reason thinking it #8217;d be the best thing I #8217;d ever do. It didn #8217;t end well at all. I was adamant that I was going to kill myself if I couldn #8217;t harm when and how I wanted to. So I moved out, harmed very *very* badly multiple times, and then still just wanted to kill myself anyway, if not more than originally. Ended up staying in some outpatient clinic a few times, having a brief ward admission, then I just got fucking sick of dealing with healing wounds and stitches and nurses and psych teams it was just becoming so frustrating. I just wanted everything to stop. Not entirely sure what exactly got my mind to change but I #8217;ve been clean a year now. I still want to harm, have thoughts and urges present every second of the day, regardless of what I #8217;m doing or how well the day is going or if I #8217;m in a class or whatever. I #8217;m just not following through with it because it just leads to disaster and every time I thought it was the answer I #8217;d come out of it feeling worse than when I went in. I still think I #8217;ll relapse because it feels inevitable, but I know trying to resist the temptation is helping me actually have a life other than hurting myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It will be hard to move out if you #8217;ve transferred away all your money. Moving out isn #8217;t cheap (at least here it #8217;s not). I could only just afford to pay rent and bills and groceries. It was so stressful and on top of everything I #8217;d also be spending hundreds of dollars on first aid supplies and every hospital trip I #8217;d Uber/taxi myself there and back which also cost money (I did not want to call an ambulance because I #8217;d be put in the ward, but I needed stitches. I wouldn #8217;t tell anyone when I #8217;d harm because I also didn #8217;t want them to call an ambulance). I #8217;ve been in therapy for years, my current psychologist I #8217;ve seen since 2015. I #8217;m incredibly honest with him even though that #8217;s caused be problems. Hopefully once you start therapy you #8217;ll get some help. Are you sure there #8217;s no way to get help quicker? I had the same thoughts and feelings, I felt like self harm was the only thing keeping me alive. I didn #8217;t want to be alive at all, I had tried dozens of medication and nothing was helping. My mind is in this constant state of  #8220;the world will be better without me #8221; and  #8220;I #8217;m using up valuable resources that should be going to people that actually want to live #8221;. It #8217;s horrible and I still think like that. Obviously your past has hurt you a lot and it #8217;s unfair. You didn #8217;t deserve what you were put through. But punishing yourself is just causing more and more damage. It really isn #8217;t the answer. My entire life revolved around harm and death for years and I could never see a way out. But somehow things have improved. You have to wait though and give therapy a proper try, some people can never recover on their own and talking everything out to someone you trust that isn #8217;t going to judge you for it feels so good. I know for a fact I #8217;d be dead if I never had therapy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess the thing is, if you #8217;ve cut her off and sent her all your money, she #8217;s already probably quite worried and doesn #8217;t know what to do. I #8217;m unsure what sort of friendship you have (in terms of how close, trust and honest etc), but could she be very concerned and want to tell someone but doesn #8217;t want to get you in trouble and hurt your feelings/break trust by exposing you? If you did kill yourself now and she hasn #8217;t told anyone about this, I am certain she #8217;d be left with incredible guilt for not speaking up. I think you should reach out. If you tell her though that you intend to move out to harm (even if you think it #8217;ll stop you from killing yourself) and you want some money back, that #8217;s also going to be a difficult decision for her to make. But I don #8217;t think you should lie about this. Lying in this situation will just linger in the back of your mind and make you feel like shit. I #8217;m unsure where you live and why there #8217;s such a long waitlist. Here we have dozens of public and private clinics and some psychs you can get into very quickly. We also have free services that you can go to that also have help lines that you can call and they let you know where your closest one is located and any other suggestions about finding help. Is there a chance you could travel a bit further to get to a psych sooner? Even if it #8217;s out of town and you have to drive awhile to get there, if it can be sooner it #8217;ll be worth it. The other option is just fessing up to your parents and going to the emergency department and telling them you need immediate help. That you #8217;re actively suicidal. Emergencies here have a psych triage team that do 1 on 1 chats with you, sometimes for an hour. If they don #8217;t think you #8217;re safe to go home then you #8217;ll get help. They #8217;ll ask you to stay overnight and re-evaluate in the morning, or might just send you to a ward for a bit. They want you to be safe. Most places won #8217;t lock you in a ward for huge stays to begin with. The thing is with uni, you #8217;ve gotta consider is it worth struggling but forcing yourself to keep doing uni and feeling like you want to harm and die 24/7, or getting the mental help you actually need so that you aren #8217;t in this constant battle and can try and recover rather than just being consumed by it. In the long run, being mentally okay comes above uni. You can always go back to uni or education. You can #8217;t undo a suicide. You can #8217;t undo permanent nerve damage or arm weakness and pain (which I #8217;m now stuck with forever). You can #8217;t let uni prevent you from getting help, because if you don #8217;t get help chances are you won #8217;t be able to continue with uni anyway. You might have to drop out if your mental health keeps declining. Edit- Also the hospital would take you explaining about not wanting to fuck up uni being a  #8220;preventative measure #8221; regarding your safety. It doesn #8217;t matter if you go in bawling your eyes out and shouting or being calm, if you still want to function for uni you #8217;ll be deemed mentally okay enough to go home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think she #8217;d agree you #8217;re a bad person therefore you should cut her out of your life. If you #8217;re really close this will be upsetting both for her and you. She obviously cares about you and you care about her. Don #8217;t kick supports and friends out of your life. I #8217;m 100% agreeing to kicking toxic friends out but she doesn #8217;t sound like one. I really think she #8217;d be in shock having all your money in her account. Could your parents drive you further out? Do you have any relatives that would? It does seem a bit backwards to just make every service free therefore there will always be a massive backlog. Obviously charging people $170 a session isn #8217;t ideal but if you #8217;re on a wait list for months I #8217;d rather pay to get sessions. With suicide, people reach a point where nothing matters, they don #8217;t care anymore about commitments and just want everything to end. They #8217;ll drop out of school, quit their job, isolate, might abuse harming, alcohol and drugs etc. They no longer see a future. I know it #8217;s not always like this though. If you #8217;re still wanting to go to uni and not cause family tension, then that #8217;s currently stopping you from suicide. Or at least, medical professionals see it that way. They often judge a persons suicidality on these traits. I #8217;m not saying you #8217;re not actively suicidal, but you #8217;re still at a point where you have things in your life you care about. Uni and avoiding family tension. While family tension sucks, it #8217;s better to cause tension by getting hospitalised if it means you #8217;ll be safe and get help. If you still want uni to happen, you even have a goal for yourself you want to complete. I seriously think you should just come clean and cause family tension. It #8217;s the better outcome. They just have to deal with it. You need to put yourself first. I would reach out to your friend. But I still don #8217;t advise moving out just to harm. It won #8217;t end well. It absolutely will not. You #8217;ll think getting to harm whenever you want will solve your suicidal thoughts. It won #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Reducing lamotrigine via cutting the tablet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-25 15:46:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I take 200mg APO-Lamotrigine morning and night. The tablet is dissolvable so it #8217;s just this big, flat oval and just disintegrates super quickly in liquid. Because it #8217;s dissolvable, will the contents be spread evenly in the tablet? Could I, in theory, very slowly cut the tablet down into smaller and smaller fractions? I know it #8217;s very bad to go cold turkey with this medication and it took 8 months to reach the dose I #8217;m on (this was done approx 3 years ago). I would be incredibly cautious and drop a fraction for maybe 3 weeks, then drop it again for 3 weeks etc, possibly alternating between dropping the morning then the night. Because of the size and shape of the tablet, it is very easy to cut it into pieces just with a knife so it would definitely be doable to start taking away fractions. But I #8217;d just need to know if the actual medication is spread evenly within the dissolvable tablet. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It doesn #8217;t really matter if it is the only problematic thing in your relationship, it is still abuse. Because not only did they abuse you themselves, but they caused you to get bullied throughout your schooling, which is a direct result of their actions. They also ignored a doctors advice about your weight which is immediately putting your health at risk and at a young age. I can understand how your parents are raised can greatly change how they raise their kids, but what they did was wrong. It can be hard for them to realise because in their mind they #8217;re doing what they think is best for you, even though it #8217;s not. It #8217;s hard to know what your family dynamic is now but have you been very open and honest about how they made you feel? That you really want to mend the relationship and continue recovering but want them to acknowledge their actions were harmful and seek an apology? I think you #8217;d get a lot of closure if they said sorry and you voiced your emotions out. They might not want to, or think you #8217;re being unreasonable.

    <TEXT>I got this super cute hoodie, like I love it. But when I put it on and look in the mirror I #8217;m utterly disgusted. Take it off and I feel better. The weird part is like...it #8217;s a hoodie, and I basically live in hoodies. They #8217;re oversized and I feel safe, I own like 10. Every other hoodie I have I feel comfortable wearing. But *that* specific hoodie I just bought makes me look ginormous? I honestly don #8217;t know what happens. I fear that #8217;s what I actually look like and my brain has tricked me into thinking all the other hoodies I #8217;m blocking out how fat I am. I want to cry. It #8217;s not like it #8217;s a piece of tight clothing than will hug at my body because god I #8217;d breakdown putting that on and looking in the mirror. I purposely bought the hoodie because I always feel okay in them, and the design is adorable. But I simply cannot wear it without wanting to die :( Edit: wow this blew up. I #8217;m so sorry many of you have this problem too. It makes you feel so awful. I just wish I could put on clothes and not immediately want to cry. I #8217;ve had to really clear out my wardrobe over the years to only have safe clothes, and I haven #8217;t had to deal with this feeling for years because I don #8217;t really buy new clothes often :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Helplines have a  #8220;duty of care #8221;. If they deem you unsafe and an immediate risk, they are required by law to do something about it. Don #8217;t take it personally on whoever #8217;s on the phone, they are abiding the law and their job. They would get in serious trouble if they did nothing about it. When you call helplines you #8217;re being evaluated, they have to assess the danger you #8217;re in. It #8217;s not just about having someone to talk to, they are very glad you #8217;re reaching out and having the talk, but they also have a job to follow. I sort of want to give you a timeline of what I think will happen if you move out in your current state of mind, in terms of what exactly happened to me. And this is just a serious concern. I want you to really think about this. You #8217;ll move out. You #8217;ll feel amazing. You have freedom and privacy. A sense of relief will wash over you. You #8217;ll start harming, it will feel great. Knowing you have no limits will bring you joy. You #8217;ll harm more and more. But then what happens? You realise harming isn #8217;t actually stopping your suicidal thoughts and your internal battles. It doesn #8217;t matter how much you harm, how deep you go, how often you do it. You will NEVER be satisfied. I mean that 100%. It wouldn #8217;t matter if you could harm 10 times a day because you have the freedom to do so. You will NEVER just make those suicidal thoughts vanish when you were ADAMANT self harm was the answer. You #8217;ll spiral down even further. You #8217;ll get hit in the face that harming will NEVER work like you thought it would. You #8217;ll breakdown and feel like total shit. Your suicidal thoughts will be worse than ever. You #8217;ll just want to scream and cry, you #8217;ll feel utterly helpless. There #8217;s also the risk with harming that you #8217;ll disable yourself because you have no limits now. You #8217;ll do serious and permanent nerve damage. I was lucky years ago. I almost fucked my entire hand. I #8217;ve being hitting muscles and tendons, and my arms can be so weak and ache because scar tissue is attached to them. If you harm and hit the wrong thing? You might lose all control of your hand. It might be damaged, and you won #8217;t be able to use your fingers. The whole thing could be numb and constant pins and needles. But harming is what you wanted, right? Trust me you #8217;ll be going down a dark path. A very dark path. You need serious and immediate help so this does not get out of control. It will ruin your life if you don #8217;t get the help you need. It #8217;ll be tough but you need to tell your parents and go to hospital. Show them you #8217;re still harming. Tell the staff at emergency how close you are to killing yourself and show them your scars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My life has been going so well, better than it #8217;s been in like 9 years, but I still just want to harm so bad? I #8217;m in my early/mid 20s, and I was  #8220;late #8221; to start harming, I didn #8217;t do it as a minor. I always felt guilty I started so late as if I was acting like a child anyway. I haven #8217;t done it for a bit over a year now. I #8217;ve gone into uni, never thought I #8217;d be alive this long let alone returning to education. Atm it #8217;s all online so I haven #8217;t had to deal with people seeing my scars. I feel shit because next year will probably be going back to in person gradually. I hate that I feel like I need to hide from embarrassment and not wanting to concern anyone. So I hate myself even more for still wanting to harm knowing it #8217;s just going to cause more problems. I guess I just wanted to rant. How can I still be self destructive when I #8217;m doing something I never thought I #8217;d ever be alive or in the mental capacity to do?

    <TEXT>You hear this all the time.  #8220;I won #8217;t crash if I drive when I #8217;ve had a few drinks. I won #8217;t get lung cancer from smoking. I won #8217;t fall off a building trying to do parkour. I won #8217;t still have an eating disorder once I reach my UGW. I won #8217;t gamble all my money away. I won #8217;t take street drugs and become an addict. #8221; Etc etc. We have this mentality of disconnecting ourselves from negative outcomes because...it won #8217;t happen to me? Wrong. I never thought my self harm would go as far as it did. I never believed I #8217;d cause permanent nerve damage. I never thought I #8217;d have to deal with severe scars. I never believed I #8217;d have to go to emergency to get fixed. I never thought I #8217;d cause weakness in my arms. I never thought it would become my only coping method. I never thought it #8217;d make me anaemic. I never believed stopping would be this hard. I never thought I #8217;d be admitted to a psych ward because of harming. I was adamant it wasn #8217;t as bad as people were telling me. I fucking thought none of that would ever happen to me. Ever. But harming is so fucking risky. It #8217;s a slippery slope. You go from just doing it a little bit to doing it a lot. You go from doing it every now and then to doing it all the time. You go from just breaking the epidermis to reaching the dermis to reaching the hypodermis to reaching muscles and tendons. You cause nerve damage that cannot be repaired. You believe harming will only help, nothing bad will happen. You think you can stop and move on with your life once you #8217;re feeling better. All of a sudden everything you thought would never happen to you will happen. I really beg you be so fucking careful. This isn #8217;t a game, this isn #8217;t fun, this isn #8217;t helping. Get proper help before your whole life revolves around hurting yourself. Don #8217;t let yourself live like this. This is not okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think people realise how easily nerve damage can happen, and how horrible the consequences are. I found that out the hard way, I had minor nerve damage that just affected the spots where the scars were and it was really odd to touch it and feel nothing or feel pins and needles but I shrugged it off. Then 1 cut caused permanent nerve damage to half my hand. Knowing that will never come back is horrible. Exactly. If it never happened then no one would ever get lung cancer from smoking. But it does happen and it can happen to anyone that smokes but we deny the risk actually happen to us. I #8217;m sorry you #8217;re still struggling with it all, it isn #8217;t nice and 100% a drug.

    <TEXT>I tried them when I was maybe 15/16. I never found them comfortable to wear and everyone just said I hadn #8217;t put them in right and it #8217;s harder when you #8217;re a virgin. So I gave up on them. When I was 20 I tried again. This time they didn #8217;t make me uncomfortable having them in. It #8217;s not the nicest thing to do pushing something up your vagina if you #8217;ve never done it before. But the benefits for me was having twice the protection for heavy periods. Tampon + pad helped immensely for leaking and not needing to change my pad every hour. I also find having the blood dealt with inside my vagina rather than spread all over a pad in my undies much better as it made me feel more clean? If you #8217;re nervous to try, look at some tutorials on how they #8217;re inserted. A huge part is what position your body is in to make the tampon slide in nice and easy rather than having to push it into a tight space. The main thing I #8217;d suggest is to buy the smallest ones you can first. Have a good feel of your vagina (easy to do in the shower), making sure you #8217;re aware of what #8217;s going on down there. I didn #8217;t like the thought of it at first but tampons made my life much easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry you #8217;re also in such a struggle atm :( Having aches sucks, my arms are so weak I #8217;m so shit at lifting heavy things. Most of mine were stitched or stapled so it did greatly help the healing process. But my arms are covered in scars now and I won #8217;t be able to get rid of them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem is often the  #8220;good enough #8221; people seek can get higher and higher, so while you #8217;ve found your happy spot of scarring to a standard it sounds like it #8217;s no longer escalating, not everyone find that point where they #8217;re satisfied. I #8217;m glad you #8217;re at a spot now where you #8217;re 30 and managing it all. The problem is it #8217;s not always the case people are so lucky and not have it take over. A big problem is also there are people so young on here, and a lot of them mightn #8217;t realise how addicting this will become and how dangerous it can get. Another problem is people can also be in a really bad mental space and harming is their main way to cope, such as having severe depression and anxiety (especially if they #8217;re still at school). If you #8217;re working and managing a business it seems you #8217;re at a place now where you are very much in control of your life as a whole. Kids on here aren #8217;t yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve also been in and out of psych wards many many times with some stays lasting over and year and I #8217;d see people come in, leave and come back later and go  #8220;you #8217;re still here?? #8221; It was shit. Honestly though the problem is when someone #8217;s desperate almost anything can be a tool to harm. I #8217;ve also got scars from things that sound ridiculous from when I was in the ward that they #8217;d then take off me. At one point I turned to hair pulling until I had a bald spot because they can #8217;t really stop you doing it and they know I won #8217;t cause serious harm and yeah it was fucked. It can be hard to relate to people when they haven #8217;t been through what you #8217;ve been through</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My recommendation would be to get a tattoo :) not only will it cover them if you ever go to a workplace that get weird about them, but it also is so nice to look at your arm and see art there instead of scars. Getting a tattoo over some of my old scars was an amazing feeling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem is though that your suggestion could be more dangerous. Especially because they #8217;ll go out and buy it brand new and what they #8217;ve been using could have been dull, it #8217;ll be very dangerous. Plus I would feel a level of guilt knowing I gave suggestions on what you should hurt yourself with. If I told someone and they attempted using what I suggested I would feel horrible</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Staples instead of stitches?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-07 08:59:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know some of you need to go to emergency for stitches but has anyone else ever had staples? I had them years ago and they left big dot scars (some of my stitches have too but basically every staple one stayed while stitch ones 80% of the time faded away after months to years). They were pretty shit because you had to go and get them removed with this tool by a doctor or nurse. Sometimes the harsh movement of them removing the staple would partially reopen the wound so it seemed stupid. When I was in the ward sometimes I #8217;d pull them out myself and the nurses would be so pissed and shocked and couldn #8217;t understand how it didn #8217;t hurt. Getting them inserted was also weird, they held the skin together and just use this stapling thing to clunk them together. A few times one edge of the staple wouldn #8217;t have grabbed the other side of the skin so it would staple into the wound instead (what I mean by that is scraping into the inside of the wound as only one side of the skin caught it) and it would start bleeding again. I felt like the hospital just wanted to get me out ASAP because many times they didn #8217;t bother using anaesthetic and just grabbed the stapler. It was much quicker than stitching. Has anyone else had them too?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I guess my main point with the dull and sharp thing was just if they #8217;ve been using something dull and applying firm pressure, when they move to something sharp and apply that same pressure it could do a lot more damage than expected. I #8217;ve experienced this first hand many times</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry you did enough damage to your legs in one hit to require 200 staples, that must #8217;ve been a really shit time for you and I hope you #8217;re doing better. It #8217;s really good to hear they healed so well though. Do you have the dots next to the scars or did they go away? God yes I remember how itchy they would be, compared to stitches they were so much itchier for sure. I often get/got bruising from stitches and staples so I #8217;d look fucking weird with gross yellow skin and purple and metal clamping wounds shut</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d often get student doctors for some of my minor ones that needed stitches. It #8217;s great practice for them to stitch sh wounds because they #8217;re generally a very clean wound (like in terms of it often being a straight line incision but also clean hygiene wise) and it #8217;s just about shutting it. When compared to like an accident based wound where the skin might be a bit messed up torn on the edges etc and harder to align again. One thing I wasn #8217;t too happy about was when I needed internal stitches as well as external and the doctor was showing the med student the technique and once he finished the internal ones he did like 3 external ones and asked if she felt she could do the rest. She didn #8217;t do the best job but because it was internally stitched it didn #8217;t hugely make a difference compared to if it wasn #8217;t. Then it would #8217;ve been really really shit. Internal stitches have made the biggest difference to reduce my scarring from certain wounds</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly they are going to be really kind about it. I #8217;ve got 3 tattoos so far, one was next to scars and one was right on top of scars. The one next to the guy didn #8217;t even say a word, we just chatted about random topics for the 1.5 hours. For the one over scars all the lady said was  #8220;just letting you know scar tissue can hold ink differently and I might need to go over parts a couple of times which might hurt more than usual #8221;. They didn #8217;t say anything else, didn #8217;t ask if I was mentally okay, didn #8217;t ask if I #8217;m getting help, didn #8217;t ask for my history or bring it up etc. They #8217;re artists and they love what they do, they #8217;ll happily just work away :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It will really depend on your design and which scars exactly you #8217;re going over. With my heavily scarred arm I got a tattoo over, the lady had to rework a section an extra 4 times I believe just to really embed the ink. Because scar tissue is different to skin tissue there are 3 possibilities; it will take more ink to fill the scar tissue, the ink will bleed/blur once it hits the scar tissue so some designs might look a bit off, the scar tissue will behave pretty closely to skin. I think the biggest key with designs over scars is choosing ones that will fit the scar. Ones that won #8217;t distort because the skin isn #8217;t flat</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In that case what I #8217;d suggest is to start on smaller ones first, and ones that are even with the skin (not indented or raised). See how your scar tissue behaves. Wait a month for the tattoo to be fully healed and see how it looks. If it went well, work your way through your other scars, maybe have a design plan to make a larger tattoo piece that covers the majority of your leg/arm in a joined design as it will blend out the scars into the skin. A good tattoo artist will be able to make it work for sure though, and don #8217;t be afraid to swap to another one. Make sure though that your scars are completely white. With larger wounds it #8217;s very important it #8217;s been 3+ years, there #8217;s horror stories of people getting tattoos too quickly and the scar splits open. For smaller wounds you don #8217;t need to wait that long (some people still get tattoos on pink scars if they haven #8217;t gone past the dermis), but for your scars you #8217;ll need to be careful. Let me know if you have more questions though because I #8217;m happy to answer! Covering scars with a tattoo was one of the best decisions I #8217;ve ever made and helped so much. Eventually I want every single one covered :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can #8217;t stop the bleeding yourself after firm pressure for ~10min, you should to tell another person so that they can help you. They #8217;ll have to make sure the bleeding does stop with their help otherwise you #8217;ll need to go to the hospital. If you cut to the fat layer you need stitches within 12 hours, so you #8217;ll also need to go to hospital. If things are dire, such as cutting into a larger vein or an artery (trust me you will know, blood will flood or spurt out) then you need help ASAP and should call an ambulance.</TEXT>
