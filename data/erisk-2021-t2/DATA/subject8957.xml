    <TITLE>[BFV] Change your controls!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-31 23:03:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK so I've been frustrated with a lot of things lately and I've changed my controls to fix them. See I can barely use the squad leader radio because I have some very precious smoke grenades which I can't waste. Then I was a medic and I couldn't get my supplies out in time without putting my fingers in awkward postitons. So I made a setup for those with the same problem (Console). The RB or the right bumper is used for things like talking. To me that's taking up some good space therefore replace RB as your 1st gadget which in my case was the medpack then change talking to the right d-pad? I think. This works for all classes and its super easy! The next one takes a bit of discipline. Change the squad leader radio to up d-pad and healing to the left stick. Them change your settings so that sprint is double tap forward. I made this originally for the medic which is in a lot of firefights and has unlimited medpacks so tweak as you like. Just want to make people's lives easier!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people go to the C tower for sniping whether that be the honourable assault or recon sniping or the less honourable support sniping. Instead, blow up the tiny water tower at the barracks. The jagged edges allow for cover and these work amazing for bipod's so you can follow your sick twisted MMG dreams. This provides a view for the two best areas on the aerodrome. The C objective or the big boy hanger and the E objective or the twin hangers. Just a tip fellas!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>An epic push</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-07 16:05:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now, this is a text post..no video since the push lasted like 15 minutes. See I was playing frontlines on aerodrome as the Brits. We couldn't capture objective B. We would capture A easily and B not as much. So we're trying to live. Eventually, the enemies PUSHED so hard that we had to fall back. This was their 5th attempt. I'm an MMG support and I'm mowing down people as much as I can yet we were pushed back. See... Every time I've played frontlines... If you've been pushed to HQ, you won't be able to go back to the previous one and you were done for. I'm a fucking terrible tanker. Yet I used a lot of points to get the Churchhill croc. I was dealing blows left and right. Getting hit too. This war would come to an end. This was the most intense battle I've had. My heart is still racing. pump. Pump. PUMP! They've armed objective B! Moments later... BOOM! Objective Baka has been destroyed. I watched helplessly. I still have a job to do! I destroy infantry. Soon I'm out of ammo. By ammo I mean the machine gun. Still, 20 more soldiers to kill. I see an assault run up to me. He places his TNT while I'm trapped in the remains of some barracks. Like around where the A artillery calling thingy was. BOOM! I get hit. He aims his PIAT at me Boom! I'm down to 27HP both me and the tank. I hop out! There's an enemy support waiting for me. I use my crappy STEN to kill the guy. He was down by a lot. I do my mechanic fix a.k.a going under the vehicle. Halfway done... Almost done... Finished! I've repaired the Croc and right as I repair it. I see the number of enemies I need to kill. 7 We push forward. Then we PUSH again. I die sometime there. The tank doesn't. I switch to a medic. It's my best class... I'm reviving people. Getting killed. Then we fall back once more. I called in the half-track. Being the idiot I am, I forget about it. The timer runs low... 30 29 28 .. .. I receive a guy who was killed by like 5 people. I kill 2 and run for it. I won't let them take objective Aka. 20 .. .. I run. I run and kill 2 people with a pathetic scout knife. 5 4 3 2 1 Defeat. As the round draws to a close, I think... Wow. This seems like the war story of the Italian Dude in Bf1. My heart was still racing. I will remember this for like a week.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fun Sims 4 idea. The disease challenge.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-18 16:47:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I thought of this as soon as I started playing the Sims 4 so I don't know if someone already has come up with the idea. So Heres what I'm thinking. You get a single Sim. Style her or him like the goths aka make them creepy as hell. Their last name will be disease. Then you romance a family and move into their house after you sell your house. The biggest rule here is nobody is allowed to have babies. After that you get some people from your new family to romance other families. To avoid too many sims, I've decided to kill them if they reach the elderly age. You can say adult and that would also be fine. Now you will romance another family and move on with them and sell everything in your previous house. You repeat until you've successfully destroyed all the houses in one world. Then you move on to the next. You fail if upon asking a family to move in fails. Once you've done this challenge, you will probably have well over a million. Infact if you want you could name the other lots as different countries. I would say continents but we have two worlds. Or you could call the next lots in the new world, planet names. Plague the entire solar system. If you have more lots after, three milky way is next.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So on my homepage, it says 14 day, 1 month or 3 month. No 12 month gamepasses. Is the 12 month exclusive to U.S or something? I can't even find it on the site.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-20 12:13:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So quitting smoking is her way of manipulating the black people to go into the sunken place. As she does with Chris. Chris is introduced to the smoking thing by her husband claiming it helped him quit smoking. Now we know to quit smoking you have go to the sunken place. My theory is that the sunken place isn't her only trick. She manipulated her husband and daughter to become like her. So then she could start transplanting brains and what not. This could also explain why Amy's character felt kinda weird like the poessed black people. So Missy is the creator of the cult and she helps other people "quit" their addictions in which she manipulates them to join the cult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm have a dispute about if my towns healthcare center is a hospital. A friend said that its not because of something involving a helipad or something like that? I was zoning out unfortunately. So I was discussing stuff with a different friend when hospitals came up. I stated my point and currently we're having a dispute about the topic. So help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is one of the worst opinions yet. Dude, I fucking love steak, and this is just repulsive. I can appreciate a big mac, it's pretty fucking tasty considering it's possum meat stuck between what could be considered bread under the right lighting, but steak is fucking great and you are insane. There is nothing better than tearing into a slab of meat on a plate. I went to florence once, and the steak there is fucking amazing. They give you a fucking enormous slab of meat, bigger than your head, and it is delicious. You can't compare that to a fucking McDonalds cheeseburger dude. Have you tried high end steak? I am so fucking mad right now. This opinion is against everything I stand for. You are a monster. Seriously, what fucking steaks have you eaten? Do you think high end is the fucking luxury section at Tesco's? Is there some miscommunication here? I have never been so unreasonably angry. I wish I could give you platinum for how fucking furious you have made me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I certainly don't want a world akin to the lorax. I would prefer not privatizing air but Idgaf about trees or nature. I ain't trying to earn upvotes, I promise. Out of the many people I know, there's only 1 person that agrees with me on my stance. The closest I've ever been to even remotely liking nature was Niagra falls. But I only liked the mist on my face, something that can easily be emulated by a Gatorade bottle. Edit:I certainly don't litter, that would be trashy. I've volunteered to clean up the highway and stuff so I hate littering. My world is just theres an algae farm in cities and towns where people get their oxygen. Hell even have one part of the world be colonized by algae so the rest of us can do our stuff in peace. I'm not for burning down nature like some kind of madman. I just want an industrialized world. If we have to transport the animals to some other place then that's fine by me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yall ever accidentally leave out a cup of water for a day or two and come back to drink it. If I could that's exactly what I would do simply because of how tasty stale water is. Drinking stale water for me is akin to that scene in ratatouille where the brother eats one of Remy's dishes and theres some weird but cool music visual effect. That thing Injust described makes water which is usually flavorless have a bit more flavour! If you've never watched ratatouille then I suppose one could also equate it to the taste of milk. You know the weird taste that comes with it? I swear my milk is not expired. Edit: Why are my opinions so controversial?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see so many of my friends who make being depressed their whole fucking personality, and it pisses me off to no end. Like take Friend 1 for example: She'd tell the teacher and pretty much the whole fucking class that she cried 73638573 times yesterday. Fucking dumbass. I'm only friends with her because it's easier in class like that. But damn does she radiate r/notlikeothergirls energy! It's okay to be depressed or anxious. Take Friend 2 for example: He only made an offhand remark that he has depression. Not yelling it through the streets! My stance just applies to anything like anxiety or other stuff. I get mental health is important and shit but you don't have to make it my problem to deal with when we're barely acquaintances.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-03 02:06:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll describe the rough plot since I want to read this again. Before I begin I will note that the book was a bit mature so definitely not in the children's category. Some girl discovers she has lost and found powers after seeing a missing kid on a milk carton and she calls the police with the kid's location. She got her powers when she got struck by lightning while leaning on a bleacher. I think the children's lost and found operator's name was like rose or something. Anyway after she finds a child who was killed under a tree she is a suspect for these kidnappings and eventually the government approaches her to find war criminals. It's only when she researches them that she finds that most of them are innocent. After some hesitancy she slowly gives them the locations of dead war criminals and the bad ones.</TEXT>

But I've seen quite a few people talk about Thrill of the fight being better aswell. So Questers, which one is better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. I did the math a while back and 33million people play GTA V Online everyday. Now I'm giving us a very conservative number of 22million who will destroy a vehicle that costs more than 1 mil. This is absolutely not true since I occasionally crash my luxor deluxe and scramjets in one day but let's be conservative here. The vehicle I used to calculate it was the Mk2 with the trade price which is 3mil. This should slightly cancel out the luxor deluxes being crashed. 22mil x 3mil = 66trillion. I don't even count the deductibles since it makes no difference. And that's per ONE DAY. Over the course of a month that'd be 2 quadrillion dollars or nearly half the value of earth! Within a year you could have bought Earth 4 times over!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbf exclusives is a big thing. Even right now they have some really strong exclusives and I'm simply dying to play Spiderman 2. I'm probably going to stick with Xbox because save for the exclusives, Xbox has given me a lot of reasons to choose it (Ergonomic Controller, "Small" size, Maybe more power) but don't try and argue away exclusives or VR. VR is something Xbox has failed horrendously to capture. The lack of VR has also made Xbox a shakey choice for me and many others in the VR community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. That is true. A vast majority of games may be third party but as Xbox and Playstation get bigger, we'll see bigger and better exclusives. Halo was a big one imo. It defined the late 2000's gaming atleast for me. While Detroit and Spiderman aren't exactly going to be as huge as Halo without adding some online functionality, I can sense the potential. 2. As a Oculus Quest Owner and frequenter of BR gaming hubs I can say yes, VR is pretty niche. But and heres the big but you want to grab ahold of something while it's still young. Apple made the first big touchscreen phone and they were worth over a trillion dollars at one point. 2016 if I recall but they made an investment in a niche market with the possibility to grow and it worked. VR is already growing, ever since HL: Alyx was introduced, we've seen a rapid increase in VR users. So it would be better for them to invest in VR than just pussyfooting around.</TEXT>

It's better than aggressive since you come out with more money and a sense of satisfaction. Plus what's better is you can completely carry someone on SnS. While on Aggressive they need some basic fighting skills. With S amp;S you can just have them follow you and you can take care of all the enemies. No matter which one you pick, do Duggan's Shipments. While yes, it is possible to so S amp;S without it, it saves you a lot of pain in the process.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. You will not get elite challenge but yes. Also you will need to own GTA V on both. If you're willing to glitch it a little bit then you can do something where you (the host) gets 15%, the other Xbox gets 85%. Then you need to quit as soon as you see this green flash when you complete the mission. I'm pretty sure you know the Bogdan glitch which means you'll know this one too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Always choose the machine pistol loadout. While it's not necessary it is amazing compared to the micro smg. If you acidentally choose the SMG then use the vintage pistol instead. 2. Cameras and metal detectors don't detect you if you're walking/running. It's only when you're standing still for more than 3 seconds that they detect ya 3. Choose the waste disposal entrance. Since you'll be at the side instead facing the agents from the front, it'll be easier to aim and carry the mission of it gets to that 4. Aim for the head and then once you've shot quickly shoot the other guy. Most people can go down easily with that. Just remember to do Duggan's at this stage. 5. Use the EMP and Infiltration suits. While I'm fine without an EMP, it does make things easier. I personally like to use it while I'm escaping as that's when the poor level design comes into play. 6. If you're not planning on doing the gold glitch then you can easily collect the daily vault. Just cover on top of it (press the cover button so you're covering on the safe) and spam whatever you press to do actions. It's right D-pad for consoles. This allows you to get the daily vault without another person. Do this while going in and out for extra cash. 7. Try and limit your kills to a minimum. You'll save time and you won't have to shoot down as many cameras.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to the latest leaks, Lockhart will only be downgraded in terms of graphics. So it'll definitely be able to compete with the PS5 for casual gamers. I personally think that the PS5 will possibly have competition when there's a pretty decent system retailing for less than $400 that can do the same shit just not 4k. I'm excited to see how it pans out, maybe Sony can make a save with the all digital or will xbox take the lead?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people are comparing the Quest with a link to the Rift S but here's the thing. The Rift S is made for PC and thus has a bit better screen than the quest. If you've ever looked through one of those screen doors used to trap mosquitoes and the like you'll know the feeling of a web over your normal vision. The quest has that effect as do most VR headsets but the quest in particular has a more exaggerated effect since it's so compact. If you care about that then I wouldn't reccomend the quest. I personally own a quest since I don't notice the effect as much but you might.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not OP but the r/nofap community says that it can create unrealistic expectations and thus neither you nor your partner are satisfied with the experience. You're not satisfied because it isn't over-exaggerated as porn typically is while your partner is also not satisfied since most people want the others to be satisfied aswell. Assuming you're actually in love and not a prostitute or a hookup. In my *personal* experience I've not found this to be the case. To me it's like Social Media, I browse Instagram and Reddit all day (sometimes) and I suffer no confidence issues or more insecurities. I know this is not the case for many other folks however. A friend of mine fell into some pretty nasty depression because she felt bereft of a life of money and Instagram happiness. If you're concerned she's recovered since then but my point still stands. It really depends on how you perceive it. I know porn isn't real and that it's greatly exaggerated. But it could affect you or someone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's UK. Sure my Quest is 399 Pound Sterlings or whatever the dollar is there but if you convert 399 pound sterlings to Canadian Dollars = $671 CAD. Now that's not the actual price of the Quest in UK. The actual price is $319. Y'all have ridiculously high taxes so it turns to 399. 319 pounds into CAD is $539. Which is rounded up to 550 since stores don't constantly change their pricing based on the economy and conversion rate. Different countries have different conversion rates. The Quest is like 30k in India because of the current rate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Finally some non-political r/pics content! I'm not a trump supporter nor a Bernie bro (entirely because I live in Canada) but sweet baby jesus am I getting tired of the political shit I see in here. Some kid took a picture of himself flipping off a presidential car. Like that matters! I'm here for some cool pictures not the political shit. If I wanted to view politics I'd go to r/politics. Good job OP for doing the bare minimum that everyone should've done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Woah there, I'm not saying to spank your kids. I'm saying smack your kid's hand if they're reaching for some hot coals. I'd rather them get smacked by my hand (which doesn't hurt as much as coal) than burning themselves. Both methods achieve the same result: Your kids learn (hopefully) to not touch hot things such as coals or whatever else. However, in the scenario of which you do not physically punish them, they will be punished by the object and I can guarantee whatever small smack to the wrist I'll administer will not equal the painful burn of coal. Children are able to understand very simple reason. And this part is me being selfish but I'd rather not deal with a burn. I'd rather not let my child suffer from the long lasting pain of a burn than some insignificant pain from a small slap to the hand. Burning your hand has more intensity and duration of pain than a smack to it. Both achieve the same goal so: Why make them suffer more intense pain if the lesser evil can achieve the same thing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I did not. Because it's neither funny nor necessary. I do not identify with being a racist but I wouldn't put  gt;I hope all black people die As a username. That would be a terrible unfunny username I see no reason to use. Time out is a less severe punishment that not only takes longer but the child could perceive as less severe. While this is purely anecdotal I will say that as a child, I could just pass the time in "boring" situations such as time out by just imagining something. Hell I even got lost in my imagination and I wouldn't care about what the time out was used for. Not to mention there are children under 2. Also just because someone spanks their kid doesn't mean they're low IQ. I don't agree with spanking but I wouldn't call them Low IQ. I don't agree with the other political party but I wouldn't call them low IQ. Not to mention pain is universal. You don't even need an advanced brain to understand it. If I felt pain when I touched something, I'd understand that said thing is not supposed to be touched. The same would be for a toddler. If a toddler was reaching for something and they felt pain, then they'd associate reaching for X to have pain associated with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not taking race into it. You said "People may have usernames that they don't associate with themselves" I'm simply saying I don't associate racism with myself. Same point could be made with communism. I don't associate communism with myself and thus I wouldn't put "Communism is amazing" as my username. There are many examples I can use, I just chose the first thing that came to mind. IQ isn't directly inherited. I'm pretty sure Albert Einstein's parents are anywhere as near as intelligent as their kids. Plus when a family is privileged enough to be able to provide a good education, then they have far more resources to deal with a problem. Hell if I had enough money, I could buy a playground where it is near impossible to hurt yourself. A poorer family won't have the disposable income to do such a thing. Instead they'd have to discipline their child. Hell if I was rich enough I could refrain from ever correcting my child. Also can we keep our discussion to just one thread please?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll just respond to this comment instead of all the other threads. 1. Do you think I'm implying you should never teach your kids language and hit them? If so, then that is absolutely not true. I'm implying you can teach them with a little smack when they're not intelligent enough to communicate. Secondly: This is teaching them what not to do. Don't touch this because otherwise you'll feel some pain on your arm. Not to hit when you don't get what you want. You're reaching quite a bit. 2. This is talking about your spanking IQ reply. Yes money is a correlation. A completley childproof house is much easier to do when a family can afford to buy baby gates than when they can not. 3. Your employer doesn't hit you because you've developed past the stage of infancy and you can now understand basic reason. Also some employers kinda do: The military. It may not be hitting in more modern armies but painful exercise. I may be fit but it can seriously hurt if you're forced to do 100 pushups in a row. Lastly I'm going to take a break since I've spent 40+ minutes arguing with a stranger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By aircraft spawns I mean Hydras and Molotoks. Both of which can be used for either Duggans or the long haul routes like the Lost MC mission or the Paleto getaway cars. Plus the whole location is better because you can afford more mistakes on a run unlike 8-bit. The Casino Runs are the backbone of your arcade so I'd argue it being shorter is more important. The biggest thing has to be the wallbreach though. Its accessible via Mk2 and you can use it to lose cops on basically any of them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Answer: Truth is a big portion of Reddit are the unpopular kids who hate everyone else. Think of the TV trope girl or boy who hates the" Chad's and Stephanie's". The "Chad's and the Stephanie's" like Instagram because it's fun. So Reddit started hating on it. You'll still see a fair bit of "Instagram bad, Reddit good" memes on this site if you follow some certain communities. Now TikTok is trending. So Reddit is hating on it now. While yes, the above comments are true in that TikTok has been accused of suspicious behavior, that's more so become the argument for why Redditors hate TikTok. Instead of admitting the true reason of hatred: The popular kids using it, people say it's because of privacy reasons. Now don't get me wrong, it's not every Redditor. Some people genuinely care about the Privacy concerns of TikTok. The r/privacy community comes to mind. But *most* Redditors hate it because it's popular and used by the popular kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you go to the Videogeddon garage and keep heading down the alley you'll find a green dumpster. Next to that dumpster is a window that looks broken. Use a Mk2 or deluxo to get inside and voila! Police can see you if you're in front of that window so just head right (facing the window) so they can't see you. It's great for AFK and losing the cops. There's a useless wall glitch (police can see you no matter what) nearby too.</TEXT>

Because the users don't care enough to self moderate considering the general distaste for the sub, they decided to post just random things. Like what happened to World Politics.

    <TEXT>TLDR; It means it's a good opinion regardless of what quadrant I'm in/ that's funny. Correction: It means that their opinion is a good one. That isn't extreme. It's also replied to comedic comments. Sometimes when they're contradictory. For example if an AuthRight (typically the conservative part of the compass) were to say "We should treat black people as equals. We'll unite to kill all the jews" a person might reply based to that. Typically a conservative is viewed as being racist against black people, for one to not do that but instead focus on the Jews is kinda funny since it's subverting a stereotype and replacing it with another (Republican-- gt; Nazi) thus someone may reply based to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tbf this is kinda true. You'd think with all the evilness of Hitler, there'd be a lot of assassination attempts from basically all the allies right? But that's actually false. A lot of allies (not all)didn't send any assassins after him since the man wasn't that good at being a military commander. Plus with all the "hype" for lack of a better word Hitler had created, if he was assassinated a better military leader could take his place and obliterate the allies. One example of this is how he failed to dominate the British airforce since he focused on civilian attacks instead of decimating what little airplane building places the Brits had left.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The races are on tracks but they're not on safe places. There's a stunt race that goes up a building. The tracks certainly aren't legal, the only legal tracks are open wheel races and some traditional land races. The first one is technically attempted suicide or atleast disturbing the peace, second is well idk exactly but you're most likely jumping from a helicopter that will crash on purpose so not legal. Close calls is reckless driving as is driving backwards. I think the wheelie and stoppie ones are the only legal challenges and that's assuming you don't crash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Defensive? Excuse me? I just pointed out some flaws in those examples. C'mon mate keep this relaxed. Plus falling the furthest is still a public disturbance and close calls requires quite a bit of speeding. You can but you won't jump from a helicopter as a passenger. Nobody I've met in GTA has done that challenge with someone flying the heli. It's much easier to do so by yourself than having a friend fly for you. Plus the vast majority of people are driving backwards on the streets. The objective may be "technically legal" but the ways 99% of players achieve them are not. It's absurd how you're defending the legality of activities in a game about crime.</TEXT>

We're discussing legality in terms of the real world. You can murder a person in GTAO and nobody cares. It's only when it's 2 that you get the cops on you. So I wouldn't use the wanted system as a metric to figure out the legality of actions in GTAO. And I was defensive? Wow that's a stretch.</TEXT>

The Ps5 went from being my main console that I'll buy to a "I'll buy the slim maybe" because of gamepass. I'm a sucker for fun experiences and the experience of flying above my house in MC Flight Simulator is amazing as is getting halo for "free". I mean sure PS now has a lot more games but gamepass just has more fleshed out games. There's a subreddit that's a book club but for gamepass and it seems amazing.</TEXT>

Change your outfit and have your spawn location set to arcade 5. Pay 25k to see the vault contents. 6 (if you don't like vault contents). Quit game while you're still looking at the vault contents. If you back out or select an approach then this fails. You can also disconnect internet 7. You'll spawn at the arcade without losing that 25k .

    <TEXT>It's like getting rid of your nuclear bombs and any facilities to make them. You don't want to be the first to do it no matter what you believe. Because if you do then that means you're defenceless. Without exclusives there's further reason for fans to migrate to Ps5. Imagine how many more people would have a PC if all games were cross play and exclusives no longer existed. There would be no real incentive to be on a specific console. But at the end of the day no matter how noble your goal you don't want to be defenseless, and you don't want your company to lose money so you have to treat unity as a double edged sword. Xbox is doing the most they can without slicing their artieres wide open.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Plus one thing I'd like to note is: Professional athletes don't always get paid more. If you're a doctor, you're on a fixed salary: there's too many branches so I'll just say straight out of medical school you get 100k per year. An athlete could earn far less or far more. Because an athlete is essentially a businessman. He/she has to advertise themselves. Though to a lesser extent than actors or comedians, it's still like running a business. Some athletes in minor leagues are barely paying rent while others are able to pay the rent of a small town. It has a lot of sway unlike doctors</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want this and the ability to own a mall for huge amounts of passive income. Think the arcades max take but daily. So at a base price (no upgrades) you'd get 25k every day. It's enough to knock down the fatality of expenses. Then with upgrades like tech stores, food courts and jewelers you'd get more money. This may be too ambitious but I'd like to see each type of store to have it's own bonus. So without any upgrades you won't make that much. Just a consistent 25k. With a jeweler, the game does some Rng for you and if it gets the odds you'll make a random extra 35k. It's random so sometimes you may only get 25k but others you'll get 60k. Food courts and clothing stores give you extra RnG time. So if you buy a clothing store it'll give you 1 extra jeweller roll. So two chances to get that sudden 35-50k. These also make a tiny amount of income. Tech stores are the only ones not linked to jewelers. This makes you an extra 30k. But if you buy all of the above you'll make 100k + maybe the 35-50k you get from the jeweler. Now obviously this should be expensive (10mil full upgrades and 7mil base) so new players don't get their hands on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These steps are for you and your friend. First go to a cart (you'll learn the configurations but generally go for middle then out) and grab ONE BAR then exit out by pressing B or Circle on playstation. Repeat until you've altogether gotten 5 carts. Maybe 3 for you, 2 fir your friend? Idk. Then once you've hit 80k or 70-something on normal go back to one of the carts you glitched by taking a bar from. Start grabbing the gold from that cart, you'll see it double up. Make sure your friend and you start grabbing at roughly the exact same time. Otherwise some of the carts will go "stale" as in you won't be able to grab gold from them. If you go over 150k before your friend has picked up a bar from the glitched cart then it'll go stale.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends. The game counts anything over 3,635,100 as 3,635,100. That's the game's max take. The real max take is infinite. But with two people the mac you can get is 4mil. You don't need anything over 3.7 though. Hell if you're careful you won't need more than the tame max take. Anything over 3,635,100 is just used as a shield against losing money. I typically lose 10-20k on my trip to the heli which is balanced out since I get 3.9 from the vault.</TEXT>

The iPhone Ui with it's blues and greens looks so strange and hostile while I can just be more comfortable in the bit more friendly UI of android. I just believe Google can make better software than iPhone. At the end of the day if a phone can take half decent pictures and have a half decent battery life (+ waterproof) then that's all I need. The software is much bigger on my priorities however. Especially the assistant, you can actually have a conversation with Google Assistant unlike Siri or Bixby.

    <TEXT>TLDR; Gas rises and Rome falls and is vault man hurt? Not at all. While it is true, our players are strong I would say that the entirety of GTA V (NPC'S and everything) have a below average immunity system. Atleast to gas. You'll see this demonstrated if you tear gas yourself or an NPC. Tear gas is generally accepted as non-lethal. All it would really do is severely irritate a person not outright kill them. This however happens to be the case for the entirety of GTA. So based on that (considering there isn't much else that's poisonous except our suicide cyanide) I'll make the assumption that we are weaker to typical poisons than the average human. With this in mind I'd say it takes more time for our player to die as he's A. Jesus but evil and B. Got better discipline. I mean my guy can survive (if we do a real time conversion) for maybe 30min without oxygen (every second irl is 2 min for him) so I'll assume he's better at holding his breath. But that goes away as soon as he's out. As we're in there (with tear gas if activated) for more than 15 seconds. Plus I'd assume he'd stop holding his breath. Not to mention the gas is green #1The gas is GREEN I hope big text works. Anyways, you see the gas isn't enough to cover the desk area where the man works. Infact you can see it rising to the ceiling which is further proof that he's not getting affected by the gas. So with that in mind, I can safely say he's not getting killed by the gas. My man whom I always try to do a fist bump with but then realize he's short so I'm aiming for the head is not getting killed by the gas!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I HATE pixelated games.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-30 16:45:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I absolutely LOATHE pixelated games. I can get if it was an old game like Mario. I played that as a child and it was pretty fun but Mario gets a tiny pass because it doesn't have a lot of pixels. But modern games with pixels are unacceptable. No, they're garbage. It shows a lack of effort on the part of the game developer to use even slight graphics. It scares me that when AAA games are blurring the line between video game and reality some lazy game dev can't even take the time to draw a stick figure! I bought Celeste and my god was it disgusting. A friend introduced me to something, I forgot it's name (like I should) but it was like Isaac or something. The pixels were to kill for and not in a good way. I detested the 5 minutes of playing that game more than I could detest Hitler. Okay maybe the last bit was exaggerated for comedic purposes but you get what I mean. The fact that games like Terraia and Celeste are revered in the gaming world is a sin to me. If we started shaming developers who wasted their talent in game design by making a videogame into a monstrosity with pixels bigger than my head then we'd finally get some half-decent looking games. Or at the very least have the pixels be very tiny. Like Celeste but smaller. And don't get me wrong I can enjoy pixelated games if the benefits outweigh the cons of my eyes begging for mercy. I played Celeste because I was an idiot who wasted his money on a game that looks like someone coloured some sugar cube and put them on a table. And obviously I didn't want to admit my money was wasted. TLDR; Pixelated games are ugly and low effort thus we should get more game developers to put even the slightest bit of damn effort into making a game that doesn't look like utter trash. Rant over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I consider both. If a game has amazing gameplay but terrible graphics then I won't play it (eg. Undertale) or if it has amazing graphics but no content (eg. Err Forza since I'm not a racing guy?) I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. Though your point about gameplay while being cheap does make sense. Less budget spent on graphic designers and more money on nice gameplay. Though it really limits the types of games that can be pixelated. Platformers and maybe top down games are the only ones I can think of and even then it feels limited.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>2d is where pixels end and polygons begin. Not to mention a lot of 2d games (not all) could be made better by using anything that's not pixels. Say for example: Some game with cards. You could make the cards look a lot better with more details printed on. Maybe have a dragon on one of those but you can't get that done nearly aswell on a pixelated game as you can on a non-pixelated one. The problem is with 2d it looks more so like watching a movie than being the character. I personally feel a lot more empathetic to the characters when I feel like I feel like I am the character than when I play Celeste and see a vaguely human-like form that is supposed to be myself scaling a mountain.

    <TEXT>A bit of both. While my opinion changes with pixel count. Roller coaster tycoon takes more effort to make (graphically) than some 16bit game. I'm not going to shit on orginal games since that's tech not effort. So if I see a lot of pixels it'll just be ugly and then again it also depends on borders. Minecraft technically has large pixels but borders aren't as visible. If you look up, it's just a lot of blue, no borders and it looks amazing. While other games use too little pixels that have too visible a border which makes me think it's ugly and lazy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really hope y'all realize that this is because of the gold to gamepass thing going around. They don't want to change it so it's just removing 12month now. Please don't hype this baseless rumour up only to disappoint yourselves. Even if this is true, it's best to approach with some cautious pessimism. That way if it doesn't hold up, you were expecting that but if gold really does become free, you get a nice surprise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gold to gamepass ultimate is an offer they were running in which you could convert existing Gold subscriptions into gamepass ultimate (gamepass + gold) subscriptions of the same months. As gamepass ultimate is more expensive, this is a good deal however people realized if they bought 3 years worth of gold then they can convert it into 3 years worth of Gold + 3 years worth of gamepass which even if you dislike gamepass is still one hell of a deal.</TEXT>

So they can still keep Gold around when they stop the offer. So far they've tried to modify it (only amount of money is converted so 1 year of gold would only be 4 months of gamepass) but I think they're buying time with the 12 month to outright stop the offer without seeming shitty.</TEXT>

So gold could still be around just you can't buy 12months now. Once Next Gen releases or announces they'll stop the deal and let folks have their 12 months gold back. TLDR; Converting $69 of gold into $180 of gamepass ultimate was being taken advantage of by people so they stopped the 12 month gold thing. Probably going to stop the offer soon like at the launch of the console.</TEXT>

So here's how a bunker sale with this would go: Take Marshall and deliver. Teleport back to bunker. Repeat. Only on console: 1. Go to interaction menu and scroll to hide options 2. Click jobs then turn all of them to show 3. Accept Lester Heist invite (except fleeca, get a different one even prison break without a single setup works) 4. Exit apartment and go to your business (also works for VIP work) 5. Start and you'll still see the blue icons on the map 6. Hover over a blue job icon that is close to your destination then press start job. It is X on Xbox and Square on PS. Wait a second for the teleporting sound and power off your controller 7. Keep a close ear or turn up your TV volume and wait to hear some background noise (traffic, waves or conversation). Then listen for a bit until they cut out. Once they're cut out Power on your controller. 8. You'll be at your destination .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both. Obviously as a heist but if you do the math: 10min x 2 (to repay your buddy) it takes 20min to get 1 million. So 40 to get 2. But in casino that is reduced to 30min. Which only gets more apparent as you multiply the amount of rotations. Some people do 8 bogdans (buddy included) that would take almost 1 and a half hours to get while a simple casino would only take an hour. Not to mention it's not merely a 2mil payout either, if you do the gold glitch you can get a 3/4 chance of getting 2.3mil. Even if you get the 1/4 configuration you'll still get a respectable 2.1mil. Which is slightly higher than Bogdan twice. With this math 3 (6 with a buddy) casinos generate basically a whole mil more than Bogdan can in 12 tries. That's an extra 2 tries once the numbers start stackin'! And it just gets worse for poor old Bogdan from there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess it's more consistent but Big Con is basically the easy way to it. The reason you haven't been getting a good payout is because you should do the Gold glitch. It gives you the 2.3 payout I talked of. Plus the 3/4 configurations I talked about give you above the max payout so you'll actually not ever dip below max take assuming you're skilled of course. I suppose it's easy but unless both players know the layout (sub and to just land the avenger on the beach) it'll end up like a failed casino. I don't do B2B's anymore but I used to get 12min for it.</TEXT>

Not to mention both companies will 100% outsell last gen. I mean it's been what? 7 years? That's a long time to gather a decent amount of fans on both sides. I do agree with your numbers as much as I hate to admit. 3:1 is the max I'll see it at and 2:1 is likely. Probably 2.5 or something will make a bit more sense. What I DO think will even out the ratios is the rumored S. Let's face it, a significant portion of the gaming community is underage/in debt. So University students and under. A Series S that has allegedly the same performance specs but not the graphical ones will probably sell like hot cakes.</TEXT>

Plus there's lot of situations where you need other vehicles. If you blew up your Mk2 within 5 min then you'll need something else, to battle air vehicles, for missions where you can't use a missile (anything with a small explosive resistance) or when you need to get somewhere fast. I can keep on going but I'll stop it there. The fact it's a jack of all trades is amazing, I can't be bothered to look at all the garages I own just to find the right vehicle for each situation.

However following that they noticed a lot more injuries (for lack of a better word) on their aircraft to the point they nearly stopped armoring the aircraft. But they then realized they were getting more "injuries" on their aircraft rather than crashes. If you put the protections in place you'll see a lot more cases since there's more protections for the hookers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Communism will never save the planet. Watch and read wholesome stuff as much as you want but humans will always desire to have more. Which breeds corruption. The only other way is if everyone had a Wall-E experience. As in you'd not do any work and just relax. That would be massively detrimental to the human race as we need innovation. Communism won't ever work because of our humanity and in order for it to work we need to sacrifice our humanity.</TEXT>

It's certainly not something I'd go out of my way to buy but the rare time I actually buy it, I enjoy it. It's different from the water and little smoothies I have normally. Hell soda isn't even that tasty for me. I've quite literally never chugged or drank a whole can or bottle of it and it's not particularly enjoyable but since it varies from the norm of what I eat, I enjoy the experience.</TEXT>

Or something similar. But 1488 is actually a neo-nazi symbol. A bunch of people fell for it, mostly on Twitter but that's small compared to this.</TEXT>

But there's more white racists being racist on bpt than black racists on wpt. So bpt combatted that via the verify you're black or a non racist country club rule. Not to mention country club threads were/are just locked to heavy race related subjects. If you're talking about police brutality then they'll lock it so only verified non-racists and POC can comment. If it's just a black person talking about traffic, it won't be locked.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-20 13:14:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay so a couple months previously I was a die hard xbox fan. I was going to pre-order day 1 or atleast by December when the deals go crazy. But now I'm conflicted. Even when I was a die-hard xbox fanboy it was only gamepass that held me onto xbox (and the controller before the Ps5 controller was announced). But I just don't see the point anymore. Halo is a fucking disaster, MS flight sim will be a one time thing for me (a non-aviation enthusiastist) and call of the sea + the other experiences only seem good at best. I rarely play more than one game at a time (bad habit I know) and my current game of choice is GTA V. Maybe minecraft if my friends start playing. Considering how much money the game is raking in I can expect a couple years worth of content so gamepass isn't that worthwhile when I have a game that can offer me so much more. Furthermore, PS has more users and thus more folks to play with (especially with that free online deal) so I'm extremely conflicted on what to choose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up in the shadow of millennials. Where a bunch of games are tailored to Millennials and they're the main audience. Good god is it really annoying. Nostalgia has soured many things I love just so some people can get high on the joys of being a child again. Now I do occasionally get Nostalgic about some things but I'd certainly not play a game in 2020 that has Mario 64 graphics. Or even an artstyle inspired by it so some people can reminisce over their childhood before they screwed up their own life. Truth be told I'm not a big Halo fan. I've never played the games in fact but I played the first one as part of the big collection of them and it infuriates me to see 343(or whoever is making this game) to go back to that primitive artstyle for Nostalgia. It's quite frankly insulting and I wish humans could just not feel the high of Nostalgia so we wouldn't have failures such as this one. It enrages me to see the horrible art styles people can get away with on the fact it looks like how ugly games were a couple years ago</TEXT>

Instead of making new IP's, they're using the same thing with slight differences. I'm not a big smash player so I can say that all I notice between Brawl and Ultimate is maybe a couple new characters. It's not even like COD, HALO, TOMB RAIDER or a lot of other games that innovate the story each time, nope games that are appealing to people's Nostalgia boner are basically remakes.

    <TEXT>It's really easy to find good Tiktoks. From the outside or before a week of using Tiktok, sure it's kinda bad. Tiktok has categories and unofficial titles. Like the outward Tiktok that Reddit loves to hate on is reffered in TikTok groups as "Straight Tiktok" while it may be the most profitable, you also have to realize useless videos are the most profitable on YouTube like Mr.Beast or Morgz or a lot of other channels. Now I put Mr.Beast in there because while charitable, he's not exactly the most creative with his videos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically how much interest money the bank can get off of you. Low credit means while they get some interest, you are likely to miss payments and they'll need to wait a bit to get their full loan + interest back. I forgot the exact range but 700 is what is a good credit. That means you pay your loans on time (not too early or late) and the banks get the most intrest out of you. Higher than that means you pay more of it than they expect like 600/month instead of the expected 500. Which means less time to collect interest. Fun history fact: Before computers and the internet took over you had to get a recommendation from your bank like: Hey fellow bank, I'd like to let you know this guy is a normal sucker who'll give you a lot of intrest money/ he probably won't miss his payments</TEXT>
