    <TEXT>Best buff idea for Crypto. Crypto's drone has the potential to offer great utility. The issue is that it's way too easy to shoot down so it's bloody useless. Here is my simple proposal to easily remedy this. When the drone is stationary i.e. not being piloted by Crypto, make it project a front facing shield, very similar to a knockdown shield with about 600 health. So enemies will either have to spray down the shield or shoot the exposed back to kill it instantly. This will make it a much more viable and strategic tool as you can set it up in choke points or corners for enemies to be detected as it's intended to, but without it being one shot. Right now the drone is so loud and easy to locate as soon as it's stationary, people will just shoot it as soon as it detects them. Totally useless. I love Crypto but his drone serves very little purpose right now to Crypto himself, beside EMP spamming, so I see him as very much low tier right now. Obviously, when EMPing the shield will go down as well. If anyone sees any flaws in this idea let me know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Woah you seem to be thinking the shield would be massive. It would just be large enough to cover the front of the drone. It wouldn't fully cover you standing behind it. You could still be shot in the head or legs. It's just meant to keep the drone alive. Caustic's traps already cover his whole body and they are infinite health until they despawn. And so what if Crypto could use it as a bit of cover. Would add an extra bit if strategy to his kit but still easy to work around. And once the shield is depleted it's got a cool down time before it's up again. Not broken at all. Necessary and ideal buff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sounds cool. But to balance it he would have to hack the respawn station in person and not by drone I think. Maybe they already have this planned as an ability for another legend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really expected a Mirage rework or at least a buff in this update. He's an awesome character but his kit makes him low tier. I'm really surprised and disappointed the devs didnt make any changes to him. Is this something that is at least being worked on?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read an article a little while back about a datamined PIN system being developed that would allow for Cross progression between console and PC. I have a great PC setup with the best peripherals, but when Apex came out I wanted to squad up with my brothers who only had Xboxes. I decided to play with them and we've had a blast since launch and I've played Apex exclusively on xbox and have become really good. The cosmetics in Apex were too good to pass up, so I've probably put $200+ into the game on xbox since launch. Now however I've switched over to PC and been playing Apex on there and love the precision of aiming and better movement. But I'm reluctant to play on there without all my juicy cosmetics and skins. Does anyone think there is a good chance they'll implement cross progression somehow, like Fortnite? At Apex's release I remember a Dev saying it wasn't possible, but a PIN system might be a solution and nothing is really impossible is it. PLLEEEAASE devs this would make me and a lot of other people so happy  #128557; #128557; #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Warzone is arcady and doesn't care about balance so will just add whatever. Apex is trying to be a competitive shooter so they don't want to add solos when some legends will completely outshine others. I disagree with this mentality though. Just add solos, doesn't need to be competitive. It's ridiculously fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right dude. I'm giving it the right amount of time and I can feel my brain creating the new muscle memory pathways lol Getting a lot more instinctive and feeling natural. Will be quite a bit more time until it just feels right though, when my brains made the full conversion. That's a really good idea to bind your buttons like that. Do you use hold to crouch or toggle to crouch?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I know I'm not psychotic?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I've always hoped I wasn't psychotic because I have been able to distinguish reality logically, but it still doesn't stop these intrusive thoughts tormenting me daily. How do I know they aren't delusions? Because I can't dismiss them or reduce them even though I know they're irrational. Does anyone else feel like no one else exists or exists only in your mind and gets a feeling of paranoia as a result? Is it normal to feel paranoid with dp/dr? How do I know the difference between paranoid ideology and severe anxiety? Where's the line?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously I'd prefer to avoid becoming psychotic though. I've had dp/dr for 8 years now, since I was homeless and abused as a young teen. I still have hope that one day something will pull me out of this mental state and Ill be right as rain. My method has been to try and keep a somewhat normal existence going so if that day comes, I havent completely lost my life to this thing. But in pushing myself to act a certain way despite my mind and body screaming no, hide! I feel I have just made the rift from myself deeper. I wonder if I prioritise my treatment now, move somewhere new away from my trauma and actually feel human again, I dont even know what that would look like on the other side. I appreciate you responding, I'm curious how long you've had dp/dr for? And how old you are? And what are your thoughts on this? This is the first time I've been active on this subreddit and I've never asked anyone directly about their own experiences.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did my wild imagination and propensity to fantasise contribute to the development of my dp/dr?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 09:50:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would always play pretend with my brothers until a rather late age (12), and I was socially anxious at school and never really given the opportunity to form close relationships with other kids because I was always shifted from school to school. I was also book worm, so I was engrossed in fantasy books. I always thought and was told my imagination was a gift and I thought it was awesome I could visualise entire worlds in my head. I wonder if when the trauma hit my life though, this turned against me and fueled the self perpetuating, rather creative ideas of dp/dr? Can anyone else relate to this? Were we all very creative, introspective kids?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Find a room in your house where you will be undisturbed and sprawl out on the floor like your making a snow angel. It is very helpful if your room is cool, so turn on the air conditioner so it's just a bit chilly. Your body reacts very well to temperature change, and the slight cold will make you feel pleasantly pleasant. Close your eyes, breath deeply and steadily and with every worry that comes into your mind just respond to it with 'nothing matters'. Feel like your soul is missing? Nothing matters. Feel like all your memories are disappearing? Nothing matters. Feel like you're a terrible human? Nothing matters. Worried about something you said to a friend years ago? Nothing matters. Feel like you will be swallowed by the abyss? It doesn't matter. Just be a vessel completely separate to the firing of neurons in your head. Whatever you think will happen, just let it happen, don't give a shit. Lie there as long as you need to. Don't think about things you need to get done. Just as long as you need, nothing matters...
