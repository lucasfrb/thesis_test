    <TITLE>What the hell is "Carmel Sauce"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-22 21:14:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I see this modifier on mobile all the time and it fucks me up because I got Cr Syrup, Dark Carmel Sause, and Cr Drizzle. No item called Cr Sauce. Worse- some people even ask for pumps of syrup (cool)  amp; sauce. Its separate from the Carmel Flavourings I already have, and furthermore has a pump apparently. Did I hit my head?? Am I actually hallucinating in a hospital bed?? What yall do about this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its spring in my area and Im reminded how much I love the little guys. Particularly fond of Wolf spiders and Domestic House Spiders- whenever Im working on a project someone will hang out near the ps4 (warm) and later check out the workspace when things settle down. They're like weird small cats, I find them charming. Do we like certain pets?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thought it was a giant house spider, but apon closer investigation had no markings and different "skin". Homeboy looked exactly like a Hobo Spider to a T, however this guy was two inches long. Size: about 2 inches leg to leg Colour: reddish brown Markings: none Legs: long and slender Mandibles: large Abdomen: clear segments but not waspish Dementor: very skittish. Despite the size made no moves to tag my hand through the cup Overall appearence: lovely! Just a little to big for indoors Apologies for no photo, it was fairly late so lighting was terrible</TEXT>

I always blank on what to write, so what are some really solid comments to leave you? Edit: thank yall so much for the responses, I always tip/star/checkbox but was really overthinking my comments. I usually default to "nice guy, great driver" or "great music taste" but was worried that those were too general/common. Additionally, what are some unintentionally rude comments you get?

    <TEXT>I wouldn't try to get them to open up if theyre this private rn Silent affirmation in physical touch can be nice, just make sure you give them space to process. I know when Im going through some emotional turmoil good intentions can make me irrationally scared or angry- Im not good with feelings so my brain just panics and hits the fight or flight button. Distraction is a good idea if theyre really wallowing in it, getting out of the house and doing something busy like shopping at a new market. Makes for an interesting trip, and keeps them focusing on productive thinking, as well as getting some fresh air in a new environment. At the end of the day though if they need to be depressed, they might legitimately need that. Sitting around with your feelings can help process and acknowledge them- getting your thoughts in line before you open up about them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really wouldn't, at least not long term. Its good to challenge yourself, but this job really actively tries to trap people and the benefits of being a shift arent worth the negative aspects. Ive seen being a shift break a lot of people, not because of the work itself- but the constant corperate pressure and lack of recourses. You can request coverage but upper management usually doesnt listen. However you still get in trouble when the shift doesnt go well. You be expected to put up with a lot of corperate created issues but wont get the help you need. They will expect you to work far ahead of your pay grade and often wont be trained properly. The raise isnt great, and your availability wont be respected. I would do it for a few months and then go back to barista. Just for the resume.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I mean you become jaded pretty quickly working with the public, a lot of people who seem nice end up really surprising you. Just found out a regular at my store has been making borderline suggestive comments at underaged employees for years. Even if a customer makes a small mistake, its cathartic to make mild complaints in the back room because theres literally nothing else you can do in retaliation. It also really adds that we're essential employees working during a plague, asked to complete extra labor for no extra pay. Nobody is trying to be mean, its just people who're in a bad position and cant do anything about it. Honestly, never assume customers see you as people- its gonna hurt way worse when they try to get you fired or throw things at you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Their bite can have symptoms, but its pretty mild. Most spider bites are just going to be quick tags without any venom, but if you do get bit its no more dangerous than a bee sting. If you get a really solid bite (messing with its eggs or something) you can get swelling and fever along with the expected pain of any bite. Good to get any bite looked at, but this one isnt much to worry about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Caffe just means coffee, latte means (ingredient) amp;steamed milk, mocha means caffe latte with chocolate. A caffe mocha and a mocha latte are 1)the same thing and 2) contain unnecessary words If you like cold coffee drinks with chocolate, an iced mocha, an iced coffee with chocolate, and my personal suggestion if trying something new: mocha frappe with an added shot of espresso. Quick tip, you can radically change the flavour of the drink with the milk. High fat content milks (whole milk, h amp;h, heavy cream) nerf the bitterness and channel sweetness, while low fat milks (almond, oat, and nonfat) bring out the coffee. Almond milk is great in iced drinks especially- in addition to raising up the coffee flavour the nuttiness pairs really well with chocolate, and elevates it without going too sweet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly there isnt much to do about it, like you said everyone is working as quickly and efficiently as possible At a certain point the fault is in corperate understaffing the stores and the customers before you bulk ordering Theres a pandemic going on, and yet someone who orders a tea will have to wait for the 5 customers who each ordered 6+ items- often time consuming items like frappes and paninis Sending complains (even totally in good faith) will usually just result in upper management coming down harder on the baristas. You gotta very specifically complain about labor cuts and bulk orders, and mention the clear difference in customer service when employees are happy. Im so sorry this happened, and thank you for your sympathy. Its hard to remember that there are people that genuinely do care and want to change things for the better, and I thank you for coming to say that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, something about me (and a lot of us) gives the vibe of someone more confident with intimacy, but that inferior Fe got us looking foolish. Im personally pretty guarded, and intimacy tends to give me the willies. I can only speak for myself, but I prefer when my partner doesnt tiptoe so much. Gives me more anxiety about the whole thing. When my partner is the first to use physical contact it kind of gives me an idea of whats acceptable in the situation- I might tease them for being sappy, but deep down its really nice when a partner isnt afraid to initiate. It gives me something to build off of, so I dont feel totally lost. Once I know where the boundaries are Im MUCH more relaxed. I would be blunt with your affection, and test the waters. If youre already a pair, I wouldnt worry too much about scaring them off. A back massage or head scratch can be a really nice surprise, and get them to open up a bit more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yeah no the whole "the guy has to move first" thing is utter bs. Its all about having fun and having both of your needs met, and everyone is different. Thats a good question, Id probably ask if they wanted to do a casual activity that yall both enjoy. "Yo Im thinking of going fishing sunday you wanna come with?" Gives them the option to say no without feeling pressured. Idk why, but apparently a lot of istp have this wierd fear of relationships (me included lol) bc you get this sudden irrational feeling of being trapped by social obligation. Not knowing what your partner expects out of you is definitely part of it for me at least. Id make sure the relationship feels like "friends first, dating second", and continue doing the sort of stuff yall've always enjoyed doing. Continue going hiking, or exploring abandoned locations- whatever you want. In my last relationship, we started as casual friends and the second we started dating it was like dressing nicer and going out to the city. I felt hella drained and didnt know what they wanted. Invite them over and chill, just keep the progression feeling natural. If you wanna progress and do something bigger, continue to keep the vibe relaxed and normal. Road trips are a great way to test the water- youre gonna be together but its calm and peaceful</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely based communication man, we love that. Im not always great handling others emotions even if I really want to, and sometimes give "fixer" advice rather than letting them vent or helping distract. Learning to ask "what can I do to help?" has been a great lesson in just listening to others. Just because I want to help in one way, doesnt mean its what another person needs in that moment of frustration. Im absolutely about your relationship, and love hearing your side of this- kindof puts into perspective some faults I definitely struggle with. The point you made about needing to describe physically what you need really resonated, sometimes I feel like my brain is full of birdseed when Im trying to help someone emotionally.</TEXT>

Get in the habit of using the item wheel and checking your notes for monster information. (Also keep in mind to report into the book guy at astera to make sure your info is up to date) I played solo the whole game up untill a while after iceborne was released, you just gotta get into the swing of it. If a monster is really thrashing you, try a new weapon type for a while and see if it helps. Anjananth gave me hell with dualblades, and the insect glaive worked much better with my play style</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hate to say what everyone else has said, but practice and time really make a world of difference. Wish there was a training app you could take home- but thats not a possibility right now. If customers hassle you thats normal, just ignore them. Try to remember the formula for a latte, and the typical pump/size quantity. Grande=4 will take you far, because you can work out how many go into the other sizes. Another thing they might not have mentioned, is most hot drinks are just types of lattes. A mocha is a latte with chocolate, a carmel macchiato is an upside down vanilla latte with finesse and so on. Hell, an americano is a latte with water instead of milk and an extra shot. If you see a new drink getting released, theres a good chance its a latte with a new syrup. Keep in mind the register is organized pretty badly in the custom mod tab, but the rest is generally easy. Bottom tabs are drink catagories, right tabs are types of mods. Brewed drinks are gonna be iced/hot coffee (the plain boys) while espresso is gonna have macchiatos and americanos. What items are you having trouble with in the register? Good way to remeber the headsets (based on my old store and the headsets we had idk if they got changed) A is for the asshole in the drive through- B is to bitch to your coworkers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive never been super afraid of spiders, but definitely got iffey around them being close. Wanted to get over my adversion (genuinely like the little guys) so I started just immersing myself in spider lore. Learning to id the ones in my area, and letting them hang out in my room has helped a lot. Recently I let one run into my hand and laughed out loud when he was so spooked he sprinted in the opposite direction. If you wanna keep one as a pet in a fishtank that might be a place to start- then you know they arent gonna surprise you. Ground spiders (wolf, grass, ect) are a great place to start because they arent harmful and are pretty shy. Otherwise, look up videos of pet jumping spiders. Theyre extremely intelligent and seem to enjoy human company</TEXT>

They have this crazy worldwide fear but dont do much. You live in texas and yall got rattlesnakes- those are an actual threat. Brown recluses are extremely shy and dont want to fuck with you, thats why actual bites are so astronomically rare- even rarer are impactful bites. Ive lived in black widow territory forever and never been bitten. You dont have anything to worry about lol if anything? You literally moved a baby recluse outside and named him thomas, in an extremely uneventful interaction. Most spiders dont inject venom when they bite humans- that takes concious effort and theyre terrified of you. Chances are you wont see him ever again, Id just wish him well on his shyboy endeavors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lmao spider bite photos are insane- keep in mind most people dont even know when a spider bites them because its so unnoticed. Those pictures get thrown around because theyre worst case scenario outliers. If someone gets a really bad tarantula bite and doesnt wash it its probably gonna get infected. Sometimes there are bad bites but theyre so rare, its much easier to get a hornet sting. I literally had some known aggressive spiders living in my bathroom for months and we just vibed because I wasnt sticking my finger in their face. Im really glad you had a good interaction with the little guy! An interesting protip if you arent comfortable with the prospect of another recluse in your house (or widow)- ground spiders and cellar spiders (daddy long legs) are pretty deadly to them, and harmless to you! Cellar spiders got really long legs and big webs which makes them hard for other spiders to deal with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So TiSe works by taking in information from the real world and turning it into an internal logic. Ni is informed by these two, and presents as gut feelings. If your TiSe is working well your Ni is probably going to be very accurate. This can work against your favour however, in the form of paranoia- Ni gets bad vibes, and because you can typically trust your gut it can be hard to shake</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean fe is still generally our downfall so Im unsurprised youre having trouble gauging whats expected as a friend- I struggle with that all the time Wanna connect to people, but it doesnt come naturally, so humour kindof helps facilitate the process. I wouldnt worry so much fam, if you dont have social energy but wanna hang Id just be real about it. The amount of times Ive hung out with my boys and prefaced it saying "hey heads up Im fuckin cranky rn" and then had a great time with no social pressure.. Fr just be honest with your friend and practice trusting them. They really aren't judging over every small thing, same way you probably dont notice the things theyre insecure over.</TEXT>

We already do the work of multiple people, the fact that they cut labor even further and expect us to _earn it back???_ like its some tv privilage??? This is a job, and we agreed to work a certain amount when we were hired. Corperate doesnt get to pretend theyre above us and our criticism when we make all their money. This week I trained two newbies during record heatwaves and smokestorms, and every training shift was during peak. Im one of the last vet employees at my store rn, so obviously Im hopping on the bar and helping. While we were making hundreds in seconds I was somehow expected to thoroughly train them on foams, frappes and the like. Cant wait for my sm to give me a "talking to", this is preposterous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No like I understand where youre coming from and I enjoy hearing other sides, but there is no direct link of bias towards sensors because every person uses functions differently- the second someone doesnt fit a stereotype all bets are off Si and Se look extremely different, and not every sensor is a good worker. Not to mention Entjs, which are considered one of the potential "best" employees are intuitives. The job market needs vastly varying skillsets even for the same job.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats pretty common, and theres two main ways you can go about it- change up the drink ingredients or turn the extra fat into muscle. Pretty much everyone Ive seen gain weight after working here only gained a few pounds, and fairly quickly turned it into beef points. Try carrying 4 milks at a time or volunteering for trash runs. Otherwise you could sub dairy options for nondairy lowcal version/add less sweetened prouducts. 2 less pumps of white mocha, no whip with almond milk is pretty good. You mentioned you like guava tea, try going light ice and light guava- you'll still taste it but get much more tea.</TEXT>

She will aggressively try to make conversation for at least 10 minutes. You will remake this drink twice. She will call you after close to tell you how the drink is, and talk shit about your coworkers. She might come in tomorrow and ask for a new one on the house if it didnt "taste right".

    <TEXT>Irl bias just doesnt fucking exist tbh- we all struggle with different things yes, and sometimes you can connect that to functions, but pretending all sensors are just A+ at doing things irl is dumb fuckery. Irl skills need to be learned by everyone, and you need experience to achieve that. We all have issues, blaming them on intuition, and lashing out at Nebulous Mean Sensors is the diaper babiest thing Ive ever heard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best thing to do is 1) wash any laundry thats been in storage near the carpet for a while (sweaters or blankets out of use), 2)vacume thoroughly, 3) sprinkle borax powder around the carpet and in any spots theyve been congregating Borax powder is easily found as powder laundry detergent- just double check that its borax specific. Usually runs fairly cheap, so Id grab a few boxes to lie down a good coating. Vacume the excess off the carpet after letting it sit a while. I like to leave some, as the borax keeps the larvae from hatching</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally really vibe with it, gameplay is pretty streamlined but you still have plenty of opportunity to change your battle tactics. Granted, havent completed the game but so far the pacing feels pretty solid. If I have one complaint- there are some stretches of storyline that are basically just extended cutscene/vis novel segments that can go for a week. Pretty hard to save the game, and I end up skipping through dialogue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a heads up, with the current formatting of the request it will probably be pretty hard to get a bite- recommend just posting a photo with the title something like "mystery shipment" so its easier for IDers to reconize while scrolling. At which point you can comment on your own post and paste the backstory Sorry I cant help much btw, he looks like some type of ground spider or rancho but unfortunately I dont have a lot of knowledge with commonly sold spider breeds. Personally, if you know they sell ranchos Id start with looking into popular pet species. Good luck mate!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ever experienced a betta that enjoyed being touched?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 11:07:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had a plakat a while back who wierdly enjoyed touch. We adopted him from petco after seeing him there time and time again (pale and lethargic). Got fed up and grabbed him, and after about 2 months hed changed colours and became one of the friendliest (and aggressive) fish Ive met. Anytime I walked into the kitchen, hed run back and fourth by the glass excitedly- so Id often play "follow the finger" while I walked by. Due to (betta fish circumstances) there were a couple of times Id have to prospective roommate from the tank, and he quickly learned I usually meant good things. At one point out of curiosity, I let him check out my finger, and found out that he really liked either resting beside it or wiggling up against it. Wierded out, decided to see if hed do it again when hed run by the tank. Basically anytime he was excited and playful, he would willingly come run himself against my fingers. After withdrawing my hand, hed come demand my attention by the tank again. Was worried he might be sick and itchy- but never saw him scratch against his furnature. Anybody ever had experience with this? Id never really heard of outgoing fish- only tolerant ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #9757; #65039;was gonna say. Its possible hes stressed out and hiding in the furnature- if rocks or plants have edges (and hes been lethargic/ resting a lot) he couldve had some roughing up. Check the pleco and see if he has any similar problems. Id also personally separate him from the main tank- dont want him irritating the other guy or coming into contact with anything potentially causing harm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean its really hard to give any sort of advice- it really sounds like the two of you are trying your best under the circumstances and openly communicating in the direction of actual problem solving. Unfortunately like you said, it seems to be a problem of personalities and duration. Id personally say the only way to salvage the relationship would be to establish a connection outside of work- that way your views of each other arent defined by the work environment. If your coworkers are ever down for drinks it could be a good opportunity to flesh out the relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being useful to others is a fufilling feeling but dont base your entire worth on it- otherwise youre gonna feel useless when youre only useful to yourself. Do things for others for sure, but make sure you focus on yourself first. Its something I struggle with a lot, and makes me feel insecure when I cant hit it out of the park. Wowing your peers feels great, but youre going into a loose loose situation if you make it your constant state. Youre gonna feel worthless if you miss, and burnout if you manage to succeed most of the time. Take some time away from helping others, and work on just appreciating your own company.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yeah no I get the same way- tripping myself up with what others think of me (and assuming everyones as hypercritical as I am). Just keep in mind that you dont judge others as harshly as you do, your coworkers have made a million mistakes that youve no doubt forgotten in 30 seconds. At the end of the day others perception of you isnt super sturdy, and subject to change with the group youre in- its nice to ask a really close friend how you honestly come across for extra data but keep in mind you arent really acting "yourself" if youre trying to be what everyone needs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The future holds a lot of potential, and theres a ton of stuff I want to get better at. However I try not to think about it too much- working towards one career seems less fufilling than trying different stuff out and learning new skills. The painful thing is you cant always just change careers, sometimes you gotta make rent for a while. When I get antsy about the future I make an effort to work on improving areas of my life that will come in handy when I _can_ change jobs. For example, improving hand eye coordination/dexterity by idly flipping stuff. You get that good feeling of improvement while still relaxing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep him dry, hes a house spider and Im p sure they get their fluids from prey. Hes not gonna eat dead flies, a live ones gonna be the best bet. Idk what bugs you can scrounge up but they arent picky and often eat other spiders. Just dont put anything potentially dangerous in there (like a bee or beetle). I will give you a heads up though, while not really dangerous per se, yellow sac spiders are more aggressive and their bite can cause some side effects (nausea, blistering, soreness) so just be wary</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find that if I keep thinking or getting angry about someone/something who hurt me, I generally have some sort of ambiguity associated with them. "Was I wrong", "lets break down into absolutes what happened and judge from a third person perspective", "what specifically about this situation is hurting so much". Once I take some time to think about it I let myself mope if need be, and try to ensure Im not enforcing a false narritive. In terms of grieving (general wallowing) after I work through complicated feelings I like to either find catharsis through music or artwork. Music and art resounds with me more than personal sharing (which just makes me feel weak/vulnerable). It also helps me find strength in creating art that mirrors how I feel in a visual medium. You know, open up intimately without feeling prone.</TEXT>
