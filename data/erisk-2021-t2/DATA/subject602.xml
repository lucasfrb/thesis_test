    <TITLE>A possible fix for no land beyond</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-26 17:39:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just a quick idea i came up with the other day while playing with my new shitty nightfall drop. How about bungie change up the second perk so that you get a critical hit no matter where you hit the target, or at least extend the size of the crit zone by a certian percentage. This way it is still quite a hard weapon to use and master due to the awfully slow fire rate, sights and handling of the thing, but if you do manage to hit what you are aiming at you are rewarded by that massive damage bonus. I understand that this may need some tweeking for balance issues, but something along these lines would be cool and make a truly crap exotic into an interesting weapon that mixes up gameplay a bit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Has anyone else on the bridge section of crotas end been getting this glitch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-01-20 23:23:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So me and my regular fireteam has done the raid three times today and every time, even since the hotfix, we've had this glitch. Basically we do it legit, two on centeral and two on each totem, we kill the swordbearer as the bridge has formed and grab the sword. (I'm normally the first to go as im the only level 32 in the group.) So i get to the other side and kill the gatekeeper, and literally the second the bastard drops, the two ogres spawn instantly. At first the whole team instantly panicked, but we managed to fend them off, and got the rewards. Keeping in mind everyone was alive when this happened. This happened all three times we ran the raid and these runs happened both before and after the hotfix. Just wondering if it has happened to anyone else, seems like the most convenient glitch ever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Name: sonder veldt (known on venus as 'the dusk walker') Gender: male Race: human Age: unknown, but face is scared and aged (12 years as a guardian) Class: stormcaller Backstory: Previously a top student at the Ishtar academy, and a specialist in the application of experimental fusion physics on weapons and armour, sonder was revived by a curious ghost who made it as far in as venus. He awoke in his laboratory, overgrown with vegitation and filled with seemingly naturally occurring vex technology. Although he was not particularly young back in the days of the collapse, he looked far older when he was awoken and his face far more scared and rugged. he thought at the time that this artificial aging must have been something to do with him being dead next to vex machines for many years. using the help of his ghost he salvaged the technology that he partially understood and made some partiallly functional, but very 'rickity' Armour. He spent the next few years making name (and some better armour) for himself on venus, trying to re learn all of the knowledge he spent countless years memorising before the collapse. His fascination with the vex and their vast time travel network was what earned him his nickname of Dusk Walker, as he would spend his evenings walking among dead vex structures admiring them as the sun set. Also during his time on venus he found the blueprints to the fabled pocket infinity and the emmensley powerful sleeper stimulant and attempted to recreate them himself. Due to his previous expertese in fusion technology he made some fairly good (although not always reliable) replicas of the ancient designes. After many years he finally finished his jump ship project that he had started a few months after being revived by his ghost, and set off for the planet on which he was born... Earth. When on venus he had made radio contact with the vanguard and the speaker many times, and he had been educated on the last city and the battle of twilight gap. All he wanted to do was to use his knowledge to help humanity, but on his arrival on earth he found he did not agree with the speaker and consensus and how they were going about rebuilding humanity. after his falling out with the tower authorities he built a small 'base of operations' in the form of a large shack made of scrap in the barren wastelands of old Russia. He now spends his time helping passerbys and guardians seeking out his help. And also carries out secret personal strike like missions for cayde-6, his only friend in the tower whom he stayed in contact with after his falling out with the rest of the vanguard. These strikes are limited to earth though as his jump ship was only built for one voyage and he does not have anywhere near enough materials to make another one. Weapons: .pocket infinity replica .sleeper stimulant replica Armour: vex like robes and armour that look similar to the hezen lords armour set only more bulky, less symmetrical and more 'homemade' *apologies for all the spelling and grammar issues, never been a large writer and did this all in a half hour lunch break*</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** * The PC will be used mostly for gaming but will also need to be able to run image and video editing programmes such as photoshop well.  gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** * my budget overall is  #163;1000 but that includes the monitor so will probably be looking to spend about  #163;850 on the tower its self.  gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** * As soon as possible  gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** * as stated before the budget covers the tower and the monitor.  gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** * I will be shipping to the UK.  gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** * The only re used parts are the keyboard and mouse, and they are not of any major concern as they will be upgraded at a later date.  gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** * I am not interested in overclocking.  gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)** * no specific features required.  gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?** * case size is not an issue, and i would rather a simple case with plain colours and no LED's/window.  gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?** * no copy of windows needed.  gt;**Extra info or particulars:**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>System: PC Gamertag: diazgroup Country/time zone: UK (GMT) When I usually play: usually play a couple of weekday evenings between 6pm  #8217;n #8217; 2am ish (GMT) and occasionally during the day at weekends about myself: been playing destiny since the first beta of D1, had about 2500 hours of glorious playtime. Owned D2 and played quite a bit of it (still substantially less than D1 that shit took up more time in my life than college did) but fell off due to loosing interest just before CoO released. Since the release of forsaken I #8217;ve become fully re-addicted. Got two characters on the go currently, one (approx)510 light warlock and a hunter that hasn #8217;t been touched since base game but I #8217;m planning on getting back up to three characters in the next month or so What I #8217;m looking for in a clan: Just a nice ass, chill ass group of people to do endgame stuff with. I used to play d1 on ps4, had a good circle of people to play with there, but as D2 came out and I made the switch to PC, none of my clan made the switch with me, so I #8217;ve played mostly solo for my D2 experience. with coming back after so long, I #8217;ve still to try escalation protocol, blind well, competitive crucible all that good stuff (I #8217;m lonely and want to kill alien things in fun ways pls help)</TEXT>
