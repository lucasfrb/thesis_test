    <TITLE>Do you think dysphoria is necessary to be considered trans?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-18 01:46:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I asked my mom to call me by they/them because i had been thinking a lot about if i was non binary or not. Being called by he/him or she/her doesnt really insult me, it just feels wrong in some vague abstract way that i dont really know? Im just really confused and indecisive, i know other people cant decide for me if im Trans or not, but maybe hearing from other people could help me? I dont feel very strongly any way in particular and mostly allow people to call me whatever and i wont correct them. I dont feel dysphoria, i dont like my chest, but i dont wear binders hardly ever and ive been noticing how i act traditionally female. It makes me doubt myself, especially when i buy fem clothes because when im shopping it looks cute but it makes me feel like im faking for attention... idk are there other people who feel just completely lost? I could be gender fluid or something else but i feel like when i try to talk about trans issues or enter trans spaces im just a cis lesbian. And then i just cant end the sentence like that because i need to contradict myself constantly aaaghhh im gonna stop this rambling post here, hopefully it made s bit of sense to someone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think ever since i was aware of trans people and on the internet interacting and hearing from them ive been questioning myself. Its gotten a lot worse recently, because of quarantine i mostly just think about myself. Im also an indecisive person in general so it makes sense to me that nothing i say or think is correct? I must have been struggling with this for at least a few years,, but actually when i asked my mom to call me by they/them she said that i had asked her before and then told her to stop when she kept messing up. I dont remember that at all though  #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can i trust therapy when ive only ever had bad therapists?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-31 04:37:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>So before i go on let me say the im 16 and have had like... 5 or 6 therapists so far. I know (hope at least) that there are therapists out there that can help me. However, i am tired of wasting my time looking for things that i might not need in the first place... like im not good at talking to them when im in therapy but when i dont have one im all "omg im soooooo saaaaad maybe therapy will help" even though i know full well i wont find anyone i like because i cant be pleased, i wont be able to talk because im a stubborn idiot, and im just gonna spend more of my MOMS money. The last therapist i had was online (because of quarantine) and i couldnt do zoom because i hate my face so we talked over text and they felt like a robot spitting endless questions in my face. I hated it and now i have to wait until after corona calms down (like seriously what's her problem?) But im really alone because i cut myself off from all my friends and i really want to talk to someone but i dont feel like i can. I dont even have anything i want to say........ UGHHHH This is more of a rant than anything else. thanks if you read any of that :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>this is the second post ive seen talking about ghosting and i feel attacked  #128531; so ig just ignore this. I always feel bad when i ghost people but my brain tells me that because they dont text me first they dont care about me. So i usually realize that im in the wrong after MoNTHSS and i dont want to bring it up and apologize because i feel like they just dont want to be my friend, like honestly if you had been talking with someone and you didnt text them in weeks/momths and you dont check up on them once maybe its not ALL MY FAULT SOPHIA ( #128548; #128548;)... there has been one person who i completely ignored and cut off even though they were trying to talk to me and i really dont know why i do that its horrible :(( i never apologized to them and i never plan to though because i just cant face them........... ok everyone downvote me now, i deserve it :")</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-24 06:04:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I (16) want to tell her how i feel but i have no idea how to articulate it. Everytime i try it feels like im pulling shit out of thin air and i feel so dumb. She knows i SH and she is really chill about it (maybe too chill). She knows i smoke and drink and shes seen me break down a few times over school and crap... she always asks how im doing and i always say im fine,, even after ive just been SHing and drinking and smoking... i know i dont have to lie to her, i just dont know what to say,, i dont think she could even help me so idk why i want to talk to her at all.. she usually just makes me feel worse (inadvertantly,, but still) but she keeps asking and shes the only person i have in my life ((and thats why i hate her  #128531; #128531;)) i want to say something but i really dont feel like im going through anything... sure in the moment, while im selfharming, i know that im fucked up and i know i need help,, but when im just sitting around looking at my phone smiling at stupid memes on reddit,, like the fact that i can still laugh means that nothings wrong right??? Right? I feel like i shouldnt even be posting here because im not depressed,,, but i need to stop posting on r/ selfharm... no one ever cares about what i post anyway,, ill just cry because thisll get 1 like and ill know that im just a pathetic piece of shit that doesnt matter to anyone</TEXT>
