    <TEXT>The person who posed the question wants the longest word(s) for gender so I #8217;d say they would want the basic ASCII set which is 7bit. I guess they want to know how many 7bit characters would fit into 10mb. I think would be 1,000,000 divided by 7 then multiplied by 8 - roughly 1,142,857. You #8217;d need machine code or some clever higher level code to do it I guess. It might be easier to use the extended ASCII set of 8bit and then the answer is in the question 1,000,000. The second question seems redundant so I won #8217;t bother with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You might try having the array as a parameter of the function. All arrays are passed by reference so any updates will pass back. If that works then there #8217;s some issue with passing back arrays by returning them.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m glad you found something you liked in the end. I ended up as a cleaner. I thought piss/shit would be horrible but it was actually a great part time job.

I #8217;m in IT now and with COVID I #8217;m the same as you. I don #8217;t see anybody. I get the occasional idiot user, but every job has something to deal with.</TEXT>

They get taken from friends and loved ones as children. imprisoned in tiny cells with others that don #8217;t speak their language. Imagine putting a random 2 people from different cultures in a 6 ft by 6 ft cell for no reason. They spend years being treated like crap and end up bullying each other.

Ok, you might not get a coherent sentence out of him for a while, but he #8217;s trying. He #8217;s very trying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few people on Reddit doesn #8217;t make a community. I #8217;m sorry that some atheists haven #8217;t been nice to you. As you #8217;ve already pointed out the actions of a few loud mouths don #8217;t tell you the whole truth. Without condoning them. It might be a reaction to their own dealings with religious people. Also we all know examples where religious leaders have protected bad behaviour. I myself haven #8217;t dealt with any issues, except the condescending stuff when you say you #8217;re an atheist. Most religious people I #8217;ve met will try to convert you to believing in god. In fact my mum says it #8217;s an important part of her faith to  #8220;save #8221; people. This gentle attack can be laughed off but after a while you want to sound off. I #8217;d say a Reddit sub with this title would be a perfect place, and maybe you #8217;ve fallen foul of that. I have to say I think that the unlikely events that lead to life on this planet and hopefully other planets is amazing. Knowing that this life I have is all there is makes it seem worth it. I personally think that to carry on forever would be pretty boring. Your bound to reach a point of having done everything and then suicide won #8217;t work. I #8217;m happy you #8217;re happy, but it wouldn #8217;t be for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone can see the curvature of the earth when looking out towards the horizon on a clear day, across a plain. It #8217;s also impossible to navigate in the ocean with no land mass in sight without knowing the Earth is round. The story about Columbus having to argue with the church, and risking death was written in the 19th century. It was to make the discovery of America more interesting, and was completely made up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The centre of your brain keeps you alive and is constantly juggling multiple pieces of information and making decisions which are correct. It #8217;s possible your instincts come from here as well. A good rule of thumb is that if you #8217;ve encountered a similar situation before, or know a fair amount about it, then your first instinct is probably bang on. If your in untested waters your instinct might not be right, so let the outside of you brain have a think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Vision Quest is a coming of age movie in which high school wrestler Louden Swain decides he wants to be something more than an average high school athlete and sets his sights on a prize that many don't think he can win - he then sets out to reach his goal alone, without much support from his father or coach. His father rents a room to a young drifter, Carla. Swain falls in love with her and she helps him stay focused and prevents him from losing sight of his goals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A prisoner of war movie. A Japanese camp with David Bowie in his finest role as the complicated prisoner. It #8217;s about the relationship between prisoner and guard. It #8217;s also about the prisoner #8217;s own demons and guilt for a past mistake, so he actually wants to be punished the way the Japanese do.</TEXT>

We #8217;re not allowed to send any patient identifiable info unless it #8217;s via NHS mail. If we need to send patient info outside Britain then it #8217;s through the mail or fax.

A new law is being called for that says anyone who murders a policeman, paramedic or any other emergency service, then there should be a tough sentence. The two guys that killed the cop got 4 years. I agree with a new law, but it should go both ways. Anyone protected by the law should face the same sentence if they murder someone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Soccer is a shortening of association. The football league that went on to become the excepted one we know today is called association football league. Rugby is called rugby football league. The original rules of association football allowed the carrying of the ball, which the Australians copied and still play today as Australian rules football. The carrying of the ball was dropped when Sheffield football league merged with association football league and Sheffield football league didn #8217;t allow the ball to be handled at all. The original game of football had only one rule. Get an object to the side of the village, while the opposing team had to get the same object to other side. Using the feet, hands, body was used mainly on the opposing team. People generally died when this was played, with broken bones being common. It #8217;s why it was banned as we needed our men able bodied to fight wars.</TEXT>

Normally if a person fits they #8217;ll move their head forwards and backwards violently so putting a pillow or something soft near the back of their head will stop some serious damage. When someone fakes it they shake the head side to side so as not to give themselves a major injury. I #8217;ve never seen this live as I don #8217;t actually work with patients, but it #8217;s something to remember.

If a human does this to an animal you #8217;d say the human is a psychopath or sociopath. This story alone doesn #8217;t paint this imaginary being in a good light. However it like all religious fables are based on children #8217;s stories from millennia ago.

We rang up the moron on site whose only real job is to follow our instructions because we aren #8217;t there. He says it #8217;s been stolen. We point out that he #8217;s the only one who has access, and there #8217;s been no break in (something you #8217;d have thought he might mention). We ask if this is his way of saying he stole it. He says no, but it is stolen. Everyone is busy so the manager drives over the next day. When he gets there he asks to see the crime scene. Dialogue as told to me.  #8220;See it #8217;s not there #8221;  #8220;What #8217;s that box there? #8221;  #8220;Oh that #8217;s the domain controller.

    <TEXT>My mate believed it. He #8217;d just come back from America around where it was filmed. Apparently it had been advertised as found footage. He told me and another friend about it. I said  #8220;witches don #8217;t exist #8221;, but he was adamant. Then the big reveal a few months later; like we needed it. Apparently I was right. Anyway I saw the film and didn #8217;t engage with any of the characters. I wanted them all to die horribly pretty soon into the film. It took far too long for this to happen. Never seen it again The last broadcast is a far better film.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eton football team coined the slang soccer as a shortening for association football league. At the time there were 3 football leagues in England with their own rules - Sheffield football league, association football league and rugby football league. Sheffield being the only one to not allow picking the ball up. The Australians copied the rules of association football league and still play it today under the name Aussie rules football, and from what I #8217;ve seen that #8217;s a fucking amazing game. Anyway Sheffield merged with association and the holding of the ball was dropped. All football games would have evolved from a game called football played in the Middle Ages. There was only one rule - score by any means. Each team had to get an object to a chosen side of the village. Broken bones were common and deaths happen. It was banned by the king as he needed his men alive to fight the French every 10 years or so. I agree rugby looks harder than American football. Aussie rules looks tougher. I wouldn #8217;t play any of them myself.</TEXT>
