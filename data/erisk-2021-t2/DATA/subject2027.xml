    <TEXT>Unfortunately, the whole movement detracts from the FOIA releases that come out regularly, proving the extent of corruption on both sides of the aisle. The truth is almost no one reads the Hillary emails the FBI has been releasing. Not even people in the Great Awakening. The truth is that the whole criminal conspiracy in government revolves around "Principles of Mass Persuasion." A lot of the studies are publicly available and FOIA requests are made all the time regarding the intelligence community's attempts at behavior modification. Once you start turning up those activities, it gets real dark, real fast. And, of course, instead of making more FOIA requests and writing articles about their contents, these people were all duped into doing nothing and "trusting in the plan." Which is total BS. Do something. It's both sides of the aisle. Expose the unelected powers that meddle in democracies all over the world. It's that simple and both "sides" should be doing it if they wanted to maintain some kind of intellectual honesty and credibility. https://vault.fbi.gov/ https://i.imgur.com/uzR7zk1.jpg https://i.imgur.com/gTjIeC2.jpg https://i.imgur.com/K3KO9nW.png Also, fara.gov is a good resource.

    <TEXT>PnP guys miss a lot from the old D20. It seems like it would have made most sense to fit into the mexh of the current market by just doing a D100 and staying as true to PnP as possible since those players would be more loyal than most other fan bases. The limitless combinations of race and classes also add to the appeal. Multi classing in clever ways was a lot of the fun of character building and it takes way too long on PnP to take risks and try things out. I get why they have to make adjustments for gamers' expectations, these days, but the DnD content done right would last forever and just need graphics updates and new campaigns. That being said, I think they've done a good job, and a very intentional effort, to make it so that if you know PnP, you'll do better and if you know WoW, you'll do better and if you know both, you have an early advantage... but also less surprises.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do understand. But, if it isn't enough evidence for you, I get it. That's the whole game. What this allows us to do, though, is start asking for more information in order to get the complete picture. If we gather enough evidence, then I'm sure there is a point where you and I could agree on what is really happening. That's why all these jumping to conclusions are fine intellectual exercises and all, but there comes a point when it is time to stop trying to outguess the guessers and actually have a chance to see primary source evidence. As it stands, there isn't enough transparency for there to be an honest debate, no matter which political ideology you subscribe to. Because I promise you... the people you are voting for... they ARE NOT supporting your political ideology.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>r/conspiracy is a containment board. On 4chan, there was a time they decided to ban /b/. The result was much as you'd expect. They took their high velocity shit posting to every other board. If you don't allow a people to tell the truth, somewhere, they will tell it everywhere. Give them a useless forum, then fill it with shills who are pro-war and anti-transparency, then use it in conjunction with the media apparatus to shame them, insert flat earth conspiracies and other nonsense. Then have the audacity to pretend the Finders Case, Dutroux Case and Franklin Case and (the largest federal trial ever, btw) the Pizza Connection Trial don't exist, and want to say Pizzagate is debunked, even though there is decades of evidence behind it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've lived by the beach my entire life. Not a single inch past what it was 50 years ago when I was born. Still exactly in the same place. As a matter of fact, my family's property would be underwater if the sea level rose even just a little bit. So, it makes me curious where i can see evidence of sea levels rising.

    <TEXT>The article says 1/8 inch per year. In my 50 years of life that is 50/8 inches. That is 6.25". I'm sorry but that number is WRONG. If that was the case a lot of communities all over the world would already be underwater. I'm not a "climate denier" but I do not see that the sea level has risen, at all. Again, my family's homes would have been underwater years ago if these numbers were true.  gt;Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average due to local factors such as land subsidence from natural processes and withdrawal of groundwater and fossil fuels, changes in regional ocean currents, and whether the land is still rebounding from the compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers. This explanation still doesn't explain why homes on the beach in places like New Zealand, Southern California, Australia, etc, are not flooding. One example is the Coronado Shores built in 1970 right on the beach. Out in front, is a shipwreck. That shipwreck is only exposed when the water goes down. That shipwreck was exposed more times this year than I've seen in my entire life. If this article was true, that would be impossible and the complex in Coronado... next to where the SEALS train, would be flooded. I'm sorry, but these numbers just aren't true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you have to resort to insults, you've lost the argument. The point is there are numerous places that still experience the same average sea level that they have experienced for a long time. I think pollution is bad. I think environmentalism has often been used as a racket. I think the USFS, in particular, should be doing a lot better. I think the sea pollution is a far worse problem than sea levels rising because I can see the problems pollution is creating. Just because I don't blindly believe in propaganda articles, doesn't mean I deserve ridicule. I'm asking for a reasoned response with maybe an example, rather than an insult. If someone wants to educate me, I'm all for it, but, until then, this sub seems to be full of a bunch of cognitive dissonance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is what you do... 1. Do the Unwelcome Guests Quest. Get the Barovia gear. It's the best set you can possibly get right at 70. 2. Do your daily leveling queues every day. Use the Seal of the Brave you earn to buy primal stuff, starting with the rings. 3. Start saving for a good companion, bonding runestones and an epic mount using AD. 4. You can work through the whole Elemental Evil campaign easy with the Barovia set, but only a piece per day can be done of the other campaigns. So, do the Harper Broward quests every day for Tyranny (Common Cause), then the Bruenor quests for Maze Engine/Underdark (Support the Factions), Sharandar and Dread Ring (just the Demonic Hunting). 5. Find a guild who will help you with Barovian hunts. That will be the fastest way to get item level 540 gear in a lot of slots. By the time you've done all that, you should know what to do next.</TEXT>

Rough astral diamonds begin to have no value to you because you cannot spend them on anything. So, to save up for a 600k bag, you would need to save for 6 days. Unless, you sell off the salvage at AH. You take a little bit of a hit, but someone will quickly buy a 2,000 AD salvage item for 1900 AD and make 100AD. You, on the other hand, now have more than 100k AD per day and you can buy that bag in just a couple of days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The FBI is not credible and works in lockstep with the media. They serve a totalitarian agenda that relies on systems psychodynamics in order to accomplish mass persuasion. A clear example is setting up Harvey Weinstein stories to create the basic assumption that white men are sexual assaulters and that accusers should be believed. William Bion is the father of basic assumption theories and the implementation of his ideas are plain to anyone who knows about them. While Strzok and Ohr and other were thrown under the bus, anyone researching FBI leadership knew, even before the election, which ones were playing into the Clinton machine and were outraged that they were ignoring the crimes of one candidate and making up crimes of another. The news has yet to get to others like Kadzik, who have already been exposed for obvious corruption. We have the documents that prove all of this. It is preposterous to ask the FBI to investigate a crime that isn't even in their jurisdiction, not only because it isn't their jurisdiction but also because they have proven to be a corrupt entity. /r/FBIWatch</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's what is SAID. Just like the Mueller investigation, none of that is what is actually done. It's an excuse to sift through someone's life and selectively leak to the press, which has been the status quo of the FBI for quite some time. It's naive to think the leaks to the media (and other leaks) haven't been orchestrated. The FBI is corrupt. It needs new leadership. Right now, the man in charge told everyone they couldn't access Apple devices while he had already arrested a guy for the Fappening. Right now, there is a camp of mulsim terrorists the news won't cover and the camp has been demolished... the FBI allows evidence to be destroyed. James Comey was controlled opposition on the limited hang out case that was Marc Rich of Glencore, the human trafficking mining company. Also of note in recent events, VCS mining, the human trafficking gold mining company and Uranium One who has assets in places like Kazakhstan... who also rely on slave labor. NBD to the FBI and media, though, right? The selective outrage is clear. The FBI has already revealed at the FBI Vault that they let pedophiles roam free in exchange for information. The FBI has already revealed the 7th Floor Group and does nothing. They require the complicity of the DoJ to accomplish this. So, I understand your sound byte. But it's a propaganda piece that history proves wrong over and over again. The Harvey Weinstein case was set up specifically for this purpose. It's called "basic assumption theory" and it was the manipulation of basic assumptions so that as many as people as possible sided against the supreme court nominee by using the media. "Systems psychodynamics" is the psychological area that is being put to use. So, if you believe what you are saying, I daresay you need to look at the blueprints of these same situations from the past. They always end up the same. Anita Hill. The Whiskey Scandal Special Counsel. "Othering." The political theater is as formulaic as any average sit com.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can hit "K" and queue to get to level 70 pretty fast. Then go to Barovia and get Vistani set using the Unwelcomed Guests quest line. A lot of people shoot for dps as a Guardian Fighter, but you really should be shooting for defense until you hit the cap. THEN work on power. You need to be able to survive to do your job and your job is not damage. It is to control aggro and survive. For running around in the world, you might consider Lunging Strike, Into the Fray and Enforced Threat. You get around a lot easier and for easier dungeons this combo will grab the spawn. For more single target control, you can rotate in Knight's Challenge and or Knight's Valor, but you will usually be expected to use Into the Fray in dungeons, so keep that. In dungeons, Enhanced Mark and Guarded Assault. I'm still playing with the others, maybe someone else can weigh in. I've been at it about 5 weeks and I just hit 13k total item level. You can do it way faster if you... Make friends and find people to help you do hunts in Barovia. A lot of them. Get the 540 gear. Crown of the Undead, Mists Armor... something like that. Save your first 2500 Barovian coins. Buy the artifact necklace and belt in the Ravenloft Store. Save your next 2500 for that belt. Make those your first pieces of legendary gear. When not doing that, run the queues. Earn astral diamonds and get all blue mounts and all purple companions. Use the right insignias on your mounts to get the heal over time bonuses. Get at least one purple mount. You can use that speed on any mount. Companions should be percentage based. To get started, start with Angel of Protection, it doesn't proc very often relative to others but it gives you 5% damage reduction. Energon, Black Ice Prospector, Cockatrice and purple Apprentice Healer are usually cheap enough to fill you active slots with them before you start saving for the big ones. By the time you have purple companions, blue mounts and blue insignias, along with your fist two legendary items, you should be right around 13k gear level, which gets you access to all the queueus. I wouldn't make your weapon or off hand legendary until after mod. There will probably be something new to upgrade. Runestones on companions should be bonding. Buy at about level 7 or 8 and upgrade as you earn. Same levels regarding enchantments. Azure for defense, radiant for offense slots. I'm using prominence on my weapon enchant and negation on my armor. My survivability went way up when I got those. Way up. At least invoke every day 6 times, if nothing else. The campaigns are important, but you should be hitting the queues and Barovia as top priority. If you have a lot of time to play and you are enjoying it, you should start with Elemental Evil and play it straight through as it is not time gated. Monday, hit your weekly quests for each campaign. That will get you started. Then squeeze in dailies as needed. Harper Quests and Bruenor's quests, Common Cause and Supporting the Factions should be done daily, as higher priority. Sharandar and Dread Ring are also very easy with Barovia set of gear. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>SS: Kamala Harris and her sister Maya Harris are part of a web that connects Podesta, Alefantis and the Clintons.  #8203; It turns out that they also connect to a secret police ran by Grandmaster Henry X. Who also is pictured with Bill Clinton and Maxine Waters.  #8203; The shill response a few years ago was that this was a case of bad jacketing against Kamala Harris but that now seems like and implausible and even impossible assertion to make.  #8203; Is this pizza party poster for real?

    <TEXT>When the story of Kamala's secret police broke, the shills were calling it a bad jacketing, which is what they are currently trying to do to Trump with the recently murdered journalist. They try to make him seem responsible for the murder; wrapping Trump into the story and creating a psychological connection between the two issues to viewers. The assertion of the shills was to call it bad jacketing, using those terms, but the pictures with the Clintons and Maxine Waters make it a hard position for shills to take, now. Especially given that Kamala Harris has been covering up pedophile crimes. It's a common thread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://old.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7pje8n/neutralizing_the_poison/ # Neutralizing the Poison True narcissists are easy to deal with because they have a blind spot in their thinking and only a handful of tools they use. When you are their target, it doesn #8217;t seem easy, but that is only because you have fallen into an unfortunate pattern of behavior. There are a set of rules and tactics you can implement that will gradually rob them of their ability to harm you. You can neutralize their ability to spread poison and you can even turn them to your own agenda without them knowing about it. # Rule No. 1: The first rule in dealing with a true narcissist is implementing no contact as soon as possible. They are capable of causing harm and you should protect yourself from that harm. You have a right to seek safety and protection. Also, have a  #8220;go bag #8221; stashed somewhere with a set of keys, cash enough for a hotel room, a few changes of clothes and a smart phone or tablet that has a texting app that works through WiFi. Being able to walk away from a face to face confrontation is power. The rest of this is for people who, for whatever reason, are unable to go no contact. Those of us who are trapped there know what that is like. These rules and tactics also apply to people who engage in standard narcissistic behavior, but a normal person #8217;s ability to be reasonable and make compromises and amends means you shouldn #8217;t really have to be hardcore about it. # Rule No. 2: Never, ever, ever mention the word narcissist. You will polarize this person in a way that will be difficult to return from. If you have done this, already, just let it fade into memory. Also, don #8217;t use "gaslight",  #8220;triangulate #8221;,  #8220;love bomb #8221; or anything else that might lead back to literature that discusses narcissists. # Rule No. 3: Never, ever, ever try to convince the narcissist they are a narcissist. In fact, the best diagnosis for them is Borderline Personality Disorder, so that they can be convinced to go through cognitive behavioral therapy. You will usually not convince a true narcissist that they are a narcissist. If they become convinced, it will be because you have utilized these rules and tactics against them so well. # Rule No. 4: Be polite. Politeness is its own reward and it is your best weapon. The longer you are steadfastly polite, the more a person #8217;s negative overtones become obvious to themselves and the people around them. Never give the appearance of being the hostile party. # Rule No. 4: Ban sarcasm. This is more difficult than I thought it would be, but it comes naturally, now. Sarcasm is just going to be used against you and make you look like the jerk. Especially in writing. If something can be read either way, specify that it is an honest question. # Rule No 5: Ban secret conversations. If you are texting, always make sure someone else is in the thread with you. No one on one texting. No coordinating against people in secret and don #8217;t even allow yourself to be in a position where you give the impression you are coordinating with anyone. From now on, you don #8217;t say anything about anyone that you wouldn #8217;t tell them in person. Once you have lived with that, for a bit, then you can start telling people that you don #8217;t participate in secret conversations to coordinate against anyone or put yourself in the position where that might be the case. You can use  #8220;court safe #8221;, religion,  #8220;my therapy #8221; as a reason, or even not bother to offer an explanation.  #8220;As a general rule of thumb, I have banned having secret conversation froms my life. #8221; Once your problem person is aware of this rule, it will put them on the run, because they are going to go immediately have a secret conversation about it. # Rule No. 6: Keep everything  #8220;court safe. #8221; This means that you should expect a judge to look over every email and text message and have secretly recorded conversations. An imaginary judge. This judge is looking for the hostile party. You are allowed to be angry. You are allowed to have your feelings and act upon those feelings. Just don #8217;t show those feelings to anyone who isn #8217;t safe or anyone who doesn #8217;t understand how and why you have to protect yourself. As far as real recordings, I recommend hunting cameras that are triggered by motion activation and always having a device around, like a smart phone, that is capable of taking pictures, recording sound and recording video. Know your local laws about recording people. Now that you know the ground rules, here are your three tactics that you should employ in every exchange: # Tactic No. 1: Telegraph the behavior. You can often predict the problem person #8217;s behavior. Simply by telling them you are concerned they are about to commit that behavior creates a trap for them. You #8217;ll get better at predicting when you practice, but with no alternative you can also just explain past behavior in general terms, so that it doesn #8217;t repeat. Generally, don #8217;t use any jargon. Keep it simple.  #8220;I #8217;m afraid you are using your inheritance as a carrot to make me do things that I don #8217;t want to do. #8221;  #8220;I #8217;m concerned you are having secret conversations that are being used to undermine me. #8221;  #8220;Is there a chance you are going to play the victim card if I spell out some of your hurtful behavior? #8221; # Tactic No. 2: Reverse Triangulate This merely means you bring as many sets of eyes in against your problem person as possible. This simply means telling your problem person #8217;s  #8220;flying monkeys #8221; or  #8220;harem #8221; about the behavior without using jargon before the behavior happens so that the credibility of the rumors against you begin to slowly deteriorate. By including people in the conversations and always being consistently polite, non sarcastic and  #8220;above #8221; secret conversations, the extra set of eyes force a person to censor themselves. You can even use imaginary eyes like your  #8220;journal #8221; or a psychiatrist that doesn #8217;t exist. (I have a fake psychiatrist, btw, that I use. This psychiatrist believes in, first, controlling your own reactions to bad behavior and then using truth, honesty and positivity to counteract dishonesty and negativity.) If you are caught in conversation, often use  #8220;Person A says... #8221; and  #8220;Person B thinks... #8221; where the problem person is now forced to go through the extra cognitive effort to work around these other people #8217;s points of view. It also allows you not to attach yourself to good ideas so that they will be discredited. Bonus points if you can attach a person you don #8217;t like to an idea you do like while hinting you don #8217;t like the idea. # Tactic No. 3: Seek justification. Just make this a habit.  #8220;I #8217;m confused, can you explain that? #8221;  #8220;I understand you are upset, but I don #8217;t understand why? #8221; When ancient history gets drudged up, use,  #8220;I know, that was a long time ago, but what is going on with you RIGHT NOW that is making you feel that way? #8221; You #8217;re never going to get justification. Or, you might, but that isn #8217;t the purpose. The true narcissist can control their behavior. That #8217;s what is most cruel about them. They know what they are doing. By investing minimal creativity into asking justification in different ways, the cognitive effort your problem person expends is exponentially greater. Don #8217;t get caught up demanding explanations. Don #8217;t even consider the explanation you do get to be truthful. Just ask for it. # Combine Tactics FTW Don #8217;t go through a lot of effort. Use these tactics to free up your efforts to your own endeavors. The shorter, the better. Try throwing all three tactics into one text message.  #8220;Hey, the ladies from church are concerned you #8217;re going to try to lord over the next event. What do you think a good game plan is? #8221; Deploy and forget is a good guiding principle. # THE TRAP IS SET. Wait for the work around. If you have stuck to the rules and used the three tactics, it is a no win scenario for your problem person. They are either going to hit the pause button on their behavior or they are going to freak out. A lot of times, it only takes one public freak out to get immediate reprieve. While they are nursing their wounds and trying to find a work around, you can rest easy knowing that the three tactics are easy to come up with in the moment and you won #8217;t have to stress about what comes next because you already know how to deal with it. In the meantime, don't engage. The next work around will make itself known and you can chuckle to yourself at how much less energy you are spending on this stuff and how much extra energy they are spending. They will spring the trap again and again because the true narcissist is unable to avoid it. The reason they can #8217;t avoid it isn #8217;t obvious to you because you are a normal person who doesn #8217;t understand their mindset. It is good and normal if you don #8217;t understand why these rules and tactics work so well. But, when you start to use them, you will see that they work instantly, even though the long term application is what is going to give you the relief you need. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Think of living with a narcissist as living in Plato's cave. When you finally get out of the cave, your eyes need time to adjust. You've never even seen the sun before. When blind people have their vision repaired, they still need their hands to navigate and are unable to rely on their vision to navigate a room, at first. It takes a long time to learn. It will take a long time to learn what the real world looks like and how it looks at you because it has nothing to do with what you've been trained to think. https://i.imgur.com/Ue87SMH.png</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ever see that guy put uranium in his mouth during a physics lecture? Some people think that nuclear weapons are a hoax that were made to replace the failed judgment day myth. Not me, but I always find it strange when shills attack the question. Are nuclear weapons even real? Would at last explain why the Clintons played so fast and loose with uranium. Edit: I'm not saying they are fake. I'm saying you require faith to think they are real. Many nuke videos are fake. You ever see the one where the Chinese run up to the explosion with fire hoses? Can you tell the difference between a mushroom cloud caused by TNT versus a nuke? No. Mushroom cloud explosions happen with a variety of explosives. So, if you think the video is proof... again... you are taking it on faith. Also, the first test has buildings blowing away while the camera remains in place just fine, out in the open. In fact, go ahead and rewatch all the nuclear explosion videos and then go check out other mushroom cloud explosions. Might be an interesting way to decide or yourself whether you are right or wrong. Plenty of people consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki to have been a firebombing and the truth is that the Russian invasion shocked the Japanese NOT the bombs. Oliver Stone talks about it in his new documentary, if you don't believe that salient point. Again, I'm not saying they are fake. I'm saying you must have faith to believe in it because you and anyone else who criticizes the argument HAS NO IDEA how a nuclear bomb really works. In fact, many of the nuke videos are totally fake. In fact, a failed nuclear explosion looks a lot like a poorly stacked TNT pile exploding. https://i.imgur.com/XVPCdKF.png https://i.imgur.com/KtdlUfN.png https://i.imgur.com/OuqWSAb.png https://i.imgur.com/zT37YX4.png https://i.imgur.com/4azWwBg.png https://i.imgur.com/lZR3fZh.png The fact that no one is allowed to ask the question is pretty crazy.

So, in terms of debating someone on the nuclear weapons, they have faith that it works. They have no idea how it actually works. The Internet does not contain that information so that you can look it up. It certainly seems true that matter can be transformed into energy. But how do you do it to make a nuclear bomb? I'm not saying I believe nukes are fake, but I think it is important to point out that the only reason people believe it is because they trust their government and not because they actually know nukes work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go ahead and reread where I wrote I DO NOT THINK NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE FAKE. I am merely pointing out that it requires faith to believe in them. I bet you have no idea what a krytron is or how it is supposed to help make a nuke explode. YOU DO NOT have the knowledge or ability to prove a nuke works. I agree, matter can be broken down into a great deal of energy. I understand the science very well. Most people who argue with me HAVE NO IDEA how the science really works. Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been repeatedly called a firebombing and it is the Russians who shocked the Japanese, not the bombs. I know what a triple stage nuclear weapon means and using fission to make fusion, etc. I've actually looked into it. You are merely acting on faith. I looked into it because world powers are irresponsible with uranium and it makes no sense. But posing the question brings the shills out in force. Did you know Uranium One was bought by Rosatom? And that Rosatom black market uranium was caught headed to Iran? And that Rosatom is collecting heavy water out of Fukushima? Why would our government allow that? Why would the Japanese?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't deny that nuclear weapons are real. I merely pointed out that asking the question brings around people who are certain they are real but have no idea how they actually work. Most people take the holocaust for granted and have no idea what evidence was presented at the trials and how to prove whether or not it was real. They take it on faith. I have been around the world myself. I knew enough to see it for myself... not that I was debating flat earth, but I know how to even calculate the circumference because of Eratosthenes? Do you? People are idiots who tell someone they are wrong but have no idea WHY THEY ARE WRONG. And yes, I have experienced account deletions, bans, etc across multiple platforms. Because I adopted Voltaire's point of view but finding the people and issues you are not allowed to criticize. If you are actually interested in learning about it, rather than being desperate to tell me I am wrong because you are triggered, I can list most posts and issues that resulted in bans. The last one that got the Great Awakening banned on reddit was a post about Maggie Nixon and President Obama. If you want to know how shill armies work, take a look at https://upvotes.club. It costs money to make sure the right things are downvoted and upvoted. If you get 100 downvotes in 10 minutes on a comment on a week old post in /r/politics, it is because it is a coordinated effort. It is easy to know what is being censored and what is not if you post every single issue in the morning and watch which ones the shills attack or promote. The only reason I even thought to dig into this particular issue is because "Death Object" was heavily. I don't even think it was a good read. Certainly the brigading wasn't done by people who read the book. Certainly the BBC lied on this issue about the people dying in minutes. WHY DID THE BBC LIE?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Krytron. And it doesn't have to use hydrogen. So, allow me to be skeptical of your prior knowledge on the subject.  gt;faith as acknowledging the Earth is a spherical mass. Wrong. You can use math using Eratosthenes' method. He accurately calculated the circumference of the earth over two thousand years ago using the shadow of an obelisk in Egypt. That obelisk was eventually moved to the Circus of Nero and it still stand in front of the Vatican. You can also do what I did, which is travel around the entire earth and end up back at home. So... I don't really consider your argument to be sound, in any way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In what way? La Times broke the Masonic police story. NY Times confirmed she let a black man be framed for murder. Maya Harris works with Alefantis and Transformer art gallery. Alefantis has numerous small businesses that are being used to launder money. Political fundraising is an integral part of his business model. FEC proves Soros money flows through Alefantis. Additionally, associating with John Podesta means that Russian money has been mingled into the Center for American Progress and David Brock's media machine. John Podesta and Tony Podesta, as you can see appearing with Maya Alefantis, have FARA.gov paperwork that proves they were taking money from Sberbank, the Russian state bank. Additionally, Ruben Vardanyan was exposed in the Panama Papers and confirmed to have been paying the Podestas through multiple channels like Joule Unlimited and other shells. The secret police seem integrated into this social network, as well, where Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris and the Clintons appear with the now dead police chief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everyone understands the climate deal. This is all such hyperbole. Even people who don't believe in climate change... they still want water they can drink, want beaches that aren't covered in trash and would prefer if glyphosate didn't saturate their foods. Look at the Pipeline they blocked. You think they did that for the environment? Or do you think the people shipping the oil in BY RAIL, and had been for years, were willing to spend a couple million on staging protests, a fake media narrative and getting people on board so the news pretend it was an environmental issue? What about water rights in California? Talk about a corrupt broken system where the people are getting credit for 5 times as much water as actually falls. What about the Forest Service? Botching the maintenence of land, selling of lumber for pennies on the dollar and clean water to Nestle? What about Al Gore getting a half billion to produce electric cars IN FINLAND, only to abandon the project after a few hundred cars. Maybe a couple thousand, I can't recall the exact number. Point being, the problem is NOT unreasonable conservatives. It's unreasonable politicians who are allowed to do what they do because people are dumb enough to fall for the news blaming all these problems on sections of the population when in fact IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CORRUPT POLITICIANS. Younger generation. Older generation. Whatever. If you let the news divide you from other people, the government is that much stronger. They have infested movies and music, cartoons and video games and yes, this sub. (Hi, Eglin AFB.) So, because some people are aware of the corruption, it doesn't make them trash tossing, clean water hating, glyphosate loving idiots. The false divide is why you aren't reaching anyone with this rhetoric. They aren't idiots and they don't hate the environment. The difference in opinion is how much they trust their government to do anything about it or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At one point, I was banned from /r/Wikileaks for suggesting that the organization was compromised. Curious that they haven't had much to share about the Clintons for a while, when we know they had other channels of communication beyond the server and the gmail accounts. Podesta handed out multiple passwords which gave a lot of people access to a lot of his communications. Runner4567 is one example. Also curious that Podesta picked Trump to run against Hillary, which surprises most Dems when they hear it. Either way, Wikileaks has faced a lot of complaints that they haven't released information given to them. It is easy enough to test. They are either waiting for another election or they have been successfully stopped. Most people don't understand concepts like "modified limited hang outs", "controlled opposition", "bad jacketing" or other time tested strategies. Not because they are dumb, but because they haven't taken the time to really look into how covert politics affects change in the political sphere. The sad truth is that abstract concepts do require intelligence to understand, and it is beyond plenty of people, plain and simple. The people who ARE smart enough to understand usually don't have the time to track down real evidence and come to sound conclusions. The mainstream media is careful to be able to construct a narrative where you decide issues based on how you FEEL, as opposed to empiricism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get how you FEEL about it. I am not against being fair, of course, so don't misunderstand me. I don't even take a position on whether or I agree with birthright citizenship. I haven't pondered or researched the issue, though I notice many "progressive" countries have eliminated it in the last decade. My point is that, despite how any feels about it, I challenge anyone to show the wording actually means what they want it to mean. Belonging to another jurisdiction, already, would mess with your definition. If another country considers a child born of parents that are citizens of that other country, it's citizen, then your definition falls apart. I still posit that the wording is suggesting two requirements, that you be born of a US parent AND are subject to the jurisdiction of the US, as opposed to born of a US parent or subject to the jurisdiction of the US. My education in law might be lacking, in some cases, but plenty of legal experts agree with my interpretation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 14th Amendment was written to include freed slaves and their children. The word "jurisdiction" applies to "foreign power" not legal jurisdiction by the local and federal laws. I promise. In fact, multiple cases have come along, like regarding outlying US territories that make it clear that the wording in the 14th amendment had to be clarified. If you want to bring another court case in, you need to understand what I was saying in the first place... the original wording IS ABSOLUTELY POSTIVELY 100% NOT the "jurisidiction" they are referring to and IF IT WAS, it would EXCLUDE children of foreign parents born on the soil. In fact, the case you refer to, where the opinion specifically states what I have been saying, **"The Constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these words,"** So, in fact, you have proved exactly what I have been saying in the opinion you use to attempt to prove me wrong. That is why the historical context is important... again... slaves and their children.  gt;"The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that." And he proceeded to resort to the common law as an aid in the construction of this provision. 21 Wall. 167. So, here we go, because of the a priori nature of law, your opinion again shares my interpretation:  gt;There is no common law of the United States, in the sense of a national customary law, distinct from the common law of England as adopted by the several States each for itself, applied as its local law, and subject to such alteration as may be provided by its own statutes. . . . There is, however, one clear exception to the statement that there is no national common law. The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and **are to be read in the light of its history.** So, I am, in fact, 100% correct using your own source. The wording does not mean what people are trying to force it into because of how they feel. I'm glad you were able to prove yourself wrong because of your feelings and unable to read a thing a certain way outside of the context of your feelings. The wording did not intend to include everyone born on US soil. It had to be argued and it was agreed that the wording was not sufficiently defined in order to come to a decision to let "birthright citizenship" even happen in the first place.</TEXT>

The expression has also been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims,[11] as well as to describe the behavior of an abusive narcissist who tries to win the confidence of a victim.[12][13] Modern social media can intensify the effect of love bombing since it enables the abuser with nearly constant contact and communication with the victim.[14] Love bombing is an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. One of the signs of love bombing in the start of a relationship is much attention in short time, and pressure for very rapid commitment.[15] It is often the first sign of narcissism, and if successful turns to control and degradation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My career was in wildland fire where I made fire perimeter maps and burned area restoration maps. Fire is a part of the natural cycle in California where plants require fire to germinate. People are failing by not making a firebreak around their homes and put firefighters at risk to protect insurance companies. Alaska has more acres burned per year and larger fires, but they don't attempt to stop them because they aren't hurting anyone. The mismanagement and lack of allowing forests to burn results in more dying, bark beats infested trees, along with a host of other problems. The USFS has a history of making poor decisions regarding pre emotive fire management along with the homeowners who should be held responsible for protecting themselves from something that is supposed to happen every year. Trump is mostly right and Tue science backs it up. It isn't global warming. If you let fuel grow out of control and never let it burn, it becomes a more significant fire than if it would have been allowed to experience the natural cycle without human intervention. All this has been known.</TEXT>

This is simple spy v spy stuff. You seem a bit emotional, and I am curious why. I've been waiting for proof about Wikileaks, one way or the other. What we are seeing is that GCHQ has their fingerprints all over this situation and the news is really selective on how they present this. The uranium deals in Australia, Kazakhstan and other places all culminated in a massive expansion of Rosatom, who has now signed on to make nuke plants all over including floating power plants. They are also reclaiming the heavy water from Fukushima. Mueller helped this deal happen. The Podesta emails were the proof that could undo the deal. Whatever you believe, politically, this story is going to reveal who is on what side. Mueller is in a faction with the Clintons. They have all exposed themselves on both sides of the aisle and in the news. Who is the other other faction? Aren't you curious? It would help identify their motivations, as well.</TEXT>

Podesta email later doubly confirms. FARA paperwork confirms as a third separate source. The media was colluding with this machine, too. Not even Fox talks about Ruben Vardanyan, Putin's bag man. Podesta recommends Trump in an email as a pied piper candidate. Ada AI and CA AI go to war using media. Cambridge Analytica outperforms ADA, Trump wins. GCHQ now has left fingerprints on both sides... Clinton and Trump. Serco continues to be relevant. Voting machines, etc. I am left asking, was Wikileaks really a GCHQ extortion scheme? Has the Crown been meddling in all of our elections? Using spycraft to put both sides in their pocket? Why did Russia win so big on uranium? Why did Turkey start finally start to explore and drill of Cyprus? The energy markets are key, here, and Midsuf specialized in energy markets.

According to Roger Stone, Wikileaks cut a deal with the Clintons. He sent an email directing Bannon to direct Mercer to pay Wikileaks' 501c4 in order to make the leaks continue. Supposedly, that is why the Kerry, Ecuador and other files were never released. The narrative is finally starting to come to light and MSM seems to be keeping a few key pieces in the dark.

    <TEXT>Don;t you get it? It's all about emotional triggers that circumvent the front part of the brain by triggering neurological processes in the hypothalamus through fear and xenophobia. THAT'S NEWS. And the only way they can seem legitimate is through doublespeak where they say the opposite of what is true in such a careful way as to make it appear it appear legitimate, even though it is THE OPPOSITE of true. So, if you post the RIGHT news to /r/politics while posting religiously to the ignored "/r/COnservativeNewsWeb" you will still get thousands and thousands of upvotes because that is what the Internet SHILLING MACHINE PAYS FOR at about 1 penny per impression.

    <TEXT>Most of it is objections. Here are some that are answered. If you can call them answers. **Describe the creation of your clintonemail.com email account, including who decided to create it, when it was created, why it was created, and, if you did not set up the account yourself, who set it up for you.** Response: In the Senate, when Secretary Cl inton began using e-mail, she used a personal e-mail account for both work-related and persona l e-mail. Secretary Clinton decided to transition from the account she used in her tenure at the Senate to the clintonemail.com account. She recalls that it was created in early 2009. Secretary Clinton did not set up the account. Although Secretary Clinton does not have specific knowledge of the details of the account #8217;s creation, her best understanding is th at one of President Clinton #8217;s ai des, Justin C ooper, set up the account. She decided to use a clintonemail.co m account for the purpose of convenience. **When did you decide to use a c lintonemail.com email account to conduct official State Department bus iness and whom did you consul t in making this decision?** Response: Secretary Clint on recalls deciding to use a cl intonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business in early 2009. She does not recall any specific consultations regarding the decision to use th e clintonemail.com account for official State Department business. **After President Obama nominated you to be Secretary of State and during your tenure as secretary, did you expect the St ate Department to receive FOIA requests for or concerning your email?** Response: Secretary Clinton does not recall whether she had a speci fic expectation that the State Department would receive FOIA request s for or concerning her e-mail. She understood that, because her practice was to e-mail State De partment staff on their state.gov accounts, her e- mail was being captured in the State Department #8217;s recordkeeping systems. **During your tenure as Secretary of St ate, did you understand that email you sent or received in the course of conducting official State Department business was subject to FOIA?** Response: Secretary Clinton understood that e- mail she sent or received in the course of conducting official State Departme nt business was subject to FOIA . She further understood that, because her practice was to e-mail State Departme nt staff on their state.gov accounts, her e-mail was being captured in the State Depa rtment #8217;s recordkeeping systems. **During your tenure as Secretary of State, what, if any, effort did you make to inform the State Department #8217;s records management personnel ( e.g ., Clarence Finney or the Executive Secretariat #8217;s Office of Correspondence and Records) about your use of a clintonemail.com email account to conduct official State Depar tment business?** Response: Secretary Clinton does not recall specifically informing the State Department #8217;s records management personnel about her use of her clintonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business; she did openly communicate via her clintonemail.com account with many people in the State Department. Secretary Clinton does not recall interacting with Clarence Finney or empl oyees of the Executive Secretariat #8217;s Office of Correspondence and Records. **In a November 13, 2010 email exchange with Huma Abedin about problems with your clintonemail.com email account, you wrote to Ms. Abedin, in response to her suggestion that you use a State Department ema il account or release your email address to the Department,  #8220;Let #8217;s get a separate addres s or device. #8221; Why did you continue using your clintonemail.com email acco unt to conduct official Stat e Department business after agreeing on November 13, 2010 to  #8220;get a separate address or device? #8221; Include in your answer whether by  #8220;address #8221; you meant an of ficial State Department email account ( i.e. , a  #8220;state.gov #8221; account) and by  #8220;device #8221; you mean t a State Department-issued BlackBerry. A copy of the November 13, 2010 email exchange wi th Ms. Abedin is attached as Exhibit B for your review.** Response: Secretary Clint on recalls that her November 13, 2010 e-mail exchange with Huma Abedin attached as Exhibit B to Plaint iff #8217;s Interrogatories was triggered by a problem with the State Department #8217;s telephone system. When Secretary Clinton wrote,  #8220;This is not a good system, #8221; she was referring to the way in wh ich the State Department would notify her of telephone calls. Secretary Clin ton does not recall what prec isely she meant by the words  #8220;address #8221; or  #8220;device. #8221; To the best of her re collection, she meant that she was willing to use a State Department e-mail account or device if it would resolve the problems with receiving telephone calls, so long as her personal e-mails w ith family and friends would not be accessible to the State Department. Following this e-mail exchange, the State Department changed the way in which it notified Secretary Cl inton of telephone calls, resolving the problem that triggered this e-mail.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>States of mind are a pattern of set neurochemical set points and action potentials. Everyone has multiple personalities, some just lock harder with triggers than others. The extreme dissociation is the same mechanism we all have pushed to its limits, where the set points from one state to the other can be drastically different. As children our inner dialogues are programmed into us. As a adults, you can spend a few weeks in sensory deprivation and get wiped to start over again, but people are easier to program when young. Borderline "insane" was my original understanding, having been noted as a problem by even the ancient greeks. It is the same problem, one state of mind is a very extreme form relative to another, forcing a person to swing wildly between different perceptions of reality, though not to the extent of having a complete memory break from one state to the next. Anxiety. Fluoride. Race bating identity politics. Outrage. Fast food. Porn. These things all make you less sharp. If the IQ can be shaved slightly and emotional triggers can be programmed into you (like which news to feel outraged by), then your vote is easy to predict and elections, therefore, easier to manipulate; always trying to keep the election as close as possible so a bundle of forgotten ballots here or there can make all the difference.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Forget about CIA, forget about pedophiles. James Alefantis is a money launderer, at the very least. He has set up a bunch of small businesses that are designed to break down larger funds of money. The Pizza Connection Trial was the largest federal case in history that no one talks about. Pizza shops are all cash businesses that are ideal for laundering drug money. Throw in an art gallery, a used book store, a couple more restaurants, then you have a place to clean money. Also, you have "Edible Schoolyard" that runs 120k fundraisers and only makes 12k. Alefantis is on the board. Tax records for the "Solstice" fundraisers are available widely. Now, you have people like Alice Waters and Marina Abramovic and satanic posts on Alefantis' Instagram, and you see why people see the occult stuff and think "satanist" or "devil worshipper." Even though that might be to simple of an interpretation. Then you see all the school fundraisers, the pictures of babies for sale, the child sized coffins, and then you start to wonder how they can do all this stuff out in the open because Starbucks can't even treat black people mean without a SJW mob showing up. How can these people, who are friends with known and convicted pedophiles and "infant masseuses" (Liddle Kidz network) not raise the ire of some crowd? John Podesta was lifelong friends with Dennis Haster. Known pedophile. They are pictured together on a Japanese island in the 60s. John Podesta took millions from a Russian Front called Joule Unlimited. Did not report it. Tony Podesta was exposed by the Panama Papers as taking money from ANOTHER Russian front, Troika Dialog. He modified his disclosures after he was exposed. The Podestas prop up Center for American Progress that props up David Brock's internet shilling campaigns, Correct the Record and Shareblue. David Brock and Alefantis were both being blackmailed and were represented by Max Maccoby, a lawyer involved with... you guessed it... NGOs surrounding underprivileged children. The Web of Slime can be traced out from there straight into the DNC the FBI and a bunch of private propaganda machines like Fusion GPS where the end result is that Russia's Rosatom took control of the worlds uranium. Remember the diplomatic cable that proved Mueller was helping with the uranium? The news isn't telling anyone that Rosatom is in conquest mode, right now, and is signing up to make nuclear reactors for every country in the world while many of those same countries are now also pumping for new oil, at sea. The Clintons, with the help of Alefantis and his money laundering and his boyfriends media machines have perverted the news from top to bottom to blame Trump for colluding with Russia when it seems that Russia was already allowed to win by the Clintons, who have been eternally involved in mining and forced labor of children with Gelncore, Giustra and other mining magnates. Alefantis is operating with black money, meaning, if he is CIA, he is off the books. Alefantis is operating with pedophiles which means, if he is not a pedophile himself, he earned his title of "One of the most 50 powerful men in DC" someway else. So, even if the authorities won't investigate him as a pedophile. Even if the news won't tell us why him and Brock were being blackmailed, even if he is allowed to launder Soros money and Russia money and pedophile money under of color of law... James Alefantis still deserves to be hanged for treason for influencing a media storm that allowed Russia to take control of the world's uranium markets, including the black markets, that (I PROMISE YOU) has already resulted in nuclear proliferation in manner that is against the interests of the US and the entire world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Control your own reaction" is great advice in most normal situations. The exception is when dealing with pathological narcissists, at which point they freak out if you honestly communicate their bad behavior, provide solutions and all while having a positive attitude. The easiest way to is to be as poor to them as they are to you, but without the emotional or temporal investment. Just automate every post in their subreddit to appear on your own new, rebranded version, let the xpost bot harass their subreddit and leech users while you concern troll and create an uprising. Isn't that how reddit has always handled this sort of thing? Hate groups of every type pretending to be every other type to get the others banned... It's... the natural order of reddit.</TEXT>

Edgar Hoover used the technique against the Black Panther Party and other Black Power organizations as part of its COINTELPRO operations.[1] Neal writes that this technique was effective in isolating key individuals, forcing them out of the organization, and that its effectiveness was enhanced by the tendency of Black Power activists to divide among "rigid racial, ideological, and increasingly gendered" lines.[1] Jo Durden-Smith claims that this technique was used by U.S. prison guards to undermine targeted prisoners and so making them vulnerable to manipulation.[2]</TEXT>

The appointment of Mr. Huber and the Inspector General #8217;s report were steps in the right direction, but the appointment of a second Special Counsel remains essential as there are many unanswered questions. Take a closer look into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court abuse. Potential abuses of the FISA process must continue to be investigated and remedied.

In fact, the fact that Russia has expanded Rosatom state powers to move into a new nuclear alliance with about 50 other governments is the most concerning news in the world today, but because it was Hillary Clinton's booboo, and to protect the Democrats and RINOs, the NEWS won't report about it.

    <TEXT>This handkerchief was given to him by Alice Waters, the chef, who also appears in Marina Ambramovic spirit cooking videos. Alice Waters and Alefantis are on the board of Edible Schoolyard, who, according to tax records, threw 160k events to raise 12k for their nonprofit. Clear case of money laundering. Alice Waters and Edible Schoolyard were involved with a school that had fundraisers with Comet Ping Pong. An email to James Comey's private account suggests Alice Waters and Comey knew each other to the extent that she could ask him a favor to help clean up the mess. The email was and Comey carefully worded his responses about it during testimony. He lied by omission and mischaracterized the relationship of the sender of the email. The link between Alefantis and the FBI should be troubling in light of the occult symbology they seem to worship where names like Moloch are common place in their communications.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2910833 Edible Schoolyard has Pizzagate written all over it, complete with James Alefantis on the board and double entendres on cannibalism. I found it curious that the money trail involved a Solstice fundraiser that COST $167,200, but only raised $12,400. Money laundering? https://i.imgtc.com/9R59NNj.jpg Either way, Marina Abramovic was at the fundraiser: https://i.imgtc.com/GzMB0Eq.png Edible Schoolyards keeps coming up and, at some point, I felt like Maggie Nix was connected. The subreddit ban of TheGreatAwakening was the result of Maggie Nixon posts. I know this for a fact as two of my reddit accounts were banned for just cross posting the link. The claim was doxxing, but the truth is that Maggie, herself, posted publicly in order to raise money for a vacation to Southeast Asia (more money laundering) to deal with her mental health issues. But that may be a bit of a digression. In March of 2017, James Comey received this email: https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg A mystery woman asks Comey for a favor because a school has been connected to Comet Ping Pong because it held fundraisers AT Comet Ping Pong. He then forwards it to Rybicki, who informs Comey Andy Vale and Paul Abbate, Mueller appointees, are on the case. My question is if they were in charge of investigating it, or covering it up? The whole conversation is weird in that Comey was contacted on his personal email and refers to the sender as a "serious woman." Comey walked the line in his reply to Congress about it.  gt;I don't remember. I don't remember investigations on those topics. I remember at one point receiving an email from someone, a private citizen, to my personal account, raising issues about the --- is it Ping Pong? Whatever the pizza place was that was involved in some conspiracy theories. I remember sending it to my staff saying, make sure this gets to the appropriate place, but I don't know whether there were investigations. https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-transcript-james-comeys-dec-7-interview-house-committees You may also remember Comey was already dinged in the OIG report for ignoring crimes against children: http://fbnewscycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-10.54.23-AM.png Comey is caught in the lie that he doesn't really know about any of this, particularly since he was given the names of the agents in charge. He even seems to know Paul on a first name basis. Keep in mind, while there has been a number of FBI employees, the news has left certain ones alone. Peter Kadzik, who warned Podesta about the email investigation, has faced no repercussions. Mentioning Arun Rao of the DoJ gets you banned in a lot of places, still. We are seeing, in real time, how a limited hang out works. My instinct was that Alice Waters was the sender of the email. Maybe, maybe not. Here is Alice Waters with Marina Abramovic during a spirit cooking sessions: https://i.imgtc.com/tyw8M7D.png Alice Waters is a Spirit Cooker. Alice Waters is connected to Alefantis in many ways, at this point: https://i.imgtc.com/gxjaQlB.png I posit that Alice Waters is connected to John Podesta through "Rachel's Network" (women in environmentalism), at least. It was anonymously claimed that Alice Waters, Podesta and Alefantis had a high level emergency meeting after Podesta Group was exposed as taking money from the Russians and Tony Podesta had to resign. https://i.imgtc.com/TTsM6QC.png Alice Waters is also listed as one of the "Chefs for Hillary" https://www.pinterest.com/hillaryclinton/chefs-for-hillary/ So, which schools have had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong? It turns out Horace Mann Elementary in DC is an Edible Schoolyard school AND has had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong and Politics and Prose. https://edibleschoolyard.org/program/horace-mann-elementary-school-mann-gardens-washington-dc  gt;Horace Mann Elementary has has had a school garden for over 20 years, growing our curriculum out of our science program. During this time our gardens have changed location many times but have continued to grow despite disruptions to physical locations. https://www.facebook.com/HoraceMannDC/posts/cmon-sleepyhead-we-will-see-you-over-at-pp-to-pick-out-a-great-book-to-get-your-/990375704349797/ http://archive.is/oQsdy  gt;C'mon Sleepyhead, we will see you over at P amp;P to pick out a great book to get your Sunday going!  gt;The Politics  amp; Prose and Comet PingPong benefit day for Horace Mann is TODAY, Sunday April 24.

I would like to know if Horace Mann was mentioned anywhere in the time just before that in Pizzagate circles because, if not, it means Edible Schoolyard was the source of the irritation.</TEXT>

However, the ability to find locations I need to spy on has proven to be useful twice. The first time I had to serve some papers to a guy who owned a boat. A trimerand, which is pretty specific. I found it on cam, 2000 miles away at a Marina where the camera was on top, overlooking the inlet and watched that mofo til my eyes were ready to bleed. Spotted my target, drove out and served his ass. Very satisfying. When he claimed he was never served, which he always does, I was able to provide screenshots from the Marina camera.</TEXT>

The claim was doxxing, but the truth is that Maggie, herself, posted publicly in order to raise money for a vacation to Southeast Asia (more money laundering) to deal with her mental health issues. But that may be a bit of a digression. In March of 2017, James Comey received this email: https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg A mystery woman asks Comey for a favor because a school has been connected to Comet Ping Pong because it held fundraisers AT Comet Ping Pong. He then forwards it to Rybicki, who informs Comey Andy Vale and Paul Abbate, Mueller appointees, are on the case. My question is if they were in charge of investigating it, or covering it up? The whole conversation is weird in that Comey was contacted on his personal email and refers to the sender as a "serious woman." Comey walked the line in his reply to Congress about it. I don't remember. I don't remember investigations on those topics. I remember at one point receiving an email from someone, a private citizen, to my personal account, raising issues about the --- is it Ping Pong? Whatever the pizza place was that was involved in some conspiracy theories. I remember sending it to my staff saying, make sure this gets to the appropriate place, but I don't know whether there were investigations. https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-transcript-james-comeys-dec-7-interview-house-committees You may also remember Comey was already dinged in the OIG report for ignoring crimes against children: http://fbnewscycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-10.54.23-AM.png Comey is caught in the lie that he doesn't really know about any of this, particularly since he was given the names of the agents in charge. He even seems to know Paul on a first name basis. Keep in mind, while there has been a number of FBI employees, the news has left certain ones alone. Peter Kadzik, who warned Podesta about the email investigation, has faced no repercussions. Mentioning Arun Rao of the DoJ gets you banned in a lot of places, still. We are seeing, in real time, how a limited hang out works. My instinct was that Alice Waters was the sender of the email. Maybe, maybe not. Here is Alice Waters with Marina Abramovic during a spirit cooking sessions: https://i.imgtc.com/tyw8M7D.png Alice Waters is a Spirit Cooker. Alice Waters is connected to Alefantis in many ways, at this point: https://i.imgtc.com/gxjaQlB.png I posit that Alice Waters is connected to John Podesta through "Rachel's Network" (women in environmentalism), at least. It was anonymously claimed that Alice Waters, Podesta and Alefantis had a high level emergency meeting after Podesta Group was exposed as taking money from the Russians and Tony Podesta had to resign. https://i.imgtc.com/TTsM6QC.png Alice Waters is also listed as one of the "Chefs for Hillary" https://www.pinterest.com/hillaryclinton/chefs-for-hillary/ So, which schools have had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong? It turns out Horace Mann Elementary in DC is an Edible Schoolyard school AND has had fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong and Politics and Prose. https://edibleschoolyard.org/program/horace-mann-elementary-school-mann-gardens-washington-dc Horace Mann Elementary has has had a school garden for over 20 years, growing our curriculum out of our science program. During this time our gardens have changed location many times but have continued to grow despite disruptions to physical locations. https://www.facebook.com/HoraceMannDC/posts/cmon-sleepyhead-we-will-see-you-over-at-pp-to-pick-out-a-great-book-to-get-your-/990375704349797/ http://archive.is/oQsdy C'mon Sleepyhead, we will see you over at P amp;P to pick out a great book to get your Sunday going!

I would like to know if Horace Mann was mentioned anywhere in the time just before that in Pizzagate circles because, if not, it means Edible Schoolyard was the source of the irritation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to the news, it was a training exercise. Many know that training exercises have coincided with tragic events, as it allows for extra personnel to be on hand from multiple agencies as well as extra emergency and medical personnel. This training operation may have been a cover story for something more significant. The day before a fake cop crashed with four other people in Yorba Linda. LA has had a problem with fake police before, when the LA Times exposed Kamala Harris's secret police. The chief died following the first hearing after being indicted. Other fake police forces were involved in the Vegas shooting and at least a few more fake police organizations ave been dismantled in the last year. The fake police angle is troubling and ignored by MSM. The FBI also had an issue with a development going up a few blocks from the raid. The Chinese were bribing local officials and there was money Laundering and extortion, to boot. Another theory is the Wells Fargo outages are connected to multiple raids, including in Salt Lake City. The LA raid was next door to Wells Fargo. Yet another idea is that the lawyer, Girardi, was raided and is connected to Hillary Clinton through his donations and possible multiple cutouts.</TEXT>

There are articles that explain the nexus around the North Korean group. Don't forget, the South Korean President was removed for taking orders from her cult leaders. The news didn't talk much about it, because there were cult mumbling about Hillary, at the time. But secretive groups are being manipulated in a lot of interesting ways from the top down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honesty trap is a legitimate tactic that is perfectly ethical. Honest people don't fail them and dishonest people are exposed. Special Interrogatories are an honesty trap. They are used in court. They work. Having dealt with many narcissists in court, I can tell you that honesty traps are easy, ethical and effective against pathological narcissists. Please think about what you are saying. Just asking questions of severe narcissists makes them lose their minds. When it happens in front of other people or in writing, so that other people can we it, then they lose their power. I hope you understand that I am giving legitimate, time tested advice.</TEXT>

If you are recommending people don't use Special Interrogatories in a domestic violence case, then you are straight up giving bad advice. I condensed thousands of pages of literature in dealing with narcissists by professionals into a single post in a way that eliminates jargon. You'll notice that the first piece of advice is no contact, meaning that you are m8scharacterizing what I presented. I have a long history of successfully helping victims of domestic violence get justice. For you to suggest that I am recommenidng a confrontation is dishonest. Not sure what your problem is, but I take issue with you misrepresenting my work. Maybe read it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem like the confrontational one. I got the message from your first response. Then you sent a second response. I highly recommend putting people in a position to tell the truth in front of other people where you never have a one on one interaction with them. It is the only way to keep narcissists in check, and generally they will very quickly develop a preference to stay away from you. It's really that simple. If you act like they are boogeyman, you will never be in the headspace to treat them like children. Because that is how they act... like 9 year olds. If you take away their power to be dishonest, you rob them of their primary tool of control. And, the more you can do that with little to emotional investment on your own part, the better. I am not recommending anything tricky or confrontational. Just common sense that works. And it is fine if you don't want to post it. Just don't day that my advice is something it is not. It is the opposite of confrontational. If you consider that arguing, then I suggest you go back to the start of this when I was ready to leave it at... 'Your call.' Truly, I feel you have the confrontational tone; not me. I hope you can approach what I am saying objectively. Special Interrogatories are an important concept for people unfamiliar with them. Not just because they are useful in the legal world, but because you can do your text messages in the same exact way. If you are forced to communicate with a narcissist, or even just a dishonest person, just learning how to ask the right questions (never one on one) prevents you from being a magnet to narcissists in the future. Honesty is what stops the vicious cycle. Banning sarcasm is another tool you can take away simply by banning it... even from your own behavior. I can give you references and authors... PhDs that's I've even talked to about this stuff. I can back up what I am saying with sources. But, if you think that is bad advice, then that is on you. Im not trying to run your sub. If you want to learn and jave a conversation... or teach me how I might he wrong... Im willing to have a conversation. That's how people get to the truth of matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cambridge Analytica also got their prostitutes from Ukraine - they offered to blackmail politicians with them (See the undercover video of the Channel 4 investigation.) I've always wondered whether these women were trafficked against their will (likely), and whether this is the reason Steve Bannon, who was involved with Cambridge Analytica, was in touch with Jeffrey Epstein as early as 2014. The last time they met was in Paris in autumn 2018, when Bannon visited Epstein there. (According to Epstein's French butler.) Unfortunately, nobody seems to have investigated this part of the Cambridge Analytica story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Live a Spartan lifestyle. You don't need a bunch of junk. As one person, you only need 1 plate 1 bowl 1 fork 1 spoon and 1 knife. It's impossible to fill the sink with dishes this way. Get rid of anything you don't need and don't use. If you haven't touched it in a year, get rid of it. I have a good friend who is a hoarder. His place was spotless when he had almost no stuff. His hoarder parents forced him to take a bunch of junk to his house and he hasn't cleaned it in a year now. He was also happier with less stuff. Then he started making money and began to buy more useless junk exactly like I said not to. Staying clean is easy when you don't have enough stuff to make a mess with. Most people can live out of a backpack for a few days. Try doing it for a few months. Also clothes belong in the machine, the hamper or the drawers. Nowhere else. Have less clothes. Throw away anything you don't wear. You only need a week of stuff. This way you will never be more than two loads of laundry behind.</TEXT>

He calls himself pamphlet anon. That is how I know it's a LARP. You, on the other hand, are u informed and use it as an insult against me who actually looked into it. So, what's your problem? Ciaramella is in the white house logs on the days the pictures we taken, so we don't even need the pictures to know who he was meeting with.

    <TEXT>Any tests actually work to determine if it is actually the cov19? As far as I've seen the antigen tests only tell you if you have the antigens which could result from any of hundreds of corona virus strains. It also doesn't tell if you are actually sick with corona virus only if you've had it long enough to make antigens. This means false positives will abound unless they are decoding the genetics of the virus of those who test positive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt it because they would have been more skeptical before closing Sunday services. The way the pandemic bond works is that investors pay in, get a dividend then a big payout at the end of a certain timeframe... unless a pandemic hits then they get nothing. The expiry for the pandemic bonds was March 23rd so the World Bank needed the WHO to declare a pandemic to keep the investors money. The investors money is actually chump change compared to what happens next if a pandemic is declared. 14 billion gets uunleashed to NGOs and a lot of them are tied to the Gates Foundation. Additionally the world bank will ask for another round of funding from member states adding to the coffers. The tests they are using only test for the antigens, not the virus, itself. There are 100s of corona virus strains. The numbers being touted are so far from the truth because they aren't genetically testing to differentiate where the Corona came from... which strain. Off the top of my head I didn't see anyone tied to the LDS empire in the bonds. The primary purchasers specialize in that type of bond but they sold off their shares and the people left holding the bag were mostly third and fourth parties meaning... Not in on the scam. Its possible the LDS church has funds with some of these entities but it wouldn't be of any significance given they would have no participation and the bonds would merely be a small piece of a larger portfolio.</TEXT>

R politics was wrong about the Clinton election, I was right. It is insane to believe the herd on r politics starting with that idiot prediction because social media stats made it clear. I could go on a longer list about all the times I was right and r politics was wrong but I don't need to because outsmarting the shill machine, putting my money where my mouth is, has paid off tremendously. For example, when shills firms like upvotes.club were obviously doing a pump and dump with bitcoin, I made money. My coinbase transaction was posted the minute it happened to prove I am willing to bet when I have good information The point is this, I already presented the facts that prove the Corona Virus is hoax. Pandemic bonds. World Bank. False positives. Not only that, I bet against the bears on the stock market and made another killing because they are just shills serving a retard agenda just like the herd on r politics that makes crap predictions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or it's totally fake and there are hundreds of corona virus strains already present in the population that will test positive. The World Bank issued pandemic bonds, the first ever that included corona virus, and those expired March 23rd, which means their neutral third party, ha, the world health organization, had until last week to declare a world wide pandemic. Investors in the pandemic bonds lost everything as a result. BUT after the investor money the member state money clause goes into effect based on the death toll. The more dead the more taxpayer money gets pilfered for Gates Foundation like NGOs. This is why they are falsely tying everyone who tests positive as dead from the Corona Virus. The world bank needs the number to be as high as possible. The 30kb strain that has patented nucleotide strains and HIV segments is man made. Not that it was made in a lab but it was confabulated merely in the text file. This is where it gets good. They use three types of tests. PCR, antigen and antibody. The antigen and antibody tests see multiple strains meaning lots of false positives. Some of these tests still see the antibodies even if you don't have or spread the virus anymore. The PCR test looks for three different markers. Each marker is from a different set of strains. So while all three markers are in the confabulated strain, they are also in a few others. Because materials were short in supply who instructed everyone to only use the first two markers. This means every positive test is a false positive. Its all a financial scam and the stock market should have been your first clue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd be curious on theories as to who they are looking for. Having control over the testing is important for anyone in power. This is the perfect deep state free for all where every cell and compartment has free reign to impose as munching authoritarianism and privacy invasion as they like. The tests are good targets for scams, too. LA Times reported fake tests were bing smuggled in. This reveals to us that there is an agenda in the black recesses of power that want there to be as many false positives as possible. The World Bank needs as many deaths as possible to bilk the maximum billions from taxpayers in member states. They already bilked their investors in pandemic bonds that expired March 23rd. This all looks like a perfect storm of corruption. The World Bank was massaging their financial scheme and the Gates Foundation was massaging it's ID2020 scheme which will be paid for by pandemic money. The Democrats didn't take long to order their media mafia to lambast Trump with it and start trying to steal the election. Seemingly some people are waking up to the fact the numbers are less than the Flu but the elite are demanding a zombie apocalypse response. The levers are Tavistockian. Every psychological lever they ever studied and published in their archives is being pulled. Hoarder? Triggered. Hypochondriac? Triggered. OCD? Triggered. The list goes on. The people in your lives with neuroses of every kind are triggered and dragging you into their frame. Stop them by being calm, cool and collected. The effects of these levers wear off quickly if you can do that. Basically, everyone needs to calm the fuck down and keep focusing on the corruption. Either way, in the midst of this, someone has the opportunity to do something interesting. Imagine if everyceverycoI'd storage DNA rape kit in storage managed to be rapid tested due to what is happening? How many serial rapists? Murderers? Missing children? Clones? Could you find if you started testing en masse? The real travesty here is that we, as a society, continue to let these kits sit for years and deteriorate and get lost in bureaucratic labyrinths. The DNA tests we should be doing are those kits and politicians. Everything the deep state is wielding against you should be turned the other direction. Hopefully, the media will lose its foothold but they just found a way to keep everyone glued to their mind control master screens that tell them to stay at home and do nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I gave up on your opinion after this...  gt;found out that there is a protein spike in the structure of COVID-19 Which means you don't know what you are talking about. Covid 19 is the disease. Sars Cov 2 is the virus. There is not enough genetic difference between the nCov 19 and the 2003 outbreak strain so they changed the name from nCov19. When someone tests positive for Corona Virus in a PCR test, it could be for any of a few dozen strains that are closely related. There is no test for Covid19. It is a set of symptoms. Covid19 means Corona Virus disease discovered in 2019. Again... not a virus. Antibody tests show if you have fought off a similar Corona Virus in the past. It does not test for Sars Cov 2. Will test positive for hundreds of corona virus strains. Antigen tests can tell if you are currently fighting the disease or have fought it in the past. Also does not test specifically for Sars Cov 2. Also high number of strains will show positive. The PCR or recombination assay tests seek to match three markers. Unfortunately, the protein combinations it is looking for also exist in about 30 other strains all that have made appearances on the world stage. PCR tests also do not test specifically for SARS Cov 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, no one is going to publish anything about false positives right now. This has been planned for a long time. Really, all you have to do is understand how the tests work. If you want to start somewhere, start with the Wikipedia article on SARS COV 2 where they source the decision on changing the name from nCov19, to SARS COV 2 because they were not genetically different enough to be considered separate strains. That means a test for original outbreak would also be positive. The reason this is an obvious scam is because of the pandemic catastrophe bonds that expired March 23rd. If you want sources on how different strains can match tests, then I would point you to the scientific study from Jul 2019 that explains the commonalities in nucleotide sequences of corona virus strains where the phylogenetic tree is mapped out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Covid19 is a disease, which means it is a set of symptoms. The virus is the SARS COV 2 virus. They tried to name it nCov19, but genetic analysis showed it was too similar to the strain from 2003 to be a different species. Point being, there is no test for Covid19. It is a set of symptoms. If they test positive for Corona Virus with those symptoms present then they are calling it Covid19 but the comorbidity of other life threatening conditions in covid deaths is 99%. When you account for the margin of error, it is worse than zero. Speaking of margin of error, some antibody and antigen tests are massively false positives because they not only do not test for viral load, but also do not differentiate between many corona virus strains... 300 of them. Also possible to have had it previously and test positive. The PCR test is better but it searches for three markers that are common to 36 strains. Standard false positives is around 2 percent and you can see that with other PCR tests like for HIV. The margin of error for false positives combined with the possible incorrect strain being detected and we are at a margin of error so high that the current number of covid19 deaths is statistically zero. So yeah... It makes sense if you know a little science.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corona virus is literally the common cold, along with several others. Covid19 is the disease. SARS COV 2 is purportedly the strain that causes the disease. As the disease is merely a set of symptoms, there is no conclusive test for the disease. Testing for SARS COV 2 is done with four different tests. Antibody, antigen, PCR and full genome decode. They attempted to call the new strain nCov19, for novel corona virus strains discovered in 2019l except the full genome revealed that is was the same species as SARS COV made famous in 2003. The antibody and antigen tests are unable to differentiate which strain you have from a possible 300 species and strains. The PCR test is a lot better, testing for two ORFP1a polyprotein markers and an N gene marker. The problem is that 36 strains of corona virus have these same markers. This means that unless you decode the full genome, there is no way to know if you have the actual new strain. This also means the numbers being touted are totally false. I invite you to check my facts. You are correct, though, the new strain isn't killing anybody. Nobody is really even testing for it. I'm aware of about 200 full genome tests. I'm sure there are more, but there certainly aren't 20,000. The World Health Organization has admitted what I am saying repeatedly.  gt;Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms. #8221; And  gt;Several assays that detect the 2019-nCoV have been and are currently under development, both in-house and commercially.

    <TEXT>Tuberculosis kills a million people per year. Why no pandemic declaration? Why not quarantine for other deadlier diseases? Better safe than sorry does not apply to these numbers the media is spewing. Sudafed during the day, Nyquil at night and the symptoms that turn into secondary infections are pre empted. Treat it like a normal cold because that is what it is, worst case scenario. Covid19 isn't killing people in any kind of significant way. 99.9% of Covid19 related deaths were as a result of comorbidity of other issues. Given the false positive rate, it is statistically zero. There is no need to fall for the astroturfing campaign. All the bitcoin shills got moved over into the covid issue. Just look at the numbers and compare your hysteria to other, more realistic threats... like car accidents or STDs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no clear way to determine the mortality rate. It's an imaginary number because the CDC stopped sharing how many people were tested. At this stage, the numerb of deaths is statistically insignificant because a couple of million tests have gone out all with a false positive rate of higher than 2 percent. Corona virus is literally the common cold, along with several others. Covid19 is the disease. SARS COV 2 is purportedly the strain that causes the disease. As the disease is merely a set of symptoms, there is no conclusive test for the disease. Testing for SARS COV 2 is done with four different tests. Antibody, antigen, PCR and full genome decode. They attempted to call the new strain nCov19, for novel corona virus strains discovered in 2019l except the full genome revealed that is was the same species as SARS COV made famous in 2003. The antibody and antigen tests are unable to differentiate which strain you have from a possible 300 species and strains. The PCR test is a lot better, testing for two ORFP1a polyprotein markers and an N gene marker. The problem is that 36 strains of corona virus have these same markers. This means that unless you decode the full genome, there is no way to know if you have the actual new strain. This also means the numbers being touted are totally false. I invite you to check my facts. The new strain isn't killing anybody. Nobody is really even testing for it. I'm aware of about 200 full genome tests. I'm sure there are more, but there certainly aren't 20,000. The World Health Organization has admitted what I am saying repeatedly.  gt;Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms. #8221; And  gt;Several assays that detect the 2019-nCoV have been and are currently under development, both in-house and commercially.

    <TEXT>SARS COV is the same species of sarbecovirus as SARS COV 2. You can confirm for yourself at the blast database that not only are the same species, the differences in nucleotide sequence are minimal. Antibody and antigen tests are unable to differentiate between the species as well as several strains because of the similarity in nucleotide sequences. PCR tests are better, but are only using two markers from the ORFP1b polyprotein and one from the N gene. Even with this test, false positives are high because of other strains similarities. Over 300 coronvirus strains are known. 36 are sarbecoviruses and 6 species infect humans. Most tests are not sensitive enough to differentiate. These viruses are known to be the cause of the common cold, along with rhinovirus and a handful of others. COVID19 is a hoax, because it is not the virus, it is the name of the disease that is supposedly caused by the virus. It is a set of symptoms that also are the set of symptoms for thousands of other ailments. So, when you see the news say that they are testing for COVID19, they are lying. There is no test. You can test for the virus, but unless you sequence the whole genome, your test isn't going to tell you if you have the common cold or the sickness that overwhelms ACE2 receptors to shut down the lungs. Additionally, you don't even know if you have extra ACE2 receptors in your lungs that would make you susceptible. The death count models have failed utterly and emabarassingly. So yes, it is a hoax. Millions of people have not died per the models. The media taking bunk science to the public has been a total hoax. The news refuses to even use the correct terms so people have no idea unless they dust of the molecular epidemiology of coronviruses, like I did. Do you allow journalists to translate science for you? Seems like it. Maybe you should visit the blast database yourself and tell me whether or not I am correct.</TEXT>

No. The difference between SARS COV AND SARS COV 2 is miniscule and the PCR tests are the only decent chance of an accurate test beyond a full genome sequencing. If they are getting these numbers off of the antibody and antigen tests, a secondary test is required to confirm. Thus far, only 300 have been uploaded to the public database.

    <TEXT>The facts are wrong about the similarity between the strains. Anyone can confirm using the blast database. The difference between SARS COV AND SARS COV 2 is on the ORF1B polyprotein and the N gene, though the difference in the N gene is miniscule. They are the same species, so literally are mutated forms and just a different strain. This article is very misleading in that respect. Additionally, the models have failed miserably and missed by millions. The virus was most definitely not made in a lab. The 4 sequences shared with the HIV 1 gp120 are too short to have been inserts, meaning they don't have stop and start codons, and they are common to many different viruses in the blast database... again, which anyone can use to check my facts. The article doesn't seem to want to talk about the evidence used to make the lab made argument. Weird, since it is so easily debunked. The author also doesn't seem to know the difference between covid19 and SARS COV 2. Covid19 is a set of symptoms... The disease... and the symptoms are shared with nearly every other illness and many medication side effects. The symptoms are useless to confirm a case. The fatality rate is flat out wrong. By a lot. Like 100 times too much. Don't trust journalists to be middle men between you and science.</TEXT>

Differential diagnosis Cannot easily distinguish from other causes of viral respiratory infection such as influenza or community-acquired pneumonia based only on clinical grounds, COVID-19 testing With limited testing capacities in many locations, clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. The most common symptoms include fever (subjective or confirmed) and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing) or initial nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction. https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540747/all/Coronavirus_COVID_19__SARS_CoV_2_</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The paper that was pulled that claims HIV 1 gp120 was cut and pasted into the SARS COV 2 genome. It depends on how detailed you wanted to get. Maximum effort would be download each of the genomes, 30kb each, then run an average and look for anomalies. Large deviations indicate high mutation rate or even man made interference. But, just to prove to yourself that the HIV story is bunk, go to the Blast database and search the values highlighted in the picture. You will come up with many results of many species with the same short sequences.</TEXT>

Usually, fringe science is ignored, but now we have everyone pushing this narrative. It is definitely possible it escaped from the lab, but I don't think it was edited with crispr. If anything they bred many strains and one got out. Even then, it has proven to be not very lethal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The real number we need to see is how many people have been tested. The CDC had the number on theirnwebsite the first few days, but as soon as the tests numbers were showing the model was wrong, they pulled it, leaving the number infected and number dead. Without that number, it is hard to put the others into context. If they had only tested 100,000 people, 40,000 deaths would be apocalyptic. If ten million have been tested, then 40,000 deaths where 99 percent had comorbidity is as severe as the common cold. The top bioweapons experts did a good interview, I'll have to dig up the link, where they say everyone in Italy who died had some other serious medical problem. 99 percent within a certain margin of error. At 2 percent false positives for early testing... which is very very generous... zero people died of COVID19 in Italy. They all had something else. As the trend continues to be completely opposite of what the models said, it is possible SARS COV 2 is as dangerous as the common cold. When we see the test numbers, I predict that will be the case, based on the current trend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean that SARS kills people by overwhelming the ACE2 receptors in the lung. People dying in Italy were not dying from this effect, they were dying from other causes... other respiratory illnesses and it was being called COVID19, but that was not the actual cause of death. If people die of something other than Covid19, but still test positive on the high rate of false positive tests, they are still calling it a covid19 death. Meaning nobody is dying opfrom the SARS COV 2, but other causes. Zero people, according to top us bioweapons experts ha e stated this in recent interviews and it aligns with what we've been seeing from a variety of reports.</TEXT>

The truth is nobody is testing to see if lung failure occurred by ACE2 receptors being overwhelmed.

People are being diagnosed for COVID19 without being tested. I never said diseases don't kill people.</TEXT>

Wuhan Insititue was accessed by 4chan users. Everything in Chinese though. WHO accounts have been accessed. Many passwords were stale. Limited value so far but the real way to use these is not to hack. The real way is legal. Make a burner gmail, then import these lists as contacts. Then, sign up for every social ,media site and allow the site access to your contacts. That is the type of thing that has to be crowd sourced. Leave the hacking to the hackers. Also, the thing is clearly to generate awareness about the forces behind the current situation. Hopefully it draws some eyes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are correct. That's because the antibody tests look for the CR3022 antibody protein. The thing about this protein is that 20% of common cold are caused by corona virus and they all have the S spike protein, which the body responds too by creating the cr3022 protein. All strains of all species of coronviruses that affect humans... known as sarbecoviruses. Sure the nucleotide sequence may be off by an amino acid or two between each species, but that just means the cr3022 protein binds to it more tightly or more loosely. Your body still makes it.

    <TEXT>Question, if they hyperinflate the dollar, then won't stocks go up to reflect that? Also, at what point in hyperinflation does everyone in middle America actually get a chance to easily pay off their mortgages? I can't see the banks letting that happen. Too far the other direction and poor people do well, also. The exploits have always been fine for the elite, but I don't see the system granting that access to the common man. They took most of what they could steal already and they'll do it again, but break the system and there's nothing left to steal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>World politics and lockdown have made it so that dollars are highly desired, counteracting inflationary effects. Think of all the families that aren't getting dollars sent home, now. Think of all the immigration that has stopped. The dollar will be drying up, in places. Even worse, countries and foreign corporations who were trading in, essentially, promissory notes of dollars, now are starting to require actual bank transfers of dollars. In fact, the management of the response has been interesting because of how gradually it has to be decoupled from oil and Chinese manufacturing. This is world war 3 and they are starting by going after everyone's wealth. And when the gay bear agenda failed they dialed it up. When it failed again they dialed it up. The consequence of Buffett holding cash amplified the dollar demand. Whatever the cabal has planned next will trigger negative interest rates. Then, the reality of cheap oil and cheap energy will set in, pushing markets further. Unemployed people will continue to use their money to inflate stocks now that they can do it for no fees on their phone while watching fear porn on the news. A golden era of overvalued trading will begin. Eventually it is illegal to sell stocks for a loss, and everyone agrees to only buy at market and sell at 1 percent forever infinity. Stonks will legally only be able to go up and the gay bears will die off. Trading will just be a contest of who can do the most trades. Then, PC master race finally takes over the world because the people using phones, Xbox and Nintendo to day trade to trade couldn't keep up. They merge with their AIs, become immortal and everyone else is just born into trade slavery to trade their universal basic income on lesser devices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Covid19 is a set of symptoms purportedly caused by the SARS COV 2 virus. The symptoms are generic enough that nearly any illness could be considered potentially covid19 leading many to jump to assumptions without tests. This inflated the death toll. Eliminating comorbidities... where people would have died of something else, anyways, and the danger is diminished further. No test was up to snuff until March. Prior to March, they were literally using SARS COV tests. Antibody tests are still way too imprecise. Your immunoglobin develops a CR3022 protein to block the S spike protein from SARS COV 2. This is what the antibody test looks for. The problem is that all corona virus species and strains that affect humans have the S spike protein, albeit an amino acid or two off. The human body reacts the same. So, even the corona virus species that causes the common cold shows as positive for the antibody tests. This drastically inflates the cases. To make matters worse, the next best test explains in its instruction manual that SARS COV will red as positive, as well, because the strains are so similar. These are PCR tests. This means the only true test is a full genome sequencing. Last I checked, there are only 500 SARS COV 2 strains in the BLAST database. What this all means is that the media hyped intentionally faked models as fact and is trying to do so again. The media is powerful enough to cause a temporary pricing in, but more people are aware it is a scam, and are investing accordingly. Personally, I put every spare dollar I had in the market when Tesla went under $400, and I had more than chump change. I cashed out many times on the way up, and heavily reinvested last Thursday, because I know this second wave is a scam, too. So, while people are skeptical of my easily verifiable science, there is money to he made in getting ahead of the shills.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop acting like this is new stuff. This link is recycled every month. It is not new. It still has value if you want to look through it and report on it. For example, admissions about the assassination of JFK are made. CIA gun running out of El Paso through Greco Air. Tons of stuff the news still won't touch with a ten foot pole and you won't see included in a partisan Internet astroturfing camping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Step 1, build a spreadsheet or database that track import data from many websites. Step 2, build a scoring system into the spreadsheet for your preferred buy indicators. Step 3, build your own webpage with your database that has buttons built in that use the brokerage API You need a green light, red light system, so your bot knows when to buy a stock and when not to buy a stock. You need to practice using your algorithm before you hand it to a bot. None of this is easy. Eventually, you will need a machine learning system like TensorFlow or Apache MX to help calculate your spreads in real time and analyze tons of metadata to help you pick stocks. Everyone's strategy is different, nobody is going to give you a free one, and no one is going to tell you exactly how their system works because they can all be easily counteracted. It's best if everyone is working slightly different. Your goal is to, 1st, pick 100% correct every time with no loss. This means you have to target small gains with rapid and voluminous transactions. Since the dip, Ive been compounding at about 1.4 percent per day by targeting 4 to 10 stocks where my automated process buys at an intermarket dip, sells at plus a half percent, then waits to repeat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dont know of anything that I would use, that I didn't build myself because lots of reasons. For Robin Hood, you can use a mouse and keyboard macro recorder to execute your commands. That was where I started for thinkorswim. It doesn't do a ton of volume but it is still many, many times faster than clicking yourself. Not only is this method free, you can use it on multiple trading platforms with no fees or commissions. It's not an ideal system, but is free, which I love. I eventually made my own local website to connect to my database, with 9 frames. The middle frame just constantly sorts by what has the most buy indicators, with most of the other frames focused on displaying data that either has strong visual cues or that isn't imported I to the database. This is so I can babysit the decision-making. I built buttons that execute commands through the API directly into the displayed spreadsheet. So, if TSLA gets sorted to the top, I can click buy, and the trade and math is all done automatically. I originally used the mouse robot to operate this stuff on auto, because I'm more of a talented copy paster than a programmer. Currently, a trade is triggered by a green light system, where, when a stock is ON, it will repeatedly buy and sell it for a small percentage until a red light condition stops it or until I manually say don't buy it anymore. This is all mySQL, PHP, JSON... everything you would expect working together. For this reason, it is impossible to distribute my system. It isn't anything I can really give to some because there are so many facets. For the machine learning, I am lucky enough to have a family member who is a professor of computer science who helped me set it up. I have three. Two on a separate computer with tons of hard drive space. One is for running simulations all day every day and building it's metadatabase. This is the one that helps calculate spreads. One is for collecting data and updating the database. I use only free data, so python is required to make a different solution for most sites. Keeping this up to date and as real time as possible was very difficult, so I enlisted help. It never even occurred to me to use TensorFlow in this way. My machines aren't anything fancy. i7s with maxed RAM. I really try to keep costs down. They all house multiple nVidia 1080 GPUs and have many hard drives. Additionally, I am using cloud computing and storage, which I already have for websites I run. Mostly, this is for redundancy and also, it hasn't really come at an additional cost. Which I love. The third is my oldest and most primitive. It is my Apache MX and it monitors news. You can see from what I moderate that I have many streams on many platforms that are all outputting so that the news gets into my news database. I originally created this as an anticensorship tool so I can actually search the news that Google hides or deboosts. I am always concerned with someone counteracting my trading. Stealth is wealth. There is a war of algos going on at all times within the stock market and beyond. Even shills counteract my news tracking, constantly, so not giving details on how your setup works is kind of important. For example, I created a feed that just focuses on FBI corruption. They identified the keywords, after I did a podcast about it, then made it so it only served up good FBI news. When I changed it again, to fix it, they stole the subreddit from me and made it a pro FBI subreddit. Admin will not give it back. So yeah... don't tell people how your stuff works, they'll mess with it for a variety of reasons and sometimes just for fun. You are correct that with enough sparse details, our algos will never cross paths. Your summary is a good one. You need strong technical analysis, strong fundamental analysis and strong news analysis in my system and it needs to work fast enough that I don't have to click more than once per trade. My set up is pretty hodge podge, but I am always trying to streamline it. I would love to sell it because it is a product I believe in, but I'm a ways from being able to do that. It still requires constant work and intervention and 3 computers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, stealth is wealth. Don't be telling nobody about this. Second. Diversify. Liquidate enough to pay for your first home. Something modest where there is no luxury tax. Start a business from your home to help ease tax burdens. Your property should produce something. Anything. Next, you will need to make money with your money. Personally, I started with a second property, close by, to rent, to cover the expenses of my first home. Put this in its own LLC and use it as a tax sink, as well. Then, I created a living trust, whereby it would become irrevocable upon my death. Most of my assets are parked there, until I decide what to do with it. Then, I bought reliable dividend stocks, like AT amp;T, Disney, etc. A million in decent dividend stocks yields a living wage. Between rental income and dividend income, this means you shouldn't have to worry, ever again. I eventually did buy a safe and occasionally acquire bars and coins of precious metals. Don't tell anyone about your safe, either. Don't increase your fun money spending until you have enough coming in. Continue to buy properties until you can get a property management company to take over. Even consider starting your own property management company. This will be the bulwark against any potential financial disasters. When the dip occurred, I began to invest heavily in equities and I spend a lot more time day trading, now. I attempt to recoup 1 percent per day of what I put on the street. This is about a thousand dollars per day, for me. Slowly diversify into safe, long term investments that contribute to passive income.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not defensive, you've just proven again you don't get it. It isn't Alex Jones. It isn't CNN. It is them working together to create a strawman. For example, CNN calls Pizzagate a debunked conspiracy theory about human trafficking by Hillary Clinton out of a pizza shop. Alex Jones calls Pizzagate something quite a bit different and even more exaggerated than the fake conspiraypcy theory made up by CNN. At no point does either CNN or Alex Jones mention the money laundering out of Comet Ping Pong or the known, convicted pedophiles who frequented the establishment. Christopher Kloman is one example. Ken Starr, a republican hack, wrote a letter defending a pedophile. Weird. James Alefantis' whole family, Democrats, also wrote a letter defending the pedophile. That's one of many pedo examples. Did Alex Jones ever mention that? Nope. Did Alex Jones ever mention that the email talking about bringing three underage girls to the hot tub? Or that the email chain ended with "I've never had an affair before"? No. Even though that would have helped him. And, of course, Jeffrey Epstein and Dennis Hastert, among others were curiously left out of the conversation. So, yeah, you don't get it. You are HALF way there. What are they trying to leave out? Is what you should be asking. I guarantee you it hurts both parties. Otherwise, they wouldn't be playing the stupid game about crisis actors in the first place. Oh yeah, adrenochrome? You can oxidize an EpiPen with ferritin. No blood needed. Anyone with a Chemistry degree can tell you. Anyone pushing this idea exists to make people who vote for Trump seem crazy. On the other hand, CNN is hiding that Joe Biden cannot help but sniff and grope kids... among others... but A LOT of kids. But it's okay because he doesn't drink adrenochrome? Vote for Biden no matter who he put his finger in? That's the other half you are missing. Right v left is a useful tool. Gay? Vote this way! Black? Democrat vote slave. Like guns? Hurr durr racist red hat. And while everyone gets caught up in these narratives, no one is voting for antiwar candidates or pro government transparency candidates and those two problems, ending war and creating government transparency, solve all the rest. Where people can get together, gather signatures and create laws, they don't because they are being taught sarcasm and outrage work. They don't. Where people could report on corruption using social media, they don't. You get what I'm saying? You FEEL superior because you don't agree with Alex Jones. The trap is designed that way. Then you agree with someone who is also lying, as a result of that feeling.</TEXT>

Make both sides emotional, activating the based portions of the brain and overriding reason. By subscribing to fake narratives, you give up your ability to reason and all you've got are petty insults rather than a reasoned argument. Everything you people spew is regurgitated media talking points... not actual research. But keep picking the wrong side, either one, and continue to be surprised when events prove your hot takes wrong over and over again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are capable of superficial relationships with other narcissists easier than with other people. They instinctually act as each other's flying monkeys. However, it is possible to nudge them into death spiral power struggles with each other... quite easily, even, to get them off your plate. A true narc usually likes to plot against someone else, so sick them on amother narc. They deserve each other. If you lead each narcissist to believe that the other is talking dirt behind their backs, they'll focus on each other. This can be njce chance for respite for some people. In the end, narcissists only have enablers and most can only manage lording over one or two people, tops. The talented ones are a bit better, but you get enough targets on their radar, and they'll tone down their tendencies until they can get a foothold. Not as easy to do with narcs who live with you, but workplace narcs are easy to deal with in this manner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried ordering one of their expensive cabinets coincidentally named after a missing child, but the price reverted to normal. There are a number of bizarre coincidences, like the trafficker who was just arrested with a Wayfair shirt on, but unless they are limited the purported buys to platinum club members, I don't see how they are pulling it off. My guess is that these stories are distracting from the trending, again, Pizzagate. It's an election year, so expect Wikileaks to rear its head again, as well. The Wayfair story was immediately on the heels of the maxwellhill story, which turned out to be a dude in Malaysia who is fond of the run down 'resort' named Maxwell Hill. I'll be curious to see how much the narrative effects the stock price.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Snopes and other fact check sites rely on sitessetting up a limited hangout for each issue by presenting a strawman and then answering it in the most myopic way possible. For example, Reuters created the strawman that Hillary was trafficking children out of Comet Ping Pong basement so they could say there isn't even a basement. At no point do they address Laura Silsby, Jeffrey Epstein, human trafficking by their friends at Glendora or Tyson, or Black Ivys sketchy 3rd world ports, or the Troika Laundromat money trail to the Podestask etc. However bases on the strawman fact check, now everyone get to run around saying it's debunked despite the documentation in the blackmail case against Alefantis and Brock... or the fact that Comet Ping Pong was ground zero for the Antifa movement and people like Luke Kuhn were plotting attacks from the restaurant, where Maya Harris, sister of Kamala Harris, has fundraisers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His son also plead guilty to child sexual abuse... https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/15/us/jerry-sandusky-son-pleads-guilty/index.html He was sending seductive letters across state lines. He has had more accusers. https://heavy.com/news/2012/08/sandusky-pedophile-ring-feds-suspect-sicko-shared-boys-with-other-men/ That's 10 seconds of Google. Do you have a link or an argument to support your point of view?  gt; Bucceroni told this reporter,  #8220;In 1979 and 1980 #8212;when I was 13 and 14 years old #8212;a well-connected pedophile named Edward Savitz took me on trips from Philadelphia to TSM fundraisers. I knew the minute I got there it was a breeding ground because of Savitz #8217;s involvement. While [Jerry] Sandusky interacted with wealthy donors, the other men were sizing-up kids. I felt like a cheap whore because I was in these naked pictures that Savitz was passing around. #8221;  gt;When asked how certain he was in regard to these claims, Bucceroni replied,  #8220;I #8217;m sure of it. Savitz talked about taking kids from Philly to TSM and introducing them to men #8212;soliciting them to  #8216;his friends. #8217; They exchanged and swapped kids like baseball cards. It was a feeding frenzy. I felt like a prostitute or a go-go dancer at a bachelor party. I felt dirty, used and cheap. #8221;  gt;When it came to TSM #8217;s founder, Bucceroni didn #8217;t overplay what happened.  #8220;Savitz introduced me to Sandusky on two separate occasions, but he didn #8217;t come across like a pedophile. The other guys at these functions, though, were different. I could tell from their body language what they had in mind. When I met him, Jerry was a like a movie star. Everyone called him  #8216;Coach. #8217; After Savitz hand-delivered my enrollment forms to him, Jerry grabbed me by the shoulder #8212;not in a sexual way #8212;and said,  #8216;Don #8217;t worry, we #8217;ll take care of you. #8217; Savitz told me that Jerry would take kids to football games. #8221;  gt;Sexually abused victims who testified at the Sandusky trial in Bellefonte, Pa. confirmed this point. https://notpsu.blogspot.com/2012/07/sandusky-scandal-tied-to-philly.html And don't forget about the missing FBI files and the missing DA whose was never found, who had been investigating Sandusky... https://deadspin.com/what-is-the-cia-hiding-about-the-missing-da-who-didnt-p-5890077</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem a bit emotional, but I am after the truth. The reason those victims made money was not from Sandusky. It was from Penn State ignoring reports of abuse. I'm totally willing to be skeptical because the mediator was none other than the 9/11 victims mediator. Many consider the high payment to be hush money over the ring itself. They did have evidence of their claims... reports with the university, their doctors and other witnesses. The letters Sandusky was sending and being caught in the act of sodomy also seem like fairly strong evidence. There are other accusers who didn't get paid, plus you still haven't really covered the case of the missing DA and his files. We even have a governor taking donations and associating with second mile leaders while slow walking the investigation. So, if you're argument is there is no evidence, I'm not going to be able to give it much creedence.</TEXT>
