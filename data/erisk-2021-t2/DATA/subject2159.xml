    <TEXT>Portals work for around 5 minutes after starting the server up. Than they stop working. You can walk in them, but it doesn't trigger any event to go to the other dimension. I have searched for the last 2 hours and found nothing \- I don't have multiverse installed, so it's not that \- I have enabled the [server.properties](https://server.properties) nether option and allowed portal creation.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unity FPS project (well into development) looking for people to join.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-17 09:09:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! I've been working on a first person shooter for over a year now, It's been more of a side project but now I am starting to put all of my spare time into it. The project is a first person shooter, inspired by Titanfall, Destiny, Minecraft and Skyrim. Yes, I understand it's a very weird mix, but it does look cool. When I started making this project, one of the ideas I had was to only use 1 model (the unity cube model) to make my entire project out of, If you look into my project, all of the models are the Unity cube model with different colours, scaled and transformed to look like a "ok" looking model. I was inspired heavily by minecraft for the models. They're simple to make, and they don't look that bad. After reading that, I am sure you want to see some gameplay, here is some clips of the game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sse8nmBTH\_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sse8nmBTH_Q) [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJRM-fOQgKs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJRM-fOQgKs)[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOeCy32jAc) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOeCy32jAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOeCy32jAc) The game jolt page is here if your interested:[ https://gamejolt.com/games/hes\_mora/446872](https://gamejolt.com/games/hes_mora/446872)  #8203; The game I want to be, is like an MMO RPG, somewhat. Currently, you can do missions in the game, most are "survive the waves of enemies" but I have made a lot of the missions have tasks in them, such as the event that pops up in your map when you reach level 1 which is called "stop the witches ritual". Essentially, you have to defeat a couple of hordes of zombies, then defeat the witches, and stop the ritual.  #8203; [Stop the witches ritual mission. \(Event\). ](https://preview.redd.it/836azpwl87n41.png?width=1178 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=3065148144548abdb146c5e4444000c5774c6aaf) Now the multiplayer aspect was going to be co-op, but I failed miserably at adding this to my game. This is why I would LOVE someone who had any experience in basic fps multiplayer coding and mechanics. I would want there to be lobbies where you connect with other players. I also am making a "gladiator arena" where you fight other players, 1 on 1, or 2 on 2, maybe 4 on 4? in small battles, which go for short duration of time. The game has it's lore to, if you have reached this part in reading, most likely you care about the lore. The game is set on a planet (maybe an alternate universe, or maybe far into the future, not sure yet) known as Mora. In this, you play in a small portion of mora, known as Malboz. Malboz is a city state, run by the Orcs, there are many cities and tribes in Malboz each which you must conquer for the Empire. The warring faction in this game is the Imperials. The Imperials are a mostly human Empire which seeks to Conquer all of Mora to create Order. You fight for the Imperials, but this may change. Also, the faction known as the Voids, are meddling in the affairs of this war, infact, they come from the other side of Mora. Shown in the picture below.  #8203; [This is the land of Mora. This may change over time though.](https://preview.redd.it/u1wsfkjs77n41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=d68af022bfb84de3850972a1b58a4643cd0101e5) This is the land you actually play in: [This is the area that the player has access to in Hes Mora. ](https://preview.redd.it/sypukc4w77n41.png?width=1920 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=a1dbc30c5f76961fe5c19b8962232540354c5080) So there is much room to expand, hopefully we can add some open world elements. [The races of Hes Mora](https://preview.redd.it/jh7dtnhsw7n41.png?width=800 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=cf630fa8acaf407dc832c4e34835bac57ce5d22e) Races Explanation: \- Human, Generic human race. \- Orc, humans mutated with pigs to live longer, now a separate race. \- Elf, Taller humans with hyper senses, also likes magic (yes, there is magic in hes mora) \- Cyno, Cynocephaly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynocephaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynocephaly)) are the dog race of Mora All races have there own benefits and abilities.

    <TEXT>How did this get 100 upvotes? I am genuinely curious. See I have been uploading random stuff lately too see if this community would actually upvote it. It's funny, nobody can figure out who I am, or what I do. Just that I steal Reddit posts and re-upload them, Maybe one day I will reveal my real identity? Perhaps not? Has everyone forgot about my burden? If so I feel worried. Anyway, since your here, Have you heard the good news? Jesus died on the cross for your sins! Yes! You! Repent, or you will not inherit the kingdom of God and you will be sent to hell! Oh also, if I have reposted your post and you want credit, feel free to just dm me and Ill give you credit, this was just a social experiment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Guys I am sick of these larpfags</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-22 10:38:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok, so the 9b9t reddit is a save haven for us non larpers. I think it's time we take action. We need to unite under 1 banner. I don't have a name for it, since naming things is a form of larping. Infact my name was made from a randomly generated username generator so I couldn't larp. I don't speak in chat so that I can't accidentally larp. Nor do I speak in voice chats, voice chats are considered larping since you talk over a block game, which is impossible and larpish. Who is with me? Aren't you guys sick of these larpers? We must not do anything, to anyone at anytime; all actions are considered larping. The only words we must say is "cringe", so we can call out the cringe larpers!!! This is one of their images I found, I wasn't larping or anything. I was on the Imperial's discord and found this! (BTW I left straight away, don't worry I didn't send any messages, I tried not to take in their propaganda, it was hard but I had to stay strong) [Chaos on top! Down with larpies!!](https://preview.redd.it/1g7h9ah0oa051.png?width=1500 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=3fca9c478f2c941d79714199430b120ba6fc97fb) To fight larpers we need to not say anything, we need to remove all groups, discords, and any other form of medium. We must not move our characters in game becuase this could be youtuber larp, as youtubers like FITMC moved in game. We can only say "cringe" or "larper". Guys this is the last larp ever on 9b9t. I am sorry to the community to have to see this larping cringe, but it is a necessary evil.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Than why does he never explain that to the community? Your making assumptions based of no facts. Until the 2b2t owner either says this or there is some form of evidence your just speculating... Speculations are usually wrong. The owner is not communiting with the community so he can keep making profits. I honestly don't care if he makes profits, my entire concern is that he censors reddit for literally no reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't dislike solid, but he's friend Mcsapling continues to be part of the "call mrck10 a pedo without any proof" group. On discord I wasn't able to get moderator status because he wouldn't let me, Zltb8 at the time wans't on the discord to my knowledge. I think it's fair if you remove Solid, but I still like solid as a person. MCsapling and possibly SolidColled tried to get me removed as moderator from this subreddit because they were worried about there "reddit power" and me "nuking the sub", how do you nuke a subredit lmao? It seems like they didn't want people as moderators so they could keep control of 2b2t\_Uncensord. Also it seems very sketchy how many accounts are posting the same message and replying, for some reason I always see solid's groups spam post on critism posts. such as when the pedolarper video came out they posted "#TEAMNOTREES" to associate the video with them. I don't hate solid, or not even mcsapling, but I never knew prior to this they tried hard to get me removed as moderator. So  #128526; the tables have turned!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah yes my agenda. Also I was talking about r/2b2t not this subreddit. I have made multiple video's prasing this sub, I would say every 2nd video I talk about this subreddit lol. The video about this subreddit has 30% of it's viewers come from recommended which means around 189 people who probably have never heard about this subreddit, came to this subreddit and got redpilled. Also I haven''t been in imperials for 3 months because I left. I don't control imperials, I don't affiliate with Imperials. it's also not my group. It's not owned by 1 person like the majority of groups. So whoever you are xxx\_Crystalz\_xxx69 please stop spreading your conspiracy theory's on 2b2t. Thanks Merick.</TEXT>
