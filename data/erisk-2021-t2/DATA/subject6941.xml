    <TITLE>transaction speeds</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I am struggling to see how bitcoin will ever scale. Say if 1 billion people (1/10th of the world population) decide to all make a single transaction using bitcoin, then based on it's current transaction speed of 7 seconds, it would take 1653 days to process these.  #8203; Lets put this another way, if everyone in the world wants to own a fragment of bitcoin, then 10 billion transactions will take 45 years. Is my maths correct here? surely i am wrong  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's no cure but don't sabotage yourself. Get to work earlier than expected. Put your phone in the draw and don't look at it. Say good morning to everyone and make small talk to your boss. It takes 6 months to know what's going on in a new role.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to a psychologist because I had crippling anxiety. Ended up doing the mbti test. Anxiety makes you second guess everything so filling out a personality test yielded the same results has filling it out for a person I never met. The results came back as inconclusive and a high degree of contradiction and lieing. After 10 sessions with the therapist I came away feeling even more lost than before.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Shower fixture won't align</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:35:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I had to replace my shower fixture and it won't align quite correctly. It has a rubber washer so I decided not to use thread tape. When screwing in, it tightened just enough to prevent a leak at the 2 O'clock position. I can loosen it back to 12 o'clock but it has a very small drip Should I use thread tape or should I stack another washer to reduce the amount of rotation required?</TEXT>
