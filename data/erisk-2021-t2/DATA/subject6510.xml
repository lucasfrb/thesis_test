    <TEXT>I would add a Magus with Might From Beyond for +1 Attacks and +1 Strength. Then you could also add a Acolyte Iconward with Icon of the Cult Ascended for another +1 Strength. If you want to bring this to the Max you can add a Primus for exploding 5's and 6's for the Abominant aura. Paint the whe Thing as Twisted helix for +1 Strength and the possible to attack twice. 8 Abberants with picks and 2 Abberant Hyphermorphs net you 20A S16 AP -1 D2, 32A S8 AP -2 D3, 32A S8 from Rending Claws and 2A S8 AP -1 D1 from the Hyphermorph Tails. All with explosive 5's and 6's hitting on 2's. Thanks if you read that. Your paint job and base are awesome. I love that model.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-11 09:31:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my approach on a home brew GSC army which is lead by a Doctor, who managed to implant psy-blocking devices inside of various Genestealer Hybrids, cutting them from the Primarchs influence and link them to his own mind. This connection from then on works like the Techpriest and Skitarii connection, so the Doctor can send his orders straight into the heads of the cultists. He then proceeded to capture more imperial, aeldari and other vessels to form a fleet of pirates ravaging through space with the fiercest strength the former cultists can offer. The looted weapons and goods are used to reinforce and expand his fleet. Thanks for reading This idea came to my head because I don't like the thought of having my cultists devoured by the Nids after their job and because space pirates are awesome. What do you think of it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely still viable as you will have the opportunity to remove screens with the new 12 inch handflamers and then use your bonus on the charge. This is, with twisted helix, the best melee cult but the choice is dependent on your meta. With a lot of Marines and other T4 armies id choose twisted helix to get the chance to wound on 3, if your meta is alot of T3 armies you can safely go C4AE. And try to lose the purestrains out of your army if you want to get competitive, they are pretty expensive for their output. I hope this helps you.</TEXT>

And Goliaths as they can now move and shoot without penalty and transports are generally strong in 9th.</TEXT>
