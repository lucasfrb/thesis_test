    <TEXT>I just got the essential phone last week, I switched essential from LG G6. Everything is good so far, but I have the bluetooth issue. I used more than two bluetooth devices one is my ear phone and the other one is my car. Whenever i started my car, I have to manually connect it through bluetooth. The Essential Phone didn't auto connect to my car. I didn't have this problem with my G6. So is this how stock android devices works, because this is my first stock android device.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a g6 once before i switch to the essential phone. Everything about the g6 was good especially the wide angle camera i just cant live without it. Its a must have. But the battery on the g6 was not good due to it ips display and bad battery optimization compare to stock android. And that's why i went for the essential phone. But if price isn't the factor. I would love to have the V30, because it has an Oled display, wide angle camera, water resistant, and one of the best headphones jack out there. I WILL GO FOR THE V 30</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it bothers me but not as much as Samsung skin. LG is not that heavy. And i would still prefer some of the LG feature like Bluetooth auto connect when ever i get into my car. I always have 2 audio device with me, one is my earphone, and the other is the car. LG connects two of them automatically. Compare to the essential phone, i have to manually connect them whenever i hop into the car. But essential phone is only been out there for 5 months, so i hope the can fix this with the update this week. I like essential because they kept updating their device since this is their first one. For LG, since it's a big company you have to wait for a while for they pushing the update. But i really want the v30 because of the wide angle camera.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ip 68 wont sustain long in the pool. And if you're looking for an android wear that can sustain in the pool, that would be expensive. Im using pebble 2 now and it can be use in the pool because its water resistant up to 30meter (3atm), if you're interested. Pebble 2 only cost around $60 on ebay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used the lg g6 for around 3 months and i loved it. I love its design, its screen, and especially its wide angle camera. I really miss the wide angle camera. But one thing that made me switch to the essential phone is that I prefer stock android with fully optimized battery. The lg g6 battery is one of my disappointment, it has weak standby time. The essential phone software is getting better, and i love the monthly updates, the phone just getting better. Compare to big company like LG, it would take them longer time to get the latest updates. I do miss the wide angle camera. But the essential phone is a beauty that packs with good specs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its just depends on how you like stock android or non stock android. To me, i love the essential phone because it runs stock android and has no bloat ware. I don't like Samsung skin l, even though it's getting batter. But there are still bloat ware and that makes the phone lags a little. One thing that i like the non stock androoud phone is the Bluetooth features, those phones are capable of connecting 2 Bluetooth audio devices at the same time. While stock abdroid phones will have this feature until Android P release which is around Fall. Other than that, I still prefer the Essential Phone, their community is very good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but i think because of the sales as well. Since they dont sells alot. There is no reason why they have tonkeep supporting it. I like the watch so far. But alot of people dont know about the watch and the price was too high and it didn't launch with android wear 2.0.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its a used one but in great condition. Everything is great, especially that its 5atm water resistant. But i do wigh to have Oreo update, so I can disable the touch to wake feature. Because this watch is only a year old. But it seems that the sales are not going well so they are no longer support it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you look into the A15, it's more powerful than the g15 and it's 2.22kg vs 2.02kg on g15. And it has more drive slot to upgrade. If you prefer 15 inch gaming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right so it would be depends on your preference. I have the G14 and I love it, it's light and looks professional and it has an amazing battery life. I have the white one with rtx 2060, to me I would prefer the 1660 TI one bc it runs cooler than the RTX 2060. To me a 15 inch is still big to carry around. My previous 15 inch gaming laptop is the Triton 500.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also I think the G14 build quality is better than the G15, and it also has the fingerprint scanner. The only thing thatI don't like is limited upgrade like 1 slot of ssd and ram.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BC the RTX 2060 is the Max Q design so the performance would be almost the same to the 1660 TI. The only difference that I think that RTX one has Ray Tracing, which is cool but I will sacrifice alot of frame rate if we turn it on. But yeah I have the same issue as well is where got is from Best Buy and they only have the White RTX variant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another thing to consider is that the G14 pannel has bad input lag of around 46 or 49ms if you into competitive gaming like Overwatch or COD. But if this is your first time playing with the high refresh rate panel, then you wouldn't notice it.</TEXT>
