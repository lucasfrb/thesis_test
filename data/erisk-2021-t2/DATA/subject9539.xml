I can't think of any audio playing device that has bluetooth but no 3.5mm output. Whatever you're pairing with this device will surely have a 3.5mm output port, so... why does this product exist? All you need is the 3.5mm cable that this product comes packaged with.</TEXT>

I basically want a router that, instead of an ethernet port that connects to the internet, has a "wifi port" that can then distribute to all the other ethernet port. Ideally, it should also have usb to connect a printer, but I guess I could also do a printer share thing with the connected computers on the ethernet. is there such a device?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The note reads, "taking this pill will make you vulnerable to all diseases known to man. You will not show symptoms, but you will feel them. You will not be contagious. No modern medicine will cure the diseases you contract. There will be no cure. Your body will not be able to fight off the diseases. You will die from these diseases that you catch unless you fulfill the pill objective. Once you have sex with the 1000th unique woman, you will be immune to all fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases for the remainder of your life. You will have the immune system of a god. The potency of this pill will expire in 24 hours if it is not within your body.

I can tell he's challenging me too because his play sessions are several hundred trophies each time... making me have to play for several hundred trophies just to stay ahead of the game! Edit: Finally! Looks like my #2 quit on me. I was watching him get trophies last night and I just kept matching his speed. Seems like he went to sleep at around 1am and pulled ahead of him with 3000 more trophies. With 2 hours left before we get Camera Dude, it looks like it would be impossible for him to catch up at this point!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been looking into tilt-shift lenses. I see the image change of tilting the lens but shift seems to be easily accomplished by just moving the camera. A lot of videos I see of what shifting does is fix perspective by changing the angle of the camera to be perpendicular to the subject and not angled upward. Why not be perpendicular to the subject and just raise the tripod up that 20mm range that the lens can shift instead of spending so much on a lens that can shift?</TEXT>

Bottom is just a plate with a hole to screw in an output plug. Top is just a plate. Back is a plate with screw holes on it to screw the box to something else. Front plate screws the entire box together. EDIT: I dont have a 3d printer and i really dont want to deal with figuring it all out. Id rather just have someone do it for me.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-11-30 10:38:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ordered some Soylent 1.0 about a year ago when everything was backordered. I had to wait like 5 months for it to come it. I tasted it, it's not terribly bad, but it smelled like play doh dry, was gritty in the drink, and tasted 'blah' for lack of a better word. Again, it didnt make me gag, and it wasnt as impossible to drink as optimum nutrition whey protein powder is for me to drink (that stuff makes me literally gag and is impossible to down). I never really finished it though. After being reminded of it randomly, I decided to crack open my box again and try it. I found mixing it with some good tasting protein power helped a lot. So I check the website to see what's up and find that they're on v1.5 and now have a drink v2.0. Im wondering how 1.5 compares to 1.0 in taste and texture. Also, are they still having backorder issues with new orders? Thanks.</TEXT>

The P8 Max is like $550 to $700 getting a 9.0 rating on phonearena but the mediapad x2 is $350 to $450 getting a 7.5 rating! Functionally, they're pretty much identical with the chip on the P8 Max being a VERY slight update but based off the same hardware. Memory is 2x more but both have expandable memory and dual sim capabilities. Does anyone else see a difference that's worth the price difference? Please tell me!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-12-14 01:24:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I know this is possible because there are already products out there that can do this but I cant seem to find the information I need that makes this possible. Maybe it requires a PCB and some programming or something but I cant seem to find out exactly what is needed. Anyways, I want to create essentially a battery plate that accepts 2 rechargeable batteries to power my device but drains the batteries one at a time so that when one is drained it will be powered by the other battery and make the dead battery hotswappable. This way, I never need to turn off my device. For simplicity sake, let's say my device is 5vdc. I want to be using two 5vdc batteries which means I need to connect them in parallel and not in series since series will make the charge 10vdc. But connecting them in parallel just makes them drain at the same time and PLUS I read that you should never connect rechargeable batteries in parallel because it could over drain one of the batteries if theyre not at the exact charge level to start and cause serious problems like explosion or fire. Anyways, I think I've explained what I want to know in detail. Please help! Is there some kind of delay system or something to make it work?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I purchased an old Anton Bauer NiCd battery pack to modify as a conversion plate but I can't figure out how to get the damn thing open. There are no screws or anything and this thing is purposely built like a tank to survive hard impacts. I only need the back half a the case to be in tact since I'm modifying it to be a conversion plate so no need for the NiCd cells or top of the case to be in working condition. With that said, I don't know how safe it is to just drill through the top or saw it since I don't know how the cells will react to that. What is the safest method for me to bust this stupid thing open?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I got the packet from them and all the options they offer from Anthem BlueCross and read up on how employee enrollment works... and everything would make sense, except for the fact that I'm not a regular 9-5 worker. I work for this company that calls me in for a week or two of work at a time so there's no guarantee that I'll be working for them in the future. It's also very inconsistent and allows for me to pick up other jobs at other companies. I understand that employee enrollment means I'm on their group plan, the company pays a portion of my healthcare bill and the rest is taken out of my monthly pay check... problem is that there's no guarantee that I will have a monthly paycheck from them... so what happens then? Do they continue to pay a portion of my bill? Do I have a gap in my payment? If so, what exactly is the repercussions of having gaps in my payment? please help!</TEXT>

EDIT: Added info: Now that i think about it, I guess I can't consider myself an independent contractor with that company as opposed to the other companies that I work with because I filled out a w-2 instead of a 1099 and I do timesheets instead of invoices, but! the work style is still the same. The work is on an as needed basis, week to week, with no guarantee of work. Such is California employment laws... I do film/Tv labor work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people say that they could live the rest of their life off of a few million. I imagine that such a life would be simplistic and sensible probably in an affordable town and not really doing much. Essentially, having a boring life. How much would a person need to live a life of travel that's equally sensible? Not necessarily living in the most expensive hotels and partying like crazy, but living a life doing normal travel stuff that doesnt break the bank and staying in mostly budget accommodations that are not the cheapest-because-its-uncomfortable option. How much would such a life cost? What range of millions would you need?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This question comes with the idea that time is mostly not a factor other than having to sleep and eat. If you wanted to burn as much energy as possible in the shortest amount of time without damaging your body, what would the best exercise(s) be? The idea is not to be fit or build strength, just burn energy. It must do minimal damage to your body so that you can utilize the full 24 hour day cycle as much as possible. You must take into account that this person has not exercised a day in his/her life.</TEXT>

How effect is reusing the dirty soapy water for another load? Would the fact that it's dirty make it effectively useless in cleaning the next batch of clothes? Edit: I know I said washing machine, but really I was thinking about this inthe context of hand washing similarly to the way you wash dishes by hand.

I would think he's comparing it to an oil change, but from context, being that it's about quick charging an electric car, it must mean something else unless you guys have oil changes as often as you fill up for gas, which would be insane...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On my backpacking trip through Europe I came across a street performer that was describing a conversation with his parents. He said that his parents were disappointed with what he does to get by, essentially begging on the streets for money from passerbys. He didnt have a particularly good talent/skill but his delivery was on point as an entertainer and the next thing he said resonated. He said that he was not ashamed of what he did because what he did wasnt the stupid skill he was demonstrating... that was just the medium he used to deliver joy and positivity into the world. There's already too much hate, sadness, war, etc in this world. Anyways, I was just thinking about that in the shower and thought I'd share. While it may be common sense, it's not a perspective I generally default into so it was nice to actively think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So at work today I was having a conversation with someone above me but not my direct boss. I view him positively as kind of a mentor and feel he's overall looking out for me in general. As part of my job I am tasked with responding to emails that's sent to a mailing list (multiple people can see it besides me), in which he's on as well. I work a certain set of hours/days and as a contractor I feel that I shouldnt have to deal with work outside of those hours. Well an email came from a higher up above us all after hours and I was told that I need to be faster at responding to emails. My stance is that it's not my job to be available at all hours because I'm not a full-time employee like him. His stance is that it is my primary role at work and so I should respond regardless on the rare chances that these come in after hours. What do you think I should do? While minor as it is, I feel I need to make hard stands on things because it becomes a gateway to getting taken advantage of.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I buy a farewell cake for a coworker I interacted with but is outside of my 'team'?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-20 13:58:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I just heard in passing that it is the last day for this coworker and I'm not sure if I should get a surprise farewell cake. Some notes about our company structure: The company is HUGE, broken down into departments as you would expect. The department I am in is broken down further into a core 'work' team, which I am a part of, and then many 'creative' teams which this leaving co-worker is a part of. The many different 'creative' teams come up with work and solicit the assistance of the core 'work' team when needed. I am the facilitator on the 'work' team so my interactions or job if you will, was to basically pass on messages from the 'creative' to the appropriate core 'work' team member who actually does the work. Pretty sweet gig IMO. anyways, I'm not sure if I should get a farewell cake. I have no reservations with spending the money but what confuses me is this... I was only made aware of coworker's leaving a day before and in passing conversation within core team where one told another and such information was not necessarily directed at me... and that information was not coming from the leaving coworker, so I dont know if leaving coworker wants to make it a thing. Also, leaving coworker has their own team so maybe they're planning something already and there might be too much cake? Maybe leaving coworker cant eat cake? I dont really know leaving coworker well enough. Can you even eat farewell cake at 10 in the morning? How much cake should I get? Enough for leaving coworker's team and work team? Or enough for nearby creative teams as well? For reference, core work team is like 10 people, leaving coworker creative team is like 8 people, nearby friendly (very close in relationship) creative team is like another 12 people.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-05-29 21:44:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my car just sprung a leak. Google tells me green fluid is anti-freeze. I filled up my radiator with some water and turned it on and found the leak where the red square is in the below picture. http://imgur.com/a/HQApS Is this part of the radiator? I looked at videos for replacing the radiator for my car and it doesnt look like that's part of the radiator. If it is not, what is it and how hard is it to repair/replace? It looks to be plastic. I'd like to add that I know nothing about cars. Looks like that hard plastic tube is connected to 2 soft rubber tubes on the driver side and 1 soft rubber tube on the passenger side. What else it's connected to is beyond me. When I look at radiators online, they look like just the heatsink part of a CPU.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can someone help me with a guide for how to trouble shoot this PCB?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-04 01:39:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm trying to repair this board that's from a kitchen tool... Waring Pistol Vac charging base to be precise. I have a multimeter and a capacitor tester at my disposal. I've tested the AC/DC adapter and found it was fine, and I tested the tool itself and found that that was fine as well so the problem lies in the charging base. I popped that sucker open and found this PCB inside. http://i.imgur.com/p26ksYT.jpg I'm guessing that one of these components is bad but I dont know how to test them. If I'm not mistaken, all the Rs are resistors, all the Cs are capacitors, all the Qs and Us are transistors, but what are the Ds and what is the process of testing that each of these are not burned out? I could just buy a new charging base for $20 but where is the fun in that? I want to learn but I dont know how to do it! EDIT: So I think I found the problem... Q1, a transistor seems to be busted. plugged the board in and put a lead on negative and one leg of the transistor and got the full voltage but on the other legs it was 0 so I'm assuming that the power stops inside it because it's broken. Now my next problem, where do I get this particular transistor? I looked up the label and cant find anything about it. The label reads: STRC 245 M8 8 Any idea what this means? EDIT2: So after looking up more on transistors I learned about NPN and PNP. Taking a second look, I was following the power path into a PNP transistor as it connected to the middle contact. in this case this seems fine I believe. I followed the line to another transistor though, this time to a NPN which was labeled S8050 which seems to be a common transistor. Power path stopped there so I will buy and replace and update when done.</TEXT>

What if he ate 20,000? 50,000? At what point does the body say fuck it and you start pooping it out raw? There are competitive eaters that are skinny that talk of taking massive shits so I assume there's a limit to the absorption rate of food. What is that rate?</TEXT>

Wanting to actually change that answer, my mind immediately went to "ate an entire ice cream cake by myself and cried from sadness/disgust." Then I considered actually doing that for my birthday.

    <DATE>2017-11-27 08:13:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I CURRENTLY work for a CA company(agency1) that hires contractors for another CA company(corporation1) and everything made sense. The corporation got bought by another company(corporation2) which is based out of NY. Corporation1 decided to dissolve relationship with agency1 and use a DC company(agency2) as their new source of contractors. All current contractors are getting rehired by agency2 to continue their contract with corporation1. Are you following this so far? OK. So, because this is a new agency that I'll be employed with I looked into their policies and noticed that their sick day policy is different. Agency1's policy followed the rules of CA, allowing unlimited sick days to accrue up to the end of the calendar year and then expire, where as agency2 has a limit of accruing 3 sick days max but with no expiration date. Can they do that because they're a DC company even though the employee is working in CA? Or do they have to abide by the CA rules because they're working in CA for a CA subsidiary company?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does everyone say that you can make more money with the cash option over the annuity when winning the lottery?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-21 08:59:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen arguments that state allowing the government to invest the money for you for 30 years will return a smaller percentage than if you did it yourself but the counter-argument I've seen is that if you let the government do it the starting capital is larger because it isn't pre-taxed before investment, something that would happen if you did it yourself. Which is the correct answer? Also, if you want to take it to the next level, with the annuity, you get money every year, which you can also invest back into something which would increase your net worth at the end of 30 years. With those taken into consideration, is the cash option still the best option for those who are extremely greedy and want the most they could possibly have after 30 years? If you want to crunch the numbers and do the math, here are the numbers for the next lottery jackpot. Assuming no state tax: Cash option (after federal taxes): $687,724,000 Annuity per year (after federal taxes, per year, listed in order): 1 $18,302,545 2 $19,217,673 3 $20,178,556 4 $21,187,484 5 $22,246,857 6 $23,359,201 7 $24,527,161 8 $25,753,519 9 $27,041,195 10 $28,393,255 11 $29,812,918 12 $31,303,563 13 $32,868,741 14 $34,512,179 15 $36,237,787 16 $38,049,677 17 $39,952,160 18 $41,949,769 19 $44,047,257 20 $46,249,620 21 $48,562,101 22 $50,990,206 23 $53,539,716 24 $56,216,701 25 $59,027,537 26 $61,978,914 27 $65,077,860 28 $68,331,752 29 $71,748,340 30 $75,335,758 Total: $1,216,000,002 So when comparing your final cash option investment after 30 years to the total value of the annuity, you'll need to factor in how much you'll have AFTER being taxed again when you "withdraw" from your investment to be a fair comparision to the 1.2 billion dollars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen arguments that state allowing the government to invest the money for you for 30 years will return a smaller percentage than if you did it yourself but the counter-argument I've seen is that if you let the government do it the starting capital is larger because it isn't pre-taxed before investment, something that would happen if you did it yourself. Which is the correct answer? Also, if you want to take it to the next level, with the annuity, you get money every year, which you can also invest back into something which would increase your net worth at the end of 30 years. With those taken into consideration, is the cash option still the best option for those who are extremely greedy and want the most they could possibly have after 30 years? If you want to crunch the numbers and do the math, here are the numbers for the next lottery jackpot. Assuming no state tax: Cash option (after federal taxes): $687,724,000 Annuity per year (after federal taxes, per year, listed in order): 1 $18,302,545 2 $19,217,673 3 $20,178,556 4 $21,187,484 5 $22,246,857 6 $23,359,201 7 $24,527,161 8 $25,753,519 9 $27,041,195 10 $28,393,255 11 $29,812,918 12 $31,303,563 13 $32,868,741 14 $34,512,179 15 $36,237,787 16 $38,049,677 17 $39,952,160 18 $41,949,769 19 $44,047,257 20 $46,249,620 21 $48,562,101 22 $50,990,206 23 $53,539,716 24 $56,216,701 25 $59,027,537 26 $61,978,914 27 $65,077,860 28 $68,331,752 29 $71,748,340 30 $75,335,758 Total: $1,216,000,002 So when comparing your final cash option investment after 30 years to the total value of the annuity, you'll need to factor in how much you'll have AFTER being taxed again when you "withdraw" from your investment to be a fair comparison to the 1.2 billion dollars.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-03 10:31:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>When 2 people are arguing a point that oppose each other, what is the standard practice of who has to show evidence? Obviously both people should show evidence of their point and counter point, but I seem to always get caught into a trap of having to put in all the work of proving my point when the opposition doesnt show any. Usually, it goes something like this. I make a point, the opposition will say that I'm wrong, so I prove my point with evidence. They'll rebuttal with something like, well you forgot about this, so I have to explain how I've factored that in already or why it was not worth factoring in/mentioning. Then they'll keep the cycle with trying to poke holes into my evidence as their evidence that they're right... never really doing any leg work on showing evidence that they're right. It's completely draining to have to constantly defend against this because there's no end. They'll always find something to poke at or will move the goal of why I'm wrong. If I try to nip it in the bud and say something like, show me evidence that I'm wrong, they'll say something like, you havent proven that you're right yet. I'm always put in a defensive position and have no information on their counter argument to go on the offense. It's so unbelievably frustrating that it makes me want to not interact with any other human ever again just to avoid these scenarios.</TEXT>

I realize that yoyo games may be in the UK and that's why the sale is over but it's still advertised and I'm in the US... so it's still Feb 12 for me. Would yoyo games honor the advertised sale price if I purchase it now? Or will they tell me to pound sand. I dont want to buy it if I have to pay full price and their refund policy seems pretty strict.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What kind of career fits my desire to help people but not get too attached/personal?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-02 21:43:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I want to help people in need and whenever someone says that, the answer seems to always be social worker... but that's not really a good answer because it's such a general term that can mean anything so maybe someone out there might know of more specific roles that are out there that I am unaware of. In addition, I think it would be best for me if it was a job that allowed me the inability to get too close or personal with people which I imagine is probably the opposite of all social work positions. I'm interested in more of a broad strokes type of helping job. Are there any kind of jobs like that? Also, I'd probably want to minimize the need to deal with interests that compete with helping people. For example, while a lawyer or a doctor in essence help people for a living, ignoring the fact that both professions are very personal, both professions deal with the politics of being a business out to make money so you're put into positions where you can't help because the numbers don't add up or because someone above you thinks the risk is too high to get involved. I don't really want to be in such a situation. While I understand that there's always going to be a balancing act when it comes to utilizing limited resources and finding solutions that may not be the most beneficial for everyone, a position that focuses more on the broader strokes and away from the personal level would probably be better for my mental health. Any suggestions? EDIT: Also I like logistics and finding solutions to problems.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is the job of a congressman to represent the popular will of their constituents or is it to uphold the constitution?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-06 20:45:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I watched Justin Amash town hall a while ago and remembered this part where one person claimed his job was to represent the people, but he says in response that his job is not to represent the people but to uphold the constitution. Quick link to part of video: https://youtu.be/FsDs2fTbj1I?t=4767 What is his job really? I imagine that ideally it would be both, but when both don't align, which takes precedence? The purpose of an election is to choose a person who best represents your group of people and to carry out decisions based on that group's collective will, assuming their will falls within legality which is set by the constitution... so in this case, upholding the constitution takes priority BUT The constitution can be amended based on the will of the people, in which case, the will of the people takes priority because amendments to the constitution only happen when the will of the people force changes onto it, often through, at the time, illegal activity. So... who is right? What is a congressman's job?</TEXT>

I let it rise for like 4 hrs and it doubled in size so I had to partition it and put it in multiple containers. I check the fridge and all the containers are about to burst so I had to partition them more. Do they ever stop rising? It hasn't even been 24 hours yet! I'm worried I'm going to wake up tomorrow with my fridge spilling with dough when I open it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What's good engagement rates for different levels of followers?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-08 21:34:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I read that when you have crazy follower numbers, good engagement rates are at 2-8% but what about when you're starting out and have less that 100k followers. What are good engagement rates for the lower level accounts? How many followers do you have and what's your engagement rate? I ask because I'm looking at other accounts with similar followers that have crazy high engagement rates and I'm wondering if I'm lower than average or they're higher than average.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does anyone know how hypeauditor works? I've checked my score against others and I'm confused.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-09 16:48:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>[This is me](https://i.imgur.com/8BMqRFU.png) . [This is someone I follow who posts daily. Let's call her daily poster.](https://i.imgur.com/hi0M8K9.png) . [And this is someone I stalk that posts rarely but I see him begging for follows in comments of popular posts everyday. Lets call him rare poster.](https://i.imgur.com/w0DfMzz.png) According to hypeauditor my score is much better but my engagement level is so low compared to them. For reference, I average about 200-350 likes per post, the daily poster is getting 500-800 likes per post, and the rare poster is getting 800-1200 likes per post. We're all in the same general niche. I don't know if it matters, but I'm following 800 people, daily poster is following 900 people, and rare poster is following 200 people. Anyone know how to analyze hypeauditor scores? Because there doesnt seem to be any correlation between their score and engagement rate or like/comment ratios. Any insight would be helpful! Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; But when bad things happen in public you would want someone like me around with my concealed firearm to fix the situation. This is pretty much the mindset of everyone who conceal carries because they can't comprehend that no, we would rather you not try and fix the situation. We would rather someone who is authorized to fix the situation come fix the situation. We would rather enhance the system that allows for those who are authorized to fix the situation to better service our needs to fix the situation instead of have gangs of wannabe heroes serving up justice how they see fit. There are systems in place to deal with situations and if those systems are failing, we dont decide to do it ourselves as individuals because we live in a society and should be working towards fixing a broken system and not circumventing the opinions and desires of society because one individual thinks he can solve the problem himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was bored and looked it up. http://www.allaboutbags.ca/reusablesgreenerrmyth.html So 2000 is not even close to being true, but when looking at the problem with actual numbers, reusable bags don't seem to work with my lifestyle. Most reusable bags sold at stores are PP bags, which are still plastic, just a more durable one. The linked study only mentions non-woven PP bags, but I usually see woven PP bags so I'm not sure how it compares. You need to reuse the PP bag 11 times minimum if you're the most wasteful with single use plastic bags. Because I'm forgetful, 11 seems kind of high for me. Note that reusing the bags only count if you're using it in a way that you would have used a single use plastic bag instead... so using it to carry shit on a regular basis DOES NOT count as reusing since you're not using it in a manner that would have replaced you using a single use plastic bag. Also, if you're the type of person who reuses single use bags as trash cans or pick up dog poop with, that not only doubles (plus a bit more to 26 reuses) your need to reuse your PP bags to be environmentally equal, it now creates an issue of having to consume more single use plastic bags that's dedicated to catching your trash or picking up dog poop as a replacement. If you were to use cotton bags, the reuse need is so much higher. So it's very much true that if you don't reuse the bags, you're actually hurting the planet more just not to the 2000x reuse number given by OP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>7100 times is for organic cotton bags which are usually not the ones sold in grocery stores for a 10 cents up charge. Those bags are PP bags which the same study says 37 times. I think it's disingenuous to use the value of the very rare worst case scenario over the more common, understood, and expected PP bag when talking about reusable bags. I dont even know any grocery stores that offer to sell you cotton bags, let alone organic cotton bags when you're in the checkout line. But yeah, if you see someone using cotton bags to carry groceries, feel free to give them the side eye and ask them how much groceries they actually buy in a lifetime.</TEXT>

But If someone instead said, that guy has enough money to buy 3 747-800 commercial planes... then it's like holy shit, can I even visualize how much money it takes to buy 1 747-800 plane?

    <TEXT>Not true. If they lasted the quarentine on the ship and determined they were safe, they would have been released back into general population. At that time they are unrecognizable from any other traveler and would not be subjected to another quarentine. Is the US quarentining all who return from a Japan flight right now? Nope. And if they survived the ship quarentine, they would have easily passed right through the airport from a Japan plane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not saying the tech isn't there. Saying country doesn't care. If they've gone through quarentine and another country considers them safe to reenter into public, they're not going to requarentine them again. If they were, they would have to quarentine everyone on that same plane and that currently isn't the case. The only people going straight into quarentine have already been grouped to be quarentined before their journey into the US. You think Canada is going to quarentine the Canadian citizens who are going through the US military base quarentine? You think they're going to go through a special transfer process from us base to Canada?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, nice source. Really let's everyone see what you're referring to with that link. Second, not allowed back in until after a certain date is not the same as being quarantined again / having to go back into quarantine. Simply waiting out the time outside of quarantine once passing ship quarantine would allow them back into the US according to what you've said and at the time, passing ship quarantine was 3 more days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no idea why you're so adamant about refusing to admit to being wrong when you are. The fact is that once they pass quarantine, they've passed and wont need to re-enter. At that time, all they needed to do to pass was make it 3 more days. So had they have passed they would not have to do another 14 days in another quarantine facility. The fact of the matter is that you're wrong and you're trying to dance around it by stating other requirements that are not the same as being quarantined again. Your exact words.  gt;Except they will still be quarantined. This is false. Plain and simple.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So there's no way to officially not pay child support since it is for the wellbeing of the child and not the other party, but what if there was a contract in place that stated the other party would pay you an equal amount if child support is required... Is that legal? So say child support says you need to pay $500, the contract would state the other party will need to pay you an equal amount, so in this case $500 essentially skirting your obligation to pay child support, but not really because you're still paying, it's just that the other party is paying you the same amount so the money is just hopscotching through you. Is that legal? Im in the USA</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having nothing to do with safety or function as you claim does not make it arbitrary. There is a reason behind the rule so it is not arbitrary. You may not like the reason, but that doesnt make it arbitrary nor does it make it braindead. Braindead would imply that there is no reasoning behind the rule when you've already stated a reasonable theory they've implemented the rule, hence, not braindead, just not to your liking.  gt;And you're saying that the weight load of a plane is the responsibility of the women flight attendants and not the chartering management? Are you trying to claim that the total weight of the cabin crew isn't taken into consideration when determining the total load of the plane? Is it the total weight load of the plane the responsibility of the woman flight attendants? Of course not. When did I ever say the entire load capacity of the plane is the responsibility of one person? Her weight in accordance to the policy in place is definitely her responsibility for sure though. She needs to meet the guidelines that are in place which help to better estimate the total cabin crew load across all flights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would assume being underweight is less of a problem in the sky than being overweight because gravity. Does it mean stewardesses can be overweight if someone else is underweight? Probably not because cabin crew is always rotating every flight so there is no way to determine total cabin crew being under limit collectively if this were the case, only imposing individual limits could guarantee being under limit. What about the fat lady passenger? If she's too fat she buys 2 seats. If she's not too fat to fit in 1 seat, she's probably within the calculations they've already determined, otherwise they would have imposed weight limits on passengers too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you not know what a digital tampon is? I'm not talking about reusing tampons. They do make reusable applicators but I'm not even talking about using those. Tampons can be applied without applicators. That's why they make digital tampons and that's exactly why they're called digital tampons. If you're applying a tampon you're 99% in a situation to sterilize your hand to an acceptable degree. 40% of women in Europe and 12% in the US use digital tampons and if it was a big health issue, it would already be known.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not a moot issue. There is still a significant amount of women who use tampons. Also such an attitude is not fitting with the idea that every bit of effort towards environmental preservation helps and this is one way to reduce the amount of plastics that are needlessly created considering this very plastic is completely superfluous and not in need of an alternative. It's literally the same as unnecessary plastic packaging.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A choice based system is not a good system, specifically in the example you've listed, being fire service. Fire don't care whether you pay taxes or not. A choice based system like that ends up with choice based results like fire service choosing to save your neighbors house but not yours, or when your house is on fire, they wet your neighbors house down so that your fire doesnt spread to tax payers. Also, fires grow exponentially out of control the longer it takes to deal with it so even if your house got a little on fire, them choosing to let the not tax payer house burn down cause them to spend more resources protecting the surrounding area instead of just putting out your fire. We're currently in a choice based system with healthcare and it SUCKS. Not everyone choose to get healthcare for whatever reason, usually financial, and they get sick which spreads to people who do choose to get healthcare. It would be better if no one had a choice and everyone got healthcare.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is your choice, but is your choice really of your own doing? For the longest time cigarettes were thought of as healthy and people smoked them without thinking about the consequences. Is their lung cancer their fault because they chose to smoke cigarettes? Sort of. Should there be a level of responsibility in the cigarette companies to not lie about their product and entice people to use their product because all they care about is money and not the health of their customers? Yes. There are some parents that start their children on coke very young, like 2 years old. Sugar is addictive. When that child grows up, sure, they're choosing to drink coke whenever they want, but they were forced into an addiction to it as a very young child. Should we not blame companies for not being more socially conscious of the damages that their product does on society both environmentally and in terms of long term health?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That kind of thinking is why we're always in these kinds of messes. The idea that everything is a personal problem instead of a systemic issue is how companies get away with skirting their responsibility. Beverage companies like Coke used to sell their products in glass bottles which was their responsibility to collect and recycle. It was environmentally sustainable but was expensive for the company. They ended up switching to plastic claiming, customers wanted it for it's convenience. When growing concerns for plastic's negative effect on the environment started spreading, know what they did? They made a famous ad. You might know it. It's known as the crying Indian ad. Yeah, that ad. The ad saying that the environmental problem that we're facing is because of you not choosing to recycle. The company decides to use plastic instead of the environmentally sustainable glass bottle and it's the consumer's fault for not handling the waste properly. Here's a documentary about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnWjG8H1Dg It shouldn't be the responsibility of every individual to stay informed. It should be the system's responsibility to no deceive the public. You've been convinced into taking on the responsibility of the system or company and you're taking it with a smile. I bet you never even knew that the crying indian ad was created by the beverage companies and that's ultimately the issue with being responsible with keeping yourself informed and accepting a deceptive system, you don't know what you don't know until someone tells you that you don't know it. How can you keep yourself informed when the system deceives you into believing you are informed?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Semantics is the core of any argument. Semantics is important in understanding an argument but arguing semantics is not the core of any argument. Arguing semantics is just a symptom of one or more parties not understand the other. In this case, you've misunderstood the concept of recycling and continued down that path of misunderstanding, formulating an argument that did not exist.  gt;Glass bottles are heavier making it more expensive to ship, bottle, and yes recover to be reused.  gt;Glass also is brittle, making unrecoverable bottles more likely and dangerous to boot, both in shipping and after sale to be reused, the danger broken glass presents to employees and customers notwithstanding.  gt;Glass is simply a more inconvenient product for the producer, the consumer, and whoever would reuse/recycle the material.  gt;Plastic isn't perfect but its superior to glass as a material in this case.  gt;The problem is glass and plastic are cheap, and people are too lazy to sort their stuff. All this is mostly correct. The only difference is that glass bottles are infinitely more reusable than plastic bottles. Plastic bottles do not get recycled into new plastic bottles due to the complexity of the different layers of plastics they're composed of. It is more accurate to say they get downcycled into other products and become less and less recyclable as they move through their life. Glass on the other hand is infinitely more recycling as they can be reused as the exact same container they are built for as long as they stay in good condition. Even when they're not kept in good condition, they have the qualities of being recycled into new products with less waste than the environmental impact of mining for fresh product. The initial investment of creating a glass bottle is higher than plastic but there comes a point of reuse where that bottle's existence will be more environmentally friendly than the plastic bottles it replaced.  gt;What, you expect each individual company to send their own trucks to each home to collect their used bottles? What degree of responsibility does the company have here? To a certain degree yes. Perhaps not personal trucks to collect, but they should definitely implement a system in which they can retrieve their custom bottles to be reused. Personal trucks is obviously not the answer and is hyperbole, but there are already recycling companies that handle pickups, and the companies are in the business of logistics of delivering their product, why can't they be responsible for the logistics of retrieving their product's waste as opposed to placing that burden on the consumer?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I want to be clear and say that I'm not against plastic usage, as you seem to be so strongly for it. I have no problem with companies using plastic. My concern is with companies making decisions on their product without concern for the full life cycle of their product.  gt;That might be the case for PCR, but PET is a thermoplastic so I'm not sure accurate that is. PET may need to be rehydrolized down to its monomers and repolymerized again though, and I don't recall where the numbers are on the energy that goes into making the monomers versus the polymerization. PET is infinitely recyclable just like glass but must go through a complex process for that to happen. Currently PET bottles, while infinitely recyclable, are being downcycled with the rest of the not PET plastics. Why? Probably because it's a cheaper process, and again, a decision made by the companies, not by the consumers who have no choice in the matter.  gt;I'd be interested in seeing numbers on that [Here](http://www.gpi.org/recycling/glass-recycling-facts) is a list of facts for recycled glass. Key note is that Glass is 100% recyclable and can be recycled endlessly without loss in quality or purity, Recycled glass can be substituted for up to 95% of raw materials, and Recycled glass is always part of the recipe for glass, and the more that is used, the greater the decrease in energy used in the furnace. This makes using recycled glass profitable in the long run, lowering costs for glass container manufacturers #8212;and benefiting the environment. While not hard numbers, if true, you can easily come to the conclusion that delivering and recycling used glass is cheaper than the cost of mining and delivering new raw glass materials, otherwise why would glass be recycled to begin with if it was cheaper to mine raw materials?  gt;but I think there's something overlooked here: even if plastic is downcycled, that reduces the need for fresh material for the products used in the downcycled market. It's not overlooked, it's just not taken seriously because downcycled plastic is just future trash plastic. Also, I personally don't see downcycled plastic as a reduce in need for fresh material because often times downcycled plastic is a symptom of our overwhelming issue with plastic trash. Often times when downcycled plastics are used it's because it is an attempt to find a use for what is already considered trash, but the issue is not that plastic isnt being recycled, it's that plastic's end of life currently is at the landfill at the end of the day. As you've stated PET is infinitely recyclable but it's not being recycled in that way. Glass is also infinitely recyclable but is also in high demand to be recycled because of how useful it is. If the proper systems were in place to recycle glass, we would not have any glass in the landfills because of how recyclable it is. Plastics are not at that level of recyclability and that is why we have shit tons of plastic waste. As I said in the beginning, I'm not against the use of plastic, my concern is that companies make decisions without full consideration of the entire life cycle of their product, waste included. It should be their responsibility as it curbs the usage of cheaper alternatives by skirting their responsibility for the full life cycle of their product. It's true that the consumer will do what the consumer will do and there's no way for the company to enforce the end user to recycle their product, but that's not a reason for a company to not assume the responsibility to handle the full life cycle of their product and create a system for consumers to take part in it. Whether they take part in it is up to them, but to not have a system at all fails the public in exchange for additional profits for the company.  gt;They're in the logistics of delivering their product to retailers though, not every end user. Again I reiterate what I said just above. They need to take responsibility for the full lifecycle of their product. They can partner with other companies to collect directly, or they can partner with retailers to take on collection, but either way, they need to be responsible for what happens to it. The move to plastic over glass should not have happened without an end of life strategy that could rival that of glass bottles in environmental sustainability. And I want to remind you that this argument is not about recycling, as it is in response to your original comment of individual responsibility to be informed. Individual responsibility pales in comparison to systemic responsibility because only with systemic responsibility can there really be large change in how we approach issues. No company should be able to create their product, not care about the waste, then tell the public they need to find a solution to the problem they've created. We should not be okay with companies not caring about the long term effects of their existence and saying that it's your personal responsibility to find out which companies dont give a shit about the issues they cause and boycott them. There shouldnt be any companies that are worth boycotting to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't choose to throw your assets together in a marriage, it is the default. Once married, all assets created post marriage is a shared asset. So unless you're assuming that during the 5 to 10 years no new assets would be created, there will always be shared assets to be split. So there goes your first theory. Now, there is the option of pre/post nup agreements of course, which already exists in the real world scenario to handle the splitting of assets in the event of a divorce, which is a predetermined agreement prior to a marriage, which throws out your second theory since there is already a method to handle such situations. The change to a 5-10 year marriage contract does not create the idea of predetermined asset splitting nor does it make that assumption that a pre/post nup would be built into the contract as there was no assumption that those contracts would no longer exist. Having such contracts built in would remove the concept of those contracts existing as a standalone option.</TEXT>

While yes kidneys and liver filter toxins from your body and detox means to remove or filter toxins, there is another perspective if you look at detoxing as a word meaning the general removal of bad things from your life/system. In this context it makes a lot more sense since much of the detoxing items that you ingest is marketed towards "fixing" or realigning gut biome to more healthy standards. This is something your kidney and liver wont do. Most ingesting detoxing item is like a health shake that you drink over the course of like 3 weeks, which would have an effect on your gut microbiome make up, which has scientifically been proven to have an effect on your cravings and eating habits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A direct source for any particular shake is not needed in this case because it's based on the idea that you can changed your gut flora based on what you eat. This idea IS backed by research which you can check out [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385025/) Once you accept that what you eat can affect your gut flora, and you already accept that gut flora has an effect on cravings and eating happens, it's not hard through transitive property into understanding that a shake can be made of healthy ingredients that make it convenient for the consumer to "detox" themselves with it. Now, does any specific shake do this? I don't know, and I dont really care to look into it. But my claim was never that there IS a shake that works, just that in theory a "detox" shake is possible in detoxing you in that context and in a way that your kidneys and liver doesnt. Is there a shake that currently exists that does it? That really depends on the manufacturer's ability to create a shake that actually works. Is it possible for them to make a shake that works in detoxing in that manner? Definitely, as backed by science. Is it any better at detoxing than just eating a healthy meal instead? Probably not if the shake is just a convenient way of eating a healthy meal but again, a detox shake is not about if it's the best or only way of detoxing, just that it can detox and is not something to just roll your eyes about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's not meant to be profound. It's meant to combat the idea that a detox shake is something to roll your eyes about just because you have a liver and kidneys as the original OP had posted. If someone was drinking a healthy shake that advertised as a detoxing product and worked after they've had a history of eating nothing but fast food, would you roll your eyes at them and tell them, "you know those shakes don't help you because you have a liver and kidney right?" Or would rain on their parade and say "why not just eat healthy instead of drinking those shakes?" Maybe you should just be happy that they're trying to eat healthier and "detox" their system in the way that they want to because it is in a way detoxing their system that a liver and kidney does not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Innocent until proven guilty. I'm contributing more than you by pointing out the propaganda you're spreading. The US has been known to commit war crimes for their own personal gain. Should we just assume every time the US does something that it's a war crime until it's proven not to be? Or are we going to say that we've already proven the US commits war crimes so now the onus is on them to prove that everything they do moving forward is not a war crime, and until they do, we will assume it is?</TEXT>

The US has tested 0.00415% of its population while the UK has tested 0.045% of its population. If you want to go by this per capita bullshit then the UK has done 10x more testing per capita then the US and has found "twice the cases per capita" compared to the US. Let that sink in. These aren't bullshit tests to pump up their testing numbers. Don't even try to spin the narrative that the two countries are anywhere near equal. And don't push that Trump bullshit mentality that the number of confirmed cases are low so it hasnt hit the US as hard. It's hit, you just dont know it. The US is fucked and you don't even realize it yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm new too. In the beginning the game is teaching you how to use the class you chose and all the other convoluted shit in this game. By the time you've explored the skills it has and how to use them in combination with each other, you'll get another class to choose from with new skills. By the time you get through all your class advancements is when things start taking 4 hits to kill instead of 1. This is where I'm at now. Decided to start a few other characters since each character has their own dailies so I might was well grow multiple characters at the same time. I feel I'm at the part where leveling is going to start getting annoying. My highest character is lv390. I still dont understand all the ways to advance equipment because there's no point in doing any of it on low level gear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did this quest. This one is annoying but essentially easy. Go to the map and make sure you're the first one/only one there. This forces the game to create the map for you. This is important because it gives you an estimate on what time you need to talk to the chronomancer master. Basically just afk for 2 hours and then start asking the chronomancer master every 5 minutes. It took me about 2:34 to get it. Remember to not leave the map or get disconnected. If you do, start your clock all over again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That only works if you start off assuming celebrities are nothing but attention whores. Imagine a world where you're only good at one thing, let's say playing video games. And you were able to taking playing video games into a lifestyle/career and make tons of money from it. Then a tragedy hits and your world is flipped. All you know how to do is play video games and entertain people. Would it be attention whoring for you to consider playing video games and entertaining people for free to get everyone's minds off the tragedy? Or would it just be doing what you know how to do in your own attempt to try and make things better because you don't know how to do anything else? Are you saying that those charity streams on twitch where people play to donate money to charity is attention whoring? I mean, why don't they just donate directly right? They dont need to add themselves getting attention into the mix. Must be their insatiable need to be an attention whore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, dont call it investing. You're not going to get a return on the money you put into it. Is it worth it to spend money on the game though? Depends on who you are and what you want to do with the game. Much of the game can be enjoyed without spending any money at all. Does that mean it's not worth it to spend any money? Not necessarily. If you enjoy the game enough, throwing a few bucks their way could make that experience more enjoyable. It all depends on who you are and how much you value your money. If you have to ask then you're probably not into the game enough to know whether spending money or not is right for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but two people wearing a mask isnt what's part of this discussion, only 1 person wearing a mask vs 0. The effectiveness of this comparison depends who is infected. If the infected person is wearing a mask, yeah it's more effective. If the infected person is not wearing a mask, its not more effective. This is what "masks dont protect you, they protect others from you" means. And in the scope of the discussion of protecting yourself, you wearing a mask is not more effective than not wearing a mask because wearing a mask doesnt protect you... other people wearing a mask protects you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they're your business partner and you're giving them the keys to the private lives of all your children then there's reason to believe 1, you trust them to some extent, and 2, you need them to have the keys to the private lives of all your children for some reason since why would you give it to them in the first place? and if that's the case, even if they've proven to screw you over and exploit you, wouldnt the correct response to not take away their key but to actually make the key have restrictions on usage? Like it only works if you're physically watching them? Or it only works during business hours? Something along those lines...  gt;Obviously you shouldn't give them the keys and just trust they will behave when there is already proof they don't behave. Sure, but the answer isnt to not give them access at all. In order for this scenario to make sense there has to be a reason that you need them to have such access, otherwise such access would never have been granted to begin with. So assuming you have a need for them to have access and they've proven to exploit you, that doesnt change the fact that you still need them to have access for whatever reason, so to meet both requirements of 1. giving them access and 2. preventing them from exploiting you, isn't the correct solution to give them access that is restricted to your specifications? And wouldnt you want to extend those restrictions to any other current or future business partner who needs similar access in the event that they too are partners willing to exploit you but have yet to do so? Wait... that sounds exactly like creating stricter laws/regulations around data gathering and privacy...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What laws or regulations will prevent the Chinese government from getting information from the Chinese owned business tik tok? That's for the lawmakers to decide. You do know that's an entire branch of government right? Just because you can't think of a solution doesnt mean the solution is to just fuck it all to hell. We dont create laws that target one specific citizen, one specific race, one specific gender, or one specific age and we shouldnt create laws that target one specific anything, including country. Laws are rules we put in place for how we deal with specific situations and when someone finds a loophole in it, the solution isnt to leave the loophole in and ban the person who exploited it. We close the loophole so no one else can exploit it.  gt;You do know the Chinese government regularly abducts billionaires and who ever they want to get what they want out of them right? Irreverent to the conversation of what we should be doing on domestic soil. If you're concerned with the inaction of our government when faced with abductions of US citizens on US soil by a foreign agent then we have bigger issues in our government.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being "just a game" is not really a thing. A game is a set of rules often with conditions regarding success or failure of a challenge. When people argue "just a game" they're implying that there is no consequences to success or failure in said challenge, imparting their values of success or failure onto others when they have no right to. Anyone can make such an argument with anything and they would be wrong to do so. You lost your job? It's just a job. You lost your girlfriend? It's just a girlfriend. You lost this argument? It's just an argument. Just because something is not very important to you doesn't mean it's equally not very important to everyone else, and your inability to understand that shows you lack the ability to empathize with others.

    <TEXT>I use these leashes too but I don't let it unravel more than I need it to while Im keeping my attention on my dog at all times. The problem with these leashes are basically what you see in this video. The potential to pull you hard... And if you think you're strong and can stop it, think of what it's doing to your dog instead of you. It can cause serious injury to your dog if it was moving quickly and suddenly forced to stop. The other issue is that leash laws are usually restricted to 6ish feet so while attached, if extended beyond 6 feet, you can be cited. Another issue is when the dog poops or pees, if you're not paying attention and the dog extends out and circles around, there's a good chance you're getting poop or pee on the leash. The further out the leash is extended the less control you have over the dog. It's ok controlling your dog from moving directly forward since it extends and retracts based on that distance but if the dog rushes any other direction for whatever reason there's going to be a slight difference so if you notice your dog dart in a different direction and try to lock it right away, there's going to be a period of loose leash followed by a hard stop for your dog, which again is not good for the dogs health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Beggars can't be choosers. I used to agree with this saying but now I don't and I hate it soo much. Beggars can and should be choosers. Saying beggars can't be choosers is dehumanizing beggars. It's like if you took a bite out of a sandwich and hated it so you decide to give it to the bum sitting outside thinking beggars can't be choosers, he will be greatful for my scraps. Or like... Donating expired canned foods to the food bank thinking beggars can't be choosers, exp date doesn't necessarily mean it's gone bad, maybe they can check and make use of it... When in reality doing this just makes more work for the charity in having to sort, filter, and throw out. In fact, the process of donating canned food is kind of fucked in general if you think about it. When people donate canned food, do you think most people are going out to buy canned foods specifically to donate? Or is it more likely that the people donating are getting rid of the canned foods they bought but decided they didn't like the taste or quality of it so now they have extra. What's the point of donating foods you've determined are subpar for your standards other than expecting those receiving the foods to have lower standards than you when it comes to food and nutrition. What ends up happening is food banks get and overabundance of what the general public considers lesser quality of canned goods and none of the essential staples that we all need. Watch this video on why beggars should be choosers. https://youtu.be/dLVSKx8Wl70</TEXT>

The current US government is definitely not looking out for its citizen's best interest and it's questionable if it ever has considering the lack of social services in comparison to other countries right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is an easy way to know with a standardized system that allows for no one to be confused about who they are hiring though... It's that each actor has to have a unique stage name. Why further complicate the process by removing this standardization and requiring the people with the money to have to work harder to ensure they don't make a mistake? Hair color might be different, or it might not. There's no standard that says anyone with the same name needs a unique hair color, or eye color, or unique anything. So now you need to cross reference all these POSSIBLE unique identifiers with another list of data that indicates what is unique about the person you want to hire vs the others who have the same name. Just nip it at the bud and reduce the data bloat.</TEXT>

Just wondering if I could ever do the same if I decide to visit Taiwan. She said it took 7 days and they stayed at the military worker's houses that maintain the roads or something like that. They also had a military personnel guide the entire way. Might be cool to retrace her steps if it was still possible even if the program no longer exists.</TEXT>

Maybe put more regulations on the creators to not rape the world's resources expecting others to invest in solving the problems you create.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably not, but that's not what's going on here. If you stole from Target, your face will be on TV if they didnt catch you. Here, we have Nancy Pelosi not wearing a mask, which is violating a rule. While it's different from stealing, I personally feel publish-ability is on the same level when you ask what the purpose of publishing it is. In the case of you stealing, it's to inform the public of how you wronged the store or public. Same thing with not wearing the mask during a time when everyone should be wearing a mask in this instance. With that said, I don't think it's the lack of mask that's really the issue here for me personally. Supposedly this is a store that's closed to the public that Nancy Pelosi special ordered them to open and do her hair. Because it was not open to the public, I feel it's not really a public space in this case, though debatable since there has to be someone to do her hair. It would be the same as if she hired a private stylist to come to her house and do her hair... would she or the stylist be required to wear a mask in such an instance? I think the bigger crime against the public is that she called the store to open up just for her when there was an ordinance to keep all salons closed. It just has that, "I'm better than the general public" vibe that I dont like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I once dreamed that I met someone and had a whole life with them, family and everything but then towards the end realized it was a dream and had to say goodbye to her. When I woke up I felt extreme sadness like I lost someone I knew all my life. I wanted to go back but I couldn't. Now every time I sleep I hope to go back. It was real to me.</TEXT>

That indisputable fact only points to the likeliness of the song being in relation to the Nazi philosophy. It does not lend to being evidence for or against the philosophy. Remember that he WAS a literal Nazi and he USED TO write racist songs. You could easily say "I Saw the Sign" was a song about turning a new leaf in regards to the Nazi philosophy.</TEXT>

TikTok is harvesting data because it is integrated in how the app works. Same as Facebook, same as Google. If you have a problem with harvesting data, put in regulations to stop it that all companies need to follow. Banning TikTok for doing something every other company does makes it look a lot like you're reasoning is because you're racist against Chinese people/companies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thought that Tencent owning 10% of reddit gives it controlling interest in how it operates despite 30-35% of it is still being owned by a singular US publication company shows how biased you are.

There's no point in continuing if you've already made up your mind. Now I see your original inquiry was made in bad faith. Come back when you want to actually learn and improve your worldview.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're a professional then everyone you interact with while under a professional setting deserves to be treated professionally. It's not about the specifics of who you interact with that decides whether you treat that person professionally, it's your character as a professional that decides that, and if you've set up a situation under the guise of professionalism and then not act professionally, that makes you an asshole. A simple example of this for better understanding is to imagine yourself as a retail worker. It doesn't matter who the customer is or what they've done. As a professional employee you're expected to act professional regardless of the setting. You don't deserve to be treated like shit by the customer, but that doesnt give you the right to not be professional nor does it dictate whether that customer deserves or not deserves to be treated professionally by you. Any misstep you decide to take is a failure on your part as there is an expectation for you to be professional in all but the worst situations... and even in the worst of situations, the proper way to deal with such situations professionally would be to excuse yourself from the situation, removing yourself entirely instead of confronting and causing friction. Bottom line is that if you're a professional, everyone deserves to be treated professionally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Uh, how? Because I can't think of any other scenario where that's how believing in things with zero evidence works. That's because you come in already believing there is zero evidence. Change religion to a conspiracy theory and it's easy to see how. People have been converting to antivaxxers, flat earthers, anti moonlanders for a while now and they have tons of "evidence" to back their reasoning for conversion. It's not that hard to see a conversion to religion once you expel the notion that there's zero evidence. As long as you hold strong to that idea though, you'll never understand.

So you start from zero, as is the default when ever you learn of a new idea, and you listen to the arguments for it. Only by your default, and that's the problem in the failure of your ability to understand other people's reasoning that don't fall into the same logical reasoning as you. You're explaining your process of reasoning with the information you come into contact with in the world.

    <TEXT> gt; I don't believe that most people who believe in gods believe in them just because they will believe anything, though. Maybe I'm optimistic but I'd argue that most people who believe in gods do think they have a reason (other than 'just because') for believing in them. That goes against your original claim. You stated that there has to be evidence and there is only one way to produce/believe in such evidence, yet you side with original OP who claims that believers have zero evidence and still chooses to believe as stated below.  gt;Because I can't think of any other scenario where that's how believing in things with zero evidence works. My point is that believers have their own evidence to believe. Thinking they have no evidence is why original OP doesnt understand believers. The evidence they choose to believe is evidence enough and that exists outside your rules of reasoning which you've stated in a previous reply.  gt;the conversation begins from establishing that a belief is justified by argument and/or experiment. I really don't see how there is any other way to argue anything if we're meant to be able to understand one another. This is not a conversation on arguing the merits one's belief. This is a discussion on understanding how one can come to such a conclusion. You don't need to agree with someone's reasoning, you just need to understand that it exists and is different from yours. THAT is how original OP can understand the situation and failure to do so will always result in original OP's inability to understand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but if they want to have a conversation where we try to understand each other instead of just acknowledging that we both exist, then it's time to bring in the reasons for belief. No one in this thread or the original question wants this.  gt;Redditors who were atheists but now believe in God, what changed your mind? This is just a question about why they exist... in other words acknowledge their existence. No one is asking a believer to convert anyone, only to give reason for their existence.  gt;These threads never make any sense.  gt;Every story is inevitably just "the idea of an empty indifferent universe started to scare me and I needed some comfort so I started believing in [x].."  gt;Uh, how? Because I can't think of any other scenario where that's how believing in things with zero evidence works. You can't just self-awaredly choose to believe in something while knowing you're only doing so to comfort yourself.. This is a post about someone not understanding how someone exists beyond that one example they gave. Again, this is not a conversation about someone proving their faith.  gt;I can understand an argument with which I disagree, of course. It just has to be an argument, not just an assertion. If it's just an assertion, it has equal value to any other assertion that is made without basis - ie, none. It has no value to you, which is fine. No one is claiming that their reasoning is meant to convince you of anything. This is not about how you value another person's reasoning. This is about another person having the ability to reason in their own way.  gt;I don't think original OP was saying to no believer has an argument for their faith, either. It was specifically about the claim that people choose to believe because it's comforting. I never said original OP was saying no believers has an argument for their faith. I said original OP said/believes that believers have NO EVIDENCE for their faith. Specifically though, original OP is saying that the only reason believers choose to believe is because it is comforting (as you've stated) which can only be true under the understanding that there is NO EVIDENCE. Again, this is about a believer believing there is no evidence, which I think is false. It is not the only way to view the situation. You can very much believe that the evidence provided to believers is sufficient enough for them to believe without the notion that the decision to believe is not driven by the feeling of comfort. And this is where I believe you fail to understand the situation. The idea of evidence being sufficient enough.  gt;This would be something I could also say, because I don't understand the concept of "choosing" to believe, either. I personally can't choose to believe or not believe something. My degree of agreeing with a statement is not determined by me consciously. I do not know what that experience would even be like. I know what changing my mind about something feels like, but that's not me changing my opinion - it's not under my control. Take any complex idea that's beyond your understanding. You believe it to be true because there's science to back it up, but in reality that science is beyond your understanding. You accept it to be true and so what you understand is evidence enough for you to choose to believe it as truth. Some people have a lower threshold for what they choose to accept as evidence enough. Again, we are not discussing whether their threshold is an acceptable level of evidence to convince you to believe. This is not a discussion on the merits of their belief nor is it about their ability to convince you. This is a discussion on their ability to exist. The inability to accept that a person's threshold may be lower than yours is why you and original OP don't understand how someone like that can exist, and until you realize in that possibility, you will NEVER understand how someone like that can exist without the reasoning being "because it makes me feel comfort". The best way to understand this however, is to flip the roles and "be in their shoes". In this case, you will be in the position of someone who has the lower threshold of acceptable evidence. Go back to that complex idea that's beyond your understanding. Accept that the highest level of information is beyond your understanding. Now, someone who can understand that highest level walks in and says pretty much what you said, "I don't understand how you can CHOOSE to believe that for reasons beyond it being comforting to you." Can you imagine that now? Can you imagine your vehemently belief in something like string theory because you feel there's adequate evidence for such a belief and not because it is comforting, and then some proponent of loop quantum gravity comes in and claims that he doesnt understand how you can believe in string theory without understanding the math and science behind it?  gt;By this point I think our difference is that I assume that when people speak about things that can be taken as fact claims, I automatically evaluate them as such, and further assume that they meant to start a conversation that is not one sided. Of course, sometimes people speak just to be heard and without a desire for further conversation. In that case, the standard by which I would agree or not agree with them is irrelevant. This. You and original OP assumed that the original question is asking for a discussion. No where in the original question was it asking to be convinced by a believer, only asking why a believer believes. Original OP claimed that there is only one solution to such an answer because they've made the assumption that a believer knowingly is only doing it for comfort reasons. My point is that that is not the only reason for a believer to exist and your, mine, and anyone else's criticism of a believer's level of acceptable evidence threshold is irrelevant to the discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because firing him doesnt really fix the problem. Hungry guy who can't afford to eat is going to eat food put in front of him. Yes, you've gotten rid of one hungry guy, but what about the second? The solution is to pay them a fair wage that they can survive off of and/or give them free food so they don't eat the customer's. This is coming from a semi germaphobe. Knowing that there's a system out there where this is possible makes me fearful that it's only a matter of time for it to happen again. I'd much rather have a system that fixes the issue than one that scares people into submitting because I know that there will also be someone who will overcome that fear to take the chance of having a little nibble if they feel they need it.</TEXT>

Then we're in an ethical dilemma where people on both sides can take the side of being right and that's where civil war happens because then you have people who said it's not definitive so we should do the right thing and continue business as usual while the other side will say that business as usual means the election is stolen.</TEXT>

The game's story is built on the fate of one of the characters in CT that was left unexplained as well as mentioned how all the characters of CT affected the story. That's a sequel.

    <TEXT>So I guess you consider Star Wars 7 a spiritual successor to Star Wars 6 and not a sequel because it no longer follows Luke's Journey? Even though they share the same universe. Even though the story line is connected. Even though characters from the previous exist in the new one. Even thought 7 can be enjoyed as a stand alone without the need to watch 6. You don't need to google search how the games are related unless you've never played CT because CC summarizes what happens in CT (deep in the game). The fact that the game feels completely independent of CT's story is exactly why it is such a letdown. You don't realize how connected it is until you get deep into the game and once you do you see how connected they really are. Cross exists only because of the events of Trigger. Story wise, without Trigger, there would be no Cross.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It has nothing to do with personalities. A crewmate that is trying to deceive their own team is not playing the game as intended and expected. The game isn't about deception for everyone, only the imposter. For the other team, the game is about finding the truth and a crewmate deceiving their own team does not lend to the progress of finding the truth. It is this game's version of griefing and griefing by nature ruins the game for everyone else, including the imposter as he's not given the opportunity to play his role and work towards his goals when someone else hands it to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can want all you want but people will do what they do. Shunning someone who speaks up about people doing bad things because he does bad things only stops those people from speaking up in the future, hence you're advocating that there should be less people speaking up. You're gatekeeping the act of speaking up to only those who don't do bad things and that's a very small amount of people. I don't know about you but I think more awareness of speaking up against bad things is always better than less, but that's just my take on it.</TEXT>

You're using a scenario that isn't happening as reason to shun the good effects of what is happening. You're actively sabotaging the good because you believe the bad outweighs it thinking that by doing so the bad will stop but it won't. All you did was sabotage the good for no value and corrupted the chance of future good to come until someone is pure enough to do it.</TEXT>

Since the game is focused around different players and how they interact with the game, the variation it needs is different players, which means among us is infinitely varied. Since the focus of fun in Fall guys is not really who you're playing with but more about the environment you're all playing in, it needs varied games/maps which is considerably more limited than infinitely varied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, it's not focused on 60 players and how they interact. A majority of the maps are solo elimination maps (as in your elimination is dependent on you completing the requirements and not on the other people preventing you from completing the requirements). You might have a case for the game being focused on your competitors when talking about the team games, but ultimately your focus is as a single person winning the run so team games are more of an annoyance towards your goal to the crown since you can't really depend on them, especially in the case of how random your team's skill might be. The 59 other players you play against is for the most part inconsequential to you because your enemy in the game is majoritively the stage, time, and randomness. In fact all the final rounds end after a specific amount of time if the goal isn't met and everyone still alive gets a crown, further cementing the idea that your opponent is the game, not the other players. Among Us variation limitation is your friends. If you don't have enough friends, the game isn't that fun, but that's something you can control. You can get more friends to play Among Us, you can't get more stages to play Fall Guys, making Among Us variations infinite, where as Fall Guys variations are limited to the developers will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's exactly my point. Death by car accident is not murder. There is an absolute definition of murder and calling things that fall outside that absolute definition murder would degrade the concept and definition of murder. Death by car accident is not "close enough" to murder that we should let it slide when people call it murder. Edit: If you're going to edit your comment to include a quote from me, at least quote the entire statement so it's not taken out of context.  gt;It is like saying we shouldn't correct people who say accidentally killing a person with your car is murder because while technically correct that it's manslaughter and not murder, it's definitely murder in what we typically think of as murder since no one ever thinks of manslaughter. You're quoting what a hypothetical person who is calling manslaughter murder would say to justify allowing manslaughter to be called murder, which you've admitted to as being an insufficient argument, which is exactly what I'm saying and why calling a technically not vegan burger a vegan burger is wrong.</TEXT>
