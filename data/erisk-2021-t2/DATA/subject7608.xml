    <TEXT>You can't just copy another country's system and expect it to yield the same results over here. If a player in Chelsea's academy is good enough to be playing at those levels why don't they just loan them out, as Chelsea have done a lot of recently? They will still be playing at that level against professionals. Nobody is begrudging the young Chelsea players that I'm sure have worked very hard while playing great football for the fact they've got to the semi-final. People are just annoyed at the fact they are in the competition in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If there's nothing wrong with a trophy for semi-pro clubs, I don't see why there should be an issue with a trophy for smaller professional clubs. The larger professional clubs have the Champions League, so why can't smaller professional clubs have the Checkatrade Trophy? Unless you want to let Luton into the Champions League group stages?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, but that would be extremely flimsy reasoning for ever actually allowing B teams in the footballing pyramid. Historic and well supported clubs getting relegated because Chelsea don't want some centre-half that's never going to play for them to be told to clear his lines when whoever is there manager for that year wants them playing out from the back. In my opinion the biggest thing holding back young English players is the fact that their own teams aren't giving them chances in their own first teams because of their own interests, which for a club like Chelsea is always short-term success with very little interest at all in developing young English players. Sure, they have a lot of really fantastic young English players, but there is no push to have them in the first team. That's not universal among the big clubs. A team like Man Utd balances it well, and takes pride in academy players making the first team like Lingard and Rashford, but Chelsea seem like they couldn't care less.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree the FA should do everything it can to support the development of young English talent, as well as it should do everything it can to maintain the integrity of the professional football system in England. To say that the aim of the FA is to promote young English talent via the Checkatrade trophy is a myth that was exposed when they fined a host of lower league teams for doing just that, promoting and giving experience to young English talent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure there are many benefits to the B team system, and I'm sure in league systems where there isn't as well-established lower league professional system it is less disruptive to implement. Specifically in England though, for me and many fans, the sporting integrity is far far far more important than national team success. And personally I think if a club wants to control how many first team minutes a player gets they should pay them in their first team, but just because there's no path to the first team for young English players at Chelsea, that doesn't mean historical, professional clubs should be financially bullied out the league system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Winning when not playing well, happy days. Scunthorpe, like a lot of teams in this division, have a decent foundation and decent players but don't have the clinical striker to reward their efforts. Whereas Hylts, Collins, Lee and Shinnie are all clinical and Cornick is improving that part of his game by the day. Think we'll struggle the rest of the season without Rea and hopefully get a decent replacement in January. Thought our fullbacks did well, great assist from Justin and Stacey's running was good to relieve pressure. Their decision making is great and Justin's set pieces create chances every game. Seems to be a tactic to go high and far post and get the knock down and see what happens.</TEXT>

He's given the club a style on the pitch that carries through to the youth, he's streamlined the squad, got us promoted, he really connects with the supporters. I think fans think about things like projects and stuff that but he's there every day and can probably see even with promotion Luton wouldn't be able to match Stokes potential.

When he came here he was very open about how the crowd needed re-educating as Luton fans were very impatient, groaning at every misplaced pass and generally creating a tense and negative atmosphere of we weren't winning by 20 minutes.

    <TEXT>Starting to worry that MH's inflexibility with regards to selection might limit us in the run-in. Potts on and JJ into midfield sorta might make sense away from home but I feel like at home against a team like Gillingham we should be taking the initiative and making changes around 60-70, getting LuaLua, Moncur, Cornick, Cummings on and going for it. Don't think Lee has looked great since coming back into the team. I feel like with Hylts and Collins up top, we need somebody with more creativity/ingenuity at the head of the diamond to make things happen. Teams have started to defend us in wide positions better, limiting times JJ and Stacey can bomb forward so we need more from the middle but only Shinnie is producing it at the moment. The short of it is I feel like we've become very predictable and not very adaptable. Jones was braver than Harford with tactical and personnel changes, which didn't always work but more often than not did. Sorry if that reads very rambley.</TEXT>

It's pretty clear that a large chunk of your team, as it stands, aren't able to competently play Jones' diamond. I'm sure Stoke have a list the length of the Doomsday Book of players they want to sign, but the challenge will probably be offloading your current lot. Even if Jones gets everybody he wants in, it'll still take half a season for them all to adapt to the system.

You'll never get rid of fans like that; we're top of the league our first season after being promoted to it and you get fans shouting, groaning and they even starting booing one of our players for looking as if he was going to take it into the corner in the last minute when we were winning (which he didn't even do, instead creating a goal). But the general atmosphere did improve once some people caught on to what Jones was trying to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could make a case for Luke O'Nien and their keeper, I think. Luke O'Nien probably suffered a bit in the voting because as far as I know he's played right back and midfield throughout the season (Sunderland fans will correct me if I'm wrong), and because it's voted for by managers maybe some voted for him in defense and some in midfield, if that makes sense. I might be wrong. And their keeper has been decent but Davies for Barnsley is the best keeper I've seen this year, might have been close though.</TEXT>

Most the comments I see online about Luton are about the train station, which is admittedly shit, or about the bus station which hasn't existed for a decade. Even places nearby like Stevenage and Hemel are no better than Luton.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh wow, that's a lot of hypotheticals for half 6 in the morning haha. I don't believe God could change his mind and say that black people are immoral. I don't think God would mislead us, either. You could argue that allowing us to be mislead by Satan is I'm effect misleading us but I believe that God will give somebody every opportunity to resist the temptation to be mislead. No God cannot command and do immoral things. He might do things that from our perspective seem bad if held to a person's personal standard but the very nature of God is that He is perfect, so not immoral. You don't have to believe in Him to grasp the logic that if He DOES exist, He can't be immoral. And yeah I'm sure people do believe God told them to kill people and they believe that what they did was moral. Personally I don't believe it would happen. Jesus was pretty clear about how to treat others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The logic is that just because He might do something you might not like, that doesn't mean that it is immoral. It might appear immoral from your perspective, but I'm saying that if God does exist, and is the creator of all things, He's the authority on morality and what He does cannot be immoral, by His very nature. It's just whether you believe that or not. You obviously don't, which is fair enough. But the debate here is "if He does exist, can he be immoral." And I believe not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess the disagreement is in whether or not you think something God does, with Him knowing everything that has ever happened before it and everything that will happen after it and because of it, is immoral. I don't believe He, as the author of morality, can act immorally. You disagree, which is fair enough. God can totally seem like a dick from our perspective, but our perspective is very limited. Ignoring the fact that Jesus made it pretty clear His position on murder, if He now ordered a murder and it was absolutely Him, then yes it would be moral because if He is the arbitrator of what's moral then it follows what He does is moral. Again, we don't have to like it. If there is no God morality is relative anyway, and morality can change from one person to another. So somebody might murder somebody and it would be moral to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's all over the place but using very emotive hypotheticals doesn't change the fact that if you have the very notion of am omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent God, who exists eternally and created everything, that whatever He wills is moral. God gives life and he takes it away, He owes us nothing. And God IS immune to the current normal definitions of good and bad, which can change generation to generation. You can talk about killing babies all day but that doesn't change the logic that if there is a God, He doesn't need to justify Himself to anybody. And I think Spoons is quite reasonably priced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems a bit much but looking at them individually I can see how each has a shout for being in the team. Davies is the best goalkeeper I've seen against Luton this season. Pinnock the best centre back. Mowatt controlled the game when Barnsley's midfield dominated us at their place. I'm not sure about Moore. He's quality no doubt but he's been injured for ages. Lyle Taylor should be there. And whenever teams like this come out people always say oh what about X player from my team, and I could argue the case for another 5 Luton players to be in there.

    <TEXT>I've seen the thing about Rutter coming in being suggested as a potential reason for our improved form and performances in October going into November fairly often this season, but for me the main thing that I saw as the reason for it was JJ getting the left back spot from Potts. As much as I like Potts I think JJ is a better footballer in pretty much every area and his coming into the team really helped to balance the team with the formation we play, which was over-reliant on Stacey before that. Teams had way more to think about with fullbacks marauding down both sides rather than primarily just the right. Whereas before they might have doubled up on the right, they now had more to think about on both sides, and if they pulled wide more to try and prevent our fullbacks getting forward as much this just gave more space to Pelly, Shinnie and Lee in the midfield to use to hurt teams. Master tactician I am not but hopefully how I saw this makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I'm a big fan of Potts too and think he's a great left back at League One level, and perfectly adept at playing in the Chapionship. I was conscious my post looked a bit anti-Potts when it wasn't intended that way. I do think his League Two season wouldn't have been replicated this year though. In League Two he was the main goal point of our set pieces because Sheehan took them and Potts was better at attaching them than Cuthbert, Mullins or Rea which played CB a lot that year. This year our best player for that is Bradley so Potts wouldn't have had the same impact.</TEXT>

He won't get a lot of first team games his first year but training day in, day out with top class players does wonders for your development regardless of playtime, but Leicester have also been doing well with young English players recently so I can see why it appeals to him. Think he's by far got the highest potential at the club, so it stings and I don't think we have anybody near his ability to replace him so hopefully we get Bola in as he looks like a really decent pickup. Maybe use the JJ money to convince Stacey to sign.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>EDIT: Thanks for the replies I've had so far, I'm really grateful. I think there's a bit of a consensus which helps a lot in confirming my initial thoughts of it being odd! I would still be really interested in knowing if somebody doesn't think it's that strange though! Hello! I've recently become engaged after proposing to my girlfriend, now fianc #233;e, and we've started planning for our wedding next year. We contacted the pastor we'd like to marry us, and we arranged a meeting to discuss things as he isn't the pastor of the church we attend, as we're going to get married in her parents church in her hometown. During the meeting we spoke about our lives and journey with faith, we spoke about pre-marriage counselling which we're both excited to start and also we spoke about certain books that are helpful. He then said the only thing he asks of couples he marries is that they remain sexually pure and that we affirm this during our wedding ceremony. Remaining sexually pure until after marriage isn't a problem whatsoever, but my question is about affirming sexual purity during the ceremony itself. It did sound odd when he says it but neither me or my fianc #233;e questioned it at the time, but in our discussions afterwards she said that she feels it's inappropriate to bring that up at our wedding, and having thought about it I agree. I've been to a few weddings and it's never been brought up, and I never felt like the ceremonies were missing an affirmation of sexual purity. So my question really is just about people's thoughts on affirming sexual purity during a wedding ceremony. Has anybody seen that before? Does anybody think it's a good/bad idea? Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's pretty much my thoughts. I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of my sexual purity, and I don't mind anybody in my life knowing, let alone those closest to me and my fianc #233;e. I just thought it's a strange thing to bring up really, and might make it a bit awkward. Thanks for your reply!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that was my initial thought. Not the notion of sexual purity but just touching on it during the ceremony might be a bit weird in the room on the day. I just didn't think it was necessary and I think people seem to agree, which is reassuring. Thanks for your reply!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came to Christ in my later life, at 24, and I'm 27 now. The sexual purity he's talking about is just between me and my partner, I believe, sorry if that wasn't totally clear. Me and my fianc #233;e did talk about a possible misunderstanding but we're seeing him again in a few weeks so will broach the subject then when our thoughts about it are clear and on the same page. It might just be something he was asking us then in the meeting, not something he wants to talk about in the ceremony. I think he just thinks that is something beautiful and with celebrating, but everybody seems to disagree haha. Thank you for your reply.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, thanks for your reply. I thought about that, but my fianc #233;e thinks that he would marry people that had been sexually active before, but would require them to not engage sexually until marriage from asking him. I don't have a problem with him asking that privately as something he requires when agreeing to marrying people, I think that's his perrogative and we don't have to agree. It's addressing it in the ceremony I'm meh about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Acts 15:8-9 So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us, and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Our hearts are made pure and we are sanctified by the Grace of God. I believe this Grace is what leads us to desire to grow to be more Christ-like, desiring to be like the only person to live as a human and have a totally pure heart, Jesus. Just because our hearts are made pure as a gift from the Holy Spirit, I don't think that means we should be complacent. I think the gift needs to be nurtured with regular reading of Scripture, prayer, fellowship with your brothers and sisters in Christ, spiritual disciplines like fasting and through Holy Communion etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just from a UK perspective. I'm on the left side of the political spectrum for fiscal issues and a bit all over the place on social issues, but I don't really 'support' a single political party. It seems to be a very different atmosphere here compared to the US, where religion and politics seem interlaced to an unhealthy degree. I liked Tim Farron when he was the leader of the Lib Dems and hated how the press went after him about his opinion on homosexual marriage in a way they rarely do to any other politician about any topic, despite him separating his politic beliefs from his faith. Generally I try to remain a floating voter, but with the ideals that the party I vote for is the one most likely to improve the lives of the working and middle classes. If there was a strongly pro-life party I would consider voting for them depending on other policies, but pretty much all parties here are pro-choice, with the exception of a few individuals. Would be very interested to see what other UK Christians think if there's any reading this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why not a ferris wheel in Westminster Abbey? A carousel in St. Pauls? There's far better ways to showcase the roof of the Cathedral that don't distract and detract from the beauty of the building, both physically and spiritually. Between this, the golf course inside Rochester Cathedral and Ely Cathedral flying a Pride flag, I do wonder what Anglicans make of the priorities of the people leading their Church. Nothing against helter skelters though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't see a problem with the Cathedral flying the pride flag outside, but teaching from the Bible, which teaches unequivocally that homosexuality is sinful, inside? Whatever your opinions are on faith or pride, it's pretty obvious that if a church is flying a pride flag that it has completely betrayed it's own beliefs in supporting a lifestyle that it also believes will lead people towards hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a church to stand in support of homosexuality lifestyles is for a church to stand in direct opposition to God. It's blasphemy. They care more about pleasing people then pleasing God. And no, I'm not saying Anglicanism should be openly hostile to gay people and ban them from churches etc. Churches should absolutely be inclusive and love everybody, but loving somebody doesn't and shouldn't meant to support their sinful lifestyle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Buttons, fabric, food etc. These are ceremonial laws. Applicable to the ancient nation of Israel which no longer exists. Common misconception but irrelevant to the topic. As for the rest of it, you've not really said anything I disagree with but you've not really adressed anything I said in the previous comment either. I didn't say Christians shouldn't love their neighbours who are gay - I said they should not positively affirm homosexual lifestyles. And you're absolutely right on that Jesus/God wouldn't care if a church was supporting a sinner. Flying a pride flag isn't supporting a sinner, it is supporting sin. You can see how a church supporting sin is antithetical to Biblical Christianity?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean frankly, you have to be willfully obtuse to believe that homosexuality is not considered sinful in the Bible and in God's eyes. Paul writes in his epistles that it is sinful, which is in the NT. Jesus, despite being extremely counter-cultural in his age never once challenges the cultural norm that homosexuality is wrong but even goes as far as the affirm God's design for marriage to be between a man and a woman, and that sexual acts outside of a marriage are immoral, and therefore sin. I'm not arguing that it's an especially bad sin and that I'm super hateful and against ga people etc. It's a sin like divorce is a sin, like anger is a sin, like sex between heterosexuals outside of marriage is a sin. I do accept that it will happen and I don't want to force adults to do one thing and not another, but to be free to make those decisions themselves, even if I believe they shouldn't... but to bring this conversation back around to what it is about, I don't think the church should therefore fly a gay pride flag. Not should it fly a proud divorcee flag or a I love being angry flag or a theft is okay flag.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not saying the church should not be tolerant, I'm saying it should not be actively supporting lifestyles that are in direct opposition to what it should be teaching inside. Tolerance =\= support. The whole Bible is Jesus revealing himself to His people but even if you only look at the red letters and what Jesus taught in His ministry it's clear that homosexuality is a sin. He says in Matthew 15 that sex outside of marriage defiles a man. He says very strongly in Matthew 19 that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's not hard to see that homosexuality is sinful. Not anymore sinful than adultery or sex outside of marriage between heterosexual people, but sinful nonetheless. I'd be making the same point if the church was flying a "have sex before marriage" flag. This is in the backdrop of a Jewish culture, which Jesus was a part of, that considered homosexuality to be immoral, and he never challenged that but reaffirmed the norm with regards to sex and marriage. Jesus' view was love everybody and be compassionate to everybody, but it was not actively support sinful lifestyle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had this problem for a while, too. I tried to force myself to pray aloud on occasion and I found that I was focusing far too much on things like choosing the right words and not sounding silly that I was putting little to thought into who I was praying to, why I was praying and it just rang hollow. I still don't pray out loud most home groups I go to. What I do though, is I pray silently to myself at the start asking the Holy Spirit to help centre myself and clear my head of anything distracting and I let the Spirit guide me, and if I feel prompted to pray something out loud that I feel somebody in the group needs to hear, I will, but mostly I don't. It also depends on the sizes of the groups. Sometimes we split into smaller groups of 3 and I'll pray aloud in that scenario more often than not but in larger groups I try to only say what I feel I'm being prompted to say, keeping other prayers between me and God. So my advice is don't force it, but if you feel prompted to say something it might be because somebody in the group needs to hear it, so try to put the anxiety aside and go for it, but if you can't don't feel bad. God will understand!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've already jumped from "faith schools and religious families" to "cult and fundamentalist family/group", which sort of shows your own bias in conflating the two. If it is as you say, and these sophisticated systems of brainwashing exist and are wide spread, surely there a study I can look at to inform me more about them? I don't think it's an unreasonable ask. The other ad hom things I'm not bothered about but I resent being called a homophobe, as I'm not one. If you had children, would you raise them in accordance with your own personal values and beliefs?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; There is no jump, they use the same indoctrination tactics, just to varying degrees. All boils down to "This mythology is right and questioning it is wrong" and they do it to either vulnerable people or those in their formative years. You have no evidence for this, it's just your feeling or how you think people with faith operate (or how you want them to behave to suit your pre-determined view of them). Do you think that is demonstrating your ability to change your mind based on observable evidence?  gt; Ha, no - what you're doing is arguing in bad faith. You're not interested in studies or facts, you just have an agenda here. Sorry but we're wise to Sealioning these days. We both have agendas. I absolutely have an agenda because I believe what you're saying has no basis in fact, but I'm giving you the opportunity to prove to me that it does; which it must do given your belief system is based upon observable evidence.  gt; Yeah, I would. We have that in common at least, that we'd raise our children in accordance with our own personal beliefs and values.</TEXT>

A reminder though that the original point was about faith schools and religious families, not fundamentalist groups and cults. If your rebuttal to that is "but the same" just forget about it.  gt; distinguish between raising someone with values and raising someone with a doctrine. That's just semantics. Call them what you want, they ultimately mean the same thing. You would raise yours with your own, I would raise mine with my own. That's what parents do, basically.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The CoE being the established church has very little bearing on politics or political opinion in the UK really. The most it encroaches into politics is the fact that there are a bunch of CoE bishops in the House of Lords, which is the second chamber of Parliament. I think what OP was talking about mainly is how it seems, from an outsider at least, US politics is often preached from the pulpit and how much of a vote-deciding issue somebody's faith could be. In the UK you would never really hear a church leader telling people which way to vote, or at least I've never seen it and I've been to a lot of churches. Most just pray for our leaders and for resolutions to issues. I think a telling example of how a politician's faith is treated here is Tim Farron, who was the leader of the Liberal Democrats. He was a professing Christian and was really hounded by the press about his views on LGBT rights and could barely talk about any of his party's other policies because all people cared about was trying to trip him up and make him out to be a homophobe. He eventually resigned because he felt it was impossible to remain faithful to his beliefs and lead a political party.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I didn't say "the old testament doesn't count" but I get the impression that you're more interested in arguing with a bogey man version of me you've erected than actually the points I made. I think slavery is abhorrent, absolutely, and that was a tricky passage for me to deal with when I first read it and I'm probably still not 100% comfortable with it now. In the ancient near Middle East slavery was a common occurrence and wouldn't have been thought to be the horror that it is viewed as today. I don't think that passage implies Jesus is pro-slavery but moreso that He didn't come to lead societal or economic upheaval, he wanted to transform people's spiritual lives that they might discover the free gift of Grace. I know that's probably not going to wash with you haha.</TEXT>

If that doesn't make sense I'll need you highlight which part doesn't make sense so I can address it. I don't know. I would hazard a guess but a woman menstrating 3000 years ago was probably a lot different than a woman menstrating in the modern age, so maybe the Levitical law, to the Levites, took that into consideration.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do appreciate absolutely how people use Christian beliefs as their foundation for being detestable and horrible to gay people and how Christians can use their faith as justification for oppression. All I can say really is that it isn't my belief. I love gay people, and I know it sounds like the old "I have black friends" thing but I go to a church with gay members and I would never want them to feel excluded or attacked by the faith, but I personally believe unless they repent of gay acts they might go to hell and in my mind that's the absolute worst place and if I feel like I can help somebody avoid that I want to try. I want to try in a loving and kind way, but I'm going to try any way I can. I think maybe I was a bit rambling there but hopefully it makes some sorta sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Repentance isn't just saying "sorry for all that stuff by the way God". It's an inward change, it's a serious and authentic thing. So you could say on your deathbed "I regret all that stuff" but unless you believe that inwardly it's just words. Not saying it can't be done though, and if you're on your deathbed and do repent I would be so so happy, but not nearly as happy as God himself and His angels in heaven.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's really cool. One side of my family is from a Catholic background so growing up I would only really ever find myself in Catholic churches for weddings, baptisms and confirmations. I often find myself interjecting into conversations in home groups when Catholicism comes up because there's a lot of misconceptions around it and some people I know have only ever known Protestantism have a lot of weird ideas about what Catholics do and believe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If I'm wrong how will I know? I'm very confident that I'm not wrong, and when I compare the damage done in the here and now to what I believe will happen if unrepentant sin isn't tackled it's not even close. Hell is very real to me. That's not to say that the Christian community shouldn't tackle homophobic attitudes and beliefs within itself, and work within itself to stop the abuse, dehuminization and oppression of gay people that are still people made in the image of God and loved by Him. And it isn't just a gay issue, but the gay issue is the one that comes up most often in places like /r/UK. I say the same to friends I know are having pre-marital sex, which is just as sinful. I mean, the whole reason this 'me being a homophobe' thing is brought up is because I didn't think a Catherdral should fly a Pride flag. If there were a flag supporting a lifestyle of pre-marital sex I would oppose that, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's plenty of theological aspects I've changed my mind on and struggle with even today, but what constitutes a biblical marriage and what constitutes sexual sin (anything outside a biblical marraige) is an area I don't believe that the Bible has left much room for maneuvre on and I really can't see how as a Bible-believing Christian I could believe anything other than gay sex as a sinful thing. I did read that page, and I have never said there isn't widespread hate and oppression against gay people. I don't feel like the solution for that is for me to have to hide my views. I think as a wider Christian movement we have to tackle hatred and oppression, as they're both antithetical to what is taught in the Bible and are both sinful in and of themselves. I think it's possible to stand firm in my view on gay sex while still being fervently against people using the Biblical view of it as a weapon with which to attack homosexual people. I think to say it's my views and oppression OR not my views and love is a false dichotomy. I believe I can have my views, which are not hateful, and still foster an society in which gays aren't oppressed, attacked, hated, etc.</TEXT>

I realise this might be really niche and might not end up going anywhere but I thought it was worth a try because I feel like there are lots of little issues in and around the UK and it's attitude towards faith that could be discussed by people that live here that maybe wouldn't get the attention on bigger subreddits.

    <TEXT>I'm not 100% sure but I am certainly sure enough to believe it. To those that say they are Bible-believing Christians and they affirm gay sex/gay marriage I would say are very misguided. Nearly all prominent theologians and preachers agree that it is sin. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury who is a very liberal-minded as far as clergy go said that he struggles between being "faithful to tradition and scripture" and "to respond appropriately with an answer for all people  #8211; not condemning them". To say that gay sex and gay marriage are not sinful is to jump through hoops that aren't there trying to explain away pieces of scripture that are pretty clear, so as to please people instead of God. And I think we will have to disagree on the point about to what extent holding to a Biblical view of homosexuality fosters oppression and hatred. I'm not denying for a moment that is does contribute but I believe that comes from people who are full of hate and use the Biblical view as a convenient means of hatred, rather than the Biblical view in and of itself being hateful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rob Bell does not teach scripture. He is regularly and routinely condemned by people who hold to scripture as authority because of his warped views on eschatology and homosexuality. Eugene Peterson was against homosexual marriage as far as I can tell, but his correct view on tradition marriage aside his 'translation' of the Bible is horrible and should never have been marketed as a Bible and will mislead thousands. It's him taking his views of the world and imposing them where possible into the text. I don't know Steve Chalke but a quick Google shows that he is somebody who does not respect the scriptures. He teaches many things which deviate from scripture and even in one video asks "Do we need to rethink Jesus in light of modern issues?". How ridiculous. I saw no biblical grounding for their beliefs when I was searching for it, conveniently ignoring all the passages that condemn it and instead talking about "but love thy neighbour" as if affirming biblical truth is somehow not loving. Steve Chalke is especially insidious and Eugene Peterson's views were okay, given that I expected worse knowing what I do about his bible translation. It makes sense because looking into their backgrounds Peterson is the only one with a background as a theologian/scholar rather than just people who led big churches. And it's weird that you would pick up on the 'common ground' now given that I had said it before, too. The point is that it's hatred which is the driving force behind homophobic hate, and they use views of people like me to try to justify it, when I think hating people is horrible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In hindsight I shouldn't have said nearly all prominent theologians and preachers agree because it absolutely does open the door to people like Steve Chalke and Rob Bell. I will ask you though, to look on Youtube when you have time for both Rob Bell and Steve Chalke being interviewed on their views by Andrew Wilson. I think they both expose quite easily the sand on which they have built their arguments. Rob Bell doesn't seem to be able to argue his own views and certainly not using the Bible. The best Steve Chalke can muster up is "there's some doubt about what Paul meant" which he thinks opens the door for him to impose his own opinion into the text that Paul was okay with same-sex relationships but Andrew Wilson who is a Greek scholar amongst other things quickly corrects him on that, in saying that the consensus among biblical scholars is very clear and you can pick up any of the 50 most popular bible commentaries and it will plainly say what the New Testament teaches about homosexuality. His whole argument is to create confusion rather and then give anecdotal evidence for something. I know most of that really isn't of importance but I just can't leave it being believed that the opinions of Rob Bell and Steve Chalke are anything other than opposed to 2000 years of church history and understanding and the vast majority of Biblical scholarship. And I deeply regret the fact that my views are shared by, or embolden people, driven by hate. Their actions however do not change my opinion.</TEXT>

All churches are modern up to a point, really. Somehow being modern 2000 years after Jesus is wrong but modernising up until 1700 years after Jesus and then stopping is okay?

    <TEXT>Hey, and welcome! You've already been given a really great rundown of faith in this country, and I will echo the sentiment that religion is something that is considered a personal thing and not really spoken about in normal conversation, along with things like money and politics (although I think politics is everywhere recently so can't be avoided). That isn't to say that you should hide your faith at all though. The most common way it comes up in conversations I have tend to be from when people ask me about what I was up to at the weekend and I'll drop in I went to church and then if they are curious they might ask about it, if not they'll just acknowledge it and move on. I don't really find the attitude of "we're the only decent church in the area" common at all and I've been to a number of different churches in my city and the town I lived in previously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Firstly - it isn't my title! With that said, I find this very worrying really. Even trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and assuming they're just trying to reach out to the LGBT community to bring them into the fold of God, they go way too far in affirming and celebrating Pride. To me it seems like they are focusing way too much on pleasing the world and worrying about how they look to people rather than promoting Biblical truth.  gt; None of this sexual free-for-all should appeal to any Christian who takes God remotely seriously This sentence from the article is sort of a summary of my opinion on all of this kind of thing. Groups like Christian Concern and the Christian Institute do tend to go a bit over the top sometimes and conflate anything LGBT with sex which I know isn't wholly accurate, but I feel around events like Pride there is definitely a promotion of the sexual 'freedom' type of thing.  gt; Do they have any boundaries at all? Prostitutes, animals, family members? Although this slippery slope thing is stupid and I don't agree. I think they just put in to rile people up rather than focusing just on the actual topic of discussion. But I'm definitely curious to hear what other people think about churches openly and outwardly supporting events such as Pride. I'm not a member of the Anglican communion so maybe opinion is different inside it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately there isn't much that can be done, but it isn't anything new. Lots of different movements and cults like to appropriate Christian language and Christian imagery to try to give their own thing legitimacy and muddy the waters to outsiders looking in. I just think it's something more Christians need to be educated about or be wary about. Just because it sounds Christian, it doesn't mean it is. And just because the person saying a thing is wearing a clerical collar, that doesn't make it automatically Christian. Christians should be taught that if ever in doubt, check - we're called as Christians to practice discernment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I formed my opinion long before this article was written. I don't have a problem with anybody that "seeks to celebrate the spirit of acceptance" and I certainly don't have a problem with anybody that wants to show LGBT people, or any people, that they are truly loved. The problem, for me, comes when you look at what exactly it is that they're accepting. Is celebrating the acceptance of the sinner or is it celebrating the acceptance of the sin? I certainly don't think it's "sneering hate" to worry about how a church seems to focus more on pleasing men than pleasing God. As for Bella Tempus, I don't really know much about her but if you've got a drag queen reading mainstream childrens books to children at a Pride event, I don't really know why the church is involved in that at all. I also don't think something being mainstream immediately means it's okay for the church. I'm on mobile so I've only had a little look through The Gathering's Twitter page briefly as I couldn't find their website you mentioned and I agree there's nothing about having no standards for sexual behaviour. I agree with them that nobody's sexual or gender identity should be a reason for them to be barred from churches and worship spaces, but still in those spaces people should be prepared to feel challenged about their sin; they shouldn't be safe spaces. All the best sermons I've ever been to have been ones that have made me feel convicted about my sin, rather than making me aware of a sin I'm guilty of and then sugar coating it to try and make out it's okay or not that bad.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is /r/ChristiansUK thoughts on abortion in the UK?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-27 18:26:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, totally non-controversial topic ahead... ___________ * In England and Wales in 2018 there were 205,295 abortions performed according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The figure is Scotland for 2018 stands at 13,287, as per NHS Scotland. * In Northern Ireland for the year 2017-18 the number of abortions is 12. It is reported that the number of abortions in the UK from Northern Ireland residents in 2018 is 1,053. * The abortion rate is highest for 21 year olds and 81% of abortions were for a woman who is single. (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/808556/Abortion_Statistics__England_and_Wales_2018__1_.pdf) * Since approval of abortion in the UK in 1967 (until 2014) there have been 8,745,508 abortions performed. _________________ The law in the UK, but not Northern Ireland, is in brief:  gt; (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a person shall not be guilty of an offence under the law relating to abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith #8212;  gt; (a) that the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family; or  gt; (b) that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; or  gt; (c) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated; or 97.7% of abortions in England and Wales were performed under grounds of (c) in 2018.  gt; (d) that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. _______________________________ For me the Bible is pretty clear about the fact that a baby in the womb is known by God and is formed by God's hand, and so I think that abortion in all cases is wrong. Psalm 139 is probably the verse used most by pro-life people but for good reason. "For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." At the start of the Book of Jeremiah, God tells Jeremiah that He knews Him before he was formed in the womb and in Job 10 he speaks about being formed by God's hand. I would be interested if somebody has a biblical defence of abortion because I've kept the facts up above pretty neutral but to see that last year in England and Wales alone over 200,000 lives were terminated is pretty horrifying and sad. I think Christians in the UK should definitely be more proactive in voicing our concerns about abortion through trying to change public opinions on abortion. I don't think we're anywhere near getting legislation in to protect unborn babies so I think first there has to be a shift in public attitudes to abortion by informing people about the fact that unborn children have their own rights before God and should have those rights in law. I read somewhere once that the mass scale of the deliberate destruction of unborn babies happening in our time would be the first thing an Old Testament prophet would reproach us for, and I can't disagree. I think we need to repent for allowing it to happen. I do think, though, if we fight for the life of the unborn and don't fight as strongly for the life of those born, we lack integrity. There's so many children that are abused, neglected, living in poverty, currently regugees, etc. Christians should also be at the forefront of trying to secure children everywhere a better quality of life. Banning abortion without campaigning also to help society cure itself of the reasons a mother doesn't want to give birth would be neglegent, and I think we should campaign for better personal, medical, social and financial support as we are called to share each other's burdens. So to summarise my ramblings, I think that abortion on such a mass scale is a societal failure and we as a society should repent, campaign to save the lives of unborn babies and also campaign to improve society so that people do not fear having a baby.</TEXT>

I had heard of The Potter's Promise before while reading something but I thought it was a pro-Calvinistic book. I think why I am struggling with this as a topic generally is because I watch so many Calvinist preachers (Piper, Baucham, Washer, MacArther, Ferguson, Lawson, Sproul, White) and only really follow one or two other preachers so if you have any suggestions of preachers I'd love to hear them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey Was wondering what your favourite charities are, and what work they do, whether Christian or not? I'm a big fan of Christians Against Poverty (https://capuk.org/) and the work they do helping people in poverty and there was a great TV show that showcased their work on the BBC recently. Also the RNLI is great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I go to a mixture of the morning and evening services at my church, depending on my plans for the day and if it's particularly quiet Sunday I'll try and go to both. The preaching is pretty much always of the same length and quality, but I much prefer the evening worship. I think because in the evening there's no young children around and there's more student/young adults the worship is always more energetic and I find it really edifying. The structure of the evening services tends to be a bit more freeform, too, and quiet often there will be people on stage telling stories about amazing things God has done in their life recently or that they've seen God do in other people's lives. It's really encouraging.</TEXT>

I spoke to a lady once who says she can't go to the evening services because she gets so overwhelmed by the energy of the worship she can't sleep for hours after. Whereas I always come away feeling a real tranquility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey /r/unitedkingdom, I created a small subreddit, with really poor executed flairs, for Christians based in the UK to talk about Christian issues and issues affecting Christianity in the UK. It's a Brexit-free zone! It's also somewhere people can come to ask questions about faith and the church in the UK, but more theological questions would be better answered over at one of the other Christian subreddits probably. Pictures of churches welcomed. I realise there might not be much interest in this but hopefully it illuminates the subreddit to a few Christians out there. The subreddit is: /r/ChristiansUK</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That depends who you ask, I guess. If you ask on /r/openchristian they will probably say yes but if you ask on /r/truechristian they will probably say no. Personally I'm more aligned with the latter, as I think the Bible does not support same-sex relationships. That's not to say being gay = hell, there's loads of faithful Christians that have same-sex attractions. There's even people rethinking what hell actually is, rather than the common held view of burning sulphur etc. You can read about it on http://rethinkinghell.com/.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-27 12:57:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, Me and my future wife are doing premarital counseling with our pastor and he's asked us to individually come up with a list of convictions we think we should both agree to hold to within our marriage, and then come together and whittle them down to three we agree on and then have them ready to discuss at the next counseling session. It made me wonder what other people have as theirs. I did a little search on the sub but couldn't find anything. Some examples he gave, that he had with his wife, are things like: * Never go to bed angry or with unresolved disagreements * Set aside one date night a week with no TV, no radio, no phone etc. So yeah, if you have any examples I would be very grateful to read them. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Murder and stealing aren't comparible as there isn't a sizeable movement within Christianity advocating it's support for murder and theft and her post was clearly directed towards the Christian community. Also when she made her post, it was 2014 and gay marriage had just been made legal in or around that time. So her post was clearly in response to what was at the time current news. If murder were to be legalised I would think she might have made a post about that, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I obviously don't think that and don't understand why you would even say it, I just disagree with you about the intent of her post. I just do not read her post and think that she's calling for Christians to go and oppress homosexuals, shout them down, etc. To just look at the last few passages and take them out of the context of her talking about *Christians* misconceiving the Word of God. Ecclesiasticus isn't in my Bible but I'm sure you'd use something about not being unequally yoked to make the same point. The bottom line is Christians can hang around with, and live with, gay people and we can quote Bible verses back and forth out of context all night (although it's a welcome change from people telling me I shouldn't eat shellfish if I believe the Bible lol). I would think you would probably say the same you've said about her, about me too, but it just isn't the case. I would hire an openly gay person, and I like to think that I'm not lukewarm so I don't think you can fairly claim she wouldn't. Which is why I replied to your first post, as I felt it was unfair to insinuate that.</TEXT>

I was not, and am not, somebody who supported him so why would I pray for him? So I just didn't pray for him. Fortunately I've (hopefully) matured somewhat as a Christian and I pray for Boris, despite having far less respect for him than I ever had for Cameron, because it's obvious to me that with such strong divisions in the country the only way those divisions will be healed is through God. I went to a prayer event yesterday evening and there was 30 people praying for God to help guide Boris and for leaders in our local community too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey readers, I haven't really been able recently to put in the effort I thought I was going to be able to put into the subreddit and trying to get it to grow into a friendly fellowship of Christians in the UK, but even though the sub has hit a bit of a wall I still think that there's something here worth pursuing. My main two queries to people that subscribe here are: Do you think there's scope for a UK specific Christian subreddit or do you think it's too niche? And if anybody thinks there is scope to grow the community, would they be interested in being a moderator to help facilitate that? Again, I apologise for my own inactivity given that I started the sub but I didn't know life would get busy as it has done. Many thanks and God bless!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're unfairly putting words in her mouth when you say "she had no problem declaring we don't need them because we have the Bible". She actually says they're "incredibly helpful" and "useful tools" for helping understand herself and others. She doesn't at all dispute the John Starke quote she uses that says the Enneagram is a strong tool for identifying where we need healing and helping us become ourselves more truly in Christ. Even the subtitle of the article is "personality tests can be deeply helpful. She's just addressing what she has seen, and so have I with my peers, that sometimes people put too much stock in these tests. Ultimately using their conclusions about their personality as an excuse to sin. This might not be you, but from my experience it's definitely something that can exist in Christian circles. So she isn't saying never use these tools, but just that they're not the be all and end all. And I think she might agree with you that she should have taken some personality inventories before getting married but I would imagine that she has also grown massively as a person since then. She has obviously recognised that she hadn't properly explored her differences with her husband before their marriage, and has most likely since done so and has grown as a person because of it. I also don't think using somebody's admission of their past naivet #233; and lack of understanding as a reason to condescend them is very helpful for anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Romans 1:26-28 "men committing shameless acts with other men", and although it does identify same-sex relations as sin, anybody using those verses would be wildly missing the point of Paul's letter to the Romans, because if keep reading into chapter 2 he also says "Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things." So basically, yeah what they're doing is sin, but you sin too, so worry about yourself and repent of your sin. The other is 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, and recently there has been some dispute about what the Greek work "areenokoitai" specifically means, which is the key word in the passage which identifies same-sex relations as sin, but from the early church, church fathers and 2000 years of Christian orthodoxy has been pretty certain on what it means. There's always schools of thought contrary to the mainstream orthodox position though.</TEXT>

They obviously shouldn't take a position as to whether children **should** have faith or **should not** have faith.

    <TEXT>The point isn't about what's being taught, it's about whether parents have the right to remove their children from lessons if what is being taught is against their beliefs. Science versus faith is a false dichotomy, you can trust science and have faith. How could you teach them the importance of the world around them without teaching them about thousands of years of faith and the impact it's had on the world around them? Nobody is teaching children "don't worry about facts kids, faith is enough". If a school was teaching that reading X newspaper is acceptable and reading Y newspaper is unacceptable, I would have a problem too, but I wouldn't have a problem is an educator was teaching "some people read X newspaper" because that's true. Just as teaching that "some people ascribe to X belief system" is also true.</TEXT>

It's about the fact that whilst a Christian would typically have access to a vicar, there's often no equivalent for non-religious people. They're calling for more non-religious trained carers for people to have access to so they they can help non-religious people in what is likely a very scary or challenging time in their life.

If you are going to have a child, but find out they are disabled, and terminate the pregnancy because of that, you are saying that because that child is disabled it is of lesser value, or less deserving of the right to be born.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I felt moved after reading about the latest flooding in Ironbridge to post about praying for all the communities and people up and down the countries affected by the flooding this month, remembering that Jesus is the One who calmed the storms. Pray for the communities and the people that live in those communities that the flooding might cease, that people are given resilience and peace, that communities recover fully and that life is protected. Pray for the emergency services and people who are helping to keep people safe, to rescue people in need, to those looking after their neighbours that they would have strength and the resources they need to maximise their efforts, and they themselves stay safe. Pray that God might comfort those that have suffered loss and are in distress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! I did an Alpha course at church when I was first exploring faith and I found myself in a somewhat similar situation to you. The group leaders weren't very good at answering questions with confidence, or clarity. I knew at the time some of the things they were saying were wrong or misleading but I was still young in my own faith so didn't have the confidence at the time to really challenge them. Knowing what I know now I would have spoken up more. It's pretty reckless and irresponsible to put somebody who only knows the basics of the faith in charge of a group of people there specifically questioning it, just as it was in the group I went to. With that said, I'll pray for you and pray that the rest of your Alpha meetings go well and you help lead people to Christ!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think it's odd for you to have to explain it because they're your thoughts on the topic, and if you didn't explain them I wouldn't know what you think and I wouldn't be able to respond. I'm not CoE, but running with your examples, the church is institutionally racist but so is most of UK society and changing that isn't flicking a switch. Acknowledging it is the first step to changing, and surely after acknowledging it, things such as the faith manifesto are another step to rectifying that. If he flat out denied the church was institutionally racist I could see it as a good point. Same-sex relationships aren't affirmed by the church but that isn't discriminatory behaviour. Not supporting something from somebody's lifestyle isn't the same as hating them, discriminating against them, denying their rights, etc. If disagreeing with anything somebody does means that nobody can celebrate diversity at all, nobody would be celebrating diversity. It's almost as if having different views but coexisting in the same city is diversity. Lastly I don't think it's the purpose of the document to preach to others, it's more for the faith community to connect with the mayoral candidates and garner their support for their goals and support for the social action projects they support in the city.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Porn sites absolutely have to be more proactive on checking consent and age. The fact that they still show porn videos from a porn production company that's owners have been arrested for sex trafficking is disgusting, and it's heartbreaking reading about the minor who struggled to remove the videos of her. Stuff like this is damaging to society and how some people view sex and women, and should be better regulated. And I think that's more important than a word being different in the title.</TEXT>

I find it strange how everybody is jumping in to lecture about the title when it's negative about their particular vice but not for all the other articles I can see in the new tab where the title is editorialized, and nobody is jumping in there. So given you're now aware that PornHub has hosted rape and child porn, and only removed them after allowing what's likely thousands of people to view them, do you think they should do more checks upon uploading videos or do you think the occasional rape video or video with a minor in is a price worth paying to make the rest of the porn more convenient?</TEXT>

I don't know the solution, I would think it needs to be regulated more. But PornHub CAN do more. It took a minor over 6 months of repeatedly emailing PornHub to have her video removed.

    <TEXT>That's really inaccurate. The idea that the world doesn't matter in that way is from the gnostic school of thought and it is regarded as heretical by pretty much all of mainstream Christianity. The world does matter to Christians. It was made by God's hand, but it is fallen and there is suffering here. We also have the wider perspective that there will be another world and that this one is temporal, and the suffering here is temporal, but there will be an eternal world, with no suffering, to come. The now and the not yet - but neither is more important or matters more than the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The church do help with that. The article you're commenting on is literally the church using it's influence to highlight and challenge people, governments and businesses to think about inequality. They lead by example in adopting the Living Wage to all centrally employed and contracted staff. They run and support things like the Church Urban Fund, Just Finance Foundation, End Hunger UK, End Child Poverty and on a local level thousands of churches run/help with foodbanks, homeless shelters, debt advice centres and similar local schemes to help alleviate inequality. They commission research and papers into the causes and effects of poverty and ways in with to solve the issue of inequality and present them to governments. Not to mention, since you want them to get political, they actually have members in the House of Lords who typically always vote for policies that will help lessen the effects of poverty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During Holy Week and Easter I went to church five times. Or more accurately, I should say that I logged onto Facebook Live on five separate occasions. There I watched with joy and no little sense of amazement as my suburban parish church, by no means at the cutting edge of modern technology, skilled up in a matter of days in order to stay connected with its flock during this vital period for both the church and the world at large. I am now very closely acquainted with the pattern of the curtains in my vicar #8217;s living room  #8211; the same kindly vicar who thoughtfully posted each member of his flock a palm cross which he proceeded to bless online during the Palm Sunday service. There has been much lamentation that churchgoing online is a poor substitute for the substance, not to mention the pomp and circumstance, of the real thing. It #8217;s certainly very different. But to my great surprise, it #8217;s a difference that I have found myself valuing more and more as each day of lockdown has passed. Every year I attend the Palm Sunday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday services as a matter of course. Never before, however, have I been tempted to a meditation on the Stations of the Cross or the Maundy Thursday vigil. With the clamour of the outside world abruptly stilled, the inside, online world of the church became the absolute centre and structure of my daily routine. A notification informing me that  #8216;Holy Trinity is now live #8217; brought a precious sense of connection, and not just with the Wi-Fi. This break in the normal proceedings has also provided a welcome opportunity for some ecclesiastical spring cleaning, some stripping back of the layers of ritual that accumulate  #8211; and occasionally stifle  #173; #8211; over time. Watching services on my own has allowed me to focus on the elements of the service that matter most to me, while tuning out from those that irk. I #8217;ve never liked the hubbub of chatter that rises in a church before a service starts; in a religious building, I long for quiet contemplation and a sense of the numinous, rather than the background noise of a coffee shop. In control now of the surroundings in which I can experience the services, I make sure that I settle down in good time in a quiet room. The only time I have bothered to put on any sort of smart attire since the lockdown began was for the Easter Sunday Eucharist, when I donned a new spring dress. Even if no one else could see me, I reasoned, God could, and the least I could do on the most joyous day in the Christian calendar was to make some attempt to subdue my increasingly Womble-like hair. Participating in the familiar liturgies and hearing the familiar words in this unfamiliar context has jolted me out of a sense of lazy complacency and made me pay attention and listen again. With no external distractions to look at, I have looked at the vicar, and the vicar #8217;s curtains, only. Never before have I known the incredible intimacy of sharing a live silence with a small group of fellow worshippers over the internet. Perhaps fancifully, it made me think of the early days of the church; less fancifully, it served as a salutary reminder that even now, in so many places around the world, worshippers of all creeds are forced to follow their faith in clandestine ways. But the joy! The joy has gloriously heightened too. Never before has it been so uplifting to sing that wonderful hymn of triumph,  #8216;Thine Be the Glory #8217;, than it was on Sunday, listening to my vicar joined by, out of shot, his wife and young son accompanying us by banging on what sounded like a bucket. It was a rare and precious feeling of hard-won victory, of hope over despair and solidarity over solitude, sharpened by all the hearts and thumbs up signs that flooded the Facebook feed at that climactic moment. In normal times, I am greatly averse to hearts and thumbs up signs. These were not normal times. Finding myself with an amplitude of time on my hands, immediately after my church #8217;s Easter service I watched the Eucharist from Canterbury Cathedral. This was, as might be expected from the mother church of the Church of England, a sophisticated and reflective production that surely brought consolation to hundreds of thousands, all brooding shots of daffodils and the Gospel read by the Prince of Wales. Yet I know what I have enjoyed most over these past days: the sound of that bucket and the sight of my vicar #8217;s curtains. Written by: Fiona Mountford</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tithing happens, sure. His point was that it's the "go to" of a church to "milk the vulnerable for all they are worth". That's not what tithing is. I only made the comment I did because it's obvious that he came to the comments looking to spread his opinion regardless of whether there was any evidence to support it. His first instinct was to see if there was a way he could spin this story into something he could use to support his opinion that the church was "milking vulnerable people for all they are worth". When it was clear that nothing in the story supported his opinion (and in fact works against his narrative) he just stated his opinion anyway, with no evidence that the CoE milks vulnerable people for money. Now again, I'm not saying that no churches whatsoever take advantage of vulnerable people and they're all well run and great, but to suggest it's a church's "go to" is just untrue, yet he says it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I'm not Catholic, nor is the CoE but the Catholic Church is also one of (if not the, depending on how you measure ir) the world's largest charitable organisations, donating vast sums of money and it's members giving up lots of time for free to help the most vulnerable through humanitarian projects, including disaster relief, medical aid, and help to the poor in developing nations. For some reason we're focusing on the Catholic Church, rather than the CoE which this article is about, I still think it's unreasonable to argue that because churches built up cash reserves, land wealth, etc. by tithing historically, it's fair to characterise them as preying on the vulnerable as their "go to" nowadays (that's also to assume that tithing historically was done in a predatory way which could also be argued I guess). Especially when they they spend hundreds of millions each year actually helping the most vulnerable which sort of is evidence otherwise. I am yet to see any proof that large religious organisations such as the Catholic Church or the CoE currently have their go to way or working as milking the vulnerable. Nor have I seen any proof that it's widespread or even somewhat common within independent churches.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As Covid-19 reminds us of life #8217;s fragility, an increasing number of people are turning to faith and spirituality. _______________ Corinna Camilleri was five years old when she began attending church in her hometown of Medina, Malta. She remembers learning to recite prayers word for word from the Bible, many of which she still remembers today.  #8220;I always believed in a God, #8221; says the London-based artist.  #8220;But looking at the coronavirus situation, I #8217;m questioning his agenda. What kind of twisted entity would allow such suffering? #8221; While Corinna may be experiencing a crisis of faith, recent data shows that others may be engaging more with religion since lockdown. The fact that Bible app downloads shot up in March globally is one indication of this. The top English-language Bible on Google Play and App Store was installed almost two million times, the highest amount ever recorded for March, according to Appfigures. Similarly, one of the UK #8217;s largest online Christian bookstores, Eden, has seen physical Bible sales rise by 55 per cent in April, while Google searches for  #8220;prayer #8221; and  #8220;Christianity #8221; have skyrocketed. The pandemic has triggered a  #8220;historic spiritual moment #8221;, says Dr Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, who is unsurprised by the growth in Bible-reading. He notes that engagement with online church services is also booming, and that it is a response to feelings of disorientation, fragility and fear caused by the crisis.  #8220;Online, one can preserve a measure of anonymity. You can tune into something without committing yourself, and expose yourself to something fresh, #8221; he adds. Since lockdown began, one of the UK #8217;s largest churches, Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB), has seen turnout double for its online Alpha course, a space for non-believers to ask questions about faith and Christianity.  #8220;I've never known a time in my life when people are more open to [God #8217;s word] than they are now, #8221; said HTB #8217;s vicar, Nicky Gumbel, in an online Easter conference.  #8220;There are no other distractions. There #8217;s no football, there #8217;s no sport. There #8217;s no entertainment. People have time to hear the Gospel. #8221; Indeed, never in modern history have so many people been sanctioned to their homes, in what the Dean of Gloucester Cathedral, Stephen Lake, calls  #8220;an enforced period of reflection. #8221; Islam has also seen increased engagement. Google Play #8217;s most popular Quran app saw record high downloads in March, doubling February #8217;s numbers, according to Appfigures.  #8220;People are reaching out for help. All holy books talk about suffering, and that it leads people back to faith, #8221; says Sayyid Fadhil Bahrululoom, an Islamic scholar at London #8217;s Alridha Foundation. During his time in war-torn Iraq, Bahrululoom saw many people turn to God  #8211; a reaction to crises that he says is  #8220;instinctive in human beings #8221;. The world #8217;s major religions are not the only ones witnessing increased engagement. Reiki, an alternative medicine involving energy healing, has become more sought after than ever since the lockdown. The UK #8217;s largest reiki group on Facebook  #8211; home to thousands of members  #8211; has seen rising demand for online healing and reiki-teaching since lockdown began, as well as a spike in fraudsters offering scam services and  #8220;spells #8221;, according to the group #8217;s admin. Reiki practitioner Hilary Kingston says that people are looking to a  #8220;higher source #8221; for comfort and explanation during the crisis  #8211; much in the same way as an ill person prays for their return to health. For others, reiki carries political significance. Katrina Kiritharan is an energy healer and intuitive life coach and says that it symbolises an  #8220;inclusive and [alternative] beacon of hope #8221; for marginalised people who feel that their governments have failed to support them during the crisis. With healthcare being so unaffordable in many countries, and psychotherapy carrying a stigma in certain communities, spiritual healing presents a cheaper and safer option, Katrina explains. Inexpensive self-help is growing in the form of meditation too, with popular apps such as Calm and Headspace booming since global lockdown began. Similarly, Rowan Williams describes the advent of the pandemic as a  #8220;remarkable moment of truth. #8221;  #8220;It occurs at a time when the international global economy was more overheated and feverish than ever before. Covid-19 shows us that we live in a world with limitations, [something] we so badly need to remember in respect to the environment, #8221; he explains. Others spy a wholly different meaning behind the pandemic. Bahrululoom says that in Islamic communities in Iran, Iraq and the Gulf most scholars believe the coronavirus to be caused by mankind #8217;s sin, which is why many leaders are urging people to be  #8220;closer to God #8221;. A small minority of Muslims and Christians believe that Covid-19 heralds the apocalypse. Equating suffering with God #8217;s will is nothing new. From Noah #8217;s flood to the Aids outbreak, some individuals see nothing but divine punishment. Others, such as Williams, see free will. Coronavirus was caused by human actions, or lack thereof, he argues. Meanwhile, the Dean of Gloucester Cathedral says suffering is part of human life: Jesus suffered pain on the cross, as we suffer pain. It is easy to forget, however, the extent of worldwide suffering.  #8220;The limitations of human empathy are profoundly sad. We need a face on the statistics of suffering to speak to us directly, #8221; says Williams.  #8220;I remember when asked about the horrors of 9/11. It was dreadful, yes of course, but it #8217;s a dreadfulness that quite a lot people live with almost routinely, and we #8217;ve simply just not noticed, #8221; he adds. Indeed, approximately 3.1 million children die from malnutrition each year, a tragedy without a global lockdown that is, therefore, more easily forgotten or ignored.  #8220;We are pleasure-seeking, pain-avoiding animals. Today, we #8217;ve crafted a world in which we can tune out when things get hard. With the coronavirus, this discomfort is omnipresent. We turn on our devices and it #8217;s there, #8221; says Katrina. The universe will keep bringing the lesson until we wake up, she adds. Lessons are already being learnt. For example, many people do not want a full return to pre-lockdown life, due to cleaner air and a stronger sense of community, highlights one YouGov poll.  #8220;We need a real rediscovery of a moral and spiritual politics  #8211; one that has a sense of public good, accountability and service. One that creates trust, #8221; concludes Williams. Will politicians and business leaders hear these prayers?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being tax exempt is very different from avoiding tax. Being ran like a business isn't what makes something a business, though. There's no profit, no commercial activity. Loads of charities have investments. Investments are a way to ensure the long-term mission of the charity, or in this case church. The Church of England are extremely open with their investments and their money and if there was any evidence that they were avoiding tax they owe or money wasn't operating within the definition of charitable purposes the government would be all over them. The fact is though that they operate very ethically with their investments and very charitably with their money. I understand some people disagree with the functions of churches and dispute their tax free status, that's a legitimate point of view but the church itself operates with full transparency and adherence to the law.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having investments =/= a business. You can keep saying it but it doesn't make it true. You can argue you *think* they should be classed as a business but as it stands they are not a business. See my previous message for why charities and religious institutions have investments - it's just smart money management. The church's investment in Wonga was indirect through a venture capital portfolio and was ended as soon as it became clear. They received no profit from it and it lead to a tightening of investment guidelines for both direct and indirect investments. So a mistake, yes, but it lead to stricter guidelines as the church recognised it's ethical failure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're not businesses because their purpose, and nearly all of their activity lie outside of the taxable economy. It's the same reason museums and art galleries have tax relief. I'm not a big fan of art, but just because an art gallery invests in it's buildings, pays it's employees and invests some of it's money that doesn't make it a business. There's load of examples - conservation groups, charities, community groups. They pay employees, they invest in things for their services, they charge money for things. Are they businesses? No. The goals of churches and other organisations that have charitable status are objectively different from businesses and corporations. Churches don't receive special treatment, the only special treatment they receive above any other community organisation or charity is how easily a religious organisation can apply for charitable status, but even after applying they're still subject to the same laws and regulations as any other charity so it's not as though they exploit that. I get that lots of people dislike religious groups but tax law isn't a popularity contest. Churches contribute to the public good, they operate thousands of programs over the country to help people. Children's groups, financial advice/help, credit unions, emergency accomadation, food aid, lunch clubs, education, employability, street pastors, interfaith community links, addiction help, environmental concerns, advocacy, campaigning and social enterprises. The purpose of taxation is to raise money for the government to provide services to it's citizens. It would be pretty shitty policy to tax things providing free services to it's citizens so those programs suffer and you don't raise enough tax to reproduce them. Tax wisdom is to tax things you want to discourage, so if you want to discourage charities from doing charity work, sure, tax churches.</TEXT>

I mean they try and stop it whoops the bank account has filled up again This just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how investments work and their purpose.  gt; The reason we both agree museums should be exempt is that we both see their value. They teach us our history and serve to allow a new generation to learn from the mistakes of the past But they have money in bank account **whoops** I guess they shouldn't exist. Why aren't they spending all that money on further teaching us about history. I guess they need to be abolished, gross greedy wealth hoarders. Stupid thing to say, I know...  gt; Personally, I see no value in the church. Then don't go to church or give money to a church.  gt; never quite manages to spend it doing the good works it so loudly asks others to do. This is just either ignorance or a falsehood. Just Google your local church and see what they do for the community with their limited resources or even just read my previous message about the different types of things churches do. The CoE themselves run dozens of projects, just go on their website and they donate tens of millions of pounds yearly. You seem to think because they don't recklessly spend every penny they possibly can as soon as possible while completely ignoring their fiduciary reponsibility they're being greedy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to add to this, [lots of bishops came out against the statement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/church-of-england-sex-guidance-unnecessary-pain-bishops) and then a bit later the [Archbishops of Cantebury and York apologised](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/church-of-england-apologises-over-sex-comments) but moreso for the way the guidance was delivered and the timing of it rather than the substance of the guidance. From my own perspective there is nothing in the guidance to apologise for and when all this was happening I was surprised that so many people within the church were surprised by quite plain Biblical teaching. The fact the Archbishop is apologising for what the Bible says, regardless of your faith, says all you need to know about the CoE.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Many of the things the people in church communities do are amazing, but you don't need a religion for that. And when those people in church communities get together, consolidate their effort and focus their financial power to maximise the long-term effects of their work and mission? That's all 'religion' is, people with the same beliefs and goals working together, the CoE is just a big version, lots of people putting their resources together. A church/religion is just a collective of people at it's core.  gt; You also haven't addressed the elephant in the room namely the church's influence over our politics. I've commented on it recently if you look in my post history. I won't go again at length but I don't think there should be bishops in the House of Lords but the fact there are is almost a non-issue compared to the democratic issue that is the HoL anyway. The Lords Spiritual barely ever vote as a block, the last time they actually changed the outcome of a vote was like a decade ago to stop the coalition government putting asylum seeker's children in detention centres for education which isn't the worst thing in the world and I think their combined vote attendance is like 3% or something. The Queen is technically head of state and head of the church but that has no practical impact. There's daily prayers in Parliament or whatever, sure get rid of it who cares. What else is there for their influence in politics?  gt;But in any case... If you're arguing they're a charity not a business, then they shouldn't be entitled to business bailouts. Sure, how about a charity bailout that charities are getting?  gt; when does the investing stop and the spending start? The spending started about 400 years ago and continues every year and the investment never stops, that's why it's there. You get a return on it you use for spending and reinvesting but the bulk of it is there to earn that return.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you give me a source to what you're referring to with regards to the church wanting the government to bail them out? I'm not sure what that is. I'm also not CoE and don't particularly care for them. Churches are tax exempt for good reason, they make no profit and contribute to communities etc. as addressed previously. You might not see the value in it, like somebody might not see the value in an art gallery or museum, that doesn't negate the reality of it. You've basically just said you disagree with belief and what the church teaches which is ultimately why you seem to not be able to objectively look at the good they do, the realty of having investments etc.</TEXT>

I won't argue the bits about belief and indoctrination because that's just another rabbit hole, but I will just say that help from the church shouldn't come with a sermon. I know some charities like Christians Against Poverty offer to pray with people but the help isn't attached to that. And the rest we'll just disagree on forever I think haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is true for Christians, and praying and worshipping at home is what we've been doing during lockdown and what many of us do in our day-to-day life before Covid anyway. As Christians though, we're also called to meet together, be in fellowship with one another and colelctive prayer and worship have always been how Christians have practiced their faith. So going to church isn't going to be with God, because as you said we could do that anyway, it's to be in fellowship with other believers, listen to preaching for our spiritual growth, engaging in collective worship, encouraging one another, serving one another, etc. So it isn't really about the building, moreso just a place for Christians to be in fellowship with one another when it's safe to do so.</TEXT>

Lots of churches were already putting their services online anyway and if anything the virus forcing things online will have forced a few churches to update their online presence, but ultimately church is place where believers meet in person and I can't really see that changing. Maybe minor things like hand shaking on the doors, how communion is shared, etc but nothing substantial. I know Catholics have the sign of peace and most other churches have a "greet the people around you" type thing so I can see that changing. And of course they're after money! They still have to pay staff, pay rent, support their community projects and charities, pay their bills, building upkeep, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really can't comment on the Catholic Church because I don't know much about it organisationally. What I mean by how you phrase things is when you say something like "promoting the teachings of a humble carpenter and helping those less fortunate". It's not a totally untrue but it's obviously phrased to make it seem like by having investments the church is somehow betraying those things which it absolutely isn't. It does help the less fortunate and Jesus never said that churches shouldn't take care of their financial security. For every US super church there's hundreds of small independent churches in the same town or city in America. Super churches are the exception not the rule. I see it as sensible investment, as does lots of other people I've spoken to inside and outside the CoE. I'm not a part of the CoE, I'm not defending then because I'm biased towards them but because I feel like they're attacked for doing something completely reasonable. You can't just say "people aren't stupid, they agree with me". I'm sure lots of people that aren't stupid do agree with you, and lots of people that aren't stupid don't agree with you. It's not a clear cut thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well initially you said:  gt;Pay them a decent wage? No, I'll just put in a word with the sky wizard. That'll do. As if to suggest that somehow those praying for people have any impact whatsoever in the remunerations healthcare professionals get for the work they do, and that in praying for people instead of fighting for them to get more money they're somehow shafting them as if they're mutually exclusive, which is silly. So then I said:  gt; I think you're confusing the senior rabbi of Masorti Judaism for the person in charge of nursing pay. Easily done though, no worries. To highlight to you that it's silly to imply that a person with no power over their pay praying for them somehow deprives them of a fair wage. Then you said:  gt;So how much has this 'rabbi' forked out for the NHS then? I'll wait. Which again, is a completely irrelevant point because him being allowed to pray for staff in hospitals shouldn't be based up him paying in at least  #163;X. You also said "I'll wait" like I'm somehow supposed to go and find records of all the NI contributions and donations he's made in his life? Which is obviously stupid. Then I said:  gt;I think you're confusing me for Jonathan Wittenberg's accountant. Easily done though, no worries. Which copies the format of my previous comment, but was meant to highlight to absurdity of you asking how much money he's paid into the NHS as though him not paying enough to satisfy you personally somehow invalidates him going and praying for NHS staff. Hope that breakdown helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Lords Spiritual almost never change the outcome of a vote in the HoL, so I don't think you can argue some legislation they've impacted has negatively impacted your life. I assume you mean the principle of them being in the HoL at all, in which I would agree. Though, I hardly think 26 Bishops in a chamber which has 800 members that barely vote on anything as a block or change the outcome of a vote can be considered 'insidious shadow authority of organised religious orders', unless you're just being melodramatic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some hospitals are allowing people to visit end of life patients, even on Covid wards. Initially I believe they all stopped all visitors but I think the government message was that wherever possible they should be allowed and most trusts have been able to accomodate visits for end of life patients. I would think the risk is assessed in each case/ward though. Hospital chaplains are trained for exactly this sort of thing and if there was a significant risk they wouldn't be allowed to do what they're doing. The consultants and nurses referring these patients to the chaplains would know the risks involved greater than anybody and don't seem to be concerned about it, so I would trust the experts on this one, despite not trusting experts being very in vogue right now.</TEXT>

From the evil of the abuse itself, to the church's covering it up and inaction to prevent it or similar cases to the MPs, member of the Royal Family and a chief justice all supporting Ball while knowing the extent of the allegations, all so horrible. The IICSA report and Gibb report really expose just how awfully the church acted and you can only hope that the CoE have started implementing Gibb's recommended changes to their safeguarding procedures.</TEXT>

Edit: nothing in my comment makes sense now as you completely rewrote your haha. A brief reply to the new comment would be they're not making themselves out to be some kind of special victim, and if you got that from the article I would suggest that comes from you and not the article itself. The article acknowledges the Jewish community itself noting that for a lot of people it's their own fault for not observing social distancing, so perhaps they are sharing some blame for that?</TEXT>

Surely if the reason for not opening churches was to protect elderly and vulnerable people, which is a very good reason, non-essential shops shouldn't be open, or at least vulnerable people shouldn't be allowed to shop there. The fact that non-essential shops are open and vulnerable people are permitted to go to them but not churches is at least very inconsistent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh haha, ignore my entire reply to The Range thing then! I thought it was strange but I rolled with it. There's so much in the Bible that highlights the importants of prayer. In the NT alone there's lots, Jesus teaches us what to pray, he tells us how to pray, Paul says to pray without ceasing and to be faithful in prayer, James tells us to pray when in trouble and we're told that when we don't know what to pray the Spirit intercedes for us in prayer. Church buildings I guess aren't something we're told we have to go to, but we're told not to stop meeting each other in Hebrews. Fellowship and collective prayer/worship are demonstrated in Acts. So church buildings specifically biblical but meeting together, being in fellowship together are biblical, and church buildings are just very convenient for that, but it could be somebody's living room if necessary. It's still meeting together though. (Might be different for Catholics though, idk) Homeopathic medicine could be argued to have benefits in as much that you can give it to people with psychosomatic afflictions and you don't have to spend more money and resources testing them, treating them in other ways etc.</TEXT>

I've had some myself and someone close to me was treated horribly by her youth group leader growing up and still struggles with aspects of attending church. I think big institutional churches like the CoE have much improved their safeguarding procedures and reporting procedures for things, so it's better than it was but I just don't like top down power structures in church at all really. I much prefer a congregationalist system where the congregation vote on church decisions and the pastors and church leaders are answerable to church elders elected by the congregation. All systems have flaws though and none are perfect, but vicars, priests, pastors etc. are in general a lot less untouchable than they used to be so hopefully instances of abuse of power and stuff are less likely to happen.</TEXT>

Maybe to somebody who doesn't believe in God that makes me seem malicious but then you get into an argument about what rights parents have over their children I guess. I believe every human life is precious and of equal value, for instance, and if my child asked me something along those lines I would say "I personally believe all lives are of equal value and precious, but not everybody does though." But I would also make it very clear that I believe only one of those beliefs is valid and correct. I wouldn't say "It's okay to not think every human life is of equal value." That's my perspective anyway and I'm not seeking to be awkward or anything if it comes across that way, just to give my thoughts and understand others better.</TEXT>

They're going after the logo packs! FM is one of only 3 games I play (along with Stardew Valley and Eurotruck Simulator, for the curious) and the logo packs make it so much better. I hope FM manages to win, at least with regards to logo packs and name patches. I doubt it though.</TEXT>

People that are against abortion aren't against it because they think they'll be forced to have one, they're against it because they believe that babies in the womb have the right not to have their life terminated. Specifically this bill is trying to protect the lives of babies with very treatable conditions having their lives terminated beyond the 24th week of pregnancy.</TEXT>

The argument is whether very treatable things such as cleft lip, cleft palate and club foot are legitimate reasons to terminate between 24 weeks and birth, or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Church of England isn't Reformed Catholic. I've never heard of Reformed Catholics. The CoE are a protestant denomination separate from the Roman Catholic church. They even slag off the Roman Catholic Church in their Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion.  gt; As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch have erred: so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith. The Church of England is very broad, and there is a sizeable portion of it that can be considered Anglo-Catholic, which emphasise the Roman Catholic heritage of Anglicanism rather than the Protestant origins. They keep a lot of Roman Catholic traditions and share some Roman Catholic doctrines most protestants wouldn't but they don't accept all the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church and ultimately aren't in communion with the Roman Catholic church.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's absolutely not controversial, you're completely right.  gt; The historicity of Jesus relates to whether Jesus of Nazareth was a historical figure. Virtually all scholars who have investigated the history of the Christian movement find that the historicity of Jesus is effectively certain, and standard historical criteria have aided in reconstructing his life. Scholars differ on the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the details of his life that have been described in the gospels, but virtually all scholars support the historicity of Jesus and reject the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed. From https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus You can argue all day about who Jesus was, what he did, what he said etc but it's not really credible to deny that Jesus existed as a man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My comment want about him being called a homophobe, I don't think this bill would make that illegal as you've incorrectly assumed I did. I meant more the last bit of his comment could be seen to cross the threshold into abusive, and again I don't think it is should be seen as abusive, but due to the vague and poorly defined way the term abusive is used in the bill, it might be. Which is why I think the bill needs a rethink and has to better define exactly what it is it's prohibiting and what is allowed. I'm not saying I disagree with the spirit of the bill or its intention, I just agree with the National Secular Society that it needs to be amended to be less subjective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article text: In Douglas Murray #8217;s recent article for The Spectator he argued that, in a time of national crisis, the church missed the opportunity of a lifetime by effectively shutting up shop and putting their feet up for a wellearned break. When Murray shared the article on Twitter, it prompted hundreds of responses from congregations and clergy across the UK who countered that far from being shut, they have been working harder than ever since closing their doors on 23 March. Reverend Brian Casey, vicar of Springburn Parish Church, was one of the first to respond, tweeting:  #8220;Our church has worked harder in the last three months than at any other time. We have fed 2,000 people a month at a cost of around  #163;30,000 and I have buried 90 people personally in three months. I am exhausted and my phone still rings day and night. #8221; Springburn, on the outskirts of Glasgow, is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Scotland. At the opposite end of the country in Newquay, Cornwall, the town reported to be hardest hit by the economic impacts of Covid-19, Reverend Matt Timms echoes Casey #8217;s comments. Timms, dubbed  #8220;the surfing vicar, #8221; recently hit the headlines for staging England #8217;s first drive-in church service but says that behind the success of the drive-in and the media attention it attracted, he and his team at Wave House Church have been working around the clock since lockdown to meet not only the spiritual needs of the community but the increase in practical, emotional and mental needs too. Across the UK, churches have been stepping up to the plate, repurposing now-empty chapels, meeting halls and parish churches as foodbanks, community kitchens and distribution hubs. One such congregation is Gas Street Church in Birmingham, where vicar Tim Hughes was recently presented with an award by the prime minister for producing The UK Blessing, a song described by Boris Johnson as  #8220;truly uplifting #8221; and that  #8220;touched millions around the world with its message of hope #8221;. The song has been viewed over 3.7 million times on YouTube but Hughes is far more passionate about serving his local community.  #8220;We believe that God #8217;s heart is to bless people, so we were really keen to sing this blessing over the UK at a time of great uncertainty, anxiety and pain, #8221; says Hughes.  #8220;But also to show that even though church buildings were closed, the church is very much alive. #8221; For Gas Street, this has meant opening a food distribution hub that feeds hundreds of people every week, manning a telephone service for the isolated and lonely, and launching debt and money management services to tackle the longer-term economic impacts of Covid-19. The church is part of Love Your Neighbour, a network of 36 city centre hubs, established by Holy Trinity Brompton Church in London when a local foodbank situated close to the site of Grenfell Tower suddenly shut down.  #8220;There were 80 families expecting food, #8221; says Tom Jackson, CEO, of the day that the local foodbank closed.  #8220;Amazingly, our first deliveries arrived on that very same day, so we were able to parcel them all up and help provide for those families. #8221; A Food Foundation report released in April showed that 1.5 million people had gone without food for a whole day since the start of lockdown. Jackson says that their church was determined to be part of the solution to that problem.  #8220;The need was far greater than we could meet on our own, #8221; he says.  #8220;But if all of the churches across the country came together  #8211; and there are more churches than there are pubs  #8211; you know, we could make a really meaningful contribution. #8221; From a standing start, Love Your Neighbour has provided over 1 million meals in less than four months as well as providing friendship, advice and training to vulnerable and isolated people who might otherwise fall through the gaps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With the full economic impact of Covid-19 yet to be felt, it is likely that many churches will continue to be relied upon by the communities that they serve, making the refocus from buildings to people even more important as the church looks to offer both crisis intervention and long-term solutions.  #8220;Charity is great at dealing with the fallout of a broken system, #8221; says Jackson.  #8220;but business has the opportunity to change the system itself. #8221; As well as leading Love Your Neighbour, Jackson is co-founder of the charity Resurgo, whose Spear programme is designed to  #8220;transform the lives of young people and raise up a new generation of entrepreneurs who can bring about social change #8221; and is delivered by many of the Love Your Neighbour network churches. Since lockdown, the charity has innovated rapidly, moving online and opening up their programme to anyone who needs help getting back into work, regardless of age, in response to the economic impact of Covid-19. While the church is no stranger to meeting practical needs, simultaneously dealing with a considerable upturn in demand for those services and having to rethink their entire modus operandi has been a challenge for many. For congregations like Gas Street, with a production setup that would rival most West End shows, a largely young and digitally literate church community and a strong online presence, making the switch to online church may be relatively straightforward. But even among smaller and less tech-savvy congregations, many have worked hard to make the change, recognising both the need from within their own congregations and the desire from outside it. One in four adults has now watched an online service during lockdown. The Church of England #8217;s weekly online services have been watched by over 5.2 million people, with a fifth of these usually attending church once a month or less. A third of those who watched Archbishop Justin Welby on Easter Sunday were 34 years old or under  #8211; a far younger demographic than would usually be associated with the established church. Hughes reports that over 3,000 people are tuning in to Gas Street services each week, three times as many as were previously attending in person, and the uptake in streaming and zooming church services even led to claims that church  #8220;crashed the internet #8221; one Sunday morning in early May. But not all church responses have been necessarily high-tech. In order to cater for non-digital natives, the Church of England launched Daily Hope, a free 24-hour phone line with  #8220;hymns, prayers and reflections #8221; that has now received over 170,000 calls. And in one West London parish, a local vicar has taken to his bike to spread his message of hope. Reverend Pat Allerton, or the  #8220;Portable Priest #8221; as he has become known, has visited over 50 streets in his Notting Hill patch during lockdown, setting up his small PA and playing traditional hymns, such as Amazing Grace, and inviting those listening to join him in the Lord #8217;s Prayer. In a video on YouTube, people can be seen leaning out of their windows, waving and singing. In scenes reminiscent of Italy, one man joins in with his violin, serenading his neighbours. A woman dressed in black stops on the street, bows her head and places her hand over her heart, visibly moved. Others smile, point and take photos. As in many parts of the UK, Allerton #8217;s urban parish covers a diversity of ages, ethnicities and religious traditions, including many who would describe themselves as having no faith at all. Yet his simple response to having to close the front doors of his physical church building seems to resonate.  #8220;If people can #8217;t go to church, church should go to the people, #8221; he says, adding that the response has been overwhelmingly positive.  #8220;I think people are looking for something at the moment, #8221; says Allerton,  #8220;looking for hope. I mean, maybe they #8217;re just grateful for a distraction, a singalong, but I think it #8217;s more than that. I think people are grateful for the message. #8221; So why, with the church so obviously busy, are some commentators suggesting that it has been entirely I think people are looking for something at the moment, looking for hope. I mean, maybe they #8217;re just grateful for a distraction, a singalong, but I think it #8217;s more than that. I think people are grateful for the message absent? Perhaps, suggests Danny Webster of the Evangelical Alliance, Murray #8217;s comments in The Spectator were simply a matter of mistaken identity.  #8220;Church buildings and physical church services provide a very visible manifestation of the church, #8221; says Webster.  #8220;People who see the church in very traditional senses are only looking in those places and therefore they #8217;re missing what is happening in other areas. #8221; Matt Bird, CEO of Cinnamon Network, agrees, believing that many still perceive the traditional church to be the whole expression of Christian faith. The Evangelical Alliance estimates that there are more than 2 million evangelicals in the UK, including 500,000 Christians from black majority churches and, more widely, over 1 million more from black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities. Both Evangelical Alliance and the Cinnamon Network are involved in making sure that the voices of these churches are heard, alongside those of the established church, by the government Places of Worship Taskforce. Despite the Church of England and the Catholic Church combined making up less than half of the 50,000 church congregations in the UK, both Webster and Bird believe that there is still work to be done in increasing religious literacy and challenging the notion that the church is simply a physical building.  #8220;The church needs to help civic society understand that although we haven #8217;t been meeting physically, we were never closed, and we continue to make a transformative contribution to communities, #8221; Bird says, noting that church volunteers were already contributing  #163;3bn worth of time to their local communities each year, even before the current crisis. With the Evangelical Alliance reporting that 90 per cent of their member churches are providing support for vulnerable people and over half have started new services since lockdown, it is likely that this figure is now even higher. But in the end, perhaps the real judge of the church #8217;s response to coronavirus will not be political commentators, journalists or politicians, but those who received a telephone call or a hot meal, who were supported through a crisis or prayed with when they lost a loved one, who were helped with debt or assisted to get back into work.  #8220;In a time of crisis, the church stood up and said,  #8216;we #8217;re here to help, we #8217;re here to serve, we #8217;re here to generously give, #8217; #8221; says Hughes,  #8220;and I think we #8217;re going to see the benefit of that in years to come. When we are eventually able to gather back together, people who were blessed by those churches are going to want to know what causes generosity, they #8217;re going to be interested in hearing more from those churches and connecting with them. #8221; Maybe that will be the real measure of success for the church.</TEXT>

When you yourself have just explained in your comment how religion has also been on the right side of history on human rights issues since the dawn of time because religion isn't a single thing, and to characterise it as a single thing as you did is dumb.

    <TEXT>My issue with the statement originally was the absolutist nature of the statement about religion. Not a religion, but religion. Nothing to do the individual human rights issues you keep bringing up from nowhere. The Nazi analogy doesn't work because Nazism is one single ideology. If your original statement was about a specific religious ideology, then it would work but your statement was about religion as a whole. It's like if I said all political parties are on the wrong side of history. There's thousands of political parties across countries and history, to lump them all together in the same way is just dumb to me, really. It's the same with religion. There's thousands of religions and religious movements that have been involved in human rights issues, on both sides, for thousands of years across hundreds of different cultures. To say religion is always on the wrong side, when there's religion on all both sides is just nonsensical. And again I'm not saying it's a 50/50 split of right/wrong, there's obviously issues where different churches and faith movements were differing degrees of being right or wrong. It's that complexity that makes it silly to make an absolutist statement about all religion as if they're all the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't necessarily disagree with the main thrust of any of that. It was really just the statement about religious *always* being on the wrong side of history with regards to human rights issues that I thought was just untrue and took issue with. I can agree generally with the above statement that *often* religion finds itself on the wrong side of history. Especially established churches or churches that cosy up to power. I'm very much think that believers should secede from the established church, but that's for doctrinal reasons as well as the above. You might not think it given how many CoE articles I post here though haha I do think though as well that if it isn't religion, people in power will have no shortage of other ways to get people to kill each other and oppress people. Humans like killing people, humans in power will oppress people to maintain that power. Religion should have been better in the past at resisting that tendency but it's still just an earthly organisation made up of fallible humans, regardless of their faith. Still though I feel like religious movements have contributed to the human rights issues in a positive way and they shouldn't be discounted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've only just seen this post which I think is a bit of an indictment on how often I check in here. I can't say I've looked into whether women *should* wear head coverings or not, so I don't have an opinion on it, but I do recall reading a long blog/article once about Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones and John Stott, two men I hugely admire. One of the things I remember from it was that Martyn Lloyd Jones believed that head coverings should be worn when women pray in church but that John Stott believed that it was a cultural custom and not something for now. I think I also remember reading a pretty scathing critique of Stott's position or methodology, too. Somewhere I've got his book Issues Facing Christians Today which I used to reference quite a lot, but less so now, and it would be interesting if he broaches the topic in there. That's my little tidbit on the topic anway. I've subbed and it will be interesting to learn more as things get posted there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article text: Of all the sad and surreal things to happen in the past few months, the Catholic church #8217;s decision to abandon the dying was, for me, the worst. The Church of England abandoned its churches, forbidding first congregants then priests from setting foot in them, making it clear that in fact it actively dislikes church buildings. But the Catholic church in England betrayed the people who needed it most: the men and women who found themselves in the awful eye of the storm, dying of Covid-19 without family and, as it turned out, without even the possibility of a priest. As our infection rate begins to rise again, and with talk of a second wave in Europe, it #8217;s worth looking at that sequence of events in April, and at the mind-boggling response of the English Catholic bishops, so that perhaps they might think better next time  #8212; or at least not play us so much for fools. On 5 April, the Catholic Bishops #8217; Conference of England and Wales issued a statement entitled  #8216;Revised Hospital Chaplaincy Advice #8217;, which after a paragraph of prevarication produced one clear sentence:  #8216;Priests and chaplains must follow the visiting instructions from hospital and trust authorities. #8217; Given that the visiting instructions in hospitals were not to visit at all, this, for the most part, put paid to anointing of the sick (or extreme unction), the sacrament that we #8217;re told has the effect of uniting the sick person with Christ, giving them the strength, peace and courage to endure suffering, forgiving their sins and preparing them for eternal life. Priests can offer telephone support instead, said the bishops. Always good to chat when you #8217;re on a ventilator. One of the many depressing things about the decision was that it was unnecessary. Priests were already anointing patients safely, wrapped in PPE, using a cotton bud dipped in holy oil. This is the way it #8217;s being done all around the world. So why is the English church so uniquely risk-adverse? I imagine they made the decision by committee, in a Zoom meeting, where no one need ever catch another #8217;s eye. I imagine, after decades of promoting the sorts of people who take their commitment to health and safety very seriously, it #8217;s not the thing to point out when they #8217;ve gone too far. The bishops were afraid, of course they were. At that point in April, 90 priests had died of the virus in Italy. But we were all afraid, and if there was ever a time we needed the church, this was it.  #8216;The word cowardly comes to mind, #8217; wrote Damian Thompson on Twitter in response to the statement. Other words come to mind too. Like: catastrophically self-defeating. You #8217;re perfectly entitled to think that the idea of magic oil is daft, but the bishops are supposed to believe in it. They #8217;ve told their flock to order their lives around the sacraments; they wouldn #8217;t be bishops without them. When they abandon the sacraments, they destroy their own credibility. If it #8217;s too much hassle for a chaplain to put on a protective suit, if it #8217;s not really worth the risk, just to anoint someone with oil, then why, when you think about it, bother with baptism? What #8217;s so special about holy water? If blessing down the phone works just as well for the dying, why lay on hands during ordination either? Come to think of it, why do we need the physical presence of a priest at all? After the own goals came the unattractive buck-passing. On the face of it, Catholic bishops in England were just as keen as the rest of the country to praise the NHS. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of West-minster, began a series of Thursday masses in its honour, starting at 7 p.m. and  #8216;ending in time for the clap for our carers #8217;. Health workers, said the Cardinal in a Thursday homily, follow a tradition which  #8216;bears the hallmark of the Christian faith #8230; its commitment to caring for all, especially the poorest, sprang from the determination to follow the teachings of Christ #8217;. By the Cardinal #8217;s own definition, our medics have been better Christians than our bishops. Yet just as they blamed the government for the decision to shut churches, so, almost imperceptibly, bishops laid the blame for deserting the dying on the NHS. The whole tone of that 5 April statement suggested that hospitals had been lobbying the church to suspend visits from chaplains. Its author, Bishop Paul Mason, explained that giving access to chaplains is tricky; doctors don #8217;t want priests to become  #8216;links in the chain of infection #8217; and it wouldn #8217;t be right for priests to use masks meant for medics. Has any single NHS hospital ever contacted the Catholic church to complain about the presence of chaplains? I #8217;d love to know. I #8217;m also keen to find out, given how concerned the church is about scarcity of PPE for medics, what provision they #8217;ve made since April. I wrote to the bishops last week asking if I might see their plans for the winter. I assume they #8217;ve been stockpiling priestly PPE and testing young, fit clergy for antibodies, assembling a crack team of corona chaplains. No answer yet. More depressing even than the 5 April statement, if you can bear it, was a report in the Catholic Herald on 9 April, which mentioned that though the Vatican had itself suggested the introduction of  #8216;extraordinary hospital chaplains #8217;, the bishops here still felt that it would be unwise. Clergy  #8216;with long experience of the NHS, all of whom asked not to be named #8217; explained to the reporter that this whole business of preparing distraught souls to meet their maker was all just too tricky at the moment. Think of the things a priest needs, they said. Think not just of the oil, but of the prayer books. Because of the rules about moving potentially infected items between rooms, any special hospital chaplains would have to either commit the words in the prayer book to memory, or write them on a piece of paper that he then left behind in the room. See? Littering. Who could countenance such a thing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The stumbling block for weddings is that in a wedding there's a legal function that there isn't at a naming ceremony or a funeral. At a funeral for instance, all the legal stuff will have been taken care of before that stage so the humanist celebrant can just say whatever, if that makes sense. At a wedding there's specific legal functions that the minister and couple have to fulfill, i.e. saying certain stuff. Currently in the law this has to be a registrar or church minister, I think. So you can have a humanist wedding in the same way you can have a humanist funeral, with no legal bits, but for weddings you'll have to have a civil ceremony afterwards just to say the legal mumbo jumbo. They're trying to change the law so that humanist celebrants can say the legal mumbo jumbo, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is, but that would mean that you have to have a humanist wedding and then a civil ceremony, and most people don't really want to have to do two things so they just opt for civil ceremonies. The complaint is that people who want religious services don't have to do that, so it's unfair/discriminatory against people who want a humanist wedding. You could argue that if they can't be fussed to have a humanist wedding and then a civil ceremony, and just opt for the latter they can't be that bothered about their humanist beliefs, which is a good point. I still think that there should be a function in the law for those that are committed humanists to have the legal nonsense included in their service so they only have to have one ceremony. My personal opinion is that government shouldn't be involved in marriage at all, but if they are going to be they should make it more inclusive of different beliefs. Hopefully that's not too rambley.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article text: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has shown an increasing willingness to venture into political debates lately. In June, during the Black Lives Matter protests, he suggested that portrayals of Jesus as white should be reconsidered in English churches. And ahead of the December election last year he accused Boris Johnson of pouring petrol on a divided Britain. Clearly not content with the controversy about his new role as a political consultant, Welby decided to go a step further this evening, when he willingly joined the most hellish fight in politics: Labour #8217;s eternal civil war. Welby's foray into left-wing politics came after the Labour MP Rosie Duffield received an alarming amount of abuse from the left of her party and was accused of transphobia, after she said that 'only women have a cervix'. In response, the archbishop rushed to her aide this evening and tweeted:  gt; I know Rosie Duffield who is a brilliant constituency MP for Canterbury as well as brave, honest, kind and passionate for justice. She does not seek to demean others. To troll her is simply cruel and wrong.  gt; - Archbishop of Canterbury (@JustinWelby) August 4, 2020 Welby may have a point on this one. But Mr S wonders if the archbishop may be setting an unusual precedent by getting involved in party politics. Perhaps voters will now expect to hear the Church of England view the next time there is a Labour deselection dispute or clash between the Corbynites and Starmer. Now that's an unholy war a wise man would stay clear of...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If there was prior written consent about this situation I wouldn't argue the point, even if I'd still find it absurd. Maybe this has exposed a flaw in the paperwork or whatever agreements they sign when freezing sperm? I just think unless explicitly stated by the deceased beforehand you shouldn't be able to do what this lady wants to do. She probably knows her child better than anybody, and she might be convinced 100% this is what her child would have wanted but I just think unless there's some legal aspect proving that you shouldn't be allowed to use a deceased persons sperm (or eggs) to make children.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess the slight difference would be that their sperm was frozen so they themselves could choose too have a child in the future, if and when they wanted to. That's why they froze their sperm. If the deceased persons mother wants to raise a child, there's people that freeze sperm explicitly for that purpose. I know she wanted the child to be her grandchild but unfortunately, and by the sounds of it very tragically, that I just think shouldn't happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Baptist and evangelical churches can perform marriage ceremonies in the same way that Catholic Churches can perform marriage ceremonies, it's just different to Church of England/Church in Wales marriage ceremonies that have different rules. I'm getting married in an evangelical church soon and my understanding is religious buildings outside of the CoE have to register with the local authority as such which will allow the ceremony to take place there, which most non-CoE churches will do. The couple then need to give 28 days notice, which you don't need to do with the CoE (because of the Reading of the Banns) and the minister of the church needs a certificate or license to register marriages from the Superintendent Registrar of the local authority, which most mid-large size churches will have but if the minister isn't authorised a registrar needs to attend the ceremony. That's my understanding of it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article text: Public atheism has a new face. Your uncle Richard has been replaced by your cool cousin Alice. She #8217;s bursting with fun facts about nature and history, but is also a well-rounded human, happy meeting other humans and smiling a lot. (Uncle Richard sometimes smiles, but it #8217;s usually a by-product of sneering at the flawed footnote of an enemy.) But don #8217;t call it atheism, Alice Roberts #8217; creed. Far too negative! In keeping with her human-ness, it #8217;s called  #8216;humanism #8217;. 'Atheism is defining yourself by an absence of something,' she told an interviewer. 'Humanism is a positive choice to base your morals on your own human capacity'. To explain this further, she has just co-authored The Little Book of Humanism with Andrew Copson. Whereas atheism attacks religion as false, humanism declares it unnecessary (and quietly adds that it is also false and largely harmful). You don #8217;t need religion to be moral. Humanism, says Roberts, is the 'idea that humans can be deeply moral beings without having some external source of goodness to either impel or encourage them to behave well. Living a good life comes from you, from employing your own human faculties of reason and empathy and love'. The book emphasises that this is a venerable old tradition, extending 'throughout history'. In the interview, Roberts underlined the point: humanism 'is not a new idea, but has a deep history going back thousands of years'. I #8217;m not so sure about this. Were there many scientific humanists two thousand years ago, dissenting from all local cultic traditions and signing human rights petitions? Our idea of humanism is tied up with the moral universalism that emerged in the modern West, and has Christian roots (as I recently argued in my book God Created Humanism). I also wonder whether the wonderful niceness of Alice Roberts is, as she thinks, entirely of her own making. I think her Christian parents have something to do with it, and their Christian parents too, and the whole semi-Christian culture that formed her moral assumptions. And I wonder whether this thing called humanism has any real coherence. Here #8217;s one definition she gives: humanists  #8216;look to scientific evidence and reason to understand the world. And they place human welfare and happiness  #8211; as well as the welfare of other sentient animals  #8211; at the heart of how they choose to live their life. #8217; This would be fine if it were true, or largely true, that religious believers discounted science and reason, and gave not a hoot for the wellbeing of others. The awkward fact is that plenty of religious believers are also clever and nice like you Alice  #8211; in fact you have more in common with a British Christian than you realise.

If the authorities want to see and query the findings of the internal investigation there's a mechanism for them to do that after the IICSA report on the CoE published last year.  gt; The NST will now initiate an active dialogue with the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel to ensure that the right cases are reported to them in accordance with the principles outlined in  #8216;Working Together to Safeguard Children #8217; (2018) and the local safeguarding transitional arrangements arising from the implementation of The Children and Social Work Act 2017.

    <TEXT>It depends if you consider Christian that which self-identifies as Christian or you look beyond that to the facts of their theology. I might self-identiy as French, use a few French words like "bonjour" and put the French flag in my Twitter bio and if you think that makes me French fair enough, although any reasonable person would know I'm not. It's what Mormons do with their religion. They use Christian language to give themselves some legitimacy but you only have to look a bit beneath the surface to know they're not Christian. You have to have either no understanding of church history or be wilfully obtuse to not be able to see how Mormonism isn't Christian, in my opinion. Personally I think anybody that can confess the Apostles Creed, Nicene Creed and Athanasian Creed can be reasonably considered Christians, which is the benchmark for a lot of people. Mormons cannot confess those creeds. Saying "oh well they call themselves Christians so they must be" is just weak and lazy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Article text: In about two years #8217; time, drivers on the m6 motorway will see something new. A giant 51m-high M #246;bius strip, illuminated at night, will rise just east of Birmingham, in the green belt. Known as the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer, it is supposed to spark questions about faith #8212;some of which will be answered in an attached visitor centre. Those who see it might ask another question. In a country that is fast becoming less religious and where building on green-belt land is extremely difficult, how did this happen?  #8220;I #8217;d put it down to prayer, #8221; says Richard Gamble, a former Leicester City fc chaplain who has been planning the monument since 2004, when he received a vision while carrying a cross through Leicestershire. There are more earthly explanations, however. The fact that Mr Gamble has won support and permission for his project reveals something about British religion, planning and driving. Since 1983 the proportion of people who identify as Christian has fallen from 66% to 38%. But the decline in religiosity is not quite even, says David Voas of University College London. Fervent Christianity has held up better than the lukewarm kind, because of the success of evangelical churches and immigration from more pious countries. Mr Gamble has been able to assemble a network of supporters and donors. Lord Edmiston, a successful car importer, Tory donor and evangelical Christian, provided the land. The Eternal Wall #8217;s huge scale perturbed planning officials, who delicately described its visual impact as  #8220;not localised #8221;. Some locals argued that it should not be built on the green belt. But, as the officials understood, the purpose of the green belt is not to preserve greenery. It is to prevent houses from being built. By checking urban sprawl, England #8217;s 16 green belts #8212;which cover 12% of the country #8212;have preserved land on which religious M #246;bius strips can be erected. If road-safety inspectors had objected, the wall would have been nixed. As it happens, they have become keener on enormous monuments. Drivers become bored on motorways: traffic accidents are thought to be common in the early morning and mid-afternoon partly because the roads are so quiet. One way of keeping them alert is to build things to look at. These must be big, otherwise drivers will strain to spot them, becoming distracted. The Angel of the North, a sculpture near Gateshead, is an exemplar. But as the Eternal Wall #8217;s backers point out, the angel, at a mere 20m high, is a stripling in comparison to the wall.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thrust of your post was that churches are a powerful social club that somehow abused its power and used it to bully the government into allowing them special treatment which is just an opinion, unless you have proof they abused their power to that end. I was wrong about the churches reopening date to be fair so I concede that. I wasn't thinking about when they reopened for private prayer, but the fact they opened for private prayer does at least imply churches can be for talking to God and are a bit more than social clubs, even though there's no doubt a sizeable group of people use them as such.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt they will, I think they're aware they can't to be honest. Just last week they passed a motion to create a compensation fund which could be as much as  #163;200m for financial compensation as well as debt counseling and I think therapy costs as well for victims although I'm unsure on that last one. As for changes, when the IICSA investigated the church/Peter Ball and released their report last year the church voted at their general synod to implement all 5 recommended changes by the IICSA. I could see them maybe resisting any outside group coming in to monitor safeguarding but I don't think the IICSA will recommend that if other changes are made so that it's not necessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pubs were lobbying politicians to open, shops were lobbying politicians to open, churches were lobbying politicians to open. That's just what happens. Maybe churches were allowed to open earlier for private prayer because it was believed that they could do so in a safe way rather than some conspiratorial theory about abuses of power. Is there any evidence that shows opening the churches a few weeks earlier helped spread the virus? I doubt it. The church opening earlier than pubs is no proof of any abuse of power in and of itself. It's far more likely it was just deemed safe to do so, which it seems to have been. No big evil church abusing power conspiracy.</TEXT>

They also wanted him banned from preaching in one place for 20 minutes or more, from going within 80 yards of an abortion clinic at all, using visual aids and standing on a box to elevate his position. So in the end it's not what the police wanted really. I think it's strange how in 2020 we're using yards for legal judgements like that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; the last thing I would want is someone trying to convince me of something I don't think I'll ever be able to believe Part of the NHS chaplaincy guidelines are that patients shouldn't be proselytised so this isn't a worry. Chaplains aren't allowed to just wander around the wards chatting to random people. Chaplaincy is all done by request. Hospitals are meant to make every effort to ascertain the beliefs of patients and let them know about the pastoral care available to them, so they can request the pastoral care that want. The issue is that for people of no belief there aren't nearly enough people offering that care. Religious chaplains are obviously tanned to support those people without proselitising but some people don't want that. The English guidelines are here in more detail if you're interested: https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nhs-chaplaincy-guidelines-2015.pdf</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can currently be Humanist and a hospital pastoral support worker. The woman running to be President of their thing is currently one, she is in charge of the Buckinghamshire NHS trust. If she was president not much would change practically (I don't think it's a position that comes with much power to change, its mostly figurehead as I understand it) but I think she'd be able to make people more aware they can request non-religious pastoral care and the benefits of that. At the moment I just think the system is a bit slow to change and irreligious people aren't as aware they can request that pastoral care. It's likely even if they did request it their NHS trust might not have a non-religious pastoral care person or chaplain but if the trust is aware of the rise in demand they'll be more likely to cater to that, perhaps. That's how I see it anyway, I may be wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What does the left stand for? Social democrats across the West seem stuck, unable to move beyond the binary option of centrist technocracy or revolutionary populism. Devoid of ideas and energy, the left suffers defeat and division while the right reinvents itself and rules. Missing from progressive politics is a sense of purpose beyond rights and utility  #8211; a vision of human flourishing anchored in fraternity and friendship. Such a vision can be found in Pope Francis #8217;s social encyclical  #8220;Fratelli Tutti #8221;, published on 4 October. The contemporary left lacks a distinctive conception of the good life. Appeals to left-wing values ring increasingly hollow. Of the three foundational values that have dominated politics since the French Revolution  #8211; liberty, equality and fraternity  #8211; the left has privileged the first two at the expense of the third. Yet without fraternity, liberty slides into individualistic free choice removed from the relational constraints of family or community. Equality becomes debased to mean either sameness or difference. As a result, the left is caught in an impasse between imposing uniform standards and promoting individualised identities. Fraternity itself has been redefined. Whereas it used to denote interpersonal relations embedded in decentralised mutual aid organisations, it has come to designate impersonal solidarity provided by the central state via top-down redistribution. In this process, the intermediary institutions of civic society lost much of their agency and were subsumed under the joint power of state and market. The left version of being free and equal abstracts from social roles and relationships. Over time this has led to left-wing support for free-market capitalism, extreme identity politics and an obsession with technology. Far from producing progress, these forces exacerbate divisions that have been decades in the making  #8211; rising levels of economic inequality, social fragmentation and family breakdown. But growing polarisation will not be resolved by doubling down on technocratic or populist politics. Instead, the left abandons its traditional supporters and keeps losing elections, as happened to Labour under Corbyn in 2019. To recover a moral compass, the left should heed Francis #8217;s call for  #8220;a new vision of fraternity and social friendship #8221;. Fraternity is a universal disposition, the idea that we ought to love every human being because we all have dignity. Friendship is a particular moral sentiment, the affection we have for those we encounter. Fraternal love enables friendship as the strangers in our midst become our neighbours. In the Pope #8217;s own words,  #8220;every brother or sister in need, when abandoned or ignored by the society in which I live, becomes an existential foreigner, even though born in the same country #8221;. Social friendship, he writes, creates a  #8220;true universal openness #8221;, as opposed to  #8220;the false universalism of those who constantly travel abroad because they cannot tolerate or love their own people #8221;. But it is not only liberal globalism the pontiff takes aim at. He rejects populist nationalism and its demagogic exploitation of fear in order to attain power. The constructive alternative Francis seeks to chart balances  #8220;love of one #8217;s native land and a sound sense of belonging to our larger human family #8221;. The pope #8217;s intervention is vital for the left as it tries to regain popular trust. Mindful of our fractured world, he calls for a more just sharing of the world #8217;s resources, care for our common home of nature  #8211; the subject of his previous encyclical  #8211; and compassion for migrants. Linking greater economic justice and ecological balance to social fairness will help the left to renew its ethical traditions anchored in the common good, beyond utilitarian or rights-based models. The left will also appreciate his unequivocal condemnation of Christians who are apologists of xenophobia, racism and ethnocentric atavism. At the same time, Pope Francis is determined to take the oxygen out of the  #8220;culture wars #8221; that are ripping Western societies apart. Against left-wing protesters who tear down statutes and dismiss whole cultures as reactionary, he reminds people to know their history, learn from the experiences of their elders and be open to the inheritance from past generations.  #8220;People who abandon their tradition, #8221; the pope writes,  #8220;and allow others to rob their very soul, end up losing #8230; their moral consistency and, in the end, their intellectual, economic and political independence. #8221; It is a powerful rebuttal to the advocates of  #8220;cancel culture #8221; and the closing of the progressive mind. Key to the practice of fraternity is a balance of rights with obligations. Selfishness enslaves us to our own fabricated desires, whereas caring for ourselves and for others makes us free. True equality involves a hierarchy in which the young have a duty to look after the elderly, just as the elderly are obligated to impart wisdom which the young cannot achieve on their own. The left forgets that the family remains the fundamental social institution that educates us into the social virtues of sacrifice and service on which citizenship and democracy depend. Social virtues rest on lived fraternity  #8211; relationships of  #8220;give-and-receive #8221; that give our daily lives meaning. The left can learn from Catholic social teaching a politics of the common good, motivated by fraternal love, that rebuilds broken societies. Such a politics starts with the things that matter most to people  #8211; their families and friends, the places where they live and work, the relationships of support and community that sustain them, and the institutions that provide security. Love, home, work and hope are the building blocks for the good life that fuses our individual fulfilment with the mutual flourishing of others. Fraternity is at the heart of the social fabric binding together communities and countries. The left needs to recover ethical traditions to be a force for good  #8211; gaining and retaining power to offer people a more dignified life.</TEXT>
