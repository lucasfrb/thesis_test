    <TITLE>How do I make a religious person quit their BS when arguing without them knowing I'm an atheist?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-15 22:32:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'll set an example of the kind of BS I have to go through. I have Asperger, thus I tend to be a very logical person. Once I was at the local church(I live with my parents and both of them are Christian), and one of the people there approached me with the pretext of wanting to ask what my mother can do to help them make my highschool more of a religious society(My mom has quite some influence over there). We were talking for a while, me trying to make them see that their point of view was flawed since you can't know a person by just looking at them and they trying to convince me that they'd be able to make everyone be happier by letting them know about God. I just turned the brain off, and told them while in auto-pilot "You know that you can't change their minds. This is a generation of atheists, and your old book's logic won't be able to change their mind" Their response was "But imagine a lonely boy that needs love, but everyone is rejecting him. God could just hug them *they go to hug a plant* like this" I replied with "No. It's not that simple" Then their answer was "But imagine God hugging like this *Proceeds to hug me(I don't like human contact)* a gay person, and curing them" At that point I was done and told her that if there was ANYTHING that pisses me off the most is the homophobic shit that goes on Christian churchs. My father called me and told them that I don't like being physically cornered(Not a lie, but he said that to back me up. I think he knows I'm an atheist, but I'll never bring that up) and I got extremely pissed when that happens. Later I was eating(Church lunch day) and minding my own business. This person sits in front of me and I tried to talk to them about something not religious to be on good terms. I brought up Eurovision, since I thought there would be no problem. They started saying how there was one song that made them cry on the inside because it promoted satanism. I knew which one they were talking about, and I turned off the filter and said "Your way of thinking and reasoning is wrong. You judge based on appearances and not on objective clues. There's a reason I don't like talking to you, and that's because you talk with faith, while I talk with logic." and went to eat with my dad. The thing is that I don't know if I handled the situation correctly, and I'd like to know if I should have said something else or not said anything at all</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for expecting a restaurant to not make me pay for a plate of food I didn't even touch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-05 16:19:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>The "I" in the title is not for me, but for PA(Possible Asshole)  #8203; Today I was eating at a restaurant with my dad, some friends of his and the whole dance academy(My sister dances at the DWC), and one of them pointed out that neither him, my dad or I had gotten our food delivered (We had been waiting for half an hour, and everyone else had already left). We had ordered two stews and a steak with fries(Which, by the way, weren't fried at all), and my dad's friend, PA from now on, called the waiter and asked what happened to our food. The waiter brought the stews and PA freaked out. It happened a couple hours ago, but I didn't pay that much attention, but I remember him ranting about how the stew had no veal, little to no ingredients, and that it looked a if it was half a dish for a person. He got even madder when he saw that my dad's stew had the exact same problem. PA went to demand an explanation to the waiter, and the waiter said that there wasn't enough stew to fill the demand, and that here in Portugal eating a stew like that one for such a low price(It was indeed low, around 5 #8364;) was a privilege and that he shouldn't be complaining. Pa stormed out of the restaurant and told us to not pay for his stew if they tried to get us to pay for it, since he didn't touch it and he returned the plate. We paid, and I left right then. Is he the asshole for not wanting to pay?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have this fan fiction that I started writing years ago. Right now I'm remaking it, and I've found myself wanting to add so much more details to the original story(Something usual I suppose), but I got stuck. I'm at a point in which the MC leaves her teammates because she's having psychological trouble with her "second personality", who is in actuality herself from a previous timeline in which she and all her friends got erased. Originally this was explained through exposition at the final chapter of the first part and it felt kinda rushed and forced. I wanted to change it, but I have no clue.

Some people have told me to not do it if I don't want to, but it's gotten to a point in which is no longer a choice.

    <TITLE>Yesterday I discussed with my dad about the implications of the existence of his God</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-24 15:24:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not gonna use a throwaway. My father doesn't know English and thus I can speak here no prob. We started talking about how the civilians need to know the law, and I stated there was a philosopher who said that no human should be punished for a crime they don't know was committed. Of course, he started talking about how God is just when we go to his judgement. About how God wouldn't judge us on a sin we didn't know existed... And then I told him "You know... I think God is pretty unfair. According to the Bible he created time and space, he knows what's going to happen, because he wrote it that way on the timeline, and he knows what sins everyone will commit before anything existed. Isn't it unfair that he punishes us for something that isn't actually our choice?" He starts telling me how I'm wrong because God gives us the choice to be better, and, when at first he may have set our fate as "being destroyed", this choice would also mean that he would have a change of heart and not execute his plan. I answered to that with a question "Then God gave humans a power beyond himself. The power to change fate. Is that what you mean? Because that would imply 2 things. One: He has no control over the timeline, thus his "Perfect Plan" no longer exists. And two: Having no control over the timeline implies that he isn't the almighty being that you think he is." He resorts to saying "Are you saying you don't believe God loves you?" Of course. Classic Christian. I told him "No. I don't think he loves me. As well as I can't love a character I created for an RPG who will die a horrible death for his "decisions" which I wrote myself." "But this is no RPG, this is reality." "Yes, as well a Matrix was a reality for those inside it" "Matrix is fiction, not reality" "But remember what happens in it? The strong-willed think they escaped it, when in reality they're just in another Matrix. With your God we are exactly in the Matrix. We have a determined path that we cannot avoid. We have our fate already determined, and even this conversation would've been planned by him." "But you're misunderstanding the word, son. God gave us a choice." "He really didn't. He created Satan fully knowing he would try to overtake him. He put the tree knowing what would happen. He told the unfaithful they would suffer for eternity knowing they would believe him. All of this isn't some smart plan. It's a linear story in which we take no purpose. We only exist for existing, nothing more. Our will is just a feeling, not a reality." He mumbled something about me misunderstanding the word, again. We left the conversation there and it's supposed to keep going today. I'm a little afraid of how he might've reacted to my reasoning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some context first: My sister dances, like, a lot. She just loves dancing, and her passion has gotten her and her team mates to international level. Every year she has to take an exam to have her current level be officialized, and either the documents or the money(Or both, I wasn't involved in this until today) have to be mailed apparently(Not entirely sure how it works).  #8203; My mom, who usually does this kind fo things, had to work the day they had all the documents; so she asked my dad. Her instructions were pretty clear: Take this to the post office on \[Other town\] TODAY. She thought that my dad would be smart enough to say "Well, since we're having our local festivities, the post office on \[town we live in\] won't deliver it until way later in the week." He wasn't. He went to our local post office and sent it. This was last week. Today, when me and my sister came back from school, she told my sister that the documents were sent out of the post office TODAY. The documents have to get to its addressee by tomorrow.  #8203; TLDR; My dad felt smarter than my mom and fucked up my sister's exam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My sister has never been good at maths. She's always behind most of her class, and I've always been her maths home tutor for years. Usually, when she's having trouble with an exercise or understanding a concept, I'm there to help. But today she's asked me how to solve a problem that gave her the following data: "You bought a box of sweets. Yesterday you ate 2/3 of the box, and today another 2/3. If there are 6 sweets left, how many were there when you bought them?" A simple problem, but I wasn't able to explain to her how to use equations to solve it. She's crying out of frustration and has decided she'll ask her teacher tomorrow. I know that's not bad, the teacher will always be a better option to learn from than her brother... But I feel awful for not being able to help...</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-08 15:24:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today, as usual, I didn't go to church. When he came back he told me he had to ask me something. He started by a simple "Why don't you go to church anymore?", which I hadn't prepared an answer at all. I told him I don't do anything there, so why bother. He asked why I don't do anything there. I can't remember the answer, I forgot what I said. After that, he started to tell me that I once was a kid who loved God, a kid who had accepted God on his heart; and that he had no doubt about it, but he simply wanted to know what was wrong. I answered that I wasn't able to love God. I had thought about why he does some things, and the answer I ended up with was never coherent with the idea of God. He told me that I should seek him, and before he could continue, I said "I can't. I don't feel like I'm able to love him. I've grown to not to anymore." "Why?" he asked. This ensued a conversation about how I have no faith in god anymore, and that I don't feel like loving him. Long story short, he said he's been aware of me not wanting to go to church, and I told him I'm relieved because I've been keeping how I feel about christianity for years and now I don't have to hide it anymore. He was shocked that I didn't tell him because I feared getting kicked out. He said that he knows some people do that, but that he wouldn't kick me out for this. As I'm writing this, I'm feeling the most relaxed I've felt in years. I've always hated sundays, and they've always made me feel nervous. Today I feel great about myself.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Basic tip for everyone: Don't be lazy about story event exclusive medals. You don't know when you'll get an unit that needs them</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-01 01:17:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Farm up all the medals you might need for an unit. If you don't have any of the family Kamehameha units nor LR Broly, you still should farm up all the medals you'll need for all of them as soon as the event is back. Don't worry about farming up medals for future units, since then the event will be back for sure. If you know a summonable unit needs story event medals, get them. Don't underestimate your luck, for you may get said unit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So... I've wanted to build my own fightstick for a while, and I have a few questions to ask</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-03 17:33:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>1: What should I look into when picking parts? What is the general terminology that I should be aware of? 2: Is there a way to make my stick compatible with Nintendo Switch and PS4? If not, is it viable to change the sticks parts easily in order to change compatibility? 3: When it comes to the shell of the stick, should I use wood or plastic? I'd really love to make my own fightstick, and I feel the effort I'll have to put into making it will be worth it. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was reading a pedagogical and psychological evaluation my school gave me a while ago, and when I got to the IQ page it said that since the three sections varied so much I'd have my IQ divided in three categories. Apparently I have an above average learning IQ(133), average communication skills(That being understanding what people say with or without words and being able to express myself clearly)(108), which I consider great considering I have Asperger, and way below average processing skills(73). Not trying to brag, because I don't think this is something to brag about. I just thought it was curious.</TEXT>

I've been able to see who only cares for themselves, who are genuinely good people, or even who is stupid enough to believe this is another hoax. Politicians over here in Spain have shown everyone what they really are. They are manchildren. Instead of seeking a way to save the country together they keep with their fighting, trying to score goals that don't matter anymore. But the worst of all I've seen, is myself. I hate how I am. I'm lazy, I don't care for my studies nor to look for a job. The only thing I do is stay at home doing the bare minimum to make my parents think I'm doing something and then screw around all day. I'm sickened by how biased and uninformed I am. I hate how little I know about the world. I'm truly sick by the fact that I always look for an excuse to procrastinate my homework(I don"t really know how to use that verb, so F it) Thank you for reading my little rant.

    <TEXT>You got dumb lucky. It's a 0,417% of getting an LR on a legendary summon banner on a single. On a multisummon it jumps to a 4,089% of getting an LR. Doing single summons also means you're shafting yourself off of an SSR. Sure, you might not use it, but it can have some value in the future. SRs and Rs are, simply put, fodder.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me tell you the tale of how an entire country's economy fell because of a dumbass leader. Felipe II of Spain had the hots for Isabel II of Britain, and eventually they went into a full on war. Felipe kept getting loans to finance it, and over the course of the war he hatched a plan. A Great Naval Army, capable of taking down the invincible Britain on a sea battle. It failed. It failed because, instead of putting a capable man to do the job to lead the army, they put a moron who decided that the best course of action was to go through the storm when one got in the way to Britain. The army was defeated by climate conditions without ever seeing the battle it was set to fight. It's now labeled ironically as The Invincible Naval Army, and it was the cause of a great depression for the country. It was a heavy blow that took several years to recover from. How does this relate to you post? Because this exact situation can be boiled down to a dumb dumb decision that could've turned Spain into a 3rd world country. It's not hard to recover from one dumb person leading the country as long as that person doesn't fuck up the entire economy. What is Trump doing? Fucking up the entire economy. Not just that, he is more concerned about his public image(Case in point, he refuses to show any kind of "Weakness") than how his country is doing. Instead of helping the citizen he enriches himself and the rich, and Spain knows very well what happens when you do that(Case in point, when the most efficient way of living was saving money, buying a property and living off the title of nobility alone, which led to the title of noble being less valuable and the economy to fall tremendously). That's why people compare the US to the 3rd world. It's about to become part of it unless anyone does something to prevent it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lynels are pretty hard tbh. You need good weapons and good armor, though you can cheese them with a bow, arrows and good weapons. Head-shot them, attack them, and when they shake their head head-shot them again. The guardians are just a matter of parrying their lasers(ZL+A to parry). The timing is getting them as close as they'll go by themselves and pay attention to the lighting before they fire. Once you see the lasers about to be shot wait half a second or so and press ZL+A. Do this thrice and you should be able to kill them. Be careful, because if you miss you might get your shield broken(If its defense stat isn't as high as it should be. The Hylian Shield is a great shield for this) You can Parry the Guardians Lasers with an Ancient Shield without the input. Just by holding shield. It's a little expensive, but definitely worth it</TEXT>

There are 2 main units there, which are called the "50% Supports" due to them giving a 2 ki 50% buff to allies in that are the same typing(AGL GT Pan supports S.Agl, TEQ 2nd form Cell Support E.Teq... and so on) The problem with them is that the banners aren't worth it and the coins they give only have the 50% supports as valuable units</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of, you NEED AGL 13 to be on a rotation with PHY 14 amp;15 before he transforms. Knowing where you will get super attacked is a huge help. Secondly, defense. Let STR Cell build up his defense for a few fases, and at around God Goku you should let him off rotation if he's not needed to tank. The Future Androids are the key to the run, since they both can reach over 200k defense before MUI(and even UI tbh). They'll be your emergency tanks when reaching MUI. Lastly, the main offensive units here are Android 13 and MVP 17. LR Cell does good damage but he's not reliable at all. Speaking of which, you should use his active skill during STR UI, since 14 amp;15 and MVP 17 take a LOT of damage during STR UI(MVP 17 with his damage reduction was taking over 100k from normals). During MUI, rotations should be 13+14 amp;15 and Future Androids. Be ready to break both rotations if needed, because if for example INT Cell is gonna take a lot of hits on the last slot you're dead unless you break rotations or use items(Which are a luxury. Try to save as many as you can for MUI). 14 amp;15 should take around 10k from MUI's normals and I suppose 200k from Supers(I honestly didn't bother testing that) if Fusion 13 is on rotation.</TEXT>

But please, at least consider listening to what he has to say. You're a grown woman, so you know what you want to do and what you don't want to do. I think he might have an apology ready for all the shit he put you through, or he might try to make you feel miserable. You decide if the risk is worth it. It's a 50/50 situation really. I'm voting NA.H because of this situation, not their past behaviors. Neither you, OP, nor us know if they have changed, so we can't judge their current actions based on that, and as it is right now I only see a woman who resents her parents(And rightfully so) for what they did to her, and two parents trying to apologise for what they did before the father dies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>AGL GF is far more reliable. He'll keep taking double digits from MUI, where TEQ GF would be taking maybe 20k from supers(I don't have him, so I can't really tell) Rotations: Beerus+Beerus amp;Whis and AGL Broly+GF. The MVPs here really are the Brolys. Thanks to them I never spent more than 4 turns on each fase. When you reach MUI you want one Broly on main rotation, and to be careful with TEQ Beerus(He takes 105k from normals without using items) Ideally you want to keep most of your items for MUI, and you should get a Broly friend lead that has a ton of crit, since a rainbow PHY Broly takes away 1,7 bars of health out of MUI with a crit(0,8 bars without crits) per super. Beerus amp;Whis are super helpful with their healing on super, and they've cleared a couple of fases, saving me a lot of items for MUI</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since he's non verbal you should try to establish a way for you two to communicate. Just simple messages. Like "do you want something?" "Is it this?" He might not answer with words, but if I'm not mistaken maybe some sound will come out of him, so you'll have to learn to interpret it. I'm not an expert, so maybe this tip is uncalled for, but I think that you should teach him how to communicate with people that don't know him. Eventually, he'll have to deal with teachers and classmates who don't know how he communicates, so any universal kind of language he can learn is useful. Doesn't really have to be words. Gesturing might do the trick for you. Again, I'm no expert, so you should ask one about this previous tip I said. Good luck on your parenting and feel free to come back here if you need advice on anything. Most important of all: Treat him with respect and love. Respect his boundaries, and treat him like a person. That's what really makes a difference</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're annoying for a reason. SS2 Gohan is super powerful, too powerful in fact. By having him restricted to a very specific scenario he can still be great while preventing the game from breaking. Not in a gameplay sort of breaking, but as a gacha Game. Think about it. Would it be worth it to pull on any banner that didn't have SS2 Gohan if he was that powerful? No. And it would be a long time before trying to pull any other unit would be better</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone already pointed out, the stance looks very wrong. For starters, a fighting stance holds most of the weight on one foot, to make it easier to balance when moving. Your animation suggests that not only there's no foot for the weight, it also has no balance even without moving. Secondly, her back arm is way too far behind her. It should be a little in front of her abdomen, and its movement should be more tight, since it's the arm one wants to have ready at all times. Having it loose might be dangerous when fighting. The front arm might need to be corrected too. The elbow looks a little more inside than it should. Also, the feet look like they're in a line(A line is when, with your stance, if you bring the back foot forward and the feet touch each other, your form is not good enough). The current stance is NOT one in which you could say "That's the style". The point of preventing a line is to avoid obstacles when moving or attacking. A wrongly lined stance can make your movement sloppy and your attacks a little slower. And I think that's it. Overall, a good pixel work, but needs to be corrected in order to be in a fighting game</TEXT>

And the only reason Link can kill Moldugas with no problem is bombs. The Gerudo can't use bombs. Even bomb arrows would pose a problem, since to hit that you need to take the Molduga out of the Sand. Do I think a Gerudo would have some trouble killing a Lynel? Sure, everyone has problems with them. Even the mighty Link has trouble with killing them. Good ol' Red Lynel on the Zora Domain gave trouble to both Link and Mipha, and remember: It was a red Lynel. They can go up to Silver, and even Golden, becoming far stronger and far more dangerous. The only reason Link can take them out easily on BotW is because, wouldn't you know it, game conventions, which surprise surprise, you've already dismissed</TEXT>

Mipha was the strongest Zora thanks to her healing, Daruk for his shield and bravery, Revali for his sheer talent and Urbosa for her lighting and sword skills. Link wasn't necessarily the strongest Hylian, just the only one with the Master Sword. For all we know he could be the 10th strongest there, but because he's the incarnation of the hero tough luck for everyone else</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for lecturing my friend about dogs and heat?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 12:56:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, a little context. Me and my friend always go run errands together, even if one of us doesn't have to, when we walk the dogs. Yesterday it was super hot, like +30 #176;C with no clouds, so no shadows. My dog had once a heat stroke and was super sick, and since then I do everything I can to not walk him when it's too hot outside. Yesterday, my friend was told to go buy some groceries when walking the dogs, and I was worried since it was so hot. Usually, when this is the case, we go walk the dogs and then go to where the other needed to be. That's how it's always been. Not this time apparently. We got there, no shadows for our dogs to stay at, so they started panting. After he got out after 10-15 minutes I blew up at him over how he should've first walked the dog and then go grocery shopping. He told me that it isn't that bad, to which I replied "Don't you tell me anything about heat and dogs. You don't know shit about it". He replied that he's from Mexico, that there a hot day is over 50 #176;C. I told him that he doesn't have a right to lecture me on how heat affects dogs, since he's the one who's never had his dog suffer from a heat stroke. This went for a while, until he told me "Listen, I know you care a lot about your dog, but this is too far. You care too much about him", to which I told him that I would NOT test the limits of my dog's heat resistance, not now that he's 13y/o. I can't imagine how a heat stroke would affect him now if he was that sick when he was 6. So reddit, AITA for lecturing him? Or for anything on the situation, really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, you have to summon for new units. But EZAs aren't usually for new units. They usually are for old ass units that most players have at least one copy in their box. Hell, the only banner unit to get an immediate EZA is Wrathful Broly, and his EZA is the easiest one and a permanent one, so after pulling him you can get him maxed with little to no effort. Every EZA contributes SOMETHING to the game, and they give a ton of rewards while giving a purpose to Zeni. And EZAreas, while different, follow a similar idea. Though only for F2P units or Hero Extermination Plan units. They limit the pool of units, but thanks to them we have LR EZAs, which have given us the three best F2P units in the game, all of which can compete with some summonable LRs</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-19 18:10:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Recently I've been trying to lose weight, and the first step is to, obviously, do some exercise. I'm trying to do between 5 and 10 daily KM(I know it isn't a lot, but it's been working). My parents are doing so as well, though they use a different route. Since I started doing this, they've told me that I should wear Sport Shoes instead of my sandals, but I refuse to wear them. You see, I have pretty wide feet. I despise having to wear shoes because they hurt my feet so much. I have no problem wearing them for shorts periods of time, but a solid hour of constant walking is torture to my feet if using shoes. With sandals I get to walk comfortably, and my feet don't hurt at all(aside from the usual numbness that comes with exercise of course), but they insist that I'm hurting my feet. AITA for refusing to wear shoes?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What #8217;s it like dealing with Autism on a day-to-day basis? I've been dealing with it for my entire life, so I wouldn't know what would be different otherwise. I don't think I understand the question.  gt;What methods work for you and help to deal with your daily experiences? I tend to be in autopilot for the majority of the day, so maybe that?  gt;What is a piece of advice you would give to someone who #8217;s trying to support a person with Autism? Reading an autistic person's body language is easy, so if you notice they're uncomfortable try to not overwhelm them with the thing that's gotten them uncomfortable. If you don't know what caused it, ask them. If they don't want to answer and look even more uncomfortable then stop that line of questioning and try to avoid the topic you were just on.  gt;What topics/conversations should people stay away from when discussing Autism, whilst also trying to show compassion? Don't say "You don't look autistic" nor start using "Autistic" as an insult to other people. It's really infuriating. As for literally everything else, depends on the person. Also, you may want to avoid large groups of people when with an autistic person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, the Japanese kanji(u/Goresh correct me if I'm saying dumb things) say something along the lines of "Saiya Person", but the kanji Jin is usually used to indicate the origin of something. Maybe them being fusions invalidates them as "Saiyajin" because their origin doesn't indicate they're from "Saiya"? I don't know, my Japanese is awful</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The transformation conditions were the main controversy. And Cell back then was THE worst DFE LR. Now he's still the worst DFE LR, but he's far more impressive thanks to the Link Lv Update</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think so. The 3Year LRs haven't aged one bit and are far more consistent. To get Cell's 8M attack stats you need to get 8 orbs, which good luck with that if you don't have orb changers. To get Gogeta's max attack stat you just need his best linking partner and some rainbow orbs. Same for Vegito, except he gets counters, which can potentially deal more damage than Cell</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm gonna be honest with you, I forgot that the LR SS4s were DFE LRs lol. Yeah, probably either Goku or Vegeta holds that title now. Back then Cell was... Not really good. He was good, but there were a lot of shit that needed to happen to have him be good. Now he only needs orbs. The SS4s are... Good on every situation except SBR, but they still need orbs to be good defensively. Also, I said he is the worst DFE LR, but I still like him. He's one of the first I got to Lv10 because he got me out of so many tough spots</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Proper care and management? Install the Luma updater and use it as soon as a new version of Luma(The cfw you have) is out. Also, FBI is your friend. It'll allow you to install games without the need of going through the e-shop. To do that you need the game's .cia file. The usual way to get those is to dump them from the cartridges themselves(Of course you don't need to do that to get one lol) Twilight Menu++ is the best thing to ever happen to the 3ds hacking scene. You can run .nds files without much lag, so essentially it's a flashcard inside the 3ds. Move the .nds files to the /SD/roms/nds folder and you're good to go. Look up some tutorials about Godmode as well. If something fatal were to happen, Godmode would be your best option to revert it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA. Look. I'm also on the spectrum. My dog has been with me since it was a puppy. He's my best friend and I will be extremely hurt once he dies. BUT I never did ONCE take care of him when he was a pup. That was my parents' job, and now that I'm an adult I can take care of him and the new puppy we got. I can't imagine what I'd done if I had to take care of the first by myself without ANY help. Hell, the new dog would be hell to take care of if it wasn't because my parents are here to help. Your parents sound like dumbasses and incredibly stupid assholes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Get 6 multishot bows. Any kind of multishot bow will do. Get a royal guard weapon and go to the riverside stable. Equip any weapon that isn't your royal guard weapon. There, you want to unsheathe a multishot bow with an electric arrow(Don't shoot). Once unsheathed, enter your menu and drop it. Equip another bow and repeat the same process until links model in the menu doesn't load properly anymore. Now, equip your royal guard weapon, pick up your bows if you want and go talk to Parcy inside the Stable. She'll give you a gem for the royal guard weapon WITHOUT taking the weapon.

    <TEXT>Not here to try to change your mind, but there's one moment I can't stand even though I love the show. There's an episode in which Leonard and Penny are going through a hard time(Leonard seemingly has stopped trying to be thoughtful with Penny), and Leonard fears this might be the end of their marriage. Sheldon makes a rude comment, and Leonard replies "I would throw you out of the car but... If Penny leaves me you're everything I have left" And they played fucking laughter. WHAT. THE. FUCK. What was supposed to be a touching and sincere moment was apparently played out as a joke? Do the writers and editors talk to each other? At least write a memo or something???</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They are trash right now. They have no purpose in the game other than giving us access to the Hero Extermination Plan EZArea. I guess they'll eventually get an awakening and an EZA when all the characters from the Hero Extermination Plan get their EZAs, so I made these concepts. I had to hold back a little on Whis, since... Well, you know. Realm of Gods. For Whis I was hesitant to give him a buff on that full heal, so I turned it into an active skill and buffed it. This way, players would be able to decide if they want to heal or not. There are scenarios where you don't want to heal(Mainly, HP+turn restriction units), so I think that would add a little flavor AND give a reason to use him over STR Whis. Whis gives Ki to realm of gods because, as of now, there isn't a support for Realm of Gods that gives any ki, but I didn't want him to give too much ki(Frankly, I don't think Realm of Gods needs that buff, but the Beerus cards do)  #8203; Now, for Hatchiyack... He doesn't have categories nor good links. I gave him Thirst for Conquest so that he links better with LR Baby, with whom he'd share a whopping 4 links. The same reasoning applies for giving him Big Bad Bosses. For that, as well, before anyone says it doesn't make sense to give him that link, he could be considered the final boss of his movie/game/whatever that was, and since the link is actually Boss Characters, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it to him. His healing effect is crazy good. I struggled with whether to keep it like that, buff it or just nerfing it for the sake of balance. I decided that, since he only has 2 categories as of now, it's not like he'd be extremely OP everywhere.  #8203; I hope you liked their concepts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we want to be fair, we have to consider how good they are on every situation. Gohan is consistent across the whole game. Cooler needs a decent linking partner and to face a Saiyan(To be fair, that's over 95% of the game) to be on a similar level. Now FRIEZA is a really good contender. He doesn't really need good linking partners to be great, and being able to get his transformation turn 1 makes him far more versatile than Gohan, who'd have to wait until turn 4(Was it 4?
