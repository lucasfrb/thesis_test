    <TEXT>Have fun playing it, it's really well made! I absolutely loved how they packaged the switch edition of the game. I thought they will skip adding the little trinkets (the map, stickers etc) because the switch game case is too slim and small for that. Instead they've put the game case in a paper case just to add the additional stuff. They really meant when they said that everybody who will ever buy their game, no matter how long after release, will get the same treatment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At first I thought the question was about how to not feel like you want to die. Whoops. I don't want to die of old age. When you live to be very old there are so much things going wrong within your body even the pathologist can't say why you died. After 80-90 years of living the human body start to deteriorate to the point where you begin to rot while still living. I really don't want that.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about the Griffin in White Orchard</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-06 12:46:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Short: It seems to me that the difficulty of killing the griffin in White Orchard can differ even at the same settings. Is this real (if yes how does it work) or am I just hallucinating from playing it too many times? Long: So a few weeks ago I've got my friend to try and play tw3 and she's, well, a bit inexperienced at playing games. I warned her about the griffin beforehand, bc it's the first tough(er) enemy in the first few hours of gameplay and I didn't want her to be intimidated (she's still anxious about combat). To my surprise the battle went really easy and was a fast victory and she was very happy (so far so good, we will play together more). But I was wondering, did I remember the fight wrong? So when the game was released on switch I took the chance to see about it when starting over (new console, new game, here we go again). And I think I was right, the griffin's moveset and behaviour differed. The main differences were: \- the griffin didn't target her at all, Vesemir could completely distract it and was doing actual damage to the griffin // it would instantly aggro at me, chasing after me and paying Vesemir no attention \- different moveset/patterns, it would not do any unique attacks, only wing attacks on ground // trying to knock me down from the air by flying low + lot of scream attack Both games were played on the same difficulty settings</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny thing is that I remember it was easy at the first try. Then it got really hard on my the second and third playthrough. I've just realised what might have made the difference tho, it was easy when doing it early in the game while still at starting level, and got really hard when I did a lot of sidequests before and got to level 5-6 or so before taking on the griffin.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>21/F/EU - Looking for Battlefront II friends</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-29 12:37:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Short story: I'm looking for people to play Star Wars Battlefront II together like a nice, friendly and talkative team that doesn't take the game too seriously Long story: I've recently bought sw bf2 because I heard that despite the massive backlash at its release, the game got so much better since then and I wanted to give it a try. And it's great! I really enjoy playing it, but since it's my first multiplayer game, I have no friends and it feels really lonely this way. :( I'm looking for friends who could show me how to get better at the game and don't mind that I'm unexperienced. I would like to play together regularly, but only at weekends because on weekdays I'm busy with my college studies. Also I am a bit shy but not because I don't like talking - I would love to talk about anything with you and get to know you better - it's because I have an accent I am strongly self-conscious about. That's one of the other reasons why I would like to get into party playing, so I could overcome that. So if you finished reading all of this and you are interested and you aren't disheartened by this oddly specific post, please leave a comment!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think medicine is always about IQ and higher intellect. I have a lot of good friends who aren't the sharpest tool in med school but I've still learnt a lot from them. The way they talk to patients or how they handle difficult situations really inspires me to try and be a better person. So if you are looking for ways to grow and improve yourself, don't just concentrate on the subjects and the curriculum, school is not real life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>International student here, I really would like to have my residency in Canada</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 19:57:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>This gonna be a long story but &#8203; I am from an Eastern-Europe. After I finish school, I would like to leave the country as soon as possible and find myself a better new home and Canada just seem so perfect! I'm only just starting the 4th year in medschool, but I want to start thinking about my future already. I think you can never start that too soon. &#8203; The information I gathered so far is that I will need a permanent residency card, a MINC number and I'll have to take the NAC and the MCCEE exam to be able to take part of the CaRMS residency match program. Did I get all of this right? Honestly this process seems very difficult, can anyone tell me how much time it would take to get a residency match, in case I even get one? Also because I still have some years till residency, do you think I would be able to get myself a mentor in Canada? I mean doctors or other studens or residents who are willing and would help me find out how things work there and show me around because I don't know anything. Where do I even start finding such a person? I really would like to know somebody from a hospital who would allow me to spend some time in canadian hospitals, like an internship, but unpaid of course during my summer vacation. Just to get myself known there and also to find out if I could find my place there. I'll be very thankful for anyone who answers my post, thank you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a little disheartening. I knew it was very hard, but this much... But even though it's very hard it's not impossible! That is why I'm also looking for a mentor, because if they know my name they are more likely to hire me. Also I will need recommendations to maximize my chances of getting a match. Also what specialties count as prestigious for you?</TEXT>
