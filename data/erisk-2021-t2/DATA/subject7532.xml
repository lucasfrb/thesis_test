    <TEXT>So I work in a butcher shop and after I come home our younger staffy is scared and won #8217;t come near me or let me touch her until I shower, even then she #8217;s still a little skittish if it #8217;s after work. Whereas the older staffy loves how I smell after work and can #8217;t get enough of me. The only thing I can think of is the youngest is from a pound and maybe some bad smells there. Any answers here?</TEXT>

I #8217;m running icespire peak for 4 friends and we are in our 4-5th session and everyone is having fun but I think I struggle to bring everything to life. Making dungeons and characters matter more I think. I wanted to start homebrewing but I don #8217;t know how to mix home brew in with the already going story. I think if I homebrewed my own world I would be more into and bring it to life more. Any advice would help heaps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess the way it is in our game is the town acts as a hub for new quests more than anything. They simply head into town get a quest buy some stuff and head off to the next quest. So I #8217;m not sure how to make the town matter more. My end game plan is to have cryovain slay the town but I need to make the town more meaningful to the party.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve dm #8217;d Icespire peak for a group of friends who I don #8217;t really think got the grasp of the game properly. Or at least not to what I expected(It was also my first time playing/dming). I want to try again on a new adventure but I want to try and really get them into character this time. What are some good ways to introduce their characters to each other and also give them a reason to stick together and want to travel the world(I #8217;m going to use Wildemount sourcebook). And also a good starting quest that would bring their characters together per say. Thankyou  #128522; Edit: Thankyou everyone for your advice. Ive definitely worded wrongly in my post. I #8217;d like to get my players more engaged. But everyone comments have already helped a lot.</TEXT>
