    <TITLE>Diminishing returns...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-03 22:15:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been on this earth now for thirty-six years (give or take a few months) and I think I've pretty much run out of steam. I've been watching as my ability to feel joy, my ability to have hope has slowly eroded until now I don't even bother getting out of bed. My life seems to be following the law of diminishing returns. Every year is worse than the last - I achieve less, I do less, I feel less. At this point I am effectively just taking up space. Right now, all I want to do is sleep forever. So, at what point do I call it quits? If this is the rest of my life - lying in bed, not working, not doing anything, only ever eating at the insistence of a friend or partner - is there much point sticking around? The worst part is that I remember what it used to feel like. I remember how great it used to feel - working, achieving things, having a future. I miss living like that, but for the life of me I can't seem to get it back. I've had to watch it slowly evaporate until it's dried up completely and now I just want it to be over. I'm honestly not sure what I'm asking. I guess I want to know if things can radically change. Is it possible that if I stick it out, something will go right and everything will get better again? Is that a thing that happens? Are there happy, successful people who didn't start to get anywhere until they made it through a 30+ year downward slope? From here it doesn't look likely, but that is what a suicidal person would say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much what it says on the tin. My depression has reached a point where I no longer enjoy doing anything. I no longer want to do anything and the only time I'm content is when I'm drifting off to sleep. I think that's why suicide is so appealing right now. I know it's not, but from here it looks like just going to sleep forever. Is this something that can be fixed? Is there a pill that can repair your ability to enjoy life, or a therapy that can give you the desire to get up and do something when you wake up?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I'm a psychopath so I think about killing people on a daily basis. Actually doing it tho is a lot of bother and most of the time it's not worth it. Closest I ever got was when I was 15 and my stepfather was being abusive. I couldn't figure out how to do it without getting caught - knowing that it's very difficult to get away with murder when you're known to the victim AND have the motive. So I gave up on it and just waited til I could move out. For what it's worth, I noticed when I was about 11 that people don't have to force things like empathy and that I needed to decide if I was going to become a serial killer or a decent person. I chose option B. Ever since then I've made an active effort to develop something that I assume must be pretty close to empathy. It's not an instinct - I have to figure out how to feel in my head first - but my friends generally think of me as very empathetic so I guess it must be working.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If by "normal" you mean how most people feel, then no. Most people have some sort of instinct for human empathy. I'm a sociopath with a lot of ASD overlap, but basically I have no innate empathy for other humans. It wasn't until I was about 10 or 11 when the penny dropped and I realised that most people just kinda "know" how to feel about other people - it's not something they have to figure out in their head first like I did. By the time I was 14 I was at a crossroad where I had to decide if I was going to end up a serial killer or if I was going to try and become a decent person. So I just chose to study how people feel about people - how they react  amp; interact emotionally. The good news is that I'm not a serial killer - my friends generally consider me very empathetic and emotionally intelligent. There's lots of things that still baffle me, and I've still got to think about how I'm supposed to feel beforehand, but I think I've reached a point where I genuinely care about people in my life. We're all different - for you it might be entirely an Asperger's, sensory processing thing. But the point is empathy is something you can learn if you don't have it naturally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been turning it over in my head for a while now, and there's no other way to say it: I am a terrible, terrible human being. I've got everyone in my life thinking that I'm a wonderful person, but it's all just targeted bullshit. I lie, cheat and manipulate people. I don't really care about anyone outside of what they can do for my lazy ass. Everyone thinks I'm this tender, sensitive flower but I'm a fucking sociopath and I know it. I don't even know why I'm writing all this. I guess, just once in my bullshit life I want to be honest. I can't see a way out that doesn't just involve more twisted half truths and bald faced lies. Not unless I kill myself. I know it's cruel to the people in my life, but surely it's less cruel than what I've been doing to them so far. If I leave a note then maybe they'll realise what a horrible, manipulating bitch I am and won't feel so bad that I'm dead. I should tell them all to their faces, but I'm too chicken shit for that. Haven't decided when or how, but it has to be soon. Something gentle and clean. Sleeping pills, maybe. I'm not worth saving, I just wanted to see what it felt like to be honest for once. Turns out I don't even care.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Empath or Psychopath?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-27 23:49:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>It might seem strange, but I'm pretty sure I'm one or the other. I've been struggling with my emotions my whole life. Some of my earliest memories are of being baffled by how emotions work and, in particular, how does empathy work. By the time I was 12 I had more or less concluded that I was a psychopath - that I had no empathy at all, and simply had to fake it. And because I didn't want to wind up a serial killer, I worked really hard to create what I thought was a pretty good copy of genuine empathy. Then, a few years ago, I decided that after a lifetime of keeping my psychopathy secret, I was going to start being open and honest about it. I "came out" to a few close friends as well as my therapist, not sure how they'd react. They were all completely gobsmacked. They described me as an emotional sponge, someone who can't help but soak up the emotions around her. If they thought the mood was oddly tense or sad, they'd look to me because I'd be the first one to show it, like a kind of emotional barometer. For a long time, I thought that I was just really good at faking it. Then a close friend suggested that the reason I felt so cold and emotionally isolated was that I get so overwhelmed by the emotions around me that I've had to basically block out everything. She likened it to a person with hypersensitive hearing having to wear earplugs all the time. She thinks that my problem isn't that I have no empathy, it's that I have too much. As a teenager, trying to understand empathy, one of the most confusing things for me was how people could go about their daily lives when there's so many people around them in pain. Like there are millions - billions even - all over the world. How does having empathy for all these people not just drive you insane? Maybe that was my problem. I just don't know anymore.  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your thoughts. I guess I just didn't (and still don't) understand selective empathy. Like, if someone sees a person who is suffering, what does it matter who this person is? Why is your friend's suffering getting to you, but a stranger's isn't? The interesting thing is I've been in two abusive relationships - both were extremely emotionally abusive. My therapist says that psychopaths don't generally get into emotionally abusive relationships (except as the abuser). If a psychopath found themselves being bullied or manipulated, they'd just walk away. In truth my memory is pretty badly fragmented from that period, so I don't really know what was happening. But if it's all true and I'm actually an empath, why do people's feelings baffle me? Why don't I care that I haven't heard from my mother in weeks, or that my ex misses me, or any of the other things I'm supposed to feel? Why do I feel dead inside?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, you could be me. Especially the part about not being able to do certain jobs. One of my first jobs was doing telemarketing - I lasted about half a day. The whole thing made me ill. I couldn't understand how my co-workers could just wear all the abuse they got. The only advice I got was "don't take it personally" (a phrase that, to this day, I really don't understand). I suffer from depression, too. It triggers a lot of very self-critical thoughts and is often the time I feel most like a heartless fake. I can't deal with big crowds at all, about four or five people is my limit. I can do bigger groups for short bursts, but it takes a lot out of me. I've had all sorts of diagnoses, including BPD, GAD, PTSD and Bi-polar. I don't know if any of them fit. I'm sorry you've had to go through all this. I often think that the world is falling apart because the people who could make the biggest difference are the ones being crushed under it's weight. It rewards callousness and prejudice and punishes empathy and trust. These days I live with my partner on the edge of town. I'm not on social media, I don't watch the news or read the papers. I'm the classic reclusive writer. I hope one day I can find the strength to be part of the world again, but right now it's all just too much. Take care  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In theory, you could bleed out in as little as 30 seconds, but that's highly unlikely, unless you're a professional surgeon. The arteries in the wrist are very difficult to get to, especially if you're working without anaesthetic. I tried it once. Even with my "alarmingly precise" cuts (to quote the emergency room surgeon), it wasn't enough. By the time I was rescued, about 2hrs after the initial cuts, I had only just entered stage 3 (about 20-25% blood loss, shivering, rapid heart rate and breathing). From the way the doctors talked about it, I was unlikely to have died. Above 30% blood loss, your body goes into shock which causes extreme vasoconstriction of the extremities. The most likely result was that I would have lost one or both of my arms. So yeah, not recommended.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Up until relatively recently, depression was divided into two types: Major Depression and Minor Depression, also called Dysthymia. Major Depression was described as short to medium stretches of intense depression that is largely debilitating. Sufferers can generally do little more than lie in bed and cry, and will frequently stop eating, bathing etc without support. These periods were typically (though not always) episodic, and people could often experience periods of complete remission. An episode could be as short as a single day or as long as several months. Dysthymia was described as chronic, long-term depression that, whilst less intense than major depression is more persistent. Sufferers can typically function in some basic way, but have a generally low mood, and often describe it less as a sadness and more an inability to feel joy. Because they can function to some degree, people with dysthymia may not consider themselves depressed, simply lazy, bored or disaffected. Here's the kicker, tho. Despite the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder being much more severe, Dysthymia actually has a considerably *higher* mortality rate. Whilst the intense and episodic nature of MDD makes it easier to identify and treat appropriately, the chronic nature of dysthymia, combined with the social pressure to minimise symptoms and continue to function, makes dysthymia like a sort of mental water torture. In this sense, dysthymia is perhaps best described not as minor depression but as cumulative depression. These distinctions however have largely fallen into disuse, partially due to the high co-morbidity of the two and the frequency of one turning into the other. Furthermore, as medicine evolves, the treatment of both disorders (once clearly distinct) is becoming largely equivalent. Lastly, depression is a particularly difficult thing to quantify, and attempts to do so are often inadvertently judgemental to some degree. People who are diagnosed with minor depression are often perceived as being less in need of treatment, and less at risk, when this is demonstrably false. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm on the autistic spectrum, and also possibly an empath. Based on my experience, this is my theory. It's definitely possible to be both autistic and an empath, but it's a weird combination. Here's why. One of the more common symptoms of ASDs is to have problems "reading" people. It can be difficult to identify the subtleties of a person's expression. Understanding how someone is feeling based not on what they say but their body language, tone of voice etc can be challenging. This is why Autistic people are often perceived as socially awkward, lacking in empathy and emotional intelligence. When you throw being an Empath into the mix, things get weird. The empath part of you might absorb the emotions of others around you very quickly, but the autistic part has trouble understanding where they come from. You might feel an intense sadness because your friend is depressed, but when you ask them and they say "everything's fine", your literal, autistic brain gets very confused because you're missing the subtler signs that indicate they're not actually fine at all. Autistic Empaths can therefore have a lot of problems emotionally, as they're constantly absorbing the feelings around them, but can't always trace the source. Because of this, they might be incredibly reclusive and antisocial, or have issues with depression, anger or anxiety. Autistic Empaths will often favour people who are very open with their feelings and shy away from those who hide their emotions under a stoney fa #231;ade. Personally, I have largely suppressed my empath nature because it's simply too much. I can't see through the fog of emotions around me because I don't know where they're coming from. It's an incredibly confusing state of affairs. I tend to avoid gatherings of more than a few people, and can only really talk about anything emotionally charged on a 1-to-1 basis. I'm extremely conflict adverse and have had to step away from being politically engaged. I am, however, an expert at diffusing situations and putting people at ease. It's hard and has really limited my life choices. I'm not on social media, I can only do quiet jobs where I don't interact with many people. I can't deal with telephones because I can feel the person at the other end, but can't see them. I don't do sports, or even watch sports, because I can't deal with the intense waves of opposing feelings. It might just be my particular spot on the spectrum, or my flavour of empathy, but it makes sense to me to think of it in this way. Thanks for letting me ramble.  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

And the stupid thing is, it's all totally unnecessary. I'm not even covering anything important. Literally no one would care either way what the truth actually was. But for some reason I still had to lie about it. Maybe I'm so insecure I can't just admit that I'm boring and average. Maybe I get off on manipulating people with my bullshit. It doesn't really matter, I suppose. I'm a rubbish human any way you look at it. Pretty soon it's going to all implode on me and all my friends and family will hate me. If I had any guts or integrity I'd confess everything then kill myself. But if I had guts and integrity I wouldn't be in this position. Maybe I'll put it in my note. "Dear friends and family. Everything about me is a lie. The person you loved never existed." Ugh. I hate myself. X</TEXT>

    <TEXT>CBT and Mindfulness don't work for everybody. The therapist community is moving away from things like CBT because it places them emphasis on being active and productive, rather than being, you know, happy. Healthcare services tend to fund it because they have to justify their budget in terms of "getting people back to work" and other bullshit metrics that view people as consumers. I'm not saying getting back to work is bad, or that CBT is useless, but for a lot of people it's a very superficial fix that doesn't address the source of their unhappiness.</TEXT>

I can't kill myself - it would destroy them. These amazing people who've never given up on me. But I apparently don't care enough about them to stop being a worthless parasite for five seconds.

    <TEXT>I recognise a lot in your story. I had a similar experience recently - slashed my wrists in a warm bath and woke up the next day just wanting to try again. These days I spend a lot of time sleeping, and when I'm awake I'm mostly just killing time before I can go back to sleep. I wish I had some sage wisdom for you, but I don't. I first tried to kill myself at 15 and the urge has never really gone away. I will say that I've survived a lot of years since then and not all of them were terrible. Some were good enough that I'm glad I lived long enough to see them. And I too was totally convinced they would never come. I don't know what the future holds for anyone, and maybe it is nothing but crap, but you'll never know what little surprises of happiness the world might throw your way if you choose to end it. I wish you all the best and hope you're able to stick around, even if it's just a little bit longer. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've felt like this the past few years. Every year I start it thinking "This year is going to be better" but it never seems to work out. But I've been here before - strings of years where things seem to get worse. But every now and then it bounces back. Sometimes just a little, but it can happen. Not enough to make me jump for joy, but enough to keep things interesting. I'm not trying to give you the "it gets better" line, because I know it doesn't always, but I guess I've swapped my hope for curiosity. Even if the rest of my life is a shit show, and it might well be, I kinda want to see how it plays out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Poly is hard. Really hard, and it's not for everyone. If you haven't already, you should check out r/polyamory - they're a pretty helpful bunch. It sounds like you have serious anxiety issues - are you in therapy or on meds? Anxiety basically takes all our problems and amplifies them, so you might find your feelings are clearer if you can get a lid on your anxiety. I know that's easier said than done, but it's a way out that's not suicide. As always, my best advice is just be as honest as you can about everything with your partners. Nothing in a relationship is ever made better by not talking about it - especially in poly relationships. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel very much the same. I'm bipolar (or BPD or MDD, no one seems to know). Meds never seen to quite work, they just drag things out. I've got no real reason to be so miserable - I've got friends and family and an education. And yeah, I've been abused too, but I honestly don't think it caused me to be this way (not that any of my therapists have ever believed that). I'm not going to say "life gets better" or "you have so much to live for" or any of the other clich #233;s. I guess I just want you to know that what you're feeling doesn't make you a bad person. If dying is really what you want, then I understand, but you don't deserve it. I think you're incredibly strong to have made it this far and I'm proud of you for that.

    <TEXT>Your story really resonates. You sound like me. Right now I feel like I'm living for other people who I've somehow managed to hoodwink into thinking I'm a decent person. I'm a toxic person, I know it. And every time I think I've made a step towards balancing the scales I do something that reminds me just how much of a shit person I am. But then I think "There are loads of shit people in the world. Like really horrible shit people who are way worse than me and they all get to live long prosperous lives." And then it occurs to me that maybe we're all shit people. All of us. Maybe if people knew what went on inside my head they wouldn't say "you're a horrible person" they'd say "holy shit, me too!" I can't tell you what the point is. All I can say is that I'm almost positive that the world is nothing but shit people trying and failing not to fuck up. And as long as you're trying, then you've earned your right to stay in this world. x</TEXT>

Maybe you feel this way because your one of the few self-aware people who can be honest with themselves about how much of a fuck-up they are. Maybe the only difference between you and people who stumble blissfully through their lives is that you know it's all bullshit and can't unsee it. I heard a theory that depression is a sane response to an insane world, and that the question isn't "why are are you depressed?" but "why is everyone else not?" I tend to think that's pretty close to the truth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People react in all sorts of ways to the thought of a loved one wanting to kill themselves. Sometimes it can make them feel inadequate that they weren't enough to keep your from trying. Others get angry and might see it as a betrayal. Others still might simply feel overwhelmed at the thought of someone they love feeling that way. I doubt she's gone forever, but she probably has a lot of feelings about it that she's struggling to process and she may just need a little bit of time. It's probably harder for her to deal with than either of you expected but she won't simply vanish from your life forever. She may just need a bit more time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is definitely a good thing you got rid of your creepy bf. It was a courageous act and you did the right thing. I know what you mean about not being taken seriously. I graduated at the top of my year whilst cutting myself between classes. I got into a very elite university and was doing very well right up until I tried to kill myself. Nobody understood. Everyone seemed to think that I had just had a bad day, and that everything would go back to normal. It took me along time to make people understand that for me this was normal. People like to think that things like depression, suicide, all consuming emptiness and self-hate only happen to "crazy" people. They like to think that it's easy to spot them. They like to think that as long as they have a job and a house and a family that they're immune. They don't like the idea that someone smart and successful would want to die because they've gambled their happiness on their own success. I'm sorry you're feeling alone. Sometimes we try to isolate ourselves because we feel like our friends are safer if they don't care about us. But they're not. You can't protect them by pushing them away, and even if you think you have, they don't stop caring about you. You're not as alone as you think you are. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it possible that the reason I'm depressed is that I want to be depressed? I seem to do things that I know make my depression worse. I feel like I look for excuses to be depressed and I seem to deliberately avoid and ignore things that might help me get better. I thought it was a sickness that made me apathetic, but now I'm thinking I'm not sick at all, I just like being miserable. Maybe because it's easier. It's easier to lie in bed and cry instead of getting up. It's easier to starve myself than make food. It's easier to stare at the wall and hate myself than it is to stand up and try to make my life better. My stepfather said that I'm just lazy and pathetic. I'm worried he was right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried it once and it changed my life. I was feeling better in a few days and out of bed in less than a week - eating and showering and doing things without being prompted or forced. It made a massive impact on my life. If you look at my post history you can see it (go back a few years). The flip side though is that I was undiagnosed Bipolar. After about a month I was manic, a few months later I was rapid cycling like a motherfucker. After that I was having dangerous mixed episodes that led to a suicide attempt and a hospitalisation. So, hard to give a review, exactly. But definitely give it a bit of time - it can work wonders. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a lot of meds. Things I'd be wary of would be manic episodes and sudden suicidal ideation. You probably won't get seratonin syndrome from this mix - effexor acts more as an SNRI than an SSRI, but definitely talk about it with your doc if you're worried. At one point I was in Effexor, Remeron and Wellbutrin and it worked up to a point, but eventually sent me off the deep end. My advice it to tell the people around you and get them to keep and eye on you. It's not always that easy to know from the inside things are going south and your friends and family might have a better perspective. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you find that you experience depression but are also wired you might benefit from a mood stabiliser. One thing I do with my creative projects is that I tell lots of people, get people involved. It's easy to give up on something when it's just you, but it's harder to do when you've made promises to other people. One other bit of advice. When I'm manic my ideas tend to run away with me and they end up blown out of proportion and ultimately too big to realise. Making sure your ideas are practically achievable is super important, especially if you don't have loads of money or people who owe you favours. Think about your limitations, but don't let them scuttle your projects before they start. Find that achievable sweet spot. Good luck x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do this too, and to be honest it's not a problem in its own right. It depends a lot on the context. Like, how are you choosing your partners? Are they respectful? Are they people you can trust? Are you using protection and/or being generally safe? There's nothing wrong with meaningless sex, and if you're enjoying yourself there's no real problem. But you said it leaves you worse than before - is this because of the experience itself or how you feel about yourself afterwards? Is it something like shame or embarrassment? Or is it more about the emotional connection (or lack thereof)? I go through phases when I just need lots of sex, but I have friends and partners who understand my needs and why I have them. Most importantly they treat me respectfully, don't cross my boundaries and take care of me afterwards when I need it. As long as everyone is on the same page and communicates, there's no problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, it's hard to say. I'm more or less permanently suicidal. Every time something goes wrong in my life, not matter how insignificant, my first thought is "kill yourself". Forgot your keys? Kill yourself. Missed the bus? Kill yourself. Lost your Netflix password? This is such an alive person problem. It's been like that since I was 12. It never goes away, but what changes is my reaction, which can be anything from "shut up brain, you're not helping" to "you make a persuasive argument brain". I haven't figured out the trick to making sure it's one and not the other, but being honest about it with the people around you so they can help shout down the stupid voice in your head is helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hard to say. As a general rule, if you can get it prescribed, it's not that dangerous. Doctors tend to limit the medication they prescribe to below fatal amounts. Plus anything you take regularly you will have developed a tolerance for. The biggest problem with trying to OD is that your body is generally smart enough to puke it all up. Fancy drug cocktails for euthanasia always include an antiemetic to prevent the copious vomiting that comes with an overdose. ODs are pretty low on the list of successful methods, and can be really fucking unpleasant. I ODed once when I was younger and it was awful. I don't recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been called "high functioning" before but I'm sceptical about the concept. I haven't heard a good explanation of what high functioning means that sounds convincing. For me, it's about the balance between depression and anxiety. Sometimes the anxiety of not doing anything is worse than the depression and I can't just lie around. Sometimes it's the depression that's worse and I can't do anything *but* lie around. If I didn't have the anxiety I might just lie around all the time. But it wouldn't make me any better or worse at functioning, it would just look different. I guess it depends on what your depression looks like. If it looks like catatonia - if you stop eating and going to work/school then you might not qualify for 'high functioning'. But if it looks more like being a robot on autopilot - stumbling through a grey fog, then the 'high functioning' label might apply. Hard to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trying to hold a job down whilst having depression is very difficult. And yeah, it's largely a capitalist problem, but that's another issue. Depression isn't deliberately malicious, but it makes falling into bad situations very easy and getting out of them very difficult. Most importantly, you're not doing any of these things on purpose. The fault is in the illness, not in you. Even if it doesn't make a huge practical difference to know it, it's important to remember that it's a symptom of an illness and it's not you just being lazy or an asshole or whatever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depression is an illness and it doesn't discriminate. It doesn't give a fuck who you are or how great your life is or how many people care about you. It doesn't care about your academic achievements or how much money you make or how many awards you've won. Sure, all that shit is nice to have. And sometimes you can leverage it to get through the day, but not always. History is filled with talented, successful and beloved people who all died from Depression. I've got a lot going for me, but I've also got a lot going against me. What's interesting to me is that my depression doesn't revolve around the parts of my life that are shit. It attacks the good things - the things I'm thankful for, or proud of. It eats away at them until they may as well not be there. I don't need an illness to make me feel bad about being broke or divorced or whatever. Depression's power is that it makes me feel bad about being loved, or being successful. So don't feel like your depression is somehow invalid because you "should" be happy - that's exactly what depression does.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You write really beautifully. I totally connect with what you're saying. It's really hard when your measure of success is surviving the day, but doing it in the face of depression is an achievement, and you have the right to be proud of it. I'm sorry your mother hasn't been supportive. Parents want nothing more than to protect their children, but the flip side of this is that when they come across something they can't protect against, it can send them into a tailspin. Sometimes parents just pretend it isn't even there, but other times, parents like to think they actually do have the solution, and if their child would only follow their instructions, they'd be fixed. It's ironic that they take their instinct to help and wind up doing the least helpful thing they could do. But your mother's fucked up coping mechanism isn't your fault. It's not your job to make her believe you - it's her job to get over her own shit and believe you. You're not a bad daughter, and no amount of being a "better" daughter (whatever that even means) is going to fix your mother's issues. I know it's hard when you're in each other's lives constantly, but try not to look at yourself through her eyes. I think you're an incredibly powerful person to have made it through everything with such clarity and honesty, and I hope you continue to write your truth. xx</TEXT>

A year later, I wrote letters to those same 11 people, basically thanking them for helping me stay alive. Survival is a mixed bag. I felt good about making it through the year, but also sad because in a lot of ways, nothing has changed. I think about why I tried to end my life, and most of those reasons are still true. And I'm still suicidal to some degree most days. I still have plans. I still have notes. But I also still have friends. I know that at this point in my life I'm mostly living for other people.

    <TEXT>I've kind of done this before. When I was a teenager I had this plan to just leave a note and disappear. I was going to move to France, come up with a new name and basically become a completely different person. I never went through with that plan, but I often wonder how it would have turned out. Later on in my 20s I was going through a severe manic episode and decided to up and move to the other side of the world. It was a terrible decision at the time but somehow I got ridiculously lucky and it worked out really well for me. If things hadn't gone just the right way it could have been a disaster. However, one of the things I learned from the whole experience is that you can't outrun yourself. Starting a new life didn't really change who I was, it just changed the scenery. It didn't fix my mental health issues, it didn't change my personality and it didn't make me a better person. Despite all of that, I will say that I'm definitely glad I did move. My life is better in a lot of ways because of it, I've had opportunities I never would have had and got to find parts of myself that I never would have found. I'm still a bipolar mess, but somehow it's a little easier to handle. But here's the thing - if your alternative is suicide, then literally no idea is a bad one. If what you need is to end a chapter in your life, or transform into a new person then do it. For sure, there are good and bad ways to go about it, and I'd urge you to sit down and come up with a workable plan rather than just blowing caution to the wind, but metaphorical suicide is always going to be preferable to actual suicide. Whatever you decide, take care. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you're going through all this. I'm not going to tell you not to cut/drink/whatever because I know sometimes it feels like our only way to get through it. Not having people you can talk to, having a partner you can't trust, these things make it all so much worse. I don't know why you feel you can't talk to your friends or family, and maybe you're right, but sometimes people surprise you. Really, talking about it makes a huge difference. If you can't talk to your friends, sometimes talking to strangers works. I don't know what resources there are where you live, but sometimes you can find free or low-cost support like counselling and group therapy. There are often support groups for sexual assault survivors that are free. Either way, if you're surrounded by people with whom you can't be honest about your feelings, then honestly you need new people in your life. Being in a relationship with someone who doesn't love you is never good for you. I know this is all easier said than done, finding the right kind of friends and having the right kind of support network around you will change your life. Most importantly remember that the people in your life don't define you. Just because your boyfriend doesn't love you doesn't mean you're unloveable. Just because your friends are difficult to talk to doesn't mean you're not worth listening to. Take care xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally get your instinct to spare your friends from having to deal with your own problems, but in my experience it usually backfires. They always just end up feeling bad for not being there for you or not somehow being psychically aware of your feelings without you telling them. Because it's not something you can keep hidden forever. It might feel like you can, but it's not sustainable. Trauma is definitely something you can't ignore, and you should definitely try and find some kind of support for that. It's a complex thing and difficult to navigate alone. There are some good resources for survivors - even just on Reddit. I hope things get better for you.

    <TEXT>I'm sorry that happened to you. It's important to know that it's not your fault. Being abused by your partner is not your fault and has nothing to do with who you are or mistakes you've made. She was the abuser and that's on her. Unfortunately, relationships - even the healthy, non-abusive kind - are complicated and not everyone knows how they feel. Just because it didn't work out with this new girl doesn't mean you fucked up. It's not all down to you. You could be the coolest, smartest, most lovely guy in the world (and you might be) but if she's not in a place where she wants a relationship then it isn't going to work. One of the things that abusers are very good at doing is making you feel like it's your fault. That you're a fuck up and everything bad that comes to you is all you deserve. Even after the abuse is over, it's something that we carry with us, and it can be hard to let it go. Have you talked to anyone about it? I mean, like, a professional. Having friends you can talk to is super important, but there are some things that are best dealt with by someone who has a lot of training and experience in this sort of thing. Abuse scars can run really deep. I hope you're able to move on and find someone new who will love and care for you. In the mean time, remember that it's not you. It's not your fuck-up. It wasn't your fault then and it's not your fault now. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this was just a rant, but I wanted to say that you're not a monster. The older I get and the more I learn about depression, it doesn't work that way. Most people who think they're terrible people aren't - they're amongst the most kind and loving people you're likely to meet. They feel awful because they have trouble seeing the good parts of themselves. They set up impossible standards for themselves and then hate themselves when they fall short. I guarantee you you're not a burden. No human being is. Needing help and support is not the same as being a burden. You're a person - not a sack of potatoes. Depression lies to us. It finds all our insecurities and imperfections and throws them back at us, touting it as "proof". But it's not you, it's the illness, and unfortunately it is very good at clouding the reality of your life. You could receive the Nobel Prize for Awesomeness and your depression would still be there telling you that you don't deserve it, that everyone is wrong. Because that's what depression does. I've known a lot of monsters in my life. A lot of them are too fucking clueless to even know it. But honestly, most don't give a shit. It's kinda why they're monsters. If you were actually a monster, you wouldn't be writing things like "I wish I was a better person". That's not something a monster thinks. Monsters think they're the bees knees and that everyone should feel privileged just to know them. You're not a piece of shit. You're not a monster. And if your depression is trying to convince you you are, then that's a pretty good sign that you're not. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there. I just wanted to say something that I wish someone had said to me when I was a teen. Your teenage years are not the prime of your life. Being a teenager is one of the hardest, most gruelling experiences of your life. It's a baptism of fire and getting through it is fucking hard. Being a teen with depression is a fucking nightmare. I was a teen with depression and I nearly didn't make it. Being a teen was seriously horrible. And I had a relatively easy time. I had friends, a good family and did well at school. And I still spent most of my time wanting to die. That fact that I got through was a miracle. But I also wanted to say that things change drastically after school. It may be difficult to see from here, but life changes so radically in your twenties (and even thirties) that you won't even recognise it. I'm not saying things get better - sometimes they don't - but I can promise that things get different. And if nothing else, it's worth sticking around just to see what they turn into. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm glad I could help. You definitely shouldn't feel embarrassed about being a man who's been in an abusive relationship. Abuse isn't about gender. That said, I know it can be harder to open up to people about it and find support because it feels like it's somehow less serious. But it isn't. Abuse is abuse. Society likes to front that men are just naturally too tough to be abused, but ironically, it's the sensitive and empathetic ones who get caught in cycles of abuse. I know there are support groups and services specifically for male survivors - if you're worried about how you'll be treated if you open up about it, I'd recommend seeking them out. Actually, I'd recommend it either way. Take care, and tell your brain to stop screwing with you. Our brains can be such assholes sometimes. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Getting the right meds is complicated, and can take a long time - especially if you're someone who is resistant to SSRIs. Dosage is complex as well, because higher dosage doesn't always equate to less depression. Having too much seratonin can be as bad as having too little, so it's less about just upping your dose and more about finding your sweet spot. You're probably on a low dose because you're on two antidepressants at once which can be synergistic (as in be more powerful than each one put together). When it comes to meds, the best thing is always to talk to your psych.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Short answer is yes. It depends what happened and how seriously everyone is taking it. Not all attempts leave evidence. You step out in front of a car and it swerves and misses you. You take fifty pills and down it with vodka only to throw them all up before they've dissolved. You climb over a barrier but get talked down by a random stranger. These are all things that have happened to me. Sometimes you're too ashamed or embarrassed to say anything. Other times you do tell someone, but it's hours or even days later. The problem is not everyone believes you, and the ones that do don't always take it seriously. Others think the best thing for you is to go back to normal life and not dwell on it. Especially with kids, parents often want to pass it off as teen drama rather than deal with the frightening reality that they almost lost their child. They may not have even taken her to see anyone at all. The thing is, maybe this kid didn't try to kill herself but wants people to think they did. And honestly that's not much better. It's a cry for help and if everyone keeps ignoring her, the next time she might try for real. The worst thing you can do for someone like that is dismiss it as "attention seeking" as if that's somehow less serious or less deserving. Because, for a person in that situation, if talking about it isn't getting anyone's attention, the next step is often to do it. Either way, this girl needs support and if she doesn't get it, her behaviour is going to get more dangerous and more desperate.</TEXT>

Sometimes killing myself seems cruel and selfish, but other times, NOT killing myself seems cruel and selfish. Unfortunately, whilst friends and family can be a safety net, and a great support network, they can't "fix" your depression. It's something that needs to come from you. And that means finding ways to love yourself. If you're anything like me, your loved ones have probably told you hundreds of times about all the things that they value in you, and also like me, their words have just bounced off you disappeared into the void. Trying to let those words in and allowing yourself to believe them is hard, but it can help you move on from living for other people and start living for yourself. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went on California rocket fuel, then later added bupropion. Initially it was a tremendous success, but I was undiagnosed Bipolar 2 so things pretty soon went south. It triggered hypomanic episodes, severe rapid cycling and horrific mixed episodes where I basically went completely nuts. I can't say I recognise the drunkenness, but I went through moments of brain fog and clumsiness. My sleep was the opposite - I had chronic insomnia, but it often left me groggy during the day. Not trying to diagnose you, but it's a pretty potent drug combo, so it can do weird things. My guess would be that it the results could be quite unstable in a lot of circumstances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way I see it, you don't need to do anything to justify your sexuality. No one ever tells straight people that they need to justify being heterosexual. There's a burden of proof that's put on queerness as a way of delegitimising it. Especially when it comes to women, bisexuality it often devalued as being performative or explorative, and women are fed all sorts of shit about what they need to do to qualify as queer. I've seen women who've had same sex relationships for years get told that it was "just a phase". You said something interesting - you said when you masturbate you look at women, but that you know a lot of straight women do this. I'm just going to throw this thought at you: Maybe straight women don't do this. Maybe the women who do this are queer, but have all been told it doesn't count. No one tells this shit to men. If you're a guy and you wank to other guys, you're a queer - end of story. Society isn't interested in owning and controlling male sexuality in the same way as female sexuality. When men drunkenly make out with each other at a party, no one tells them they're just doing it to get some girl's attention. You also mentioned your "bisexual feelings", and if I'm honest, being bisexual isn't anything more than just having bisexual feelings. This might be coming across as a bit politicised. And it is - the personal is political. But it's not an accident we have these standards. They don't come from some innate part of human nature - they're social conventions and it's worth exploring where they come from, who might be benefiting from their enforcement, and what would happen if you decided to challenge them. Ultimately how you define your sexuality is up to you, but don't fall for the line that there's some minimum requirement for being bisexual. There's no "you must be this queer to ride the bi train". Just be honest with your feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh girl, I feel you. Honestly, my solution has been to just have lots of hot friends and fuck them. But I realise that's more of a long term plan. I guess my number one piece of advice is Stay Safe (and I'm not just talking protection). I did a lot of really fucking stupid shit, so I know how difficult it is to take that advice, but make it your number one rule. Personally I'm big on communication. I find that a lot of the time if you go to someone you trust and just say "hey I'm hypersexual and I want to fuck you," you'll generally get an honest answer. Just make sure they know that it's a bipolar thing and that it will likely pass in time. Also, this might be moot right now with Coronavirus, but something to consider in the future if you have the money - sex workers. They're good in bed, non judgemental and you don't have to worry about making things weird for them. Maybe camgirls/guys/people? Other than that, I'm not sure what to say. If getting yourself off isn't working, maybe get more creative. I've had some incredibly elaborate and satisfying wanks whilst hypersexual, but maybe it's just me. Some people have suggested things like yoga and meditation but that never did much for me. Wish I had more for you. Hope you get some kind of satisfaction. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not going to say that thinking and feeling the way you do definitely makes you bi. But I will say that it's very common for bisexual people to go through the same experience you are. The truth is there's no such thing as being "really bi". Your feelings are what they are. Maybe you really really like women, or maybe it's just a general desire for intimacy that spills over into other genders. Or it could be anything in between. Just be honest with your feelings, and if, at the end of it you decide that the word bisexual suits you better, then go with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Both pan and bi have quite fluid definitions and people pick one or the other for different reasons. Personally, I choose bi over pan because I feel pan gives the impression that I'm attracted to the entire gender spectrum, which is not really true for me. That's not necessarily the same definition that everyone else uses, but it's the one that my brain works with. Either way, I think as long as you know how you feel, being flexible with the language based on the situation is totally legit. So, yeah, you can be both, or sometimes one and sometimes the other.

I'm openly queer and poly and bipolar and literally no one in the whole city cares. These people are out there, just hold on a little longer.  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who judges you for being a virgin is a walking piece of shit and not worth knowing. Virginity is a bullshit social construct invented so society could own people's sexuality. It's totally meaningless. If you want to have sex because you want to have sex, that's totally legit, but it's also okay to not want it. I'm ranting a bit but I'm trying to tell you that you're allowed to be you. You don't have to justify your existence to anyone, and if people are judging you it's because they're pathetic insecure assholes who can go fuck themselves. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's hard to have perspective when you're depressed. We tend to over blow the negatives and ignore the positives. And when it comes to mental health, sometimes people can be tactless. I don't know your situation, so I can't say for certain what the reality is, but in my experience there are very few horrible people. Most are just struggling to cope with a bad situation. I think you know yourself pretty well, and if you feel like a good person who's just struggling to deal with their depression, you're probably right. Remember, depression isn't a licence to be a dick, but it's also not who you are - it's just a thing that happens to you. If your friends genuinely care about you, then talk to them. They should be able to see you're struggling and want to help you deal with it better. As long as you're willing to own your shit and learn from it, they should be able to meet you halfway and extend that extra bit of understanding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you're in this place. Especially as someone who has worked so hard to help people with with their own problems as you have. First, I think you know this already, but this guy is toxic and doesn't love you. If he did, he would trust you. You say you can't give up this chance to be happy. I've got some bad news for you, buy if you're considering suicide because your boyfriend doesn't trust you, then this isn't a chance to be happy. You're not losing your one true love by breaking it off. The only thing your losing is years of unhappiness with a possessive jerk. I know it's easy to say and to hear, but there are other, better people out there. People who will genuinely love you and not treat you like property. Toxic people are good at making you believe you'll never do any better, but it's not true. You're an incredibly empathetic person and he's using that against you to make you doubt yourself. It's happened to me and all I can say is that once you get free you'll be astonished by some of the things you put up with. You deserve so much better than this asshole, and you will find it, but you have to get rid of him. I know it's hard when you've invested so much but the loving relationship you're so attached to doesn't really exist. I'm sorry to say this, but it's time to turn that powerful empathy of yours inward and love yourself. You support hundreds of people just like you. Would you tell one of them to stay with a man that makes them suicidal? Think of what you'd say if you met yourself. Ask how would you support someone in your position and then say it to yourself. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just going to throw this at the wall and see if it sticks. You're not too sensitive. Empathy is a wonderful, powerful thing and the problem isn't your sensitivity, it's everyone else telling you that it's wrong and that you should care less. We live in a world that caters to the desensitised. So if it feels like society and the media is balling up all the pain and suffering in the world and cramming it down your throat, it's because it is. There's actually research into this - a small percentage of people are uniquely sensitive to things around them. The terminology is " Highly Sensitive Person", but some people who are more spiritual refer to themselves as Empaths. The research is not without its controversy (what isn't?) but maybe look into it. I know there's an r/Empaths but you can always just Google it. Yeah, in some ways it's shit. You feel every sad feeling around you. But it can allow you to have incredibly deep connections with people. It's a gift and a curse and if it's all to much to deal with then I understand. But don't let anyone tell you you're"too sensitive" - there's no maximum amount of empathy you're allowed to have. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you're in this place. One of depression's cruelest tricks is to rid us of the strength and desire to make things better. It can make finding a reason to live very difficult. The only thing I can think to say is that you don't need a reason to live. Reasons aren't what justify your life. I'm not saying this to minimise what you're going through, but depression can often try to convince us that we need to somehow prove we deserve to live. But that's all bullshite. You're a person and you deserve to live and be happy and you don't need to qualify for that. xx Also, side note: hanging is fucking horrible. I do not recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, my first bit of advice would be to reassess your relationship with this guy. Not judging, but when you say "he's not a fan of my sexuality" that rings alarm bells for me. Maybe I'm reading this wrong and just projecting all of my biphobic exes onto him, but it sounds dicey. Second, there are lots of flavours of polyamoury, so I'd probably suggest just thinking about your feelings. What would an ideal relationship look like to you? Whatever your picturing, it probably has a name and there'll be people doing it who can give you advice. There are lots of books and sites and primers you can read to get all the details, but start with your desires. Ignore the theory and the academia for a moment and just ask what exactly do you want?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing about polyamoury is that it's not about whether it's better, or morally right. Neither monogamy nor polyamoury is inherently superior. The point is that monogamy is merely social convention. It's not hardwired into us, and it's not some critical element of human nature that holds the fabric of society together. It's merely cultural institution, and people should have the right to opt out if they find it doesn't suit them. Things like saying "it's just like having more than one friend" aren't justifications. They're not the reason polyamoury exists. They're just analogies to try and help people understand how it can be done honestly and ethically, and give you a sense of why someone might choose it. And like all analogies, they're imperfect, so don't dig too deeply. Loving children is obviously very different to loving a romantic partner, and personally I wouldn't say that's a particularly good simile. Anyone who tells you that polyamoury is in some way better or more natural that monogamy is full of shite. But the reverse is true, too. They're just different ways of organising your love life and people should have the right to go with which ever way speaks truest to them.</TEXT>

Society tells us that we're somehow more worthy humans if we "achieve" something, but what counts as an achievement is heavily prejudiced. Society tells you you're a worthwhile human if you start a big company that churns out useless bullshit and makes you rich, but being a kind and empathetic person who enriches the lives of the people close to you apparently doesn't mean shit. So you don't have a career? Fuck it. You don't need a career to be happy, and having one doesn't make you a better person.

I wouldn't expect anyone to just go back to normal after that, no matter how much time you've had to "process" it. Things like that leave permanent scars, and you'll always bear them. My advice is to stop looking at it as something you can recover from, and think of it in terms of learning to live with it. You shouldn't be expected to somehow revert your mind and body to the point before it ever happened. It's not an event, it's a part of your life and for better or worse it's going to stay with you. I don't want this to sound like your cursed, because you're not. There are ways to handle these things that make us stronger better people. But you've got to work with it instead of against it. If you're judging yourself by your ability to leave it behind you you're going to be unhappy, because it will always be there in one way or another. You're not a failure for it. There's no such thing as a right way to grieve. How long it takes, and what you do to find happiness is entirely your own path, so don't berate yourself for not adhering to some bullshit standard that says you must be totally fine with it after x number of days/months/years.

    <TEXT>Sexuality is a funny thing. Your feelings don't really care what label you give them. Yourself going to be attracted to whomever you're attracted to. How you label it afterwards is less important. I'm not saying "labels are bad #8482;" - it can be useful to have a framework to better understand your feelings, and sometimes it can feel nice to know that what you're experiencing has a name and is common to lots of people. But bisexual is a very fluid and wide ranging term that covers a lot of ground, so there's no universal bisexual experience. There are no bi police enforcing the ancient bi code. So maybe you'll find more women in the future you're attracted to. Or maybe not. You may decide bisexual describes how you feel now, but that might change, and that's okay too. If you need something more specific, you can look into other definitions like biromantic, pansexual, demisexual, asexual and grey asexual, bi-curious, heteroflexible. But the important thing is feel first, label after. (Fwiw, I'm a bi-romantic grey asexual, but I'm also bipolar, which means I cycle between being total asexual and full blown hyper-omnisexual. Is that even a thing? No idea, I'm just making up words at this point.)</TEXT>

No amount of life insurance or college funds is going to make up for losing you. I understand why you're angry with your husband. I was angry with my friends too. But if you're trying to somehow convince people (your husband, your kids, or yourself) that your suicide is somehow justified by logic or fairness then it's not going to work. Depression and trauma sit in our brains and pretend to be all logical. They're very good at spinning convincing arguements that we're better off dead. But it's a kind of self-gaslighting. You don't deserve to die. You deserve to heal, and there's never a point where that becomes out of reach, no matter what the demons in your head tell you. I know this probably all seems pointless and unreachable, and I know what it's like to be so exhausted with life that no amount of happiness seems worth the effort. And I'm not going to give you the "it gets better" routine. But there's nothing you can do to make it okay to kill yourself.

    <TEXT>I totally relate to your story - it's very familiar. It's definitely related to being bipolar. Lots of people go through phases of hypersexuality during mania/hypomania. I'm like you in that I'm mostly into women, until I become hypomanic when I suddenly I need dick. It's not uncommon. Best advice I can give you is don't judge yourself. Do what you can to stay safe, not just sti/protection wise but with who you hook up with. The instinct of self preservation can go out the window when we're manic, (or worse, when we're having mixed episodes), so try to ensure you have some kind of sanity check in place. But honestly, if every now and then you need to fuck a whole lotta people, then that's fine. I'm lucky to have friends and partners who I'm close enough to, so that when I need this kind of thing I can just call them up. And honestly it's great. But I've also done some very stupid, dangerous shit in the past, too, so be careful. Just keep to the SSC rule - safe, sane, consensual.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. In my experience, at 25mg you're unlikely to get any antidepressant effect from quetiapine. You typically need to be above 100-150mg, but the sedative effects really ramp up around there so it may not be what you're looking for. Lamotrigine is much better with depression but is don't think it has a huge effect on mania or anxiety. It does help with rapid cycling, so if you find yourself bouncing around a lot then it might be helpful. I'm on 100mg quetiapine and 200mg lamotrigine and it's probably the most effective med combo I've had. My energy is a little low, but it's a definite improvement overall. However, I didn't have a lot of issues with irritability, so I don't know how relevant my experience is for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to hear you're dealing with this. The thing is depression doesn't actually give a single fuck how privileged you are. Depression will tell you that you don't "deserve" to feel bad because of how great your life is or whatever. But depression is a lying bitch who says that shit just to make us miserable. There's no point at which you become so privileged that you're somehow immune to depression. It doesn't work like that. Oh and if any person tries to tell your life is so wonderful and you're not allowed to be depressed then they're an idiot who doesn't know what depression is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The whole "you don't have any reason to be depressed" thing makes no sense. Of course you have no reason to be depressed - that's what depression is. If you had a reason to be sad it wouldn't be depression. It would be like grief, it would a healthy natural emotional reaction to something bad. Depression is sadness without a reason. You're depressed because you have depression. Hope that helps  #9829; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The whole "purple isn't a colour" is a complex and fascinating bit of optical science and colour psychology. In a strict scientific sense, there isn't a single wavelength of light that corresponds to purple - so that part is true. But saying it's not "real" (ie it's imaginary) is a little misleading. I mean, ultimately all colour is imaginary - it just photons vibrating in the air. The fact that our brains have chosen to take that phenomenon and craft it as the experience of seeing colour is entirely arbitrary. Furthermore, the process of juxtaposing two separate wavelengths of light into a single colour is not limited to purple. This is constantly happening in nature. There are flowers that we interpret as being yellow that aren't really yellow at all - they're actually simultaneously red and green and our brain is just squishing the two colours together into one. But if you were a butterfly (which have much more complex colour vision) you'd see the flower as it "truly" is, because the light would activate the red and green sensors in your eyes, but it wouldn't set off the yellow sensors in the middle (which humans don't have). This kind of thing is constantly happening because our brains can only understand things as being a single colour at a time. But that's not really the way light exists in the world. Think about sound - our brain can distinguish multiple different wavelengths at the same time (it's how we experience musical chords, or isolate voices from background noise). Now imagine if our ears couldn't do that - if our brains took every sound we heard and combined it all into a single tone. That's basically what our brain is doing with light and colour. So ultimately "colour" is a purely subjective human experience, just like sexuality. Each person has dozens of different "wavelengths" within them (their body, their expressions, their voice, etc), but your brain combines it all into the singular experience of "attraction". And maybe purple is the best metaphor for the bisexual experience - we can be attracted to elements from across the entire spectrum which can combine into a unique experience that couldn't otherwise exist. And just like people can quote science and say purple isn't "real", people often try to deny the truth of the bisexual experience by claiming that it's objectively impossible, without realising that there's no such thing as objective attraction. Bisexuality it more than just being gay and straight at the same time. There's a subjective experience - a unique colour - that you can't experience unless you are able to see two ends of the spectrum within the one person. That's my take anyway. PS: As a fun experiment, if you want to know what a purple object should really look like, get yourself a pair of those cardboard red/blue 3D glasses. The way your brain overlays the red from one eye and the blue from the other is kind of like what it would really look like if we could see two colours at once.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's complex but it happens because we experience colour as being a closed spectrum (what people refer to as the colour wheel). But it's not actually a wheel. Red and blue are at the opposite ends and don't connect to become purple. Red keeps going into infrared and blue keeps going into ultraviolet. When yellow light hits our eyes, we detect it via both the red-sensitive and green-sensitive cells in our eyes, so our brain places yellow in between red and green. Same thing happens with cyan light (between blue and green). Sometimes our eyes detect red and blue light coming from the same object and goes through the same process of creating a colour between the two which we interpret as purple (technically magenta). But there isn't actually a single wavelength of light for magenta (such a wavelength would have to be simultaneously lower than red but higher than blue). Magenta is created in our brains by the simultaneous detection of red and blue light. (This is analogous to the way that paints and computer screens can trick our eyes into seeing yellow by mixing pure red and green light). Hope that makes sense.</TEXT>

Lamictal has really helped me level out. I'm not on trazadone (taking seroquel instead) but the only thing I'd say is be a bit patient and watch your skin. I got a bad rash on lamictal but when I backed the dosage off it went away. Lamictal can take a while to settle in, especially when you're coming off antidepressants so give it some time.

    <TEXT>Yeah, it's called bi erasure and it sucks. The history of it is actually quite sexist too - bisexual women are seen as just performing to gain the attention of straight men and aren't "really" queer. A lot of people will tell you your sexuality is invalid, both straight and gay, but it's bullshit. Saying you're really straight because you're dating a man is like telling a lesbian who's single that she's really asexual because she's not dating anyone.

    <TEXT>CBT isn't for a lot of people. It never really helped me much either. Someone tried to explain that it wasn't about saying "just don't be depressed", but it's about identifying, observing, interrogating and challenging the negative thought processes that can lead to cycles of depression, and using pro-active techniques to interrupt those processes and redirect your emotional trajectory towards happiness. I said that just sounds like "just don't be depressed" with extra steps. In all seriousness, CBT has a chequered history. It's a kind of "fake it til you make it" technique that focuses on your behaviour, rather than your core feelings. A cynical person would say that it's because society at large cares less about how you feel - they just care about whether or not you can go to work and be "productive". It suits the contemporary model of depression as a social sickness - that if you look at the world around you and don't want to participate, then you're mentally ill. It's why most mental health facilities (including doctors and therapists) are mainly concerned with getting you back to work (or school or whatever your contribution to society is supposed to be). Even the diagnostic criteria for most mental illnesses, including depression, specify that it must interfere with your ability to contribute to society in order for it to really count. I could rant more about how capitalism promotes the valuing of human productivity over human happiness, but that's a whole other thing. My point is just that CBT isn't all it's cracked up to be and that you're not just being difficult by saying it doesn't work for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a lot of pressure on bisexual people to "pick a side", and it's not just from straight or gay people. We often have internalised a lot of biphobia and that can lead to us needing to assert our sexuality. Even when we say we're comfortable with being bi, it doesn't make it easier - we still often feel the need to express ourselves in that context, and that can be difficult. If you're a lesbian, expressing your sexuality can be done as simply as kissing your girlfriend in public, but if you're bisexual it's much more complicated. Unless you're polyamorous and happen to be out with both your boyfriend and girlfriend at once, you can't just "behave" like a bisexual and feel validated. It's why gay and lesbian culture is so heavily coded - it gives you ways of being (hairstyles, clothes, mannerisms, etc) that you can use to assert your sexuality even when you're single. Bisexual people don't have those, and it's easy to feel erased when everything you do will get you labeled as either straight or gay. The best advice I can give you is to validate her feelings. Remind her that her sexuality isn't less valid just because there isn't a simple social code or convention she can display to tell everyone she's bi. The other thing I'd say is to step up and be her advocate. If someone refers to you as a "lesbian couple" don't let the responsibility fall to her to correct (or ignore) it. If you're the one who steps up to challenge those moments of bi erasure, she'll feel better supported by you, and feel more validated in your relationship. (Obviously, only do this as far as she's comfortable). Hope that helps xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's been a lot written about the misogyny in how bisexuality is invalidated. Bisexual men are told that they're"really" gay whilst bisexual women are told that their same-sex attraction is performative for the benefit of straight men. It all revolves around phalocentrism - sexuality is defined by its proximity to dick. In other words your sexuality is a function of how straight men see you. From a straight male perspective, two men together equals not hot and icky (therefore gay). Whilst two women together is hot girl-on-girl action and is totally okay (and therefore straight). It's basically a combination of shaming and othering men who have even the tiniest same-sex attraction, whilst at the same time claiming ownership over female sexuality and invalidating female queerness.</TEXT>

It's not unusual what you're feeling, but maybe use it to explore how you can control the level of calm you feel by just shifting your perspective.

    <TEXT>Some are, some aren't. Like everyone. In my experience, the whole "biphobic lesbian" stereotype is not really true. I'm still much more likely to have my bisexuality validated by lesbian than a random straight person. Best advice I can think to give: Bisexuality isn't just being gay and straight at the same time. There's a unique lived experience that bisexuals have that neither straight nor gay/lesbian people will, so respect that and be open to what she has to say. Bisexuality is constantly being erased and invalidated, and finding ways to be secure, especially when you're always being misread as either gay or straight, can be stressful and exhausting. So be prepared to support her and step in when biphobia and bi-erasure come up, especially around your friends and family. Also, check your own internal bisexual stereotypes. Just because she's in a relationship with you doesn't mean she's no longer into other genders, or that she's going through a "cycle" that she'll later come out of. It also doesn't make her more likely to cheat on you or decide that she wasn't really into you to begin with. (I'm not saying you believe any of this, but we all have internalised prejudice that we're not aware of). Suggested reading - Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution by Shiri Eisner. Good luck.

    <TEXT>Depression is an incredibly complex thing. There are theories of what it is and how it works going back centuries, and very few of them, past and present, have large evidence based behind them. The serotonin theory of depression was kind of retconned rather than developed scientifically. They found that medications that affect serotonin receptors seemed to help some people with depression, so there's an assumption that for some people depression might have something to do serotonin levels, but no one knows. No one really understands how SSRIs work to begin with, so it's all a lot of maybes. The thing about depression is that it's not like smallpox or the flu. You can't put it in a test tube and say "that's depression". It's just a way of feeling, and there are as many causes and cures for depression as there are people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People aren't generally blind to a single colour like green. They tend to be either red/green colourblind (meaning that red and green look like the same colour) or blue/green colourblind. The extent to which the two colours merge can be different as well. Sometimes it's the entire red-blue or blue-green spectrum, but most of the time it's just a bit of an overlap. My father has mild blue/green colourblindness. It doesn't make everything blue and green identical, it just means there's a small part of the cyan spectrum (where blue and green meet) where he can't distinguish one shade from another. Even for people with total blue/green or red/green colourblindness, purple would look more or less the same as what non-colourblind people see, since their brains are still more or less doing the same thing - taking red and blue and trying to mix them together. It's just that what they think of as red or blue would be a wider spectrum because it would also cover things we think of as green. There's another point to make, though, which is that the limits of existential solipsistic psychology make it impossible for us to really understand what other people see. When two people see a purple object and both call it purple, we don't actually know they're having the exact same subjective experience. We can't pull both shades of purple from their brains and compare them side by side. All we know is that they've both agreed to use the word purple to refer to whatever colour they are perceiving. Which then leads to a strange philosophical question - is there any such thing as a real or objective colour? If, through some magic or science, you were actually able to pull that image of purple out of someone's head and compare it with your own, what would it mean if the colour in their head appeared green to you? Are they seeing purple "wrong"? Are you? Or are you both still seeing purple? Because purple isn't really an objective colour but simply the word for a shared experience of looking at something and agreeing with one another that it's colour matches the colour of another thing which we also call purple. It winds back around to the OP in a strange and overly intellectual way that nothing, not sexuality or even colour, is a universally shared experience with any objective basis. It's just an internal landscape that we navigate and express to one another in the hope of finding some kind of commonality, and by extension empathy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This might not be the answer you're looking for, but here we go. Ignore if you want. Or skip to the end where there's some actual advice. I've done my fair share of drugs, and as a bipolar person, these are my experiences: (Note: I don't condone or recommend drug taking, just relating my own personal experience) Alcohol: Mostly pleasant, but can often drink too much when hypo. But I know one or two other BP people who are comorbid ADHD and BPD and they both really need to stay away from alcohol. Cannabis: I get serious paranoia and anxiety if I smoke weed when hypomanic, and when I'm depressed it just makes me more depressed. Not a fan. Cocaine: Guaranteed instant manic episode, with added stupid/dangerous behaviour. But tapers off very rapidly and usually heads straight to depression. Also I just generally act like an asshole, so I stay well away. Meth: Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad. Like the worst mixed manic/depressed hyper rapid cycling experience ever. Highly unpleasant. MDMA/Ecstasy: I've actually had a lot of wonderful experiences on ecstasy, but it's very hit-and-miss. I did have comedowns, but honestly they were no worse than any other depressive episode. Opiates: I have only ever done opiates when I've been in incredibly dark and self-destructive places. In my limited experience, it's not something people do unless they're desperate. I would obviously recommend staying well the fuck away from this shit because it's every bit as intoxicating, euphoric and destructive as you think it is. LSD: Pretty benign actually. Nothing spectacular, didn't do much to swing me towards manic or depressed. Mushrooms: Total non event for me. Maybe I'm just not that susceptible to psychedelics. Again, no effect on my mood swings. Ketamine: I'm ambivalent towards ket. When I'm manic it's like taking stupid juice and I hate it, but small amounts when I'm depressed can actually be a little soothing. I've done a bunch of "party drugs" with random acronyms including GHB, MDA, MNDA, 2CB, and so on, but not enough to have a clear opinion. In general, though, they all made me feel a bit dirty. And I've recreationally taken lots of prescription meds, including benzos (valium, Xanax, etc) which can be calming during mania. I've also had amazing experiences with Pregabalin, but it's one of those drugs where the first time is amazing, and then it just gets less and less until it doesn't really have any effect anymore. General life statement: I've had amazing, moving experiences on drugs, and I've had horrible ones I'd rather forget. Not radically different to life in general, and not in anyway comparable to the intense ups and downs of just being bipolar. And while I acknowledge that there is a big difference between a licit and an illicit drug, none of my wildest illegal drug binges have ever been as life threatening as the experience of being mis-prescribed legal drugs for a condition I didn't have. Actual advice: Be honest and open, non judgemental and approach everything with proper science and unbiased facts. Be extra careful regarding prescribed meds and understand risks and contraindications. Support harm minimisation, like not mixing drugs, testing quality, and being in safe environments with supportive people. Laying down blanket, hard-line no drugs policies, refusing to have open conversations, and getting your info from poor quality, biased sources is potentially more dangerous than allowing safe, low-dose exploration. Look after each other. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I don't know if I'm an "empath" or an hsp. I do know that I'm bipolar and it's not a gift. It's not something I would wish on anyone. It's nearly ended my life on numerous occasions, and has made my life unstable to the point where I've lost jobs, friends, partners and any sense of long term life stability. I currently take a number of prescription medications. Do they "numb" me. Yes, they do, and I spend a lot of time wishing I didn't feel so numb. But when I don't take them, I can be anything from suicidal to delusional and worst of all it's my friends who have to deal with it. So I take my meds and feel a bit empty. It sucks, but the trade off it that I now have a stable job, loving partners, and can start making plans for the future. Look, I'm sure that there are loads of highly sensitive people out there who are being treated as mentally ill and being drugged unnecessarily. That's awful and I wish it didn't happen to anyone. But it doesn't mean the whole concept of mental illness is a sham, either. It feels invalidating to me, like I'm not really living my life because I choose to trust the people who've told me that I'm not just an unpredictable fuck up, I'm a person with a medical condition, just like any other, that can be managed with medication. Like I said, I don't know if I'm an empath. But I've chosen to take this medication and live this way because when I don't I hurt the people around me. The people in my life love me dearly, and I'd rather choose to honour and return that love, even if it is in some diminished medicated capacity, than gamble with their emotions for the sake of some spurious notion of authenticity that could end up with them having to deal with the trauma of losing me forever. I consider that to be an empathetic choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I did acid for the first time when I was 12. Or, more accurately I was given acid without really knowing what it was. My memory of the experience is so muddled and faded that I couldn't tell you much, other than I was neither traumatised nor enlightened. I've done small doses of acid since (half and quarter tabs) but it was all a bit lackluster. There was no real shift in my mood - I was maybe slightly euphoric, but I was just generally underwhelmed. Everyone else seemed to be going on some grand internal journey and to me, everything was just a bit weird. It didn't feel insightful or fanciful. Just distorted. Mushrooms do nothing for me. And when I say nothing, I mean absolutely nothing. I remember being in Amsterdam and watching all my friends tripping out of their box on tea, whilst I was literally eating shrooms out of the bag like potato crisps and feeling nothing. (On that particular day I was on a high dose of SSRIs so that probably put a lid on things, but I've also tried them when not on any meds and the most I've had is some light trails.) However: I have a few BP friends, and their experiences are all very different. One is really into psychedelics and hallucinogens, especially things like Ayahuasca and DMT. Another swears off all drugs completely and has never had a single positive experience on anything. In my experience, psychedelics are incredibly subjective and there are so many factors that affect your experience, even beyond your own mind and brain chemistry. It can come down to environment, other people, what you had for lunch. It's all too much to keep track of for me. I like to know what I'm getting into before I take anything and psychedelics aren't all that predictable. I guess that's why they call it a trip. Buy the ticket, take the ride, and all that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is much more normal than you realise. A lot of us feel that our feelings aren't valid because they're not "serious" enough, and things like psych wards can seem like a validation of our pain. There's also a certain comfort in having a trained professional tell you that you're not just a shit human - you have a medical condition, and your pain is a totally reasonable response to that. But there's a lot of good reasons to stay out of the ER. Hurting yourself often won't get you treated any better than if you simply walk into a hospital and say "I want to kill myself, please help me". Doctors take statements like these as seriously as actions. And of course, if you do attempt, even if you're just aiming to end up in hospital, there's always a chance you might overshoot the mark and end up dead. Wards are a different matter. When you're in serious danger, being in a psych hospital can be life saving, but it's never fun. Moreover, the landscape of mental health facilities has changed. Most psych wards are for crisis response these days, or for people who have been sectioned because they're dangerous. There aren't many long stay facilities left who do the kind of thing we think of when we're daydreaming about being hospitalised. Most of that has moved to home care and community mental health teams. In my experience, doctors and hospital staff will do everything in their power to keep you out of the ward, and even if they decide you absolutely need it, there might not be any space. Wards are often overcrowded and you could end up waiting two nights just to get in and be sent home the same day. I guess what I'm saying is that there's a glamourised version of the system that we hold in our heads - the ones that validate the severity of our pain with appropriately dramatic but ultimately therapeutic care. But the reality is very different, not just in terms of the system, but how your feelings and actions will play out. There are lots of safer ways to find validation and support, and most of them just involve talking to the right people, be they friends, family, GPs, therapists or whoever you feel safe talking to. Regardless, just know that your desires aren't unusual. They're not manipulative or selfish, nor are they an over reaction. You're not a drama queen, and you're not just 'doing it for attention'. You're just a person in pain who's trying to be recognised and cared for and you're totally allowed to feel this way. Hope this helps x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think this is true. Bisexuality is about the *quality* of your attraction. It's about the kinds of people to whom your are drawn. Asexuality is about the *quantity* of your attraction. The depth and frequency to which you experience attraction. They exist on two different spectra and whilst they intersect, your position on one doesn't define your position on the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not always. The extent to which the word "asexual" implies "aromantic" is fuzzy, and depends on context. It's the same as any other sexuality. When people call themselves heterosexual, there's usually an assumption that they're also heteroromantic, unless they also say "but I'm biromantic" or something. But that's largely a semantic argument. There are numerous problems with positioning asexuality in opposition of bisexuality. It can be dismissive and ostracising for people who might feel part of both spectra, (like grey-asexuals and demi-sexuals). Also, if asexuality is "attraction to no one", that implies bisexuality is "attraction to **everyone**" which is not true. Bi people rarely have uniform attraction to everyone across the gender spectrum - attraction is scattered an concentrated in certain types of people, but it doesn't mean they're asexual towards all the people that occupy the gaps in between. If you want to get into the mathematics of the above model, it plots you as being % heterosexual and % homosexual, which is problematic in a lot of ways. Men aren't the opposite of women, and bi people aren't just "gay and straight at the same time". And If bisexual and asexual are opposites, then you could make the argument that straight people are half bisexual, half asexual, (which should be obviously false). Speaking from my own experience. I'm bisexual, and my sexual attraction covers lots of points across the gender spectrum - too many and too varied to consider myself gay or straight. My bisexuality is a function of the types of people I'm attracted to. But I'm also bipolar. And one of the things about being bipolar is that it affects your sexuality. During phases of depression, my sexual attraction drops to zero, and in those periods I tend to identify as asexual. Whilst I remember what sexual attraction feels like, I no longer experience it. It's different from just having a low sex drive, because I can't do anything to "get myself in the mood". There is no mood. Porn just becomes pictures of sweaty naked people without any sexual component. But when I'm manic, I swing the complete opposite direction - not into bisexuality, but into *hypersexuality*. I'm incredibly sexually alert and feel intense sexual attraction. But my orientation doesn't change. I'm still attracted to the same kinds of people - the same points on the gender spectrum - but now the feeling is much much more intense. There's a wider discussion to be had about asexuality and how it differs from sex-drive or desire, but the point is that being fluid on one spectrum doesn't change your position on the other. There's no point on the asexual spectrum I reach where my bisexuality becomes erased.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't know if this helps, but here's something I wish someone had told me when I was seventeen. Being a teenager is a fucking catastrophe. It's borderline traumatic. The shit you go through just trying to figure things out is insane, and it's so easy to believe the bullshit line that these are the best years of your life, when you become the person you will be for the rest of your life. It's all garbage. Your teenage years are a trash fire and the only thing you need to do is survive. All the shit about finding out who you are and what you want comes after, in your twenties and thirties, when you actually have control over your own fucking life. I was a miserable psycho loser bitch queen from hell when I was a teenager. I was a dreadful fuck up of a human. Now that person is unrecognisable to me. Literally everything about my life is different. I'm not saying that everything gets better - plenty of things go to shit. But don't believe the line that these are your formative years. They're not - they're just some fucked up horrible mess that we all have to go through before we're allowed to be in charge of our lives and start figuring out shit for real.

    <TEXT>I think it's an offensive question. Eighty years ago, queer people were considereld mentally deficient. They were forcibly institutionalised, sterilised and in some cases euthanised. In some places this is still practiced. Trying to equate sexuality and mental capacity is an oppressive and, in its worst instances, eugenic tactic that we as a community should be completely opposed to. "Intelligence" is not some objective measure of human worth or capacity. It's yet another bigoted, culturally biased axis of judgement and oppression, and I have no interest in appropriating it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what study you're referring to, but I can't see how you could possibly "prove" a link between bisexuality and disability. The best you could find is a statistical correlation, which is not proof, and given that no one knows what causes bisexuality (if it's even something that can be said to have a "cause") I don't see how it could be anything more than an piece of curious trivia. Furthermore, the wider point I'm making is that there's no way to measure intelligence that isn't highly problematic. There's no useful definition of intelligence that isn't rooted in ableism, sexism, homophobia, white supremacy and the rest. It's a culturally biased judgement and just because you're talking about the "good" end of the spectrum doesn't make it any better. I understand, and take in good faith, that you mean it when you say you don't equated intelligence to human worth. My point is that that's not really something that can be done. The entire framework of intelligence is built as a measure of human worth. There's no way to posture someone's intelligence as not being a measure of their worth - that's what the entire concept of intelligence is designed to do. I'm sure you didn't intend to offend, and I don't personally take offence. But wanting to know where we as bisexuals stand in reference to a prejudicial system is in itself an act of prejudice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These days, bisexual just means attraction to "more than one" gender (or a variant on that general idea) and isn't really thought of as reinforcing a gender binary. As to the finer points of why people pick bi over pan or vice versa, it's very personal and tends to be just about what feels right for you. Personally, I tend to go with bisexual, because I feel that pansexual gives an implication that my attraction covers the whole gender spectrum, or is somehow "gender blind" which isn't true. But that's just me, and doesn't reflect how everyone feels about the two terms and what they do or do not cover. Honestly, the difference between the two terms is largely semantic, and the schism between bi people and pan people is (in my opinion) greatly overstated. The vast majority of bi and pan people respect each others' identity and the bi/pan community is pretty unified.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry to hear this. Your foster mom sounds like an amazing person and I can understand how hard it must be for you. When I lost someone close, I went through all my usual depression coping mechanisms, including alcohol, drugs, self harm and sex, but none of it helped. The problem was that what I was experiencing wasn't really depression - it was grief. On the surface it felt like depression, and it probably aggravated my depression, but there was a part of me that needed to grieve and I had never done that before. It took me a while to understand that coping with grief and coping with depression are very different things. I know that doesn't make it hurt any less, but keep an open mind. Some things that may not have helped your depression in the past might soothe your grief. Most importantly, as humans we're generally better equipped to process grief. It has a source and a cause that allow us to work through it, unlike depression which can seem amorphous and indefinable. Because grief ultimately comes from love - and that love doesn't go away. Your foster mom is a remarkable person and nothing can take that away, not even her death. You're living proof that the love and kindness of one person lives on in the people they touch.</TEXT>

If you're depressed and have suicidal thoughts, that self destructive part of you will latch on to anything it can to try and convince you to kill yourself. What you're feeling isn't selfishness or psychopathy, it's your depression using your anger against you. Depression is good at putting horrible thoughts in out heads and disguising them as our own. So be kind to yourself. You're not a selfish person. You need support and the people who are supposed to be there for you aren't helping. And your depression is hijacking that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds a lot like hypomania to me, but it's hard to say. I get racing thoughts, insomnia and hypersexuality. I also have terrible executive function - I make dreadful impulsive decisions, spend all my money and embark on ill advised projects that consume me for a few days before I suddenly lose all interest. I can't speak as to whether or not what you feel is like what "normal people" do, as I'm not a normal person, but it doesn't sound especially normal to me. More importantly, if the experience causes you distress or puts you in danger then it doesn't really matter what you call it or if it's "normal" - it's a problem for you and should be treated appropriately and seriously. Bipolar type 2 is a bit of a controversial diagnosis. Not everyone agrees that "hypomania" a thing, and BP2 is not in the ICD-11. Some psychiatrists see it as cyclothymia with comorbid major depression. In order to be diagnosed Bipolar (type 1) you need to have had a full blown manic episode which typically includes some form of psychosis. In my experience, many psychiatrists are more likely to diagnose you with Borderline Personality Disorder (or, as someone decide to rename it "emotionally unstable personality disorder" because that sounds so much better). It's similar to things like C-PTSD that are much harder to diagnose so they get palmed off to BPD. I'm not going to diagnose you either way, but I will say that if you think what you have is BP2 then be very wary of anyone trying to prescribe you SSRIs or other similar antidepressants. They'll likely make you worse, and can spark things like rapid cycling and mixed episodes which (in my experience) are very dangerous states to be in. And remember, you can always ask for a second opinion. Psychiatrist aren't psychics. They can't see into your head and they all bring their own baggage with them. If you don't feel like your psych is listening to you then get a new one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not a loser or a joke. This is emotional abuse and is just as serious as any other kind of abuse. What you're going through is very typical of abusive relationships. It's a cycle of calm, an explosion of violence, an "apology", and what's referred to as a honeymoon period where things seem great and it seems to make up for the outburst. That's the Jekyll and Hyde cycle and it's common to most forms of abuse. You clearly love your husband, and I know how hard it must be to think of him as an abuser. Unfortunately, that's the truth. You should never **ever** have to fear for your safety, or feel trapped and unable to leave. That's an abusive situation. There's something you said that struck a chord with me: Things are good except when he's angry. I know this logic very well, and it's the logic of an abused person. Everything is great, except when it isn't. Heroin is wonderful, except for all the bad parts. All abusers are lovely people if you ignore all the times they're abusing us. Abusers keep us trapped by making us believe they're good people that love us, and that when they're violent, well, that just doesn't count. They'll try to make you feel responsible for their outbursts and that you should be grateful for all the love you do get when they're not being violent. Abusers will make us feel like we're losers and fuck ups and that no one else would put up with us. And then they shower us with affection to make us believe that it's not really a big deal. Someone who is this affectionate can't possibly be a bad person. If this sounds familiar, it's because it's a textbook abusive cycle. Again, I know exactly how hard this is to admit to yourself, but it's true. None of this is your fault. He is abusive, and is doing everything abusers do. Every abused person has feelings like yours. That we're losers, that we're weak and pathetic for not standing up for ourselves, but that we're also weak and pathetic for wanting to leave. That we should stay and put up with this person's rage because it's not really that bad and they clearly love us very very much. Except when they don't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds more like Hypomania than full on mania, which means you might have bipolar 2. I have BP2 and hypomania for me is insomnia, stupid and dangerous decisions, hypersexuality, spending all my money, becoming hyper focused and obsessed with random things, and then suddenly I'm on to something else. I don't tend to feel jittery or anxious, but I know lots of people that do. A big flag for me was when I was on antidepressants I wasn't less depressed, I was just cycling rapidly between depression and hypomania (like switching every other day). I also had what are called mixed episodes where you're depressed, but kinda manic at the same time, which are really dangerous. Manic impulsivity and bad decisions plus depressive self-hate equals some really dark shit. Lithium is a super powerful mood stabilizer and probably overkill if you're BP2. There are better mood stabilisers for BP2 that are more focused on the depression side. By sounds of things, I'd definitely look into BP2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, Lexapro in particular is famous for setting of mania and hypomania in bipolar people. Plus busiprone sounds like a really bad combo for bipolar, and what you're describing is exactly what I'd expect from a bipolar person on those meds. If your mood is swinging aggressively within a single day and your behaviour is erratic and dangerous, I'd be very inclined to change meds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds a bit like stimming - which is something autistic people often do to help deal with sensory overload. Things that cause pain over a long period of time can actually be quite dangerous, especially if they interfere with things like blood flow. Does it have to be painful? Can it just be something like a heavy object or a rough surface that you can keep in your hand? Other than that, maybe consider something like tiger balm or bengay that can produce a hot sensation and is safe to use for long periods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Calling someone a "depressive" is really outdated terminology. It's not really meaningful in a contemporary sense, so I'm surprised a MH professional said this to you. There are lots of different disorders and illnesses for which depression is a component, the most obvious being major depressive disorder (MDD), but it also includes dysthymia, bipolar disorders, and so on. It's also linked to PTSD, Anxiety, ADHD, and personality disorders like BPD. Without any further context or information, I'd be inclined to think "depressive" means MDD. I find it really odd that a psychiatrist would just vaguely imply that you're some kind of depressed but just leave it at that. Was there any follow up? Did they prescribe anything?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Full disclosure: I've never been an in-patient, so take from me what you will. My advice is to research the place you'd be going pretty thoroughly. I turned down an in-patient offer on the advice of several people (including a doctor) who didn't have good things to say about the hospital I could've gone to. But I've also been a day patient where I'd be there for the day but go home at night rather than stay over. (not sure how common this is anymore). The place I went to then seemed really nice and the in patients seemed well looked after. I was almost a little jealous that I didn't get to stay overnight but they had limited beds and my home situation was pretty good. I've also stayed at a kind of sanctuary, which wasn't technically a hospital, but had a similar routine. The main difference is that they didn't have meds on tap. This was an incredibly positive experience and kept me alive when I was in crisis. I've also had friends who've been in patients, both voluntarily and being sectioned. For some it literally saved their lives, for others it was a nightmare. The difference is pretty much entirely down the the place itself and the quality of treatment they got there. So yeah, it can be amazing if the place is right. Look into where you'd be going really thoroughly, and figure out if it's what you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like a really, really hard day and I'm proud of you for getting through it. First off - I'm really sorry for what's happened to you. It's not something that should ever happen to anyone, and I think you're very strong to have survived what you went through. Secondly, what your last therapist said to you is horrible and borderline malpractice. I hope it doesn't put you off therapy completely, because it can make a huge difference. If you can find someone who specialises in PTSD and the kind of abuse you experienced, you might have better luck. It might be frightening now but it's worth it when it works. I understand why you blame your mother, and if I were in your position I probably would too. But trauma does strange things to us, to our memory and our sense of what safety is. Sometimes we bury our feelings and end up doing things we're not proud of. Things that hurt others. That's not to say your anger isn't justified - your mother did fail to protect you - but remember that it's part of a larger legacy of abuse that starts with him. You sound to me like someone with a level head, but who is also exhausted from carrying around so much pain. It may appear to others like you're dealing with it better than you feel you are, and finding people you can be honest with - friends, therapist, etc - is really important. You've survived so far, and I believe you have the strength to break through the fear and the anger that keeps us trapped in our trauma. There's a beautiful world on the other side. Take care xx</TEXT>

Well I'm here to tell you that this is not true. Not even a little bit. Your labour is not the be all and end all of your value as a person. You're a human being with a right to be happy, safe and secure, no matter how much you "produce". You don't need to justify your existence. And the thing is, if you're anything like me, it's not really about what you make or do with your time. Your depression is always going to tell you it's not enough. You're never going to reach a point where your depression is like "okay, you're now productive/successful/useful enough that you can be happy". That's not how depression works. There's no minimum amount of productivity required to qualify for happiness. Your worth as a human is not dependent on how much shit you make, or how much time you spend working on a "valuable" skill. You deserve to be happy. You don't need to justify that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not that you should or should not be "disqualified" from all social responsibility, but that your illness - which as valid as any physical condition or disability - will to some extent shape the nature of that responsibility. You wouldn't expect someone with cerebral paulsy to farm corn. "Productivity" as we've been taught to think of it is an incredibly narrow view of what counts for social responsibility, and it creates a hierachy of human worth that values a specific kind of person. But the needs of society extend beyond simply being able to produce stuff. Who is more valuable? The man in a wheelchair who is always there for his friends and family, or the man who builds bridges and beats his children? If the last three months have taught us anything, it's that the idea that if people weren't forced to go to work then everyone would happily lie on the couch and do nothing forever is completely false. We've all been forced to do exactly that and we're all losing our shit. The point is, we all want to contribute, and we all value the contribution of others. But if you say that only certain kinds of contributions have worth, and that everyone should be judged regardless of their capacity, you create a situation that invalidates the humanity of millions and millions of people like me and (as uncomfortable as it may be to admit) like you.</TEXT>

Especially when they're trying hard and especially when it's at work. What I'm trying to say is that you've got an illness that likes nothing more than to convince you you're worthless.

I've worked with some incredibly "successful" people who were, in no uncertain terms, assholes of the highest order and I hope never to meet them again. I've also got friends who have no jobs, no kids and live on government benefits, and I literally would not be alive if it wasn't for them. By a lot of people's standards, I could be seen as successful. I had a career. I excelled. It was never enough to convince my depression that I deserved to live. I'm not saying don't have goals or ambitions. I'm just saying if your goal is just "be a kind and empathetic person", that's enough. And more that, it's a far worthier goal than being the guy who invents a new kind of plastic.

Before I was on a massive cocktail of antidepressants and was pretty much in a permanent rapid cycling, mixed episode circus for about two years.

    <TEXT>It's probably best to do your own research, but here's my impression of what I've read. Exercise can be very helpful, and in some cases as good or better than antidepressants. However, there's a caveat, which is it works well for people who are already enthusiastic about trying it. If you're someone who hates exercise (for whatever reason), forcing yourself to do it isn't going to be very helpful. This is actually similar to antidepressants. The best results are in people who think they're going to work well. Same with CBT and other kinds of therapy. My take away from all this is find something that feels right for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it's utterly exhausting. Sometimes I'm having a great day and then for absolutely no reason my heart just drops, like I just found out my cat had died or something. Sometimes I'm in the street and just burst into tears. At least my friends are pretty good at spotting it these days. I'll be dominating the conversation and buying people drinks and suddenly I'll crash and have to leave. And every time I think I'm hiding it really well and my friends will be like "no, you've just cycled down, we're staying with you tonight." I'd be dead so many times over if it wasn't for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. I'm sure I don't need to tell you, but saying your depression is being caused by having "the devil inside you" is dangerous nonsense. I mean it's an actively damaging notion and is only going to make things worse. And your parents have no right forcing their beliefs on you. There's nothing wrong with taking medication for depression. Honestly, it doesn't sound like your parents are very receptive, let alone respectful of your opinions. And sometimes, when you're depressed and have very limited energy, the best you can do is just avoid it. You don't need your parents' permission to seek help or take meds or deal with things in your own way, and you don't owe them any kind of explanation, especially if all they're going to do is try to drown you in dangerous (and frankly ridiculous) dogma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not at all the wrong place to post this. These are all common symptoms of depression and I'm sure lots of people here will recognise your story. Depression doesn't have to be crying for days and feeling like everything in the world has died. Sometimes it's just an empty feeling and an inability to care about your own wellbeing. One thing I would say is that your symptoms could be indicative of something like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I'm not a doctor, but your story reminds me a lot of my friends who've dealt with CFS. My advice would be to go through it with a GP and see what they think. I hope you're able to find some help and get better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my experience, the answer to this is both terrifying and incredibly freeing. How does it feel to be loved, cared for, and valued? Honestly, when you're depressed, it doesn't feel much like anything. When you're in a place where you feel useless, or think that you're a burden, or don't deserve to be cared for, then other people's love just kind of bounces off you. At it's worst, it can turn into guilt for not being able to accept their help, and you can even find yourself getting angry with your loved ones for wasting their time on you and not leaving you alone to die. But there's a flip side to this: It means that your sense of self worth is not controlled by others - it's controlled by you. The truth is you *are* worth something, and you are allowed to value yourself, and that's true regardless of who else is in your life. You're a person - that's all you need to have value. You don't need to justify your existence. It's bleak, but there's also a kernel of hope in it, and it can light a path to happiness that can have a solid, long lasting foundation. Best of all, it means that the love and acceptance that you're searching for might not be as far away as it feels to you right now. I hope you find it. x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you feel like this. Self harm is unfortunately not the best coping mechanism, but sometimes it feels like it's the only thing available to us. My advice would be to not do it, obviously, but if you feel like you have to, do what you can to make it as safe as possible. There's info and advice online and places like r/selfharm about how to deal with urges, how minimise infections and other complications and ultimately how to get it under control. Self harm is addictive and sometimes the habit can become a bigger problem than whatever was causing it to begin with. I've been self-harming since I was a kid and I still struggle with it, and I would never recommend it. But I understand and sympathise. Just be careful and remember that self harm is just a quick fix. It doesn't really help in the long run - no amount of self harm will ever cure your depression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have bipolar 2, but I once was in a relationship with a girl with bipolar 1. I've had a lot of the experiences you've had. I've heard my name called, and I've gone long stretches without sleeping due to random intense phobias springing up out of nowhere. But my ex gf had a different experience. I remember once she called me because she had decided to sell everything she owned and move to Ghana and become a Christian Missionary. She wasn't even a little bit religious, and couldn't give me any kind of answer as to why she'd decided it. When I got to her house she had already bought a plane ticket, quit her job and told her landlady she was moving out (it was 3am - she'd called them all in the middle of the night). When I talked to them to try and explain, they said the same thing - this happens all the time and they never take it seriously, they just ignore her and wait for the episode to pass. Another time she thought she had been mind-programmed to be a secret assassin, and that one day someone was going to say some kind of activation code word and she would kill someone without being able to control herself. She ended up trying to kill herself by drinking several bottles of toxic cleaning products, but I managed to get her to hospital in time. For years I thought I might be bipolar but dismissed it because I never had the kind of psychosis that she experienced. It wasn't until I found out about BP2 that it started making sense. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, you're not. God wants you to feel love and be loved. For what it's worth, the scriptural basis for homosexuality being a sin is very thin. The verse that gets trotted out the most is Leviticus 18:22 which has been translated as "Thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman: it is an abomination". However, it's a wilful mistranslation of the original. The expression "lie with" would more accurately translate as "lie before" ie that a man should not be subjugated to another man in the same way as a wife. At the time, a woman was considered kind of like her husband's property and her path to God was through him, so the verse wasn't so much about homosexuality as it was about slavery and "owning" another man. Other than that there's not much mention of being gay at all, and Jesus himself never mentioned it. Also remember that the vast majority of the laws laid down in the early books of the old testament are ignored as outdated. Leviticus 19:28 outlaws tattoos, Leviticus 19:19 says not to cross breed cattle, plant different crops side by side, or wear garments woven from two different threads. And Deuteronomy 22:9 bans wine made from more than one grape variety. Also, fun fact: In the middle ages it was common for Monks to get married, and there's loads of adorable romantic writings from men talking about how much they love their monk husbands and how it brings them closer to God. So I wouldn't sweat it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem. BP2 is somewhat of a controversial diagnosis. It's not really recognised here in the UK (it's not part of the ICD, which is used here instead of the DSM). But the definitions are different. DSM bipolar disorder has a requirement of at least one episode of psychosis, but the ICD doesn't. Instead it allows for 'non-psychotic mania' which is closer to what the DSM defines as hypomania. Basically what I'm saying is there's not a hard line between BP1 and 2 - there's a bipolar spectrum that varies a lot and the lines between them are somewhat arbitrary. For the most part, the treatment path for both is pretty much the same so whether it's useful to think of BP1 and BP2 as different conditions is up to you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-23 13:31:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Kind of a vent - I think I already know the answer. I don't feel like I'm really suicidal - I haven't given up on life and I feel loved and cared for. But at the same time I'm having really strong fantasies of just ending it. What's worrying is that I've started to secretly hoard my medication. I'm only allowed access to a week's worth of my meds at a time so I've been pretending to take them and hiding them away. In another week or so I'll probably have enough to OD on. But it's weird - I don't actually think I want to kill myself, and I'm not really sure why I'm stockpiling my meds. The obvious thing would just be to get rid of them, but for some reason I can't seem to bring myself to do it. Last year I had a secret stash of pills I could have used to OD on but I ended up getting rid of them because I didn't trust myself - and I was way more suicidal then than I am right now. So why do I feel so differently? Can anyone relate or offer some insight?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not disgusted by you at all. You remind me of myself at times. Yeah, hospitals can be great places - they can be sanctuaries and when you don't have the strength to go on they can be lifesaving. It's a wonderful feeling to have no responsibility and be surrounded by people whose job it is to look after you. It really is like being a little kid again. I had a similar relationship. I thought I was too smart and too mature to be in an abusive relationship. And I naively thought that I wouldn't be abused because I was with another woman. We're responsible, socially aware, liberal lefty queers - we don't do abusive relationships. Of course it's not about how smart you are or how open minded you are. Abusers seek out people who are highly empathetic. The same part of you that is sensitive and understanding is the same part that can be manipulated into making you feel responsible for someone else's anger. It sucks, but just know that it didn't happen because you're stupid or immature. It happened because you're a sensitive and empathetic person who wants to feel deeply connected to others - and that's a good thing. And yeah, we all relapse. It happens. The road to recovery is not a straight line and sometimes things get worse. Don't beat yourself up over it. Just try to feel your feelings and understand where they're coming from. You don't have to fight them. It's not about never feeling bad. It's about allowing yourself the time and space to have those feelings without them controlling your life. And if, in the worst case, you need to do something to get through it - whether that's cut yourself, get high, or fuck a random stranger - then don't blame yourself. Do what you can to be safe and minimise the damage, and try not to make a habit of it. But make sure to acknowledge it for what it is: a desperate act of survival. Things like self harm are coping mechanisms - they may not be "healthy" per se, but sometimes it feels like there's no other way to get through the day. Try what you can to get through without them, but if you do fall off the wagon don't get angry with yourself. Just forgive yourself and get back up again. I really hope you're able to find a way to bring some of that safe, caring feeling of the hospital back into your own life. Look for people who can help - who can be there for you. And if not, try to be that person for yourself. Care for yourself, give yourself a break when you need, and be kind and understanding. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a little thing I've observed in my life that may or may not help. There's a difference between wanting to die and wanting to be dead. Some people just want to be free of the pain or emptiness of life, but the act of suicide itself is frightening. Others are actually drawn to the act of suicide as a kind of transformation or self destruction, but are ambivalent (or even afraid) of being dead. Neither one is any better or worse than the other (and plenty of people are both), but it might help you to understand your feelings, and know what it is that might need to change in order for you to feel differently.

    <TEXT>When we're depressed it's quite common to blunt and suppress our feelings as a way of coping with the pain, but it can lead to feeling numb and empty. Finding safe ways to feel again is very difficult, and lots of ideas that seem appealing - drugs, self harm, etc - tend to make things worse rather than better. Often the best thing for it is therapy, but that's not always practical. Sometimes it's just about trying to open yourself back up to feeling, but being careful about it and making sure you have support.

    <TEXT>It kinda depends on the psychiatrist. The most obvious diagnosis would just be bipolar, but it depends on how they interpret your manic/hypomanic episodes. You might get a major depression diagnosis with a second co-morbid diagnosis like BPD, or schizotypal disorder. Depending on what your depressive phases are like, you could get cyclothymia, which is similar to BP2 but with less severe depression. There's also things like schizoaffective disorder but that's heading more towards a schizophrenia spectrum which seems unlikely. Honestly there's no way to know, and it may not have a huge impact on your treatment plan. My one bit of advice is that if you think you're on the bipolar spectrum, don't let your psych prescribe SSRI style antidepressants. They're okay for people with unipolar depression but they can totally screw you up if you're bipolar. You're safer with mood stabilisers like lamotrigine. Hope it goes well.</TEXT>

A lot of people like to tell kids that they can't have depression - you're too young, things aren't that bad, or whatever. It's bullshit. You can have depression at any age. Being a teenager is hard. It's a baptism of fire and we expect people to just laugh and have fun with it. It can make you feel broken if you're not enjoying being a teen, but trust me you're not alone. I don't know anyone with much to say about their teens other than "I survived it". It sounds like you have good people in your life, but depression has a way of sucking all the good feelings out of you. You might think you're just being ungrateful or bitchy, but it's not you. It's the depression. The most you can do right now is acknowledge people's love for you - even if you're struggling to feel it. Be honest about how you feel but don't get angry with yourself (or them) if things have trouble reaching you. Be angry with the depression. I'm not going to be all like "it gets better" because I know that doesn't help right now. Just recognise that you're a whole person and that your depression isn't part of you - it's just a thing that's got its claws into right now, and it is possible to shake it loose. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, I get it. You can't just suddenly be okay with it. But just hating yourself for it isn't going to work out either. You can't bully yourself into not liking something, and in the long term you're going to expend more energy fighting it than if you just sat down with yourself and tried to understand and get comfortable with it - even just in tiny increments. Also, I'm curious, when you say it makes you feel weak, what exactly do you mean by that. What is it about the idea of weakness that bothers you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It entirely possible that you won't be into it forever. There's a dozen ways that it might just be a passing thing - a temporary fixation that's just a reaction to how you're feeling now. And there's a chance that if you sit down and try to understand it, it might well lose its power. It sounds like it could be linked to your self-esteem, or your feelings about relationships. But you're never going to know if you just sit around hating yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of the bi people I know are also poly which means they're not dealing with the problem of secretly wanting another partner of a different gender. But poly can be tricky, and not every bi person has that need, or even that desire. Short answer: if that's what you want, there are ways of making it work, but just because you're bi doesn't mean you can't be happy just being with one person, whatever their gender.</TEXT>

Like, you're angry with yourself for other reasons, but you're just using this one thing as a way to vent it. I won't go into my own sexual history, but there are plenty of times I've sought something out that I didn't really want, but it reflected how I felt about myself at the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, physical symptoms of depression are very real. Weakness, loss of appetite, low immune response, allergies, chronic pain, all of these things are fairly common. When I'm in a depressive episode, I sleep sixteen hours a day, I stop eating, my back gives out and I start losing time. I lose a lot of weight - like a lot - because I'm not eating, and I'm losing muscle mass from never getting out of bed. Mental health and physical health are intrinsically intertwined. When you're down mentally, you're down physically as well. But the reverse is true, and you can sometimes help your mental health by treating your physical health. It's why people often recommend exercise or yoga for depression. It doesn't always work but for some people it makes a big difference. Sometimes something as simple as focusing on breathing can help with anxiety or depression by just physically pushing oxygen into your body. It's different for everyone, but try a few things and see what works.</TEXT>

The idea that a woman can't commit rape or assault is pretty grotesque victim blaming. And I don't know who told you that you're homophobic because you didn't appreciate an adult woman touching you when you were a child, but they're full of shit. I'm a queer woman and I find it pretty offensive that they can't tell the difference between a consensual same-sex relationship and the sexual assault of a child. I'm sorry you've had such a horrible experience. I can't tell you that the world is wonderful and full of love and fuzzy bunnies and shit, because it clearly isn't. I just hope you're able to find a way to live for yourself, if only to give a big fuck you to all the assholes and douche bags of the world that are trying to beat you down.

The thing to ask yourself is what would you do if it wasn't your mother. If it was just some random piece of shit busting into your house and doing these things? Because right now she's not acting like your mother. She's acting like a random piece of shit. And if she's so committed to being a piece of shit that she's willing to kill herself and blame it on you then she's not really your mother. Not in the way that matters. She's a random piece of shit that just happens to live with you. I don't know the finer details of your situation, but I've known abusive people before and the way they get their power is by convincing you that they're something other than an abusive piece of shit. They're not. The bottom line is that if this is how your mother treats you, then she's not someone who cares for you in any way, and you don't owe her jack shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on what you consider "normal". It's normal in the sense that these are all normal symptoms of depression or other mental health issues. Problem 1 sounds a lot like depression/anxiety and problem 2 could be indicative of depression or a mood disorder like bipolar. You could be going through what's called 'rapid cycling' where you swing from manic to depressive several times a week, or even in the same day. I guess it depends on how good you feel when you're not depressed. And having mental health problems is normal, in the sense that lots of people have them and it doesn't make you a freak. But if you mean normal like "everything's fine, this is just what life is like" then no - it's a problem that needs to be addressed. It might be a normal problem, with relatively normal solutions, but it's still a problem. The best thing to do is to talk to someone - preferably a doctor/psychiatrist/psychologist - and try to get help. These people deal with these problems all the time, so to them it's fairly normal too. Hope that answers your question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not a slut, and you're not disgusting. Sexual desire is perfectly normal, and it's not your fault that someone else too advantage of your feelings. You sound a lot like me, right down to the derealisation episodes where I can't see properly, like I've been staring at the sun. I would definitely recommend seeing a therapist or psychiatrist. These kinds of problems don't come from nowhere. Trying to understand and treat them can help you to feel a little less broken. Because it's not really you - it's just an illness you have, and it's an illness that can be treated. Wanting attention, wanting to be seen, is normal for someone who's dealing with the things you are. Sexual or not, when dealing with depression and anxiety we feel isolated and distant, and seeking people's attention and attraction is a common way to feel seen and validated. Words like slut are just pejoratives, and don't really mean anything. Everybody is someone else's slut. The best thing is always to talk about it - either to a therapist, doctor, or just someone you trust. Understanding yourself is the best way to move forward. Death isn't your only option. xx</TEXT>

Your mood swings sound pretty rapid. I'd definitely suggest talking to a therapist about it. There could be lots of different reasons and understanding them is the most important step. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know the feeling - the calm and contentment from knowing it's all going to be over soon. It's quite liberating. And I know what it's like to have people who love you not understand. To wish they would just be happy for you, instead of trying to keep you tethered to a life you hate. The bad news is that there's no way to make your loved ones accept your suicide. There's no way you can end your life that isn't going to be traumatic for them. And yeah, they probably will console themselves with platitudes like "she's at peace" or whatever, but it won't make anything better. I'm not going to talk you out of it. You seem to have your mind made up. I understand the place you're in and nobody could have talked me out of it when I was there. But you also seem to care about the people around you, and I don't want to lie to you and say that people will accept it. They won't. Not ever. There's no way to kill yourself that isn't going to scar them. Your father's suicide has clearly left its mark on you, and there's a decent chance that with your death, that mark will be passed on to your own children. Maybe it won't, but unfortunately you will never know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm really sorry all this has happened to you. It's a lot to take and I know how heavy that weight can be. It's hard to tell where your friend is at, and honestly you probably would know better than me. I've had friends who wanted to know all the gory details of my history - for some it's been about trauma tourism, but for others it's been a genuine part of their empathy. Details can mean intimacy to some people. As for her talking with your ex, I actually think you *can* tell her who to be friends with in this particular case - for two reasons. First of all, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a certain level of solidarity from people close to you, and her keeping your ex in her life is a bit of a slap in the face. Secondly, though, there's the element of safety. You need to keep this guy as far away as possible, but that can't happen if he's still connected to you via your friends. In order to be safe, you need to be able to trust that he doesn't have access to the details of your life. Her staying friends with him means he's only ever one step removed from you, and that she's prioritising her social life over your safety, which I think is not cool. Personally, I would talk to your friend about your feelings. There's a good chance that they do really care about you and they simply don't realise the effect of their actions on you. All this said, it's important to remember that we're our own people, and that goes for you too. You are not the things that people have done to you. You are not your friends' opinions of you. You are not your mental illnesses, and you are not the horrible things you think about yourself when you're depressed. None of this makes you a bad person, or unworthy of love, care or safety. Be kind to yourself. Empathise, support and comfort yourself the way you would if someone you loved was in your position. Do what you need to keep yourself safe xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You sound a lot like me. I came to a similar conclusion a while back - that I wasn't the talented, intelligent person I thought I was, and that I didn't have much to live for without it. The more distance I've gotten, though, the more I've come to realise that notions of talent and intelligence are not what I thought they were. I thought being "smart" was something objective, something that gave me value, but it's not. Smart is just "you think a certain way, and it's a way that society can profit from, so we consider you a more worthy person". It's actually all bullshit. One person's Genius is another person's Idiot. And "Intelligent" people aren't better or more worthy any more than white people, or men, or straight people, or rich people, or any of the other old bullshit yardsticks we've long since thrown away as being meaningless. So it's not that you're not smart enough to do what you want. It's that the institutions that guard the access to the life and careers that you want demand a different way of thinking to the one your brain operates on. It's disheartening, I know, but there's a silver lining. All the people who made the biggest differences, who changed things in the most radical and amazing ways are people like you. People who's minds didn't conform to the established wisdom. All the great people in their fields, from Van Gogh to Einstein were at some point in their lives told that they were stupid, and that they'd never amount to anything because they didn't think the "right" way. I know this might all seem academic. And I'm not trying to say that you're the next Einstein (but I'm not not saying that either). The point is that there's a path to happiness, and it starts with not judging your own value by some other asshole's made up definition of what "smart" is. It doesn't matter how your brain is geared. You're still worthy of love, your still a valuable person, and you still have something meaningful to contribute to the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so sorry you've had to go through this. No one should have to deal with this much trauma. I'm sure this is something that will seem frightening, but if you haven't already contemplated it, I think you should consider reporting the situation, either to the police or child protection. I know involving the cops doesn't always make things better, but your situation is very dangerous, and could easily escalate. I totally understand why you might not want to report your own family, but at this point they're a serious danger to you. They clearly aren't caring for you and honestly, I don't think they really love you. Not in the way that families are supposed to love and care for each other. This all might seem really harsh, but you're clearly a kind and caring person and the situation you're in is beyond toxic. I don't want anything else to happen to you, but staying where you are is not safe. Please consider talking to someone and explaining the situation. A friend or someone you trust is good, but if it can be someone with authority who has the power to intervene, that's what you really need right now. Please look after yourself xx</TEXT>

When they found out I had depression they were really defensive and kept saying that I had no reason to be depressed. Eventually I kind of got through to them by explaining that if I had a reason to be depressed then it wouldn't be depression. If something in my life was terrible then it would just be normal healthy sadness or grief. The whole point is that depression is sadness when there's no good reason for it. It didn't magically turn them around, but it got them thinking a little differently, just enough that they got off my back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This one is complicated for lots of reasons. Ultimately, you're probably the best to guess how your particular workplace will respond. If you think that it'll be met with understanding then it might help your relationships. But that may not be the case. To make things more complicated, there's a legal element. Depending on where you live you may have legal rights and responsibilities. In most places you're not required to disclose any illness, but if you do then your employer might be required to make appropriate adjustments or allowances to accommodate your condition. It's generally not legal to fire, demote or otherwise discriminate against a person for having a medical condition. However, this doesn't mean that they can't fire you or bully you out of your job, it just means that if they did you'd have recourse to either be reinstated or paid out. Which is a different thing. I've never formally told an employer about my mental health, but I have been open with co workers about some of my history and I've generally been met with understanding and empathy. But I live and work in a very liberal bubble, in an industry where if everyone with mental health issues got fired there'd be no industry left. So it's kind of up to you to judge the situation. Keep in mind not just how your co workers and immediate manager might take it, but also up the chain. If you work for a massive company, even if your manager is supportive they may get pressure from people above them who are less sympathetic. It's a minefield and ultimately you just need to do whatever is best for you, not just to make things easier, but also to protect yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The amount of anxiety you experience around illness and death suggests that you clearly want to live. There are good therapy techniques for dealing with anxiety, such as reality checks and grounding exercises. It doesn't have to rule your life. And it's not all hypochondria and madness. Having a little bit of anxiety about your health can be good. People who are actively concerned about their health and seek help early on for minor symptoms are much more likely to live longer. The trick is to make sure that it doesn't run away from you, and there are ways to deal with those racing thoughts and fears. If you're in a real jam, there are anti anxiety medications you can take to curb the more extreme elements, and can help you get things under control. My best advice is to find a good therapist - preferably one who specialises (or has a lot of experience) in anxiety. It's not a terminal condition and you can recover from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I have family back in Melbourne and lockdown there is mad, verging on paranoid. On the flip side, here in England there's no real lockdown to speak of, and forty two thousand people are dead, so it goes both ways. What your experiencing is not just common, it's actually a serious problem during covid. The number of people who have been forced (either through circumstance or just plain isolation) to return to abusive relationships is staggering. There's been a massive spike in domestic violence and abuse, and there's been a massive drop in support for survivors like yourself. So you're not imagining things and you're certainly not alone. I can totally empathise with you on this. My abusive ex is only a phone call away, and there's so much about her that I miss. Worst of all, I know that she's been doing really well through this, and I can't help but feel that I'd be better off emotionally if I went back to her. But then I have to remind myself that I'm not remembering the relationship as it really was. I'm remembering the relationship as I was manipulated into seeing it. The love and support I remember wasn't ever really there. And if I was with her, I wouldn't actually be happier, I'd just be whitewashing my feelings and dismissing my fear and misery. I'm not saying your situation isn't hell - it is, but try and keep in mind that going back to your ex will make things worse, not better. Look for support in others who really do care about you, and in yourself. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on why you took it. Was it to die? To stop living or otherwise escape life? Or was it something different, like a way to punish or harm yourself in some way? A lot of self harm can look like suicide, and a lot of suicide can seem like self harm. It depends on what was guiding your hand at the time. I did a similar thing years ago. At the time I had been self harming a lot and when asked to explain it, I just kind of said it was another way to hurt myself. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realised it was different. I self harmed to feel something - to feel alive. I took the paracetamol to stop feeling - to feel nothing. I didn't think of it as "death" at the time, but in hindsight that was the kind of thing I was aiming for. Ultimately it's up to you how you want to define it. It might take some time to understand, but the important thing is to resist what others tell you. Don't let your family or doctors tell you what it was. They might want to downplay it and call it just "acting out" or "a cry for help" (I don't know exactly how these things are different from suicide, but whatever). But they also might want to blow it up into something it's not. Only you know how you felt at the time and what it was that brought you to that place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A friend of mine has started a vlog about being a HSP, and it's made me realise how sensitive I am and how confusing I find it. For years I never thought of myself as sensitive to people's feelings, but I realise now that I actually soak up other people's feelings like a sponge. The confusion comes from being autistic - I take people at face value and can't always tell when people are not saying what they really feel. So I meet people who are really sad or upset, but tell me they're fine. Then I walk away feeling deeply upset myself but can't figure out why. My friend is the complete opposite and can read people like a book. Are there more people like me? Sometimes I just feel crazy, like my feelings literally come from nowhere. I find it really hard to be around people who aren't upfront about their feelings, especially when it's things like hate and prejudice that people pass off as "just an opinion", like it's logical or a fact. I kind of feel emotionally battered, like I'm being punched around by an invisible man. Can anyone relate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn, what a terrible situation. If it's any help, you can sometimes play the system a little bit, depending on what the laws are and what procedures need to be followed. In some places, local law enforcement deal with crime reports, but departments like Child Services are handled centrally and aren't farmed out. It's a complicated network, but depending on who you talk to there might be a way to bypass the local police and have it dealt with by someone who's not part of the local community. I'm in the UK and local police forces in rural areas are frequently useless, but if you report something to NSPCC they're legally required to contact CID which is centralised (ie it goes to somewhere like Scotland Yard, rather than the local cop shop). Even if you don't go through with it, I think it's important to understand all your options. I'm really worried about you just staying there and if there's any way for you to get out I think you should take it. xx</TEXT>

In a lot of places, there's technically no reason a GP can't prescribe HRT straight away, but most are just too afraid to do it. Sometimes there are GPs who are happy to do it, and trans support groups might keep a record of who they are. It might be more complicated with you being underage.

The point is, if you're struggling with things to the point that it's making you depressed and question the value of life, then your father needs to check himself and his parenting methods. Even if what he wants from you is technically reasonable, bullying you and making you hate yourself is not the right way to go about it. Ultimately he's your father. His first concern should be your welfare, and if he's hurting you then there's no real justification for that. You can argue forever about who's job it is to dig a trench - it doesn't really matter.

    <TEXT>I'm on Lamotrigine (lamictal) and Quetiapine (seroquel). Sometimes I go off the quetiapine and it can often result in a hypomanic episode. In particular, lamotrigine makes it hard for me to get a good night's sleep, and a day's worth of sleep deprivation is usually a trigger for hypomania. But a lot of the time it's safer to just stay on the quetiapine. So you might want to ask your doc about adding something for the mania. Lamotrigine usually just evens out the depressive slumps. It doesn't necessarily cause mania, but in my experience it can make you more susceptible to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, you're not faking it. Self harm is a coping mechanism and we don't just do it for the hell of it. We do it because we're dealing with some serious shit and don't know how else to handle it. You might feel like it's not a big deal because you're not actively trying to kill yourself, but even just thinking about it means you're struggling in a very real way. If you want to be technical, holding a bunch of pills but not swallowing them is called an aborted suicide attempt. It's in the same category as stepping out onto a ledge but not jumping or holding a gun to your head but not pulling the trigger. It's a very serious and desperate act and even just flirting with it is cause for concern. I'm not trying to frighten you, I just don't want you to think that you're pain isn't justified because you haven't had to be rescued by the paramedics. It's common for people with depression to doubt themselves and try to think that we're just making it all up. That's the depression talking.

    <TEXT>Functional depression is common, and lots of people manage to force themselves to go to work, exercise or be social despite it. As for your parents, they really do just seem to be making things worse for you. I would recommend trying to talk to someone else, like a friend. I don't think your parents are helping. Therapy is expensive, but there are sometimes networks of low cost or even free therapists, often through local charities, so maybe it's worth looking into that. You can get antidepressants through a GP, but not all GPs are mental health trained and some aren't comfortable prescribing them. They may be able to refer you to a psychiatrist, which would be a good thing either way. Your anorexia is likely fueling your depression, (and vice versa), so seeking help for that may help your depression as well. Again, a GP might be a good first point of contact for that. Most importantly, try and keep in your mind that it's not you - it's an illness that can be treated. You're not just lazy, seeking attention, or any of the other things your parents have told you. You just need a bit of support and help to get through this, and you can recover. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sexuality it complicated, and comes in a virtually limitless number of varieties. Sometimes people are physically attracted to one gender, but emotionally attracted to another. Sometimes people are attracted to only certain kinds of people, which may not exactly correlate to men/women. And sometimes people's feelings change over time. There's no right way to be attracted to others, it's just about finding out what feels right for you. Most LGBTQ+ people aren't stereotypically "gay". Your sexuality doesn't define you, and there are plenty of conservative, religious people who aren't straight. Again, it's just about asking yourself what you believe, and what feels right. Happiness can be hard to find when we don't know what it looks like. There's unfortunately no simple trick to knowing what we want in our lives, or even what will make us happy. To make things more confusing, depression can often suck the joy out of our lives, and things that used to make us happy might just feel empty and meaningless. Fundamentally, depression is just another illness that can be treated. What treatment looks like is different for everyone. Sometimes it means medication, other times it might be therapy or counseling, but often it some combination of all of them. Again, it's about finding what's right for you. All of these things are just questions we need to ask ourselves, and although it may seem daunting, it's by no means impossible. They're hard questions, and we need to be honest with ourselves in a way that can feel very confrontational, but you can do it. And yeah, life is scary and we don't always get to live the way we want. And in a sense, you're right - life is pointless and we're all just waiting to die. But in a lot of ways that's what makes it special. You've been given a life - it's yours and no one else has one quite like it - and the only meaning it's ever going to have is what you choose to put into it. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm really sorry for everything that's happened to you. First of all, it's in no way your fault you were groomed online. There is no possible way it could be your fault. You say you feel responsible because you knew it was happening but didn't stop it. But the thing is, that's literally what grooming is. Of course you feel responsible - you were manipulated to feel like that. That's how grooming works. To say you were groomed but it's your fault is a contradiction. It's like a person being robbed and saying it's their fault for having money to steal. I know you probably get told this a lot, but you haven't ruined your whole life. Being a teenager is really hard, and although we don't like to say this to teens, 95% of the time you will fuck up. It's just what being a teenager is. I don't know a single person who doesn't look back on their years as a teenager, going through high school, and think "Holy shit I fucked up absolutely everything." Even the kids who look like everything is going great and is super easy are sitting at home alone saying to themselves "I'm a total fuck up". Trust me, I was one of them. I'm sorry your mum is guilt-tripping you for being suicidal. That is straight up bullshit. I'd definitely mention to your therapist that she's not helping, and to quit suggesting it (or come up with a better way to go about it). I know everything seems bleak, and I get it. But you're not worthless, or any of the other negative things it feels like you are. You're dealing with a lot of shit, and it's making your life fucking miserable - but it's not your fault, and it's not because your lazy or talentless or any of that. I don't know what the solution is, but all I can tell you is that you have worth and deserve to be happy. You are not your depression. You are not your grades, or your SATs. You're not what your mum tells you. 99 percent of success is survival. Grades and college and fancy jobs are all fine I guess, but not having them doesn't mean you're worth any less as a person, and it certainly doesn't mean you don't deserve to live and be happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a useless story for you. In the 19th century, no one wanted to be normal. Normal mean boring. It meant unremarkable, bland and ultimately meaningless. Then a Belgian sociologist named Adolphe Quetelet invented a thing called Moral Statistics, that basically said that being "normal" was a good thing. That most people should be happy to live boring, unremarkable and bland lives that look identical and don't really mean very much. Because their job is to prop up the other five percent of "remarkable" people (like himself, obviously) who are super clever and amazing and different and have lives that change the world and are actually meaningful. And because everyone insisted he was clever and remarkable, it got promoted everywhere until everyone decided they actually did want to be normal. I know when you say "normal" you don't been boring or meaningless. I know it comes from a desire to feel contentment, and not be weighed down by things like having no one to talk to, or no money to live on. But it's kind of a myth. As people, we're conditioned to seek a contentment in simplicity and ease that doesn't really exist. I know people who have tonnes of money and dozens of friends and they feel more or less the same way you do. That if they just had a few more close friends or a few more dollars then they'd finally find peace. I'm not saying don't bother finding friends or trying to get a better job - they would all make your life better, so definitely do these things. I'm just saying happiness and normality aren't the same thing, and that you can find happiness in the in the chaos and uncertainty of an abnormal life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can be sexually attracted to men but romantically attracted to women. That's a legitimate orientation. You can fall in love with a woman but not want to have sex with her. And you can want to have sex with a man but not want to date him. That's all fine. Remember also that sexuality can evolve over time. You might find one day that you are sexually attracted to some women. Or you might suddenly find a guy that you have romantic feelings for. Don't worry too much about what to call it, or whether it fits some preexisting label. Just take it one person at a time. You meet someone, you feel whatever you feel. There's no right or wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's quite a common desire. When you're in that state where you're desperate for help, it can feel like the only way forward is a desperate act. Suicide isn't always about dying. It can be a desperate act of escape, or self destruction, or just a last resort. The problem is it's a hard thing to aim for. There's a very real danger that your failed attempt could become a successful attempt. And there's always the risk of permanent damage. The other thing to consider is that, in my experience if someone doesn't take you seriously when you tell them you're suicidal, a failed attempt probably won't have the effect you're hoping for. Believe it or not, people don't always take attempts seriously either. They're just as likely to think you're just "acting out" or "attention seeking". Your best option is to find someone you *can* talk to, and who does take you seriously. A friend, a therapist, someone who understands and if need be can even help your family understand the severity of the situation. The worst thing you can do right now is fall into a vicious circle of increasingly dangerous attempts. You just need someone who will listen to you.</TEXT>

I don't know if you have access to counselors or therapists - maybe through school, or youth support groups or charities. There may be regional crisis centres you can go to. You could always talk to a GP, who might be able to refer you to a specialist. And in a pinch, you can always just walk into a hospital emergency ward and say "I want to kill myself. Please help."</TEXT>

Messed up people often make the best counselors - they've been there, they know how it feels. And helping other people can sometimes make you feel a bit better about yourself. Yeah, the world is run by assholes who are having a party at our expense. That's just a shit fact and I don't have a solution. But our best hope right now is to be there for each other - as counselors, as friends and as allies. Being heard is important, and you have the right to be supported.

    <TEXT>Okay, that's fucked up. Your parents should absolutely not be hitting you. It's not okay and you shouldn't have to act like it is. My suggestion is to talk to people first - friends, other family members - make them aware of what is going on. It would be nice if you could talk to your parents directly and tell them they fucked up, but I totally get that that might not be realistic. The next part is harder, but you need to think about telling someone with authority. It might seem like an overreaction at this point (and maybe it is), but there's a danger that the situation could escalate. And we can fall into a trap where we don't say anything because it's not a big deal, or we'll give them one more chance - and it keeps going and we say that over and over. It's not about sending your parents to jail, but it's about setting boundaries for yourself and not allowing them to pull you into a cycle of abuse. Maybe it was an isolated event, and if so, then maybe you can all just talk about it and move on. But in my sadly bleak experience, it doesn't work like that. If hitting you gets the desired response and there's no consequences for them, there's nothing to guarantee it won't happen again. Look after yourself and be open about it. Don't let them turn it into a secret, or something shameful that you have to hide. They're the ones doing the wrong thing.</TEXT>

They'll finally be happy and free of my bullshit. But then I realised that my friends are my friends because they like me. It's not a chore or a burden, they genuinely want me around. And helping me through difficult times is part of that. Sometimes it's hard to see ourselves as anything other than an inconvenience to the people in our lives. But that's more about how are depression makes us see the world. It's not really how it is. Everyone needs support at different times, some more than others, but we all look after each other and it's not a burden, it's what being loved looks like.</TEXT>

Have they apologised? Have they acknowledged that they crossed a line? Have they explained why they did it? You can say they'd never normally do this, but they *did*. And you need to ask why. Was it some rare and unusual situation that caused them to act completely unlike themselves? If it really was a freak occurrence, would you feel comfortable raising the issue with them? Are you confident it wouldn't happen again? I'm not saying treat your parents like the enemy, but it's not a little thing, and they need to understand that. The confusion you feel is totally normal, but unless they own up to their mistake, you may not get any answers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jesus, that's a lot of paracetamol. I'm not going to tell you to stop and go to the hospital. I mean, it'd be great if you did, but it sounds like you've made your decision. I just want to let you know what's probably going to happen. Paracetamol isn't that dangerous, but in super large quantities it can damage your liver in a really bad way. The main thing you're going to feel is extreme nausea and just general sickness. It's not clear how much is a fatal dose, as it depends a lot on what your system is like. If you have done enough damage to cause liver failure, it will usually happen over the space of a few days. Even if you don't go to hospital for live saving reasons, I'd recommend going later so they can test your liver and tell you if you've fatally damaged it. They won't be able to reverse it, but they'll be able to tell you how long you have and give you some pallative care like painkillers and antiemetics which will make it a little less awful. Liver failure isn't quick and painless, so you probably want that. This is the situation as it was explained to me when I ODed on paracetamol. I didn't take as much as you, and I got taken to hospital early enough that they were able to save me. My liver is still a bit messed up from it, but I was able to recover. I'm sorry you've reached this point in your life, and I'm sorry you've chosen this particular way out, too. But I understand, and I just hope you're able to find some peace. xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It all depends on a lot of things. If you walk into an ER and tell them you're suicidal, they won't necessarily send you to a psych ward. There are crisis response and community support teams that often will be contacted. They'll send you home but you'd get visited a few times a day. They might also refer you to outpatient services, like therapy or psychiatric care. If they do recommend inpatient treatment, then it'll really depend on where they send you. A lot of places are short stay and aren't much more that beds and nurses that watch you 24/7. Some are good and actually feel therapeutic, whilst others are awful. It really depends on where you end up. However, it's rare that you'd be sectioned, and so you'd be able to just check yourself out if it wasn't helping. Either way, it's a better solution than not saying anything and finding yourself more and more desperate. Whatever treatment plan they come up with, it'll be something, rather than nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not as weird as it sounds. My therapist/psych have asked me the same question. It can be a way to help understand what kind of threat to yourself you are. Suicidal ideation often includes making plans. Finding out how far along you've planned it could be valuable. Answering with "probably an OD" is different to "an OD on the pills I keep in my special suicide box that's under my bed". It can also help them understand to what degree you're impulsive with your plans. If your method is "whatever happens to be lying around at the time" that also tells them something about your state of mind. For some people, suicide is about the method. For others, it's a place or a time. All this makes a difference to how they can best help you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you're dealing with these feelings. Just know that there are plenty of women out there who don't want a "strong man" or someone with a dick to have "normal sex" with. For plenty of women, the idea of being with a very strong guy actually feels less safe, not more. Some women like other women as women. They like feminity. And there's a difference between wanting to be a man and not wanting to be a woman. You don't have to be a trans man to want to be more masculine. You can define your gender any way you like. The most important point is that you are desirable, wherever you sit on the gender spectrum. There's no kind of person that isn't someone else's idea of a perfect match.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fentanyl is incredibly potent stuff, and getting dosage right is hard, especially if you don't know what your opiate tolerance is like. You might think it doesn't matter since you're trying to die, but beyond a certain point it can induce a paradoxical effect where is basically turns into anti-fentanyl. So instead of being pain free bliss it's seizures and agony. It's a problem with all opiates but it's a particular problem with fentanyl because of how potent it is. I wouldn't recommend it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shit, that's a difficult situation. First of all, you should very definitely be seeing a therapist who specialises in transgender issues. It's not something everyone has experience in and anyone trying to support you through your depression without understanding your gender is not really going to be all that helpful. It's not something you can just put to one side and say "let's not worry about this part". Similarly, couple's counseling that isn't focused on helping your wife accept your transition (and ultimately support you through it) is not going to help you long term. You can't deny who you are to make someone else happy. One of the biggest dangers right now is to be sucked into this idea that a marriage is a thing in and of itself - that it needs to be kept alive for its own sake, even if the two people in it are unhappy. A marriage is just two people and sometimes people change. Transition is hard, but it's ultimately worth it. But you need to make sure that the people closest to you are on your side. Trying to transition whilst your partner is unsupportive is going to be really hard. And if they're not supporting your transition, then you have to ask yourself if they're really supportive of you at all. You're in an amazing position with a chance to rediscover yourself and reclaim your life, but it needs to start with acceptance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes we have these moments. The machine of self harm sits in the corner, covered in dust, and sometimes well lean against it, just for a moment of rest, forgetting that the wheels still turn. We all relapse. It doesn't disqualify all the progress you've made. Dress your wounds and try to be kind to yourself. You've already started to heal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For better or worse, you'll never be that girl again. Too much has changed. You might feel the return of old habits, old fears, old feelings, but you're meeting them as a new person. Because now you're a person who has survived it and moved on, and that will never change. Evolution doesn't operate in reverse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should definitely talk to someone, and you might want to consider calling a doctor or going to the hospital. Sometimes ODs can keep making you sick for a while and occasionally cause long-term damage. The important thing is to try and open up to someone you trust. It can be anybody just as long as you feel comfortable talking to them. You probably want to consider finding a therapist, but at this stage just talking about it out loud is going to help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you say he steals your underwear, do you mean in a sexual fetish way, or an "I ran out of clean underwear" kind of way. I mean, it's not really cool either way, but if it's like a sexual thing then that is ready not okay at all. It's seriously messed up and you shouldn't have to be dealing with that. You need to make it clear to your mother that this is really not okay and that it's not something she gets to laugh away. It's not funny or quirky. It's not goofy old man behaviour, it's crossing the line into sexual predator behaviour. And even if it wasn't any of these things the fact that it makes you uncomfortable should be enough for her to take it seriously. Tell her that this shit needs to stop and he needs to check himself and his understanding of what boundaries are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just be there for her. Be open and non judgemental. Let her know there's nothing she could say that would make you love her less. It might be confusing, but it's quite common for people with depression to be "casually suicidal". Once you've opened that door in your mind, it's very easy for suicidal thoughts to creep in, even with relatively minor things. One way people deal with it is to just be casually dismissive about it. You'll have a bad day, or just a little screw up and the thought "kill yourself" will just jump straight into your head. And sometimes the best way to handle it is to just laugh it off and say "yeah, right". It's one of those things that's nothing to worry about, until it is. And it might not be obvious to you if/when that change occurs. That's why being open and accessible is so important. Just keep the lines of communication open, and make sure to reassure her that she can be honest with you about her feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best thing to do is to be up front and honest - give her the whole story with the context of how and why you started, what your triggers are, and why you want her to know about it. Answer whatever questions she has. It's only going to work if she gets it and knows how she can help, and that's not going to happen if she feels like she's only getting half the story. It's not an easy conversation to have, but that's okay - it needs to be treated seriously and given the attention it deserves. Good luck. The conversation will be hard but it's worth it for the support and trust that it will build</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm over being medicated</TITLE>

    <TEXT>I suffer periodically from nerve pain, so I take this weird kind of neuropathic pain medication. It's weird because it doesn't actually decrease the amount of pain you feel, it just makes you care less. You're still in pain, but you're just like "eh, whatever" instead of "oh god I can't deal with this." I think my mood stabilisers are basically doing the same thing. They're not making me happier, I just care less. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I'm still desperate to self harm. But somehow I just don't seem to care as much. I'm like "yeah I hate myself and want to kill myself but whatever." I'm honestly not sure if it's really what I want. Does anyone else feel this way? Like is this my life now? Is this what passes for happiness? At least when I wasn't on the meds I knew how I really felt. I'm worried that my mental illness is just going to keep eroding my will to live and that I'm not going to care right up until I throw myself in front of a train. I'm so over meds right now. Am I alone on this?</TEXT>
