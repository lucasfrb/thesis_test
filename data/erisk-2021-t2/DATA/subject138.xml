    <TITLE>Something I've Noticed About the New Hot Time Option</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-09 10:42:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So tonight, I got off of work and activated hot time. Since it's still a ticket for Friday for me (4.8.2016), the hot time should be gold. However, there is no gold modifier. It seems like instead, I am getting the hero hot time for Saturday (I activated it at 12:30am). Maybe this is because it is past midnight for me, local time, and is technically the next day? Now today, if I use the hot time after reset (5PM for me, PST), it'll be hero again (Saturday). Then, if I do the same thing Sunday after reset, I will have had three hero drop rate up hot times. Just sharing what I've noticed. Anyone else come across this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>World-9 1 Key Discount and Gem Nerf?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-10 23:42:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we are all obviously farming 9-1 a lot with the key discount, but my guild and I are noticing a lower rate of 5/6* gems. I used to get a high-ranked gem in about 200 keys, but now the rate seems a lot lower, maybe even 400+, if that. Anyone else noticing a possible ninja nerf? It's still worth it for gold and 3*s, plus low-ranked gems for fodder, but still... And on the occasional chance I do get a mimic, it's an element. Haha.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Needing some advice - Overwhelmed!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-24 18:57:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, mostly been a lurker here, but have read through many of the posts, and everyone seems very knowledgeable and helpful, so I figured I'd post and give it a go to gain some guidance/direction. First off, my units of note: - FINA 4* (Max Level, farming awaken mats for 5*.) - FRAN 4* (Cura helps.) - BEDILE 4* - CYAN 4* (Max Level, use for his paralyze.) - KAIN 4* (Hits hard. Max Level.) - ELDIN 2* (Max Level. Steal, FTW.) - EDGAR 3* (Max Level. Bio Blaster helps a ton, but not sure if I should awaken him.) - LUNA 3*x2 (Just trying to farm her TM.) - GALUF 3* (Max Level. Will probably leave unawakened for now.) - BARTZ 3* (Max Level. Have the mats to awaken him to 4*.) Now my question is, what should I be doing? I made it up to the icy mountain path on island two, but the balloons/bombs keep killing me. So for now, I'm farming experience/awakening material dungeons to level and then awaken. My next two units will be FINA to 5* and BARTZ to 4*. Other than that, I'm stealing every match in Colosseum. - Should I be trying to finish all the side quests that the Npc's throw at me? - What would an ideal adventure team from my lineup look like? - As far as farming, which exploration is the biggest bang for my buck? - I stupidly used all my cactuses on BEDILE thinking he was good. Is there a great place for experience? - Farming materials for awakening? I take it Vortex Awakening-INT is still the best? - What items of note should I buy from island two to gear up for each category? Or should I save my 25k in Gil for the possible release of island three in a few days. - Is my team screwed? Didn't pull a COD or EXDEATH. Should I re roll? - Lastly, what are the must have crafts I should be working on and how/where do I find them? Thanks for any help. Any other suggestions will greatly help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm making myself farm 10% total TM each day</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-24 21:14:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>As the title suggests, I've been throwing all my energy into farming TMs for the last week. 2% is my goal per farming unit in a 24-hour period. It's tedious, but I already have a full team of Shantotto between 9-15% each. I've had a VERY wide range of variation. It doesn't matter which unit the TM falls upon at the end of the day, as long as my total Trust for the day equals 10%. Anyone else have a similar method/setup they'd like to share? When I'm finished, I'm going to work on Bartz/Locke/Luna/Kain/Kefka. May also just run a full team of Kefka. I auto Earth Shrine while at the gym (with music in the background), at stoplights while driving, at work in my pocket... the grind never ends. ;0</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-29 20:30:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this is a two-part post, the first being that I have finished farming (as of last night): - ALL tickets - ALL limit pots - ALL star quartz - ALL limited equipment - BOTH TM moogles - ALL rare items (elixir, phoenix down, holy crystal, et cetera) - ALL cheap 6* awakening materials - Enough 5* awakening materials to 5* Kain and Rosa (who were leveling in PRO) My question is, should I farm for more 5* awakening materials since the drop rate is pretty shoddy in the vortex? I know that 6* materials get cheaper as time goes on, so I won't buy the more expensive ones, and I already have 6* Lightning/Cecil, and about 20 of each stack saved up. But is anyone farming for 5* awakening mat stacks? I'm debating between farming a few stacks, or going back to TM farming. What is everyone doing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey y'all. I'll be traveling around China and Japan for the next month, but my flight operator is a China-based carrier, thus, no Facebook. I'm not so much concerned about Japan, as I'll have WiFi in my downtime (at hotels, on the long train rides, pocket-WiFi, etcetera), but moreso about the flight itself (14 hours each way with WiFi that WILL block google/Facebook services), as well as in mainland China for the middle of April. I'm considering using TunnelBear from the iOS store (Apple devices). My questions are: - Has anyone successfully played Global EXVIUS in China using TunnelBear or a similar VPN? - Any extra steps you had to take/difficulties encountered? - Any better VPNs you would recommend? Thanks so much for your help. I'm mainly concerned about logging in for login rewards and daily pulls. Don't really want to be blocked out for the month. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[High School Math] Quadratic Equations :0</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-07 03:00:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>My partner and I are trying to help our niece with quadratic equations. The following has really stumped us. Roots come out as = 6, -5 Answer key = (x - 6) (x + 5) x^2 - 30 = x We can help her by solving via quadratic equation, but the teacher also wants us to show work via the following method: (x^2 - x + ____) - ____ - 30 = 0 We work it out to the point of having x = 1/2 +/- squ.rt of 30 + 1/4 I understand we are to take the second term, - x, and turn it to (-1/2)^2 and this supplies the following two blank spots, but everything derails after that. Any help would be much appreciated. It's very disheartening when you consider yourself good at math (and moreover, great at math when you were in high school), but are unable to solve something as a 15 year-old watches.

    <TITLE>2 Months in and LOST</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-30 02:58:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Firstly, I apologize for the wall of text that will ensue. Secondly, I apologize if there is a dedicated "Help" thread that I'm somehow missing, but have yet to discover. I'll try to make this as succinct as possible, but nonetheless, thank you for clicking, and even moreso should you decide to take the time to respond. This community has been massively helpful, and I'm mostly just a lurker. I've navigated my way through FF:RK hereunto with the help of everyone's wonderful posts and the WiKi, but now I am at a loss as to how to proceed from here. I started in late March, and have dropped money on the game twice in the form of the largest bundle, times two. Other than that, I've arduously grinded for mythril to try and pull at least once on every banner, especially those that are half off. In the beginning, I mostly used characters I liked, i.e. Celes, but now I'm finding I need to focus my attention more towards characters I have good BSBs for; sadly, my egg growth up to this point has been sporadic, so my team leveling is very uneven. What follows is a list of my major characters and relics: Onion Knight 99 BSB - Vessel of Fate SSB - Blowback OSB - Sword  amp; Spell Celes 99 SSB - Indomitable Blade Ramza 99 SSB - Shout UNQ - Tailwind Arc 99 SSB - Words of Kindness SSB - Renewing Rains UNQ - Soothing Light Y'Shtola 83 BSB - Asylum Terra 80 OSB - Scorching Flames Shantotto 80 BSB - Play Rough SSB - Primordial Elements Gilgamesh 80 BSB - Faithful Companion OSB - Strange Bedfellow Lightning 73 OSB - Thunder Fall BSB - Focused Bolts SSB - Crushing Blow Kain 70 BSB - Dragoon's Pride Skills/ Lightning Dive; Blood of Wyverns Kefka 66 BSB - Symphony of Madness SSB - Forsaken Null Desch 61 SSB - Roiling Memories UNQ - Selfless Spirit Ashe 54 BSB - Dusk's Decree Orlandeau 54 OSB - Thunder God Eiko 50 BSB - Prayer of the Lost Luneth 50 BSB - Eternal Winds Other's I've yet to level with available BSBs: Squall BSB2 Fran BSB Setzer BSB Locke BSB Fujin BSB P.ecil BSB Tidus BSB Balthier BSB Basch BSB Until now, I mostly used Celes with her Runic Absorption and either Ramza (Shout) or Arc (clutch instant heal/Support) in Raids--and it seems to work well... but I mostly skirt support and am neither a dedicated damage dealer, nor an impactful healer. However, I often get "Nice" and "Thanks" and "Well Played," because I save the party in a crisis from powerful spells/wiping when low on health... Thanks instant cast: so it's working until now, I guess? My Onion Knight is stuck with useless skills because I didn't know about OK Motes until way too late. He has excellent relics, but I can't dive him, so I get kicked if I bring him. I've mostly been using a thunder imperil physical team with Lightning/Kain/Eiko/Fran/Y'Shtola in Realm Dungeons to try and level, but my god is leveling so slow. As I said, I threw my eggs into random baskets. -_- I'm kind of stuck as to where to go next. I know I have the early makings for a good wind physical imperil team with Fujin/Eiko/Luneth/SUPPORT/SUPPORT, but where do I really focus my attention next? Maxing my Lightning team? Grinding for orbs to create good abilities/honing? Raising up my Wind team? And what are the banners I should be saving for? I'm done pulling for now because I realize I'm spreading my resources all over the place. I can reliably clear content up to difficulty 160 by myself, but can't progress beyond that. I can do up to 220 providing support with a good team in Raids, but beyond that is hell. -_- Thanks for any insight, direction, guidance, tips, whatever. I just don't know where my focus should be. My goal is to do well in Raids, since they are the most fun, and tackle stronger content so I can get those juicy MC III Lodes to raise my characters. And how the hell do I level my characters more quickly? It takes forever! TL;DR;sorry: Played for two months, have a bunch of relics (see list above), threw eggs at random characters, aimless and lost at this point in time. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>http://imgur.com/a/qUQ6S (Two images) Just completed my first APOC+ (220) ever solo content! And at full health, at that! The trick was I needed to get native SSII or SG to free up RW for actual damage capabilities. Luckily enough, my 2/11 on the XIV banner was SSII. Wasn't mad at all. Rushed to master it in Orbfest. Ran: - Y'Shtola with SSII/Asylum (taking turns back and forth). Ultra Cure/Curaise and Mako Might RM. - OK with Darkra/Wraith running VoF then RWing Cid Raines's Metamorphose to burst. Battleforged RM. - Setzer with Full/Power Breakdown and Dr. Mog's Teachings. Mostly Megaflare BSB for the mitigation. - Cid Raines running Memento Mori and Dire Heal to self boost/sustain and spamming Metamorphose with Knight's Charge RM. - Arc spamming Curaja and backing Protectga. Godspeed RM for the Haste to spam cures and build SB to use Word of Kindess insta/SB when HP got low (to allow Y'Shtola to run SSII). I'm so happy right now. I never thought I'd be able to do this. Got mastery, as well!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CM Missions for DEXT/VIT 5* motes 300 Jumpstart Battle Question.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-23 00:37:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>I recently completed the 300 JS Battle for FFX and got the first CM bonus for using one FFX character (level 99 Rikku to spam USB/BSB). My question is: Worth it to bring my level 75 Yuna with USB/BSB2/SSB/SSB to 99 with the MC LODE III from FF Type-0 event part II to gain another set of the Dexterity 5* motes for using two FFX characters? I'm trying to fully legend dive my Lightning, and I'm about halfway through her grid to the last LS. I was using the following: RW Cloud USB Lightning 99 w/ USB-BSB2 spam after Cloud USB Orlandeau 99 w/ OSB spam after Lightning uses imperil Rikku 99 w/ USB-BSB spam Ramza 99 w/ Full Break-Defense Breakdown-SSB-SSB-USB (Shout/Chant/History's Truth) Y'shtola 99 w/ SSB (SSII) then BSB spam. Got all medals. I'm thinking after Yuna is 99, I can switch out Y'shtola and bring Yuna in to do USB, then Miracle Veil, Miracle Veil, Curaja spam. However, I'm also considering trying to raise either Tidus with BSB or Payne with SSB/BSB to about 50 and swapping out Orlandeau to get the third CM mission complete for the last set of Dexterity 5* motes. They'll probably die, but the few water BSB's I can get through may help. I just know how rare 5* motes are and I don't want to miss these. I'm aiming more towards Tidus because he has Ace Strike RM. Lightning can still pull me with support from Ramza/Yuna/Rikku and she can do Cloud RW/Army of One/Focused Bolts/Focused Bolts/Thundering Twin Strike/TTS. Rikku can possibly use Cloud as well after casting USB, then go BSB/BSB and Sapphire Shot. Do you think it's viable? I'm desperately trying to theory craft and don't want to waste the resources if it may not work. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do you remember how to clear/sub-30 each magicite?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-14 14:02:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Like many on this sub, I've sub-30'd every magicite, and for the sake of repeating it later on, I've saved each sub-30 team in my party roster with appropriate labels (i.e. Bismarck Sub-30). Once I sub-30'd each magicite, I'd get the feel of things and it was easy to do it many times over. I could beat each one a few times in a row if RNG permitted. However, today I went back to Fenrir and I realized I had no idea how I sub-30'd it in the first place. Sometimes, turn order and timing is so crucial that not remembering how you did it in the first place almost makes you start back at square one, regardless whether or not you saved that team in your party roster as a favorite. It took me close to an hour to remember how I did it those first few times around... So does everyone write out a list of each party members' action every turn so they can remember, do you record a video, do you just remember it? I realized that every time I go back to sub-30 a magicite I've done before, there's a long adjustment period of me figuring out just what the hell I did the first time around. Thanks for any advice and tips in advance. And this doesn't just have to be sub-30s. It can be general clears, since even those can be time-consuming and very specific.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Am I Getting Screwed on my Car Loan?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-12 03:03:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Quick back-story**: Bought my car through cash down and financing in June of 2016 at an interest rate of 4.5% on approximately $23k. My partner and I each sold our cars and downsized to one nicer vehicle that we could share and pay off together. My credit was in a pretty rough spot, at the time, of ~580-620, bureau depending. I am glad to say that through timely payment, reducing debts, and handling old credit report problems, I'm now at a 795 and watch my credit like a hawk! However, I'm still not well-versed in how loans and interest work. My partner and I share a monthly car payment of $355. As aforementioned, interest rate is 4.5%. We pay extra every month, and pay instead $400. I called the bank in October of 2016 to make sure that the extra payment would be applied toward principal and not toward total interest/interest on the life of the loan. They assured me it would. Today I received a statement from my bank for the year saying that in 2017 we paid $851.95 in interest. Every month we pay $400, when the payment amount due was only $355. The statement says, for example, that of our $400 payment last month, $331.17 went towards principal. My question is, does that mean that ~$68 went towards interest? My calculations tell me that that means almost 18% of our payment went towards interest instead of 4.5%. I feel like we are getting screwed and I'm going to call tomorrow, but I'm not really sure if we are, or I'm miscalculating, and I don't want to raise hell if I'm actually mistaken. More info: The principal went down, after this payment, from $16,916.70 to $16,585.53 after our payment of $400. As I said before, the summary says $331.17 went to principal. Is the bank trying to pull a fast one? **Tl;Dr:** Applied for financing for car in June/2016. Bank promised extra payment would go towards principal. Found out we paid $851.95 in interest in 2017 out of $4,800 in total payments. This seems like we are paying 17.7% interest instead of the 4.5% stated. Thanks in advance kind financial gurus! I apologize if I seem ignorant in this matter. Truth is: I am.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Consider sending DeNa a positive in-game message/facebook message today.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-14 22:02:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been a somewhat-longtime-lurker on this sub and mainly post congrats posts in the relic pull megathreads. Given the current state of the other sub I'm a member of (FFBE) where everyone is currently in a frenzy over the rage-inducing $50 rainbow pull cash grab, I thought I'd come here and spread some positivity. Global Record Keeper has gotten a lot of flak over the past few weeks, and rightfully so, in some regards. However, I believe things are on the up and up, and it's important that we use positive reinforcement to let DeNa know that we both appreciate and would like to see the trend continue. We are getting a cool Kingdom Hearts collab event in a week's time, as well as getting a pretty nifty Valentine's Day gift that no one expected. The mindset of the sub has completely shifted in less than 24 hours with a simple gesture that no one thought we'd see. So, if you appreciate this, I think we should all take a moment to send some positive feedback. Say how you are happy with the collab, and how refreshing and exciting it is to get it at the same time as JP. Say thank you for the Valentine's Day gift. Maybe if you spend, you can even do a mythril/gem pull on the Kingdom Hearts banner. I know I haven't done an 11-pull gem pull since December, and today did a pull on the XIV banner #2 (hoarded gems that I vowed not to spend until I saw some change). I think it's important to not only voice dissatisfaction, but also approval. We may always be living in the shadow of "JP and GL are different games," but it's important to celebrate those moments when we are happy with the outcome DeNa gives us. Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you have a great day!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who is pulling on Dream Select Banners tomorrow?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-04 20:15:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>...And what will your choices be, and why? Maybe in posting your reasoning, you can help other keepers decide their own selections for reasons they may not have considered. **---------** **OSB:** Either choosing Tidus OSB for Water+ Sword, or Celes OSB for Complete-waifuism. Leaning more towards Celes now since Bartz can use Yuffie ~~USB2~~ AOSB Thrown, Yuffie can use Rikku USB Fist, and Tidus can use his USB Ball. Still a hard choice. **LMR:** Probably going to choose Leon's W-cast Darkness LMR. I don't plan to pull on the II banner that has this, and I lucked into Leon's USB, so this will be a solid option for Siren, as she'll require physical. I usually only choose LMRs if they're W-cast. **BSB:** Still not set on doing this one, but I was thinking Edge BSB... but I may pull once on the IV Banner for Porom's USB, and Edge's BSB recurs there. Plus, Edge mostly uses SSB + Ninja Abilities. Garnet BSB1 is an option for Lightning+ Dagger, but it comes in Library of Guidance. **PSA/Tip:** As always, don #8217;t select until you #8217;ve done all the pulls you #8217;ll do. Small chance, but you may still land that targeted relic. Make sure to check Library of Guidance. Many great things are available there that are options here. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/7l7c51/library_of_guidance_jp_megathread/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I... so happy... OR How Today I Dived Quina!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-07 19:34:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I, like many other Keepers, am trying to keep a balanced Mote distribution concerning my dives, and it came time for me to dive another VIT/BRV unit. My first dive of this type was Ramza (ouch), while my second dive was Shelke (ooh!). Then, it happened. I completed my first two D/V . V/B . D/B . S/Wx2 sequences and came to the third. But which VIT/BRV to dive? Then I got Quina #8217;s USB and LMR searching for Beatrix #8217;s USB, and the recent OSB Dream Select gave me Quina #8217;s BSB off the 11x pull. It was a no-brainer. There seems to be a ton of synergy in this dive, with the LMR granting Last Stand and High Regen, and the Trance offering upped stats, full recovery, and two bars of SB. I bit the bullet today and went for it. Played a few times in OZMA MP and it was a ton of fun quick-cycling USB into BSB breaks and then Wrath #8212; gt;Entrust. Has anyone else dived Quina? What #8217;s your Quina tech look like? Where have you used it? How do you feel about it now? I #8217;m strictly sticking to the S/B . W/B . S/W . D/Vx2 dives from here on out.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who Let the Doges Out?... Or Where You're At With Alexandria Castle Dungeon.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-25 22:46:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Anyone else been farming Alexandria Castle Dungeon nonstop? It's REALLY fast to master new SBs, and the experience is awesome. I don't mind the doges' orb drops, either. I completed most of the old events the last time Renewals came around, so I only have a few 1 stamina battles at the end of each event left. I even figured out a way for iOS autotouch to run the second level of the dungeon over and over while I sleep. I've taken Siren and Tiamat to 99, and currently working on Evrae. Want to try to get as many Magicites to 99 and toons to 80/99 as possible. Anyone else been going crazy mode on the doges? It's insane, because I've been ignoring dailies except for Sunday EXP+. I'll go back to my normal routine once the Renewal Dungeons expire. I'm only devoting stamina to the six Magicites for Keystones, then back to doges! What are your goals? Doing something similarly crazy?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>APPLE/iOS Users, How to Farm Tonberry with Switch Controls!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-10 22:31:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not sure if this is allowed or breaks the Reddit ToS, but Switch Control is an inherent function of Apple products, and per Apple's terms of service, no game maker/producer/publisher can block or prohibit naturally coded functions. Mods, if this does break any rules, I apologize, and understand should it be removed. Switch Control was designed for users with disabilities to have ease of access. Being that the function isn't completely automated (still requires your input... the function just tells the recipe where to put said input, and at what times), it isn't quite a macro, nor botting/automation. Every loop requires a screen input. Use Youtube to look up Switch Control Setup/Farming for iOS. I've also attached a link below to help you find the function and get it going. I used it for FFBE Trust farming at one point, but have made it work for farming Alexandria Castle Dungeon doges, and now Tonberry! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZO_Ibw_2-o **Disclaimer: Not my YouTube Video** There's a quick setup guide to get your switch control going. Below is my method for creating a recipe for Tonberry. **For Karma Stalks, Part 2 Tonberry Farming:** I used a LD Orlandeau with LM1/2, a strong Lightning+ Weapon, NO Armor, an ATK+30 Accessory, Thundering Quadstrike in Ability Slot 1, and the "Love's Wake" Spellblade+ RM. Any Spellblader with IC+3 should work (Lightning, etcetera). Your single toon should be position 3, front row. Battle Speed  gt; 5. - All placements were made on the in-event screen where you select between Karma Stalks Part I and II. - First click is top of the MCII Lode icon on the Karma Stalks Part II banner. - Second click is above the Upgrades  amp; Inventory Button, just high enough so you don't click on it, but will be able to hit ability slot one and [ENTER DUNGEON]/[BEGIN BATTLE] when they pop up. - Third click is position 5 character slot, directly in the center of where both ability slots would be (although there will be no character present). This placement is very forgiving. - Fourth click is again where the MCII Lode click was placed for the first click. A post it or some sort of screen marker helps. - Fifth click is [NEXT] button, but again, above the Upgrades  amp; Inventory button so your cycle doesn't break by bringing you to the item screen. Try not to put it in the same place as Click #2, but still able to hit ability one AND avoid the Inventory  amp; Upgrades button. Watch your cycle a few times. The clicks should select Karma Stalks II, [ENTER DUNGEON], get you past the [PARTY] and [ROAMING WARRIOR] screens, then in battle it will click Orlandeau's head to target him, and follow up with a self-inflicted Thundering Quadstrike. The following menus will all be navigated by any screen clicks, causing you to return to the main Karma Stalks event screen where your Switch Control cycle will repeat and select Stage II again. The only thing is you need to watch for your magicites to hit cap, and when you cue it up, you need to input a bunch of screen taps so it'll continue to run. Also, observe what happens when you run out of stamina. I haven't tested whether or not this will refresh your stamina with gems/mythril, but it shouldn't (my other macro didn't). But god forbid. Test it at least once. I use stamina slightly faster than it generates (about three runs for every one stamina gained), so you will run out of stamina eventually. Also note that sometimes due to loading times, Orlandeau will sometimes target a Tonberry. Mess around with it to find your optimal timing. There you go. Mindless farming made even less harrowing. Took me three tries to get the positioning right (screen marking REALLY helps), and the worst part is you just got to tap the screen a bunch of times to make the loop repeat. Better than manually doing it a bunch of times, I say. Cheers! Let me know if you have any questions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We are about two thirds of the way through deliciously bittersweet Realms on Parade pulls. How #8217;ve your festivities gone down? Salty FFVIII Parade Float, or a joyous Pride Parade Precession complete with cross-dressing Cloud and Final Fantasy heroines laced in feathered boas?! What are your highlights, or lowlights, so far, and then hopes/expectations from here on out? ________________ For me, I got two items I #8217;ve been wanting (Shantotto W-cast Witch USB and Fire+ Mustadio USB Gun!) and Vaan #8217;s OSB! On the salty side, a dupe Rinoa OSB, Y #8217;Shtola situationally-terrible LMR, and a dupe Rude Earth+ BSB Glove *after* I chose it from AA (womp womp!). Regardless, super worth 75 mythril already with six more pulls to go. Hoping for more discotech dancing action, but will be happy with Rosettas if it means the more unlucky (so far) keepers get a good RNG seed and discos! **TALLY:** USBs: Shantotto, Mustadio OSBs: Vaan, Rinoa (dupe) BSBs: Hope1 (dupe), Rude (dupe), Shadow LMRs: Y #8217;Shtola SSBs: Freya (dupe), Yuna (dupe) What about you?

    <DATE>2018-07-21 21:45:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>We #8217;ve all done them. Whether out of rage, monotony of repeating the same button presses over and over, or just a plain of feeling of feeling like we know better and could never make a mistake so stupid... What #8217;s a silly, even irreparable, mistake you #8217;ve made in FFRK that still haunts you? - During the Orlandeau OSB debut event, I pulled three times and kept drawing Mustadio SSB, but finally grabbed Orlandeau OSB and Mustadio BSB on the last pull. Silly me though, I fed the Mustadio BSB to the SSB, thinking they were dupes. - Just right now, I was going through and raising all of my inheritance fodder Magicite to level 80/99 to clear up my Magicite screen. All farming is complete and I just need to farm Magicite for Arcana to complete my decks. Ended up feeding a level 80/99 Krysta to a level 50/50 Krysta to break its level cap. AGHHHHHHHHH. RIP the Arcana and Gil, and the three wasted copies of Krysta I need to go farm again. At least Crystals aren #8217;t a thing anymore... seriously kicking myself. What #8217;s your worst?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[HELP] Beginner here, new to cosplay  #8212; where do I start?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-19 02:53:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>**So, brief introduction:** Been sort of lurking here for a while. Huge nerd; always have been. Shit here is super impressive! Kudos, everyone. Just turned thirty this year and my IDGAF switch turned on, and I #8217;m ready to do things I #8217;ve always been too self conscious to do. Enter: cosplay. I #8217;ve always seen it as a confidence thing, as well as a money issue (cosplay seems like it can be, well... costly). I #8217;m at a stage in my life where neither seem like obstacles. What #8217;s a good way to start? I #8217;ve been reading up on a bunch of different things (prop-making, fabrication with EVA foam, sewing, etcetera), and I even have two classes coming up. A sewing class Monday, and then a three day foam fabrication class in about a month. I was ready to buy a bunch of materials soon (heat gun, EVA foam, paints, box cutter and cutting board, etcetera) and my partner calls me today:  #8220;Hey, there #8217;s a yard sale down the street and they #8217;re selling your costume foam stuff. #8221; https://imgur.com/a/VCgMOGZ I feel like I hit the motherlode. I #8217;ve seen people say it #8217;s about 4-6 pieces for anywhere from $10-20, USD. 116 EVA mats (2 #8217;x2 #8217;x1/2 #8221;) and 25 PVC yoga mats (~6 #8217;x2 #8217;x1/8 #8221;). The couple sold me everything for $30! But now there #8217;s this fortress in my living room and I #8217;m like... okay... So where do I start? I want to cosplay **AURON** from Final Fantasy X for my first project. Ideally, this would be at Comic Con end of October (Los Angeles). Is it acceptable to buy a few things online and make a few things and combine them? I might even buy the sword/haori online to use my first time. Is this acceptable to cosplayers? What about wearing something pre-made and altering it as I go along, slowly changing things to look better as I gain more skills? - Any other tips from pros/seasoned cosplayers? - What are essential items I need to buy in the beginning that are often overlooked? Any recommended brands a must? - Any great resources? I #8217;m open to anything  #8212; I feel like an excited sponge right about now. Thanks for reading my mini-novel and I appreciate any pointers/directions that come my way! Cheers. ;D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...Avoiding those that we know we will eventually get (because they're playable, such as Trey from Type-0). ONLY ONE! Your most wanted! GO! \--- I **REALLY** want Lani to show up for IX. I know she has a minor appearance in the game, but she's probably the character I want the most. I've always been so keen on her. # LANI (IX) **\[Combat 5, Heavy 5, Black 4, Support 4, Samurai 3\]** **\[Daggers, Swords, Axes, Hammers, Bracers, Hats, Helmets, Light Armor, Shields\]** **Large-bladed Bardiche** (6-star Axe \[earth\]) - **Ultra: "Beautiful Bounty"** (Deal twelve physical earth, dark, and non-elemental attacks to one enemy, temporarily infuse the user with the power of earth, and enter **"Dangerous Beauty EX Mode".** **"Dangerous Beauty EX Mode"** temporarily raises the user's Attack a moderate amount, grants one additional rank of Heavy Charge when the user gains a rank of Heavy Charge, and causes the user's heavy abilities to trigger the follow-up ability ** #8221;Ruthless Pursuit"**) * **Ruthless Pursuit:** (Deals 2-6 earth/non-elemental physical attacks to one enemy. The number of attacks depends on the Ability Rank) **Leather Corset** (6-star Light Armor) - **Arcane:  #8220;Heavy-handed Assault"** (Deal three massive physical earth and dark attacks to one target. Can break the damage cap) **Feathered Headdress** (5-star Hat \[earth resist\]) - **Glint: "Elegant Swing"** (Temporarily reduce delay of the user's heavy abilities, and grant the user up to a moderate Heavy Ability Boost. Triggers instantly) **Lani's Guise** (5-star Light Armor) - **LMR1: "Stubborn Assassin"** Begin the battle temporarily infused with the power of earth **Lani's Glove** (5-star Bracer \[earth\]) - **LMR2: "Luxurious Dream"** When low on HP, restore HP to the user, temporarily increase some of their stats a moderate amount, and enter Trance, dealing significantly more damage with physical abilities and granting Retaliate. Can only trigger once per battle **Dive:** Vitality, Dexterity (+79 ATK, +31 DEF, +8 MAG, +30 RES, +1500 HP, +6% Heavy Ability Damage, +6% Damage Wielding Axes, +3% Earth Damage, +3% Physical Damage, +3% Black Magic Damage, Minor Paralyze Resistance, Moderate Paralyze Resistance, Hands Off!, Foul Methods) **LM1 - "Hands Off!"** Reduce physical damage taken a small amount **LM2 - "Foul Methods"** High chance to temporarily grant 1 rank of Heavy Charge to the user (up to rank 2) when using heavy abilities **RMs1-3 - "lol Bio"** **RM4 - "Sharp Tongue"** Deal much more damage with heavy abilities **COMMENTARY:** I tried to keep Lani true to form from her FFIX appearance, both in ability/equipment access (also loosely based on her FFBE appearance) as well as her naming conventions for soul breaks and such. Combat and Heavy pretty much self-explanatory for her large axe that's almost bigger than she, and Samurai 3 due to her retaliate counters. Support because she does do some supporting and uses Scan in battle. Also, she uses second tier black magic spells, so Black 4. Lani foregoes any ability double, w-cast, or initial AASB for many damage boosting and synergistic effects. The USB and Glint go hand-in-hand and really want the LM2. IX needs an Axe user, and also an earth toon. Lani would really like support in the form of gauge from an entrust, and also a crit-fixer. With her damage cap-breaking abilities and the chance to recover Heavy Charges when her skills are used, she should be consistently putting out high damage.  #8203; *DeNa, please...*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen multiple sources saying different things. \- A character render I was able to pull up online and zoom in on says either 10 . 62 or 10 . 69 (can't differentiate) \- A set of replica dog tags for sale say 10 . 08 . 62 (which would make Sonya aged 58 now instead of the commonly accepted 50-51) \- I think it's canonized that she's 26 during the events of Mortal Kombat, but whether that's 1992 \[first game\] or 1995 \[first movie\] I know not Can anyone weigh in with any evidence or point me in the direction of our current Sonya's birthday, and/or current age, for our current timeline at MKXI? I want to be as accurate as possible for something I'm working on. I'm leaning more toward 50-51, and not 58 for the '62 birthday. Pretty sure she might be born in October.

    <TITLE>Anybody else kind of disappointed in the Personality traits?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-02 18:26:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>First, let me start in my saying I LOVE this game. Music, artwork, gameplay, everything #8212;top notch. Nostalgia through the roof. A+. Now, about the personality of certain characters that figures in to the finisher attack after Another Force. Some characters, like **Mariel,** have three: cat lover, staff, clergy. Then we have some, like **Lokido, Gariyu, and Toova,** whose only personality traits are their weapons. Really? Fist and staff. That #8217;s it? I feel like it #8217;s so one-dimensional; not to mention, it #8217;s also extremely hard to fit them in to certain team comps for finishers. I get it #8212;it #8217;s somewhat about balance #8212;as **Toova #8217;s** really strong. But **Lokido?** They could #8217;ve easily incorporated more personality traits or characteristics. Lokido could be  #8220;Non-human #8221; to go along with **Levia, Nagi,** and  #8212; **SPOILERS FOR CHARACTERS DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU ARE ALL CAUGHT UP ON EVENTS** - - - ...**Isuka.** This could be unlocked after her final quest where you learn she #8217;s a scientific creation. **Toova** could have one as  #8220;Melancholy #8221; to go with **Lokido** or  #8220;Spellcraft #8221;to go with **Mighty and Gariyu** (not all magic users are Staff and those that don #8217;t use staff would have  #8220;Spellcraft. #8221;)... **Gariyu and Suzette** could have  #8220;Crazed #8221; or  #8220;Battle lust. #8221; I don #8217;t know. Just throwing things out there. Thoughts? Do they attempt to balance this in the future? Do Another Styles incorporate more traits?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We all know that most of us, barring the whaliest of whales, are a long ways away from ever dreaming about promoting a 3-star into a 4-star unit. Not only must a single unit be pulled five times to max its sync, **but then you must pull it TWENTY more times** to collect the necessary 3-star power-up pieces. However, who among the current 3-stars is the most worthy of the 4-star upgrade, in your opinion? I #8217;m very much looking forward to everyone #8217;s answers, including their rationale and reasoning.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I just sent a support ticket to DeNa regarding Spirited Dispatch.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-05 03:58:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I created the ability before I came to reddit to read how terrible it is. I honed it to R4, because the description made it sound amazing. I went to test it. It doesn #8217;t do half of what it claims. I submitted the following ticket: **Please enter your question as specifically as possible.** *Is there a way I can get my crystals spent on the 6-star Record Ability  #8220;SPIRITED DISPATCH #8221; refunded? I created and honed this ability in excitement upon reading the description, then went to use it. However, it doesn #8217;t A) restore HP to damaged allies, nor does it B) heal additional damage any allies take up to 2,000 HP in total (IT ONLY ADDS 2,000 HP stock to the user). I would not have created this ability, nor honed it, if I knew it was going to be TERRIBLE. This description is both incorrect, misleading, and deceptive. I know DeNa will probably issue an apology and just give 1 mythril, but I don #8217;t want either. I just want my crystals back that I spent creating and honing this ability. And before suggesting I can shatter the ability, know it will only give me a portion of the crystals I spent back. And that is NOT an option, since the description was incorrect and misleading. Please, take away this ability and refund my hard-earned crystals. Thank you kindly, Someone who wants their crystals back.* **Since sent a report saying I also want my torment rubies back.** **So, does DeNa have some cleaning up to do? Did you create it before checking reddit like I did?**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I finished Urpina #8217;s quest up to rescuing her father and I just had her brother, Antonius, join me back at Sylmium. I finished the Phoenix quest line. As I headed north from Sylmium, a woman approached me asking me to find and destroy shards. I didn #8217;t want to be locked into a long run and fetch quest for the time being, so I said no. The woman said she #8217;d find another champion. Did I lock myself out of this quest completely? Also, any good walkthroughs or FAQs online? Playing blindly and am no stranger to SaGa games, but looking to maximize my time in-game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Follow-up Email on Spirited Dispatch Bug/Translation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-25 22:21:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the compensation today was a start, but it only refunds the creation cost, not honing. What player creates an ability and goes to test that it functions correctly!? Probably none. I read the awesome description and immediately honed to rank 4. I #8217;ve gone back and forth with support, and here is my follow-up email:  #8212; **Hello again, Today your team issued an apology compensation for the  #8220;Spirited Dispatch #8221; bug where the ability did not function as intended, using the items as follows: - 180 Rubies - 6 Fire, 6 White, and 10 Earth Crystals However, this only refunds the price of creating the ability. Not honing it. No player simply creates an ability to Rank 1 and then goes to test it to make sure it functions correctly. I read the description and immediately honed to rank four. Because the ability does not function as intended based on the original description, I want to shatter the ability and refund my crystals spent; the translation on this ability made it sound amazing, but it #8217;s actually quite awful. However, if I were to shatter the ability, I would only regain HALF of my resources: - 33 White, 33 Fire, and 55 Earth Crystals Factoring in the compensation, this leaves me in a net deficit of: -27 White, 27 Fire, and 45 Earth Crystals The surplus of rubies is nice, but in the age of the influx of 6* abilities, crystals also matter. I have refrained from shattering this ability or collecting the compensation from my inbox. Please, either refund me the remaining deficit of crystals were I to shatter this ability, or remove the item from my inventory and refund the entire crystal amount for ability creation and honing to rank four, less the amount given in the compensation. I hope your team will do the right thing. This was an error on your part, and as a player who continually supported the game via monetary transactions, I expect to be made whole. I would not have created this ability if the original description correctly stated how the ability function. Thank you for your understanding.**  #8212; Is anyone else in the same situation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, I know for a fact that I got the Long Barrel II equipment from a crate last night because I opened it, read the title and description and then immediately went to go put it on Becca. Lo and behold, when I go to put it on, it's like I didn't get it and it's still X'd out (I have enough points to equip it, so that isn't the issue). Has anyone else had a case of equipment not showing up after you've acquired it? I'm kind of bummed because it seems like a great placeholder til I unlock better things for my level 30 Becca.</TEXT>

Especially when you can see there's something clearly (albeit unclear because too small) written or designed there. Does anyone know what the patches are, what they say, or where to find hi-res character concept art or images that show the patches on Martin's blue button-down? /curiosity</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Resident Evil Outbreak PS3 Controller Issue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 21:32:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I ran into an issue when trying to play Outbreak on my backwards compatible PS3. At first I thought my controller was going crazy. Controller would turn off bluetooth after booting the disc, then randomly turn off halfway through the first level even after I turned it back on. Maybe my controller is bad? ...hmm... Linked my PS4 controller with bluetooth, but no 'start button' to begin the game... so I ordered a new PS3 controller. New PS3 controller synced and ready to go. Controller bluetooth turns off after booting the disc. It's not my bluetooth chip in the system or a bad controller now, by process of elimination. Does anyone else have an issue with Outbreak and their Sony brand bluetooth controller on PS3? Kind of at a loss what to do, and it's a nightmare having your controller randomly turn off during Decisions, Decisions when Thanatos is pursuing, or being chased by hunters in Below Freezing Point only to die because the controller powered off... XD I can play plugged in with USB cable, but my PS3 is up high on the entertainment center, and having the cable across the tv and living room is... difficult. **EDIT** I tried PS3 games and don't have the issue, and other PS2 games are fine. I'm thinking it's this game specifically and more so seeing if my issue is unique or anyone else has found a way to circumvent the issue. Thank you in advance for any help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally hear what you are saying: **Nicholai** can be hard countered by any group of survivors with guns and **Nemesis** is still susceptible to stun tactics. He's still more viable than the other MMs, sans **Spencer.** As for the other character mentions, while they are the dream team and can handle pretty much all thrown at the them together, tier lists are supposed to consider characters in a vacuum and not in tandem with any other factors besides the possibility of facing each mastermind independently (you're evaluating their skills solely). All survivors can handle cameras because they have access to guns from the box... same goes for traps. **Martin** loses some value if the MM doesn't run creatures; both his personal skill and frenzy are wasted besides the personal deactivating traps, if any. However, all others can also handle traps. No creatures = Martin being somewhat useless and superfluous, which hurts his ranking. His flash baton is useless here. Even if the mastermind isn #8217;t running creatures, the melee characters **(Sam/Tyrone)** can still handle cameras AND take the bullets due to being tanky. **January**, on the other hand, can combat cameras which prevents both turrets and creature/BOW placement. She has cheap, non-firearm, thrown weapons for mob-control, or powerful special weapons for a damage kick. However, **Tyrone, Val, and Sam** have all the tools, IMO. Tankiness/Reviving/Healing/Mob Control in the form of nigh invulnerability/regeneration/buffs and debuffs/multiple thrown explosives (pretty much all respectively where characters skills apply, though some do overlap). And as aforementioned, they all can handle cameras and traps in a coordinated effort granted they have guns. **Becca and Jill** are mostly one or two trick ponies, IMO. One change I would make is probably bumping **Jan** up a half tier if it were possible, but she still leaves something to be desired in the health/healing realm. Lastly, this was more to showcase the items in the **"S"** tier as a joke. While this is still my opinion, it is subjective and I'm in no way trying to be overly contrary, nor saying you are wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Love this idea. But there exist a few problems with the theory. It would explain the obviously African American human-become-monster that pursues the group in Outbreak's *Decisions, Decisions*. However, I'd imagine the events of Resistance (were they confirmed canon, like Outbreak has been) would need to happen long before RE2/3/Outbreak's timeline. You'd need time for Tyrone's transformation, and then housing in the test tube for programming and final development (not to mention the transfer to the university, whether or not all of the aforementioned processes took place there, or not). Creating tyrants, and BOWs in particular, was a difficult and fickle process during the timeline of RE1-3, and more often than not the subjects died and couldn't handle the effects. It took quite some time to stabilize the creations. But as it can't be canon (how would Jill be down there? how are all the MMs in one place? do they exist as separate what-ifs like Outbreak scenarios?) we can only assume Tyrone doesn't tie in to Outbreak canon... which leads me to my next point. It's a shame, because Resistance makes reference to the Outbreak canon in alluding to Jan and Alyssa being colleagues, or at least acquaintances, and Valerie becoming suspicious of Umbrella after her friend becomes amnesiac (Yoko). Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes do refer to Outbreak with various advertisements and billboards in-game mentioning products created specifically for Outbreak, RE2's mention of the RPD officer, Rita, from *Desperate Times*, and even RE7' s eventual nod to Alyssa Ashcroft through her written article appearing. So much meaty speculation. I love it. I can only hope Capcom clarifies the canon here and does tie it in. So much potential. But on the other hand, so much retconning of the canon. *\*shrugs\**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is days old, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. ...To say thanks. Seriously, thank you. As a fellow Californian, I #8217;ve spent the last several days out in the streets screaming during protests and marching because I #8217;m fucking angry. My feet hurt. I #8217;m sunburned to hell. I have almost no voice. And yet none of that compares to: - what this man #8217;s family is going through, or the family of all the others before him; - how I #8217;m sure good, upstanding officers feel having thousands of screaming people yelling at them when all they #8217;ve ever wanted to do was the right thing; - or how black- and brown-skinned Americans who are so tired of this shit and so tired of feeling afraid for their lives feel every day when they step outside the safety (relative word) of their homes. The crazy part is, I #8217;ve had like 95% amazing experiences with police officers. I #8217;m a relatively light-skinned, mixed Hispanic male, and never any major problems. ...And yet I feel so distrustful, so angry, so terrified being around police. When out marching, I can #8217;t even look them in the eyes. It feels like I #8217;m walking amidst stacks of TNT. And I hate that. And I #8217;m sure that #8217;s how most protestors feel. We don #8217;t want to feel this way, and yet I think this is more indicative of the system rather than individual police officers or the units themselves. Many police officers probably feel equally afraid. I #8217;m rambling, but just wanted to circle back and say thank you. I #8217;ve wanted to tell officers out on the front line who have been there with us, helping us  #8220;keep the peace #8221; (as it definitely takes two sides), thank you and yet I just can #8217;t bring myself to even speak words in their direction even though I know many of them feel torn apart inside. It must be agonizing to see signs like  #8220;ACAB #8221; or to be called awful names because you wear a uniform. Honestly, the thought of being at home seeing Floyd #8217;s death on television, then being enraged and sad about it all day, then having to put on a uniform to go out and be yelled at and have things thrown at you for the very same reason that you #8217;re also angry about...? Damn, I don #8217;t think I could do it. I #8217;m talking too much. Thank you for sharing, and thank you in general.  #128591; #127996; Your story helped me in some way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really like Resistance (it ha(d)s potential), but they keep dropping the ball. Every patch introduces more balance issues. Resident Evil 2 Remake has some issues, but it warranted the price and was a valiant effort at remaking a really amazing game with some pretty fun DLC. Resident Evil 3 Remake feels like a hollow cardboard cutout of Raccoon City. Most things reimagined here feel like bargain bin grabs. They cut so many corners that it #8217;s hard not to feel bitter if you played the original. The OG RE3 was far from perfect. Yes, it was short. But it had gusto and heart. But I just can #8217;t help but feel like the remake feels sort of... empty. Almost every aspect from the original was made worse in some way. (I should mention I love new Jill and the new character designs. However, Nemesis was made markedly worse, IMO.)  #8212; I #8217;m not bitter at all over my $59.99 + tax. I swear. @_@ /s</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Matilda v Six-Shooter RNG is garbage. They both need to be available or you #8217;re screwed if you don #8217;t have a Jan. As for creatures, Annette uses them to great effect, but that doesn #8217;t mean they #8217;re not underpowered. Balance usually exists in a vacuum and needs to attain balance across the board. While some MMs excel in different departments, some MMs should not even deploy creatures because of how fucked their AI and viability are. This also means toning down survivors so that they can #8217;t plow through entire hoards with torches like a skewer through marshmallows for s #8217;mores. But this is why we #8217;re at the gun meta to begin with. Creatures have become so inferior and obsolete to guns that no MM wants to play them. And do we blame them? The meta evolves like a living organism, and that living organisms has determined that creatures deployed means a lesser chance for survival.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love tons of party members. Even games where the characters aren #8217;t extremely fleshed out but have enough of a personality and defining factor (Chrono Cross, Romancing SaGa games, etc.) are great to me. You can still have lots of playable characters but flesh out the few main  #8220;main #8221; characters enough. As long as the story is good, the characters can help keep it moving. Just be careful that the characters are different enough to warrant having them playable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was excellent advice. Also, consider scale. How long will each tile by foot travel take? So a town and mountain path are three tiles apart and yet the journey seems to take minutes. Then you have another village nine tiles above the first town and the party arrives and says it takes days? This can really throw things off and make your world seem inconsistent/a lot smaller than it really is. Decide how much each tile takes in the span of  #8220;foot travel. #8221; This can really give an idea to the breadth of your world (especially when everything on the world map is usually scaled down, including the playable character #8217;s sprite). Consistency is key!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you didn #8217;t damage your ear and that is indeed wax causing the hearing loss, try placing the blocked ear over a heat source. This is going to sound crazy, but I had a lot of ear aches and blockages as a child, and my mom used to light a candle and I #8217;d place my ear to the side of it (not too close or to where it #8217;s painful). You can also use a heated blanket cranked up high. Also used a hairdryer to good effect. The heat starts to make the wax soften up. She would then follow up with ear drops that would break down the wax. Be extra careful. If all else fails, go see an ENT doc (ear-nose-throat). Do NOT attempt to stick anything further in your ear. They have this warm water flush gun that blasts into your ear and sprays out TONS of gunk into a tray that sits under your ear and against your neck. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, no, not ear candling. As far as I know, those things have been debunked and there #8217;s no proof they create negative pressure and pull out any wax/debris.

I #8217;m just recommending a  #8220;safe #8221; heat source to soften the wax and allow ear drops to do their job so that the ear can properly irrigate. **Edit:** I also wouldn #8217;t recommend sticking anything in the ear, especially when that caused the issue in the first place.</TEXT>

I think I messed up already.  #128514; All of my SS are 30+ style, but have slowed down considerably, so I started leveling their other styles thinking those were shared, too. Oy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess the stats shared across all styles are the ones gained at the end of a battle (grinding raw stats). Also, EXP for leveling styles is shared across characters with the same name or an evolution line (Red #8212; gt; Alkaiser; Orion #8212; gt; Hector; etc.). However, leveling up an A/S style for an SS has no effect besides the weapon mastery level. (Those levels are unique to that style as far as boosts go.) Or at least, that #8217;s my understanding. The only reason to level up an A/S style if you have the SS copy is to: A) Gain the skills for inheritance; B) Gain and max the raw stats gained after battle, since these are shared across character (for example, SS Subier has HORRIBLE accuracy, but by leveling the S copy and gaining stats after battle with the S version can get in the current event, we can mitigate that since these stats ARE shared across styles for each unique character; C) lastly you gain experience of the A/S style doing the two things above that can be used to level the SS style to max style rank of 50 since experience is shared across styles. The only reason to level styles for A/S character is for the weapon mastery levels, which affect overall damage modifiers. The bonuses gained are only unique to that style. This is why it #8217;s kind of a waste to level A/S characters you don #8217;t have the SS for (unless you plan to get them later like people are doing with Rouge, or how I #8217;m leveling S Undine for her SS that will come later on). Using them in battle is fine: you unlock skills, you gain raw stats for the better version, but you never go to ENHANCE STYLE in the dojo screen unless you want to level up weapon masteries #8212;this experience is saved to level the SS style. At least, that #8217;s my convoluted understanding. **disclaimer:** If I textually, literally sound drunk, it #8217;s because I am.  #128527; Ps #8212;SS Rouge just dropped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Adding on...If you #8217;ve ever played Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, FF Record Keeper, Dissidia, Fire Emblem Heroes... it #8217;s the same concept. Characters from all different worlds or timelines summoned into one realm that needs saving as memories/visions/echoes/fates, whatever it may be, so that they can save this world and effectively their own (in a way). Characters summoned have knowledge of their own timeline up until the point they were summoned from their world (such as our SaGa styles) and then consequently follow that thought process in their thinking and appearance and arrive in our world to aid the main hero. It #8217;s crazy how many mobile games are doing this now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Since he has different growths you #8217;ll get different stat caps and such. It #8217;s good to level the A/S variants for their skills to inherit and also to round out the stats of their SS since they can cover spots the SS lacks (like S Subier from this event leveled helps the attacks of SS Subier not miss as much). Just don #8217;t spend style points on the A/S as these are shared across styles. Level up your SS styles first as close to 50 as you can #8212;unless you plan on actually using the characters long-term in battle (like this guide mentions). Only move to leveling A/S styles if you somehow max the SS, as you can still gain weapon mastery bonuses, which are party-wide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry this is a bit late (and this past week's Zweig Battles have passed), but a few things that helped me: \- Use the unlimited/always open Tri-Stones Daily Dungeons to level up. Levels 4 - 7 are MUCH easier to get your characters online than actual story dungeons as they still have great stats caps (your characters will have the large sparkles); \- As these battles are easier and stats are shared globally across different styles for characters of the same name, use your A/S versions of characters. They have MUCH better stat growths and you'll generally get more stat ups per battle from your energy, getting you more bang for your buck. I only use my SS variants for the hardest battles due to their skillset and unique style bonuses. (PS: In the beginning, only Enhance Style on your SS versions; just use your A/S versions to farm for stats.) The A/S growths are generally superior for all characters except a few (SS Katarina has better than her S style, for example). Check out their attributes to see. \- Once in VH story mode, you start getting S weapons drops at about 30-50% drop rates. Level these up immediately! Even better if they have a stat after them, i.e. (STR), and MUCH BETTER if it says something like (STR+). They add +3 and +4 whatever stat it is, respectively. Look for DEX on Bows and Short Swords (Rapiers/Epees) and STR on everything else (AGI on Gloves is better, though #8212;quicker and higher damage modifier, strangely!). Even if they don't have the modifier, level them up. This made a HUGE change for me. Evolve them if you have the materials. This helps with specific missions and raises the WP cap, per weapon, that helps your characters' skills do more damage. \- By grinding up your A/S styles for the raw stats, you can then use the style EXP to level up your SS styles for the same characters. This unlocks stat bonuses and style bonuses. Also, inherit your best A/S skill onto your SS. When it's time to face hard story battles, your SS squad will be good to go! \- Use your expeditions. 1 - 3 are for newer characters. 4 is for main squad. Once they have very little sparkles, you'll get diminishing returns. Rotate the next squad at 3 up to 4 to make good use of the time you wait. Use your instant tickets to quickly gain some stats. Make sure you send out A/S variants, not SS! A/S have better stat gains, generally, so you'll get a better bang for your tickets and time. The only time I would say otherwise is if you only have an SS version available, like I have with my SS Ellen. \- Try to use your main character skills over and over for rank ups. Doesn't directly help CP, but gaining a skill rank has increased damage for me by 7-10 when I have noted it use by the same character, during the same round, on the same enemy. These levels are shared across styles, too! Also try to lower BP cost of your best skills so you can use them more frequently. That's all I can think of for now. Biggest things is to grind in the Tri-Stone dungeons until you can safely farm 4.1.5 Very Hard (where SS Terry can drop) and to use your A/S variants so you get more stats per battle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course. As for Bear, yeah, it would be recommended to send him through the first expeditions a few times to get him up to snuff. You can go back a few levels in the Tri-stone dungeon to bring him up to speed, too. Also, running two healers can help until you get him online. S Undine and SS tree Sophia, for example. Just put a hanky character up front in Imperial Cross or Desert Lance (Hector works very well). Once Bear gets some bulk and learns Parry, you #8217;ll be golden.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unlimited Saga was strange to me in the fact that you didn't actually have to battle. You could run through a dungeon avoiding encounters and still get powerful tablets at the end to power up and hold your own in battles. Those reels pissed me off, though. So. Much. RNG.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>DEFINITELY get SS Albert's -Parry- to Rank 2. It's a god send having it available more often until you can get enemies on lockdown with Rouge or at least de-buffed. I also got Sophia's -Bonecrusher- to Rank 2. It gives her something constructive to do with extra BP on off-turns where she isn't healing (especially with Albert soaking all the hits up front). It was extremely useful to be able to stack STR- and heal on turns where you need it. Alternatively, I've never not been able to heal with this method using Healing Light. I always have excess BP. I didn't rank up Healing Light because you can only use it a set number of times, and with Albert and ranked Parry, it isn't as necessary. I haven't ranked anyone else's skills yet, but Poison Blow from Rouge is next on my list. It hits hard, and having it available for 7 BP will be awesome. Dark Chains is already a net 0 skill, so I left that alone. On the other hand, poison is so extremely OP when it lands, I've seen it taking off 7k in HP a turn from certain bosses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stats carry over to other styles. Take advantage of high sparkle rates with this double stat gain event for Flurry, Monica, Azami, etc. Even though my main 4.1.5 VH farm team doesn't have the highest sparkle rate, I was able to work in two of the above at any time to continue farming for Terry shards and stats. This puts future Julian, Flurry, Monica, Azami, etc. styles at an advantage. That's just my opinion. My strong team carries two "babies" in and they still grow at the end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Played FFBE from soft launch through February of last year. It was great in the beginning. Then I just felt like a slave to powercreep. Barely any lateral units. It's just the next powerful unit blasting the last out of the water. And the bosses became more and more of a slog with crazy AI that you needed a guide to figure out and one wrong move would throw the entire run an hour in. I was much happier when I quit. Played WOTV for two days and realized it'll be the same thing, with its 50 different premium currencies and whatnot. Nope. Bye. I am loving SagaRe;U so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rather than use one main party, focus on a few different units with different strengths. **SS:** Ellen, Sophia, Blue, Cat, Rouge, Hector, Azami, Katarina, and maybe Monica for off-tanking pierce damage. **S:** Undine, and grab Santa Flurry from the current event. Your main party could be any of the above, rotating out for strengths and weakness, of course. Make sure to also train the A/S style variants of your SS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course. Me, personally, I #8217;m aiming for level 42 on A/S styles I own for my Main and Secondary Roster (so my SS styles are stronger). I only did this after my relevant SS styles hit 30, however, so I could get their third ability. If I have them unlocked past 30, experience goes their first. I also only farm stats with A/S characters since they generally have better growths (except a few... SS Katarina comes to mind as better than her S, and both current Blue styles are pretty comparable). After that, it #8217;ll be a long while before we hit style level 50 on our SS, so might as well use that EXP just sitting their on A/S up to level 42, since they #8217;re easier to unlock style caps. That being said, I only use the generic bronze pieces and then both character-specific AND generic silver pieces to unlock A/S styles. That way I can sell the character-specific bronze puzzles for the White Rose Exchange currency for stamina potions and other goodies. (The generic pieces cannot be sold for this currency, and we get a ton #8212;so recommended to use them over the style ones from pulling dupes.)

Things that carry over from style to style: Raw stats gained after battle (though some styles, usually A/S, have better growths than SS), skills, skill levels, weapon mastery bonuses, experience pool (used for leveling styles). A/S -- gt; Used to generally grind for stats, unlock skills, and gain weapon mastery levels (also to hoard experience for an SS style you'll be getting soon, like people were doing for SS Rouge with his A style). SS -- gt; Used to level the style as far as you can for style bonuses, stat percentage modifiers, abilities, skills, and to kick ass in the hardest content. Some SS are better to grind stats with (like SS Katarina). Look at their attributes on a case by case basis. It's a lot, but I hope this helps.</TEXT>

But what do you say to people with hypothyroidism, Hashimoto disease, and a host of other factors that don't allow one to be "un-fat" or at least the body type that **IS** celebrated by society and the media? Because, let's face it, society and the media don't necessarily celebrate or reward "average" body types, either. It's a lot more complex than "body composition is a choice."

When you #8217;ve grinded enough that your team no longer has the max glimmer rate animation, you can safely head back to the content you couldn #8217;t beat in *most* instances. Once you hit VH 4.1.5, it #8217;s the safest place to continually grind due to the slash weakness and ease of paralysis (with Rouge). Until then, Ruins Exploration: Tri-Stones 4-7 will get you there. Just keep pumping stats through what you CAN beat, and explorations. Pump your mains through the fourth exploration when you #8217;ve unlocked it with the instant tickets. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the consensus is just do the third hard stage x3 once a day, and then maybe farm whatever you need the last day (even without bonus)? I feel like I #8217;ve wasted a ton of stamina now farming all three normal and hard stages with bonus once every day, haha. I currently have regular SS Monica, SS Seasonal Julian, S Seasonal Azami, and S Seasonal Flurry, so good on the bonus front.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which I'm trying to balance, but no Mind characters interest me yet. If Elarra had hers, I would get it in an instant since she's fully record-boarded. Same with Selphie\_\_\_\_in fact, if she had a board and HA, it'd be a no-brainer. Selphie is actually my go to healer because I have her GSB+, all three USBS, and AASB. Her dance lets me hard counter most enemy buffs, she has status block ASTRA, two USBs with Last Stand, Regenga and Regen for Sap/Poison, and HQC2 all across her different tools. Her AASB helps me get haste after Dispel or Raise after auto-death with REALLY helpful blinks and dance-induced party-wide damage mitigation. I seemingly cannot die with Tyro entrusting her. It's bonkers. I haven't used Elarra in maybe... two months? I'm still looking out for suitable mages... but I also don't need any abilities. I'm all set on magicite, and just about to defeat my last Omega. 1st Keeper problems, I guess. P.ecil's HA hybrid destroyed any need for Mind HAs since I have Beatrix's HA and Healing Smite (3 abilities for PHYS) and then Mind P.ecil with De'Dia, Holyja, and Lunar Dragon (technically 4 abilities for MND/MAG). But yeah, at the end of the day, it's my own fault. Orran will probably be my next non-PHYS pick for HA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Highest stat cap and glimmer rate, all enemies able to be paralyze-locked by Rouge, and all enemies have Slash weakness. Very easy to manual to a point where your team can auto later on and still get good stat boosts. I'm at a point where three of my mains are able to carry two babies just fine. Luckily, Azami is one of my mains so she is benefitting from the +2 stat gains for this event. My team is carrying baby Monica and Julian to reap the +2 benefits. Every time they get a stat in a growth area they're terrible in, I get twice the amount of stats which is a major boon to leveling toons. Bigger bang for your farming buck. The stage also has a chance to drop SS Terry. You can raise him or convert his pieces to fragments to buy stuff from the White Crystal Exchange. Lastly, great experience both for Style Enhancing AND Player Level, which gives you quicker level ups for "free" stamina refills. Save your stamina pots for the 6th of July for half-stamina event! Double your farming efficiency!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Less of a question and more of a "give me your thoughts" sort of deal. Trying to take temperature on this to see if I'm being a hoarder with mega elixir-syndrome or not. XD I've gotten four copies of SS Terry from 4.1.5 VH. So I currently have 120 pieces in reserve. I know most recommend exchanging this for stamina pots (already purchased them all) and then later exchanging for universal gold pieces (both in the White Crystal Exchange). But I just can't... bring... myself... to do it. The crazy thing is: I think he actually looks extremely competent on paper -- Good even! Great growths through Karl... nice abilities on the SS... a nice load out in skills through both A and SS variants. But I'll probably never use him because I own A/S/SS Azami, A/SS Cat, and A Red/SS Alkaiser, all of whom are infinitely better and excel at what they do. But I keep telling myself *'What if you want to run a party of four brawlers?' or* *'What if they do global exclusives and the RS2 brawler job gets an exclusive?' or* *'What if we get global-exclusive buffs?'* Anyone else having trouble exchanging the farmed gold pieces that AREN'T SS Rouge? I know I can just hang on to them and *neither* sell nor use them. But it got me thinking *'Am I the only one?'*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only if you plan the use them. Otherwise, you should get them to style level 42 for weapon mastery level (this is a damage bonus shared globally and not just unique to THAT style, such as the stats bonus modifiers % or the flat attribute gains at certain style levels). This is more min/max though and can definitely be saved for later. Make sure your main team is pretty airtight first with a few in reserves to rotate in for strength/weakness. After that, sell excess A/S style pieces away for White Crystal pieces to buy stamina pots or Universal Gold Pieces. Maxing a character #8217;s style beyond 42 that you DON #8217;T plan to use is only a waste of Aurum, character experience, and puzzle pieces with the potential to be White Crystals (or used on another character if they were universal). Grinding with A/S to farm raw character stats is fine since that experience is shared across all that character #8217;s styles and the skill ranks are retained across styles. They usually have better stat growth, too, saving you time and energy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, to be fair, you get the following farming Rouge: - A lot of lower units can clear it with max sparkles in about 1/4 the time it takes to farm 4.1.5 VH - +60 player EXP a pop - Save an extra stamina every time at ~4x the clear rate speed of 4.1.5 - .67% chance at Rouge - You can farm gems for raise __X__ # of characters to __X__ level missions very easily And for farming Terry on 4.1.5 VH: - Takes about 4x the time it takes to farm for Rouge - 297 player EXP a pop. Considering you can run almost 4 missions for Rouge at 60 EXP In the time it takes to farm Terry #8217;s stage, the difference isn #8217;t that bad - Higher chance for Terry if you want pure exchange fodder for White Crystals  #8212;DONT feel too bad about not being able to do 4.1.5 VH hard yet. You can still use this time to progress towards it since all story missions are 50% off stamina cost #8212; Good luck amigo!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh for sure! I #8217;m just going to farm to 42 because that will benefit all my staff users due to the weapon mastery (in addition to SS Rouge style #8217;s stats). Then I #8217;ll move to mainly 4.1.5 as my stamina gains from leveling up get higher (I don #8217;t want to sit overfilled cap too long because I lose out on regen). Terry has a higher drop rate, so I can exchange him for universal gold pieces to raise the rest of my mains to 42. The cost for each subsequent level after 42 in gold pieces becomes steeeeeep so my farming becomes less drastic in team benefit, stat-wise (where I can round out a bunch of others for the same effort). Once everyone is 42, I #8217;ll probably return to Rouge to get him to 50. Or at least that #8217;s my thinking. /wall of text **currently at 0 Rouge copies, three Terry copies when stamina is overflow farming**  #129318; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039; #129335; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**FIRSTLY:** No, **you cannot be banned for using Switch Control on iOS**. Apple makes it so developers cannot make built-in functions in Apple products against the developers' ToS. \- With that out of the way, I apologize for the length of the video and the wobbly nature of it. I don't have the time or resources to make a visual picture guide, or even a text guide. No fancy editing software or a way to overlay my voice... etc. If someone wants to make a written version for those that don't do videos: amazing! This should get you through setup and allow you to start farming. \- I use an old iPhone 7 Max that **isn't my main phone**. Constant **Switch Control can cause your screen to burnout over time** and **also kill your battery life**. Make sure it isn't running 24/7, or if it is, **that it's in a place with ventilation where it won't overheat**. ALSO, **SET SCREEN BRIGHTNESS TO THE LOWEST SETTING**. \- With this method, you won't run out of stamina due to half-stamina. It will auto click through level up screens. Make sure you have "Full-Power AUTO" set before you begin the process. I recommend doing a higher cost stage so you can dip below stamina max cap when you level up, allowing you to regen some stamina. \- My video cut off at the end. You can end Switch Control easier by clicking the phone off, turning it on, and then clicking the home button three times. Otherwise, if you click three times while Switch Control is still active, you have to wait for it to cycle through all of your tap "loops" or "cycles" for your recipe. \- Boot up Switch Control, tap your screen a couple hundred times (I watch tv and tap all my fingers over it for about five minutes) and then let it run wild. Let me know if you have any questions. Happy mindless, no babysitter needed farming. **DISCLAIMER:** I recommend watching a few cycles of your recipe and also what happens when you run out of energy/stamina, **JUST TO MAKE sure no funny business happens**. I know a few people in FFBE that had their macros/Switch Control use all of their gems/Lapis because they didn't monitor how it acted in certain scenarios. Don't wake up to all your gems spent because you didn't test it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is pretty regular, but now is the time to get stamina up from leveling! When you #8217;re overflowed, move to running dailies for the same EXP but full cost. When you dip under your max cap, go back to farming 4.1.5. That way you get some passive regen for stamina and it is t all wasted above cap!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to clarify on top of what others said, you'll only want to style level up to 42 for styles you won't use in harder battles. That's the last style level for weapon mastery points.  #8203; For example, I've got SS/S Albert. SS Albert I can aim to 50. S Albert 42 only, so I can save puzzles pieces, aurum, stamina and character experience. I only want the universal weapon mastery bonus from style level 42 here. Every bonus after is style specific to S Albert and doesn't help me when I use SS Albert or other sword units. Since this Albert will only farm easier stages for stats, I don't want to go past 42.</TEXT>

Also have awakened Bonesplitter for SS Sophia, Cat, and Azami, so they neuter all physical attackers, haha. So that NY Kat will definitely be a target for me. White Rose is a 100% get for me. I #8217;ve read she is the #1 must. Undine, I just awakened both her heal and then Cyclone Squeeze x2. She already feels like an SS character to me. Can #8217;t wait for the actual SS version. So the Asellus mystic is the one to aim for? And it sounds like Male Emperor has the cover mechanic like SS Gustave right now. Do you when about he would be set to drop? Definitely can #8217;t wait to get my hands on Roc, either, since she #8217;s just the status package for CC. :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>1099 Reporting Gross Proceeds Paid to Attorney</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 07:35:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work as a legal assistant in a small sole-proprietor law firm. My boss had his tax man prepare his taxes this year, and it #8217;s the first year where we #8217;ve made money off of numerous personal injury contingency cases. We get a settlement for the client, entire amount goes into a trust, attorney takes his cut, doles out amount to all medical providers, and then pays the client their share. The insurance companies are required to provide a 1099 - MISC for the gross proceeds paid in settlement. These gross proceeds are reported in box 14 of the 1099. The 1099s have the attorney #8217;s EIN number and address. When he files his taxes, does he report only his taxable income from the 1099s (e.g. what he actually makes as income for his contingency cut of the settlement) or does he have to report the gross proceeds (box 14 - total settlement) and then make a line item deduction for the amounts paid and due to the client after paying medical providers and advanced costs on the Schedule C? From the 1099 instructions on the back of the document, it says only to report the taxable income on your report. My fear is the attorney will be taxed for the entire amount despite the gross amount not being his personal income. (It should be noted that in most of these cases, the entire amount after paying the attorney and medical providers is for  #8220;pain and suffering #8221; and injuries and not taxable by law anyways.) Thanks for any help. We are a small firm that has really grown in the past year and our tax guy is confusing the heck out of us. I am just trying to make sure my attorney doesn #8217;t get overtaxed, and at the same time that we aren #8217;t making a major mistake where he #8217;s under-/over-reporting with the IRS. Much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can not destroy your characters. If you look at attributes by long-pressing a character, you #8217;ll see blue arrows pointing upwards next to some stats (sometimes two!). One means easy to raise. Two means even easier to raise. In most cases, you #8217;ll see that A/S styles have better growths. This just means you #8217;ll hit important stats caps in less time and energy spent farming them. All this means is that some A/S styles in most cases have better stat growth than their SS counterparts and should be the ones used to grind and farm raw stats. Since all stats gained after battle are shared by a character across all styles, you would then go and use the SS style, with their better style bonus modifiers (the number you see with percentages after leveling up a style) in the hardest battles. Tl;Dr  #8212; - Grinding and farming easy content  #8212; gt; A/S most of the time (look at their growths in attributes) - Hard battles: SS (usually) - Enhance style? SS. These bonuses will modify your character #8217;s raw stats! - Extra experience left after maxing your SS style as high as it #8217;ll currently go? Enhance A/S styles you don #8217;t use in hard battles to level 42 for weapon mastery bonuses. These are shared across weapon types globally for all characters. (This is more endgame.)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Unofficial (Tentative) Global Banner Roadmap (AUG 2020)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-08 23:05:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>**APOLOGIES TO EVERYONE ON MOBILE. I realize this is showing up super ugly and not how it is on my Mac. I'll try to find a workaround.**  #8203; * Firstly, this is obviously **unofficial** and is subject to the global devs making changes to the banners, either via altering their order or by changing the content of the banners themselves. **This will be a living, breathing document that I continue to update and modify as actual release dates drop.** * This will **not include any ratings or analysis** of the units. There are many write-ups currently in this sub giving global a JP perspective of upcoming banners/content. * I am basing this off of various resources available online that I will link towards the end of this document. I have cross-referenced all of these different spreadsheets and databases to create this roadmap based on our own unique global starting point. If the devs decide to stick to specific release days of the week in Global, this will throws things off a bit, but this should at least give you an idea of what banners to expect and when. * Obviously, a lot of banners are themed around a specific holiday release in JP. Who knows if this will alter our schedule or if they'll keep it as is and continue to use the *"ZOMG, tower/grave distortion send us whacky timing holiday!"* I imagine they'll keep banners mostly the same, lest they decide they need to rebalance characters to maintain a viable power creep relative to the release timeline. * Part of me thinks the banners won't change much because the banner art is already complete and just needs to be translated for each event. But we shall see. * **NOTE ABOUT MISSING DATAMINED UNDINE/VOLCANO BANNERS:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/SaGa\_ReuniverSe/comments/hnrpiu/unofficial\_tentative\_global\_banner\_roadmap\_aug/fxdbqz7?utm\_source=share amp;utm\_medium=web2x**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaGa_ReuniverSe/comments/hnrpiu/unofficial_tentative_global_banner_roadmap_aug/fxdbqz7?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=web2x) * Because banners can have rate-ups on previously released characters/styles, while also featuring limited new characters/styles, I've used the following font/text convention to differentiate: 1. Characters in **BOLD** = **New (Will head to Platinum Summon Pool at banner's conclusion)** 2. Characters in **BOLD** and *ITALICS* = ***Limited New (Can only be obtained during a future reissue)*** 3. Characters in plain type = Previously Released (Already in Platinum Summon Pool - Greater %) 4. Character with a **^(free)** superscript = Free Character (Obtained via event exchange, as a gift, or a boss raid in-game) Without further ado.  #8203; **CHRISTMAS BANNER #1: JP** (DEC 13, 2018) **GL** (JUN 30, 2020) |(***SS) X-Mas Monika***|(***SS) X-Mas Julian***|(***S) X-Mas Azami***|(***S) X-Mas Flurry******^(free)***|(***A) X-Mas Windie***| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|  #8203; **CHRISTMAS BANNER #2: JP** (DEC 21, 2018) **GL** (JUL 8/9, 2020)? |(***SS) X-Mas Albert***|(***SS) X-Mas Ginny***|(***S) X-Mas Cat***|(***S) X-Mas Sophia******^(free)***|(***A) X-Mas Tatyana***| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|  #8203; **NEW YEAR'S BANNER: JP** (JAN 1, 2019) **GL** (JUL 19, 2020)? **(Untranslated?

As always, if interest is high enough, I'll look into maybe doing another Global Banner Roadmap for the following three months of SEP-OCT-NOV as they get closer. Hopefully this is useful to give everyone an idea of how many gems to have saved and for when. **Disclaimer:** This is all contingent upon Global keeping the same pace as JP. **Resources:** Will continually update.

    <TEXT>The Valentine's Banner *could* still happen in September, I'm just giving everyone best/worst case scenario if we follow JP's pacing schedule based on our own release so far. **As for Undine/Volcano banner being datamined, but missing from my timeline:** I excluded it on purpose. It's hard to say with that one because it didn't happen in JP until April of 2019, which was about a month and a half, or five banners later from the end of my timeline above. I have two minds about this. People on this sub mentioned how it was the odd one out in the timeline being that it was translated and the ones in between weren't (since it came later in JP). Either it was a mistake being translated so early, **OR** they plan to release it toward the end of my above timeline to **compete with the hype of the Princess White Rose/V. Roc banner.** It's not uncommon for Global devs to move things around to put two highly-hyped, money-making banners close to each other by gauging the buzz being created by global foresight. I'm leaning towards the latter. **This also sandwiches it between Valentine's Day and then the White Day banner with Male Emperor and Assellus (another banner with high buzz) with two weeks on either side.** The Gakuen, or school/academy fest, that Professor/Teacher Undine debuted in wouldn't throw any of the other dates off too much considering most of our holiday banners aren't going to match up anyways. And bringing her and Volcano up five banners isn't going to upset power creep in any crazy ways. Lastly, **a late August/early September global release coincides with going back to school in many of the global audience's cultures**. *Coincidental*? I think not. Hey, at least they'll get *ONE* pseudo-holiday correct. XD **So short answer:** I think they want to move her up to compete with the end of Valentine's banner when people will have spent their resources, since Undine is also highly-anticipated. This also puts that banner before the buzzed-about White Day banner. It's a giant $$$ sandwich. But that's my pure conjecture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, thanks you! If I'm being honest, our convos yesterday about upcoming units made me spend the night and much of today researching and compiling all the info from various resources! So thank you! I think it'll help people with pull-planning and whatnot. (Maybe even deciding who to begin training for a nearby release.) And I think if the released banners somewhat much my estimations based on the inferences I've made from JP, I will definitely continue to update it with global foresight. Then it'll be up to the mods whether this is sticky-worthy or not. :D</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So much this. The sheer power in saving two turns AND two bars, at least, having to re-up empowered infusion is such a QoL feature that there #8217;s major power there in and of itself.

    <TEXT>Great read and I can follow your train of thought clearly. However, I think the A/S characters for these banners should not be overlooked. For example, the (A) X-Mas Tatyana is SUCH a HUGE boon to her later (SS) variant that if you can toss a few pulls at a 3% chance to pull her, you'll be happy you did later on. Sometimes the strength of banners aren't always so top-heavy. This is even better when it's a higher percentage and lower rarity character. This isn't to say all A/S characters are worth the consideration. Some are redundant, like our upcoming Cat and a later one. Just some soup to digest! Cheers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It looks like they'll run about 14 days with 4-5 days of overlap. If Roc and Valentine's banners are back-to-back, there will probably be some overlap. My assumption that the second Christmas event would drop today or tomorrow solidifies an idea of the banner lengths, so there's a good chance that they will overlap if they occur one after the next!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Much better to plan out your pulls and budget at least 45k gems for units you know you definitely want. If you hit your target earlier than the pity, then you roll those gems over, or you have free currency to play around with. Tossing 1-2k at every banner seems a bit haphazard. But that #8217;s my $.02 Not everyone has to be a planner to enjoy the game, haha. Good luck !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To quote u/xArceDuce from his review thread: "A Tatyana's main perk is that she grants Bonebreaker to her later SS Variant, which is a huge boon considering Bonebreaker is hard to find. A type-killer with B-Power (making it basically A-Power against skeletons) with 6BP cost. Amazing since almost every Skeleton has physical attacks. As if that wasn't good enough, she also has Brainsplitter, a 9BP INT Debuffing skill that later gets to be upgraded from A-Rank damage to S-Rank damage thanks to the Skill Scrolling system introduced in 1.5 Anniversary. If you want to use SS Tatyana later as a debuff fielder at Wagnas banner, I suggest you grab this style if you can. I want to reiterate that I think going all-in for S-A styles is not a good idea without the 9000/3000 coin pity in the banner coin shop. Still, if you do like Ginny and Albert enough to go for this banner, getting either of these will help the other styles of these characters a lot."

    <TEXT>People just like to cling to their one or two games in the franchise that definite it for them, and because the series is so experimental and constantly changes mechanics every two or three games, the rest feels very un-Resident Evil to most. And for 3make, I stand by the fact that it was mostly awful. They cut heart out of it, IMO. Had it been a random game, it would have been all right. But a remake of a franchise game I love? Not good enough. Capcom even acknowledged it was barebones by feeling the need to package it with Resistance, knowing fans would complain about a price tag for a AAA game that was way too high an asking price. And I actually like Resistance. But that doesn #8217;t admonish Capcom for the lackluster job on the main product of the bundle. As for the parrot comment, sometimes people have similar opinions. Doesn #8217;t make them parrots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Best to just run Normal for Rouge. A dupe will give you x40 pieces. .67% chance, though. Hard only drops singles. Platinum Banner has normal units added to it after their banner ends. These holiday units are seasonal, so they won't be added. The pool will be updated, but up to you. If you really want any units in there now, then now is the best time because the rates will only go lower as the pool becomes diluted with later additions.</TEXT>

So you #8217;re stuck normal attacking til then. If it were 13 BP cost, you could enhance it down to 10 at level 3 and have a powerful WIL debuff on turn 1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of games use a percentage +/- modifier. There is definitely a plus/minus modifier in play here. It may be something like in Another Eden, another popular turn-based mobile game, where the fastest character doesn #8217;t always go first due to an RNG roll: AGI Affects turn order during battle, with a +/- 10% variance. Azami #8217;s AGI is 98 Hell Dragon #8217;s is 90  #8212;Azami *should* go first. However, Azami rolls -.06 (-6%) and has 6 AGI subtracted, leaving her at 92. Hell Dragon rolls .1 (+10%) and has 9 AGI added, leaving it at 99. Hell Dragon goes first. These are theoretical values, but I #8217;m pretty sure *stat variance* is at play here #8212;a dice roll each turn modifying the base AGI stat within a certain % of variance. The larger the gap in highest speed character and slowest character, the less variance you #8217;ll see between the two. My Azami usually *always* goes first, but there are times where that doesn #8217;t play in her favor due to whatever variance is at play here with enemies who are most likely just below her in AGI. IMO, stat variance makes games a lot less stale and more dynamic. It accounts for the idea that you won #8217;t always swing your weapon with as much force, might not always react as quickly, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was banging my head against a wall until I finally just settled for STR Great Sword, STR Spear, DEX Short Sword, and DEX Bow. I figure better weapons will come out soon, and the value of my powerful weapons at S evolve 2 and max enhanced is greater. Decided to just farm 4.1.5 instead for Terry dupes and stats. Besides, grinding some of the other S weapon stages requires manual since my team sometimes dies on Auto, and I can't be bothered to run some stages 200+ times, haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Skullsplitter has been invaluable for me mitigating AoE magic damage and resisting status. And since I awakened Healing Light and don't heal every turn, she usually has plenty BP.

    <TEXT>Thanks for the math craft on this. Good to know it #8217;s about 1.7%. I figured better weapons will come along and I can use the stamina instead to farm 4.1.5 VH for Terry copies and stats instead of running other stages hundreds of times to NOT get the +stat weapon variant I want. I ended up settling on STR Great Sword and Spear and DEX Bow and Short Sword because the + versions just weren #8217;t dropping and I can #8217;t be bothered to manual those stages over and over. Your post makes me feel better about just farming raw stats and Terry pieces, which I #8217;ll use to pump up my main team styles and gain stat increases through the % modifiers across all stats instead. :) Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True. I worded that incorrectly. I just meant decreasing debuffs due to the cumulatively multiplicative nature of the next debuff incorporating the already decreased stat amount to the new decimal. I'm sure there would be a point where you hit a diminishing return and would be better of just using BP to use stronger skills to destroy the enemy. Can't kill you if it is dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds like a great plan. You #8217;ll eventually want to get your main team pretty high to where they have the tiniest sparkle left on 4.1.5 VH. That #8217;s a good stopping point to where you can start focusing on your backups. But a diverse main team can get you through all current content and should be your focus for now, just rotating in one or two wildcard slots based on enemy resistances/weakness. Once I hit 23-25k CP I was good to start slowly training backups. Also, don #8217;t neglect your expeditions for your B-team. Rouge can help trivialize a lot of content with that paralyze and it only gets better and better. Blue with the higher intelligence stat can definitely help carry as you power level your bench roster. A good thing to focus on now is raising Cat, Albert, and Sophia since they have double stat gains from the story event SP bonus. They get +2 stats when they gain a stat up. This is even better when you gain a stat up in an area they have horrible growth. You get 2 points for that rare chance. My main squad of Albert, Azami, Sophia, Blue and Rouge carries me through everything, rotating out Blue or Rouge based on resistances to their magic type and statuses for another appropriate damage dealer when necessary. I would have used Gustave over Albert if I had him! I #8217;d still train Albert though, especially during double stat up time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Albert for tank parry, Ginny for debuffs, Cat for blunt and gold gain up plus STR debuff, Alkaiser can also tank with his heal passive and do good damage. Blue now for great AoE. Farm Rouge from 1.2.12 NORMAL for great CC. Hector for sub in slash damage (can also tank a bit with healer support) Grab SS Sophia for the start missions, best current healer, can STR debuff and also INT debuff from her A form inheritance, Agatha S Leonid to cheese some bosses with poison. S Mariah for backup healer. Rotate in based on content. I'd pick a main five and focus train them, run the others through expeditions, then when your mains have baaaarely any sparkles left, start training other dudes in Tri-Stones 5-7 until you can comfortably auto 4.1.5 VH.

I did pull on tactics. Kinda bummed. Two mythril pulls and I got Gaff Sync THREE times, then Marche Glint+ and AASB. At least Marche looks awesome. But man those three dupes on a zero dupe banner SUCKS. I've been slacking on Dreambreaker dungeons. Only got to 80% on FF9. Haven't tried Tactics yet.

    <TITLE>Endgame Question / Bug?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-21 03:30:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;m following a guide closely because all of the blind playthroughs I #8217;ve done have resulted in me screwing up, getting frustrated, and summarily abandoning this game for months. It #8217;s the one SaGa game (true in name) that I #8217;ve never beaten. I beat Kzinnsie with Gerard, then tackled Rocbouquet, Wagnas, Bohkohn, and Subier in the scenarios leading to the final scenario where my Last Emperor chosen at the beginning inherits the power and takes the throne. The guide then says that I need to take down one of the two Heroes left. I chose Dantarg. Beat him in the  #8220;Lost Child/Mu Calf #8221; scenario and the game jumps forward. However, at this point, the guide says that my Chancellor is supposed to give me a key to the Sealed Tomb and then I #8217;ll be visited by Waib, the seer/oracle, who will tell me about Kzinnsie Reborn. But this doesn #8217;t happen. Noel is supposed to become the endgame boss since I left him for last. Instead, my chancellor runs up and asks for money to build the New Town where all of my recruits will appear in one place. After much wandering, I finally decided to check out the desert. I triggered the Noel fight against the swordsman. Is this a bug? I really don #8217;t understand why the next step in endgame didn #8217;t trigger. My understanding is that after killing Kzinnsie with Gerard, you #8217;re only able to kill five of the remaining six Heroes, making the last alive the final boss. I killed... everyone. Can anyone give any insight? Thanks in advance. Lastly, I am 100% positive I defeated all of the Heroes I said I did. So I really don #8217;t know why I #8217;m being allowed to fight Noel in his scenario even though I #8217;ve killed six of the others and the true endgame didn #8217;t trigger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice! Yeah, in the beginning, you #8217;ll barely, if ever, have to use stamina pots. When I started the game, I kept leveling up that I didn #8217;t dip below my stamina cap until level 40-something. XD I was always overflowing. Then during double stamina event, I saved up all these pots, but didn #8217;t need to start using them til the day before half-stamina ended. Kept leveling up. I #8217;m at level 225 right now and I level up at least once a day, it seems #8212;if not every other. So now you can save your pots for the next event!  #128079; #127996;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. This solved it. I had to kill myself to become the final emperor. Waib never came. My chancellor never mentioned a key to the Sealed Tomb. *However,* I went to the Sealed Tomb and the secret stairway down was opened and I made it all the way to the end. There were monsters, but no Kzinnsie at the end. As I said, I #8217;ve killed all Seven Heroes pre-time skip to last generation. So this *kind of* makes sense. I went and sat on the throne a few times... and my chancellor ran up, saying  #8220;they #8217;ve taken over the town #8221; and then he transformed into a termite, beginning the second part of endgame for the  #8220;Termite Queen #8217;s Revenge. #8221; SO. STRANGE. I would #8217;ve never thought to kill myself. Thank you so much for the help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During Eggshell Event, you get double gains each day, so that #8217;s minimum 800 a day using the final level. In a little over three days, you have enough for one of the S Armors. I went in to the event yesterday with 10 tickets saved and 2 more in the missions tab to claim. That #8217;s 9,600 Eggshells, which let me buy three of the four time-limited S Armors and I can buy the last today with our two tickets. Thus, it #8217;s recommended to always be hovering between 8-10 Forest tickets for these double Eggshell Events. To answer your question specifically, yes, the S Armors should be priority since they #8217;re time-limited. The SS Hydra Armor is infinite time and will always be there. Slowly save up for it after purchasing the S Armors each round. Just an FYI, there are six more days of double Eggshells. That #8217;s at least 4,800 Eggshells, or almost enough to buy two S Armors if you have a few left over!</TEXT>

RS2 still has so much life to the characters that I can totally see their personalities and create an image of them. It #8217;s heightened by the world building and the environments they can be found in, as well as their quests to unlock them. And the gameplay really adds to the narrative itself. I am in love with it. Glad it gave it another chance. I always quit because I #8217;d get frustrated for triggering something to fail a quest by doing something wrong.</TEXT>

Hoping to glimmer the last couple skills I'm missing from each weapon category as well as the special weapons, and also use the classes I couldn't the first time through (ninja, diviner, diver, pirate, etc.). Also plan to beat it legitimately, but it seems like that will be easier this time through. I already have all of the fusion magic researching from generation two, haha. Thanks for all the tips!</TEXT>

I must've tried to beat it ten times the past years and quit in frustration due to messing up/not knowing what to do/the insane difficulty of not using a guide.

    <TEXT>Nice, but I wouldn't suggest getting the SS Hydraskin Armor first. It's permanent and no content really requires this SS Armor as of now. Better to save up slowly snipe off the S Armors that expire with time. Having multiple S options will outweigh one character having an SS option. Even more easily done during the double Eggshell event. I went in with ten saved tickets and two more in missions and cleared out all of the limited armor items in 14 tickets on day two. You can save up all of your extra Eggshells and eventually get the SS Hydraskin after grabbing the others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the thing I love about SaGa most it that it is so minimalistic that you have to let your imagination do a lot of the work. The world is fleshed out by the various locations, the races, colorful costumes, and the art style. The battle system and mechanics are unlike any other. It really is a game where the mechanics of the game supplement the story. I create almost a camaraderie between all my chosen party's characters based on how I think they would act and interact with each other. u/cronoes said it perfectly: "That's the beauty of the series - because through those oddities, it somehow enhances the world and the story...even though there is so little of it - but there is. So much so, because I feel the detail is put into the backgrounds and scenarios, and the gameplay sort of heightens our imagination of what else is going on." I liked SSGA...A LOT.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve charged back with Apple when they merged the global server with an Asian server for a game and the Asian server had existed two years before the global even launched and yes, that devalued the account and Apple refunded, because the game had PvP and people didn #8217;t know this was happening prior to their purchases. However, no accounts are devalued here. We aren #8217;t promised that global is going to stick to the JP timeline. By this idea, they wouldn #8217;t be allowed to change up banner order or change the contents of banners. But they can. They #8217;re the developers and publisher. Either way, let me know how it goes. Your units will face harder content sooner, sure, but you only have that gift because of JP foresight. And you #8217;ve based your pulls and/or purchases off of that, but that was a decision you made that you weren #8217;t promised/the devs don #8217;t have to abide by, unfortunately.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a rock and a hard place for me. If the game needs to speed up to survive so the whales pull more for collection purposes on a more frequent basis, by all means... I want the game to survive. SaGa is amazing and the devs deserve a product that does well  #8212; they #8217;re already so generous. And if the overwhelming consensus is fans (from the survey, bit just a vocal minority on this sub) want content faster, kudos to devs for listening. That #8217;s so rare! But I #8217;m of a like mind with you. Probably won #8217;t be the game for me and I #8217;ll have to bow my head and tap out. Less from a currency and keeping up with the meta standpoint and more from a time-management standpoint. I won #8217;t be up in arms over any money I #8217;ve spent so far: I #8217;ve enjoyed the game til that point and supported a franchise I just absolutely love.

    <TEXT>Style bonuses do not carry over: that is to say, the percentage modifiers gained at each level, as well as the flat stat gains you see at certain intervals under  #8220;Style Level Bonus #8221; INT +2 are style specific. Only the weapon mastery levels carry over, and they affect all characters of that weapon type. What does carry over is experience you can use to instantly raise a new style to level 30 since experience is shared across all styles, and also stats gained after a battle such as HP, STR, etc. Those are across all styles of that character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. A styles are easy to level, so those are good to shoot for. Long-term, aiming for style level 42 (the last weapon mastery bonus) for each style would be ideal. Also, training A and S styles in battle and farming stats is generally regarded as more ideal since they have better stat growth when you look under their attributes. (You #8217;ll see blue arrows.) This is not true for some characters (SS Katarina) and negligible for others (SS Blue), but doesn #8217;t hurt. - Short-term: raise all styles to 30 for gems. - Long-term: raise all styles to 42 for mastery bonus. - Only raise your units to style 50 that you will use long-term and that are still highly-rated in JP. - Farm experience for future styles since experience is shared across all styles for a character. - Grind A/S styles for stats (generally) to save time and stamina since they have (generally) better growths. - Use SS in hardest battles. - Always send your expeditions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>STR / INT debuffs are your friend. A few pops of Bonecrusher, Flowing Slash, or Submission will severely hinder enemy damage. Same with Skullsplitter against magic-wielding foes. However, I usually try to burn down magic foes first since they can have devastating AoE attacks. I debuff physical attackers with the skills above and pick them off based on who hits hardest first. Parry characters at the front of Imperial Cross or center of Rising Phoenix can soak up damage and relieve your healer. Same goes with tanks like Gustave or Hector who have self-healing passives. Alkaiser can work the same way. Take note of enemy attack types and try to bolster your resistances with appropriate armor and gear. If all else fails, grind the hardest level of Daily Tri-Stones you can for stat ups. Raising your CP is an effective way of tackling tougher content. Stages 4-7 of Tri-Stones is easier than story levels with the same stat caps, and you farm evolution materials for equipment. Do this until you can comfortably reach VH 4.1.5, then that becomes the best place to farm stats. Luckily, Tri-Stones is open every day! Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RANT: Some of Unlimited Saga #8217;s Mechanics are Fucking Garbage</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 07:26:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m recently going back and beating all the SaGas I never completed. Played through RS2 three times and loved it. I #8217;ve previously beaten FF Legends I - III, SF 1 and 2, SSG:A, and Minstrel Song and RS3. Unlimited SaGa is what #8217;s left for me of the main game, non-mobile titles. I tried it years ago and just couldn #8217;t get into it. I ended up trying again a few years later and made it to the end of Laura #8217;s quest. Even with multiple saves, it seems I soft-locked myself against the end boss. The mechanics are so fucking obtuse. But I can get past the reels (DND dice rolls), the boards and wonky magic system, and even the board game style. Sparking is weird and makes no sense. The game isn #8217;t really intuitive and not until half-way through this Ventus playthrough did I learn how to open a treasure chest. I went in blind to really see what this game is about. And I slowly got the hang of it and even started to enjoy it. But some of the mechanics are so fucking annoying. Enemies that constantly bombard you on a single tile. Millions of traps. I just fucking lost hours of play due to being in the Dragon #8217;s Haven on the Arbiter #8217;s Eye board. If you stay in a tile two turns in a row, the eye underneath opens and you have to fight a high-level, extremely difficult dragon. Now, if enemies attack you, that counts as a turn and the eye opens, attacking you with a dragon. I #8217;ve been engaged by random enemies three times in a row, locking me into this tile and being attacked by these mini-boss dragons. I #8217;ve had it. Sometimes these enemies attack twice in a turn. Sometimes five times continuously, for no rhyme or reason. I tried, Unlimited Saga , I really did. I can see why people would love you for all your quirks. I can see why people vehemently hate and abhor you. Like I said... I tried. But you #8217;re too fucking clunky. Being locked to the same tile and attacked continuously, unable to move or progress, only to be killed after hours of play is where I call it quits. Good grief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My switch control froze while I was sleeping, so no idea how many runs I lost, but I woke up my stamina full. Probably from a level up in player rank that I dipped under then filled back up with time. Not going to sweat it. Currently at 3 Rouge drops, 310 maps, and 4 golds. It #8217;s easier to manage when I #8217;m awake because I can check back in. While I #8217;m asleep it #8217;s the Wild West. I had 140 stamina potions, and I #8217;m only down to 80.

    <TEXT>Exactly. And I #8217;ve appreciated every major change in a SaGa ever, honestly. I feel like the lowercase  #8220;g #8221; in Unlimited Saga is because it really is the black sheep of SaGa. It #8217;s such a departure with little to no explanation that you can #8217;t really intuit your way through the game without it being a massive hindrance to enjoyment and a frustrating undertaking. If it had the levels of explanation SaGa Scarlet Grace has, it #8217;d be a non-issue. I enjoy the characters, though. So that #8217;s a redeemer. Going to try to muscle through this playthrough to say I did it. It #8217;ll justify the $15 I spent some 15-ish years ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just curious to see what everyone's take is on this. I'm using my maps as I go since it only took me about 2-3 minutes to run all of my 7 Gold Maps and 250 Normal Spree and I got a bunch of **character gold drops** and stamina potions. Also, seeing the rewards every so often incentivizes me to grind harder, and I'd rather upkeep positive gem economy since I get a lot of stamina potions back. I can see a case made for boosting Azami to style level 50. Maybe Rouge as well? Anyone planning to take any of the others to 50, or are you just selling shards past 42?</TEXT>

I wasn't even trying to fool myself thinking we can hit 50 off of map drops, but wondering who people were considering to save and who to flat out sell if they're already at 42. For example, I have Albert at 42 but probably won't raise him higher since stats are irrelevant when using Parry. But my Azami is currently 44. So trying to get a feel of what people are doing with the 5-off random pieces if you already have said toon at 42. And forgot about Cat. Raising her, too, past 42. Thanks for your input.</TEXT>
