    <TEXT>So I'm looking for some quality shoes, that won't kill my wallet. So far I've gotten some great suggestions from this subreddit, however I want to know what are your opinions on Zara shoes? Has anyone here gotten a pair of shoes from there? My little brother got me a pair last Christmas, and they're still holding up pretty well. Anyone else have any experience with these shoes. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question On Shoes?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-28 21:08:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've read the shoe guide V2.0 and it's super helpful (I'm still new, forgive my ignorance) and I just have a few questions about full grain leather. Like many guys who don't know much about shoes I've spent far more than I should have. I did the math and I've spent almost 1k in two years on brands like Aldo. So now I'm looking to buy some higher quality shoes that are goodyear welted, and are made of full grain leather. I stumbled on this article: http://dealnews.com/features/How-to-Find-Mens-Dress-Shoes-That-Will-Last-for-Decades/1128295.html And I like how Florsheim shoes look, they're not too expensive, and they're goodyear welted. However I can't find anything saying if they're made of full grain leather or not. Does anyone know if florsheim is made of full grain leather, and a list of another brands that are goodyear welted and are made of full grain leather. Also I'm looking for dress shoes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking back on when I was single I had a lot of first dates (single guy in NYC has a lot of options between girls at bars, online dating, and tinder. More options than most guys would think, you just gotta put yourself out there.) After I got enough experience I started having sex on those first dates more and more often. With girls from online it was more often than not. And i learned something very interesting in my experience. First off expensive dates are bad. Between NYC rent, and just how expensive things are in general, I couldn't afford to pay for the first date every single time. Especially if I was going on 1-2 dates a week. But that's just the tip of the ice berg. Most expensive dates make it harder to talk to a woman, and even more importantly touch a woman. Like movies, concerts, nice dinners, etc. Plus what if you don't like this chick? You've just dropped a lot of money on a girl you don't like. Waste of time. How about cheaper dates? Let's say I spent $20 on drinks for the two of us for Happy Hour, not bad right? What's even better is that you have a more social environment. You can talk more clearly, and as loud as you have to at a bar. And bars have things to do besides drink. Plus, if you don't like that bar, that's cool. Get up and go to another one. Now it's like you've been on two dates, rather than one. But I guess that still raises the question. Should you pay, should she pay, or should you split it? Even though it's a lot cheaper I still say split it if you can. Sometimes the girl will be broke, and that's fine. You don't need to split it, and it's a cheap date so it won't be a big deal. This is why I always make sure to have enough money. Now why split it if that's an option? (This is anecdotal evidence, and based on my perspective alone, so take this with a grain of salt). If she's old fashioned then she'll believe you have to pay. And if you pay you're only reinforcing her old fashioned beliefs. What else is an old fashioned belief? No sex on the first date. Or at least waiting for sex. So if she's more progressive she'll pay her half, AND she'll be okay with banging on the first date, more often than not. But what if she IS old fashioned, and you ask her to split the bill? For one you won't know if she's willing to do so if you ask, so always take that step to ask, it's 2015, don't be scared to do it. And even if she is old fashioned she might like you, and do it anyways, because she wants to follow your lead on being progressive. And if she says yes to following your lead on one progressive idea she's more likely to follow your lead on other progressive ideas...aka sex. TLDR: Always try to split the bill, and stick to cheap dates the first time you go out, but play it by ear. Sometimes girls just can't afford it, and that's fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. You don't have to be worth a few billion to be a venture capitalist, nor are most venture capitalists billionaires like theorymeltfool says. Most of the people on shark tank aren't billionaires. 2. They're not his friend's companies. When he bought a portion of the company I worked for, he wasn't friends with the owner. I have no idea where theorymeltfool got that from, nor do I know why that assumption was made in the first place 3. According to google, the definition of a venture capitalist is "A venture capitalist is an investor who either provides capital to startup ventures or supports small companies that wish to expand but do not have access to equities markets." This is what Tai Lopez does, I don't know how successful he is in it, but he does indeed provide capital to startup ventures or support small companies with capital he gives them, trying to get them to expand.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think all the unresolved stuff is why I like the book so much. It leaves a lot of factors up in the air, for the reader to interpret. The only other book I've read from Murakami is 1Q87, which has a lot of fantasy like aspects to it. So for me these unresolved issues pulled my mind in all sorts directions. Is there really some sort of mystical element in the book? Could his college friend see his color and think he was colorless and was interested for that reason, or was his friend drawn to him because he had some radiant color (like Eri hints at)? And if his friend could see people's colors why didn't he tell Tsukuru, like the old guy told his dad? Or was that story his way of telling him? But what if all that stuff is bullshit What if his friends abandoning him (high school friends and his college friend) was all coincidence? What if that story was just a story from his dad told by some weird crazy dude, that's nothing more than a weird story? What if the story is just a lesson in perseverance, and it's teaching us not to let life slip us by? All these questions force my brain to imagine all these possibilities, and that's why I like the book.</TEXT>

And my friend blurted out something like "Yea but you're fat, and you can't even beat me in a race" Which was true, our teacher couldn't beat a couple of kids in a race, and she was in her 30's, maybe her late 20's. If you can't beat a couple of 9 and 10 year olds in a race...then you should probably do something about your health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just read the article they say 'dozens' of muslims celebrated, and Trump said 'thousands'. That's a huge stretch. And dude "media" is simply a means of mass consumption. Media outlets include newspapers, tv stations, internet etc. Reddit is actually a media outlet. No matter who you're going for there will be media outlets run by people with opposing views and they will skew the truth in order to make their beliefs looks like the truth. The New York Post lies about Bernie and Trump to make Hilary look better, so do dozens of other news outlets who want her to win. Reddit will leave out details in order to make Hilary look bad because there are more Trump and Bernie supporters on reddit. In college when the Obama election was going on one of my very liberal professors actually liked McCain and said he would have voted for McCain if Palin weren't his vice president. And the class was shocked. When asked why he said something very smart, which I still follow today. He told us when doing research you're always going to have a bias leaning toward one side, and your brain will automatically search for evidence that you're right. Figure out what your side is and what the opposing side is, and there will always be people a lot smarter and/or more knowledgeable than you speaking on this issue. Listen to both of them with an open mind, and you'll see a clearer picture. This is why, even though I'm a liberal, I'll vote for Trump over Hilary</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was on a date once, and we're in a park, sitting on the grass, and a very manly looking lesbian comes up to my date and tells her how beautiful she is how good she's going to eat her pussy, etc. It was very very cringey. I told her to leave, and she did, but not before saying another annoying comment. Now, this is the first and only time I've ever dealt with a lesbian hitting on a date of mine (the girl is now my girlfriend). But my girlfriend has told me on multiple occasions that lesbians are a lot worse than guys in general. In her experience they're super persistent, awkward, and aggressive, and they aren't smooth or charming. She's told me every time a lesbian has hit on her it's been very straight forward, demeaning, and gross. Obviously this isn't the case for every single lesbian out there, but I've heard this from several girls. One of my friend Lina was at a bar, and got super wasted, and a lesbian came up grabbed her face and started kissing her. A minute later she went to the bathroom to puke and when she looks up, it was the same lesbian holding her hair up. After she was done puking the same girl tried to buy her a drink and kiss her again. Obviously this in anecdotal evidence, but I've heard similar experiences about lesbians being extremely objectifying, overly sexual, and rude, from several women. I guess my point is, why is it such a bad thing for men to do it, when it's obvious that everyone does it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, everyone, this is my collection so far. I started in April of this year and slowly growing it as much as I can. Here are my books from left to right: 1. Animal Man by Grant Morrison: Not gonna lie, I wasn't a huge fan, thought the book was alright, with a few good issues sprinkled in between. I was bored with a lot of the stories, and although the whole breaking the fourth wall thing was kind of cool, I wasn't a huge fan of the animal man character himself. 2. The Killing Joke by Alan Moore: Another controversial opinion, this was the first book in my collection, and I feel like it was over-hyped. Maybe when the book was written it was crazy for Joker to do what he did, but it was a bit lackluster for my taste. I've also heard similar stories before, and I just wasn't wowed like I was told I'd be with this story. 3. Batman by Scott Snyder : Fucking loved these books, the stories kept me on my toes and the way he portrayed some of his villains were absolutely ruthless. For example, the way he did the Riddlers story in Zero Year made him seem like a legitimate psychopath. There was also the court of the owls, two amazing joker stories, and more. Loved loved loved this batman run. 4. Big Hard Sex Criminals by Matt Fraction: I had high hopes for this series, but so far I'm a little torn. I don't find the female lead very interesting, the male lead is a loser/fuck up. However the woman they team up with toward the end of the first book makes me hopeful that she's an obi wan like mentor and these two main characters who are pretty lame will develop into more entertaining and less lame characters. I'm going to get the next deluxe edition when it comes out, because I really like the premise of this story, and I'm hopeful it'll get better. 5. Civil War by Mark Miller: Everyone knows this story, it's a good story, not much to say 6. Deadpool Minibus by Cullen Bunn: It was pretty good overall, I liked the first and last story. The first one was Deadpool against the Marvel Universe, thought it was funny, and had some great action. I felt like the second story 'Killustrated' fell short, although it's an awesome premise, I felt it was a little boring, and just kind of fell flat. The last one 'Deadpool kills Deadpool' is what I was hoping for when I bought this, and that last arc makes the entire buy worth it in my opinion. 7. House of M by Brian Michael Bendis: Wow...just wow. A friend recommended this to me, I went in blind, and this story was fucking dope! I haven't read many Marvel story arcs (just this and civil war) but if the rest are as good as this I'm looking forward to going broke buying a lot more. 8. Justice League by Geoff Johns volumes 1-8: I really liked these, I really love how they Johns changed Lex into a good guy, however...I think I'll stop buying these volumes, and just start buying the trades of the actual story arcs. Each arc has too many different series-connected with one another, so when you only have one series you don't get the full picture, which frustrated me a lot. Same with Batman, except I though batman by Scott Snyder was better written. 9 Saga by Brian K. Vaughn: Hands down my favorite series in the collection. Full of drama, great story, and heartbreak. Can't wait to find out what happens next. I mean...there's no way you can fuck up an epic space drama right? 10. Spiderman Kraven's Last Hunt by J.M DeMatteis: This book was spoiled for me, I knew what was going to happen in the end. Again, since I knew what was going to happen I didn't like the story too much because I felt like the whole story was a build up to what happens at the end. 11. Rai by Matt Kindt - I actually got this one on a whim, I saw a guy who worked at the comic book store reading it, I chatted him up and he told me he really liked it, so I bought a copy. It takes place in the future in a totalitarian Japan in space. The sci-fi and the darkness of the whole thing was a very different feel from everything else I read, and I absolutely fell in love with this. 12. Wayward by Jim Zub: Just finished this today actually. I really like it so far. Clearly, this first book is just setting the stage, if you want to get into this series I suggest you wait til the second book comes out (if you like collecting the deluxe editions like me). If you don't care if it's a deluxe edition or not, I suggest you just buying the issues that follow after reading the first few chapters, this series has a lot of promise so far. And I really love the characters in this book. 13. Wolverine Omnibus by Mark Miller: This omnibus has two wolverine related story arcs. Old Man Logan and Enemy of the State. I never heard of Enemy of the State, and it actually turned out to be AMAZING. Wolverine gets brainwashed by the hand, and Hydra, and goes on to kick some serious superhero ass. Old Man Logan, of course, is a classic. I never read that arc until I got this book, and holy shit. If you've never read it, you really have to. Mark Millar is clearly a storytelling genius, and I can't wait to read more of his work. 14. Yello, Blue, Gray by Jeph Loeb. This book contains Spiderman Blue, Daredevil Yellow, and Hulk Gray. Right off the bat, I thought this book was going to suck. I personally did NOT like Daredevil yellow. It lacked action, and although I'm totally fine with a love story in comics, it's not the only thing I want to see. Yes, I got to peek into daredevil a little deeper, but it honestly bored me. Although Daredevil Yellow fell flat, Spiderman Blue was so fucking good I actually cried a little while reading it. The action was amazing, I got a closer glimpse into Peter Parker's mind, which made me love the character even more than I already did, and the emotional rollercoaster makes this a book I won't forget. Whereas I don't even remember what Daredevil Yellow was about. Hulk Gray was also pretty damn good. Not as good as Spiderman Blue, but it took my emotions on a spin, and it made me like the Hulk as a character a lot more. It also helped me understand him more since I'm a fairly new reader.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My girlfriend thinks lesbians are the worst when it comes sexual harassment. She had a co-worker who kept hitting on her, at first she ignored it. But then one day the co-worker grabbed her ass, and they got into a yelling match. But the manager only gave the lesbian a strike (if it were a dude he would have been fired on the spot). The girl later apologized, and they swept it under the rug, although my gf was still wary of her. Later on the staff went out for drinks, the girl got drunk and hit on her again, and this bitch told my girlfriend that she could please her far better than I could. I happened to be in the bathroom when this happened, I come out and my girlfriend is arguing with her. The second I step out this lesbian is talking shit about me for some reason. It was a fucking shit show. The girl ended up quitting because a bunch of girls threatened to report her for sexual harassment that night.</TEXT>

While it's dumb to get annoyed at someone helping you out, you gotta admit...there's a lot of white guilt floating around, that has some white people blindly liking and agreeing to everything POC's do and say.</TEXT>

So just make sure to air it out, and lotion it a lot. Make sure it's scent free regular lotion, and try not to let it get this dry again.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Green Lantern Question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-19 22:52:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got the three large green lantern omnibuses (currently have the first two, and I ordered the third one). These books REALLY sucked me in. I'm looking on Amazon and it looks like there's gonna be large deluxe edition versions of Rebirth series. But I don't see that for new 52 Green lantern stories. I don't really want to buy 10 different hardcover trades. I also see there's red lantern books and Sinestro books, which I'm interested in getting too. But again, I don't want to buy a bunch of smaller trades, I'd rather have a larger omnibus or a few deluxe edition books. Does anyone know if larger omnibus or deluxe edition books exist for the new 52 Green lantern stories?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Green Lantern Questions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-21 03:58:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was recently recommended the Geoff Johns Green Lantern run. [This one.](https://www.amazon.com/Green-Lantern-Geoff-Johns-Omnibus/dp/140125134X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 amp;qid=1490067887 amp;sr=8-1 amp;keywords=geoff+johns+green+lantern+omnibus) I absolutely loved it, and I couldn't put it down. I ended buying the [second one](https://www.amazon.com/Green-Lantern-Geoff-Johns-Omnibus/dp/1401255264/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8 amp;pd_rd_i=1401255264 amp;pd_rd_r=RPXD4AC5XCJETDF2Q47H amp;pd_rd_w=Z4qNe amp;pd_rd_wg=YNfPn amp;psc=1 amp;refRID=RPXD4AC5XCJETDF2Q47H). Love it so far as well. However, I'm pretty new to reading comics, and these both are pre-new 52. I hear most stories histories were re-written in the new 52, but there were some exceptions, Green Lantern being one of them (not sure if this is true or not). So my question is this, does this Geoff Johns series lead into the New 52? Does the third omnibus take place during the new 52? Is there an omnibus or deluxe edition for the new 52 Green Lantern stories? What about the spin off books like the Sinestro series, and the Red Lanterns? Do I have to buy those in trade paperbacks, or is there a hardcover book out there with those stories in there? Any help would really be appreciated, because I'm really loving the Green Lantern character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, awesome. Thanks a lot man. That helps a lot. So I'm guessing after I read the third omnibus, I get the spinoffs (I believe it's Green Lantern corps, larfreeze, red lanterns, and sinestro. If there are others I'm missing that you know of, please let me know). But then what? Does the third Omnibus have the whole new 52 run, and I just go into DC Rebirth after I'm done with the third omnibus? Or are there other issues I gotta pickup before going into Rebirth?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think you understand how much it takes to start a business. And how much work is required of an owner, vs an employee. Not only that but the owner is taking on all the risk. Risking his money, his time, and taking on any liabilities that can occur.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First question about time and health: They're not risking their time because they're getting paid. They're selling their time, and effort. It's not a risk to work for someone, it's an exchange of service for gooda. And if they get injured on the job then it's the employer who takes on the medical expenses, not the employee. So the risk to your health isn't that big when someone else pays for it in my opinion. Second question about morals: I think it depends on the job. I agree that there are jobs that cross a moral boundary. I worked under a lazy entrepreneur for very little money, while doing most of the work that kept the company (albeit a small company) profitable. But once I gained proper experience, I found a new job that pays me more than what that guy makes owning his own business. So in my case the short term suffering paid off big time for me. It's not the case with everyone, and I think this has to be examined on a case by case basis, and not as one big brush stroke. Third question about Dunkin donuts: Fast food places are a perfect example of what I mean. Some people see McDonalds and other fast food places and they just see employees working. I used to see that too. But there is so much risk and upfront cost involved in opening a Dunkin donuts or any franchise restaurant. I don't know if Dunkin donuts is a franchise, but let's assume it is. An owner HAS to have good credit, he has to take out a loan, he has to pay employees, and he has to pay monthly franchise fees. Most fast food places take on a mountain of debt, and have to live off credit and loans for yeara before they see any profit, or break even for that matter. It's an intense grind that most people don't understand because they're not business owners. Not to mention that the owner of a fast food place should be there most of the time, at least when the restaurant is new, or else the chances of the business failing goes through the roof. If the business tanks then they go down with it, and they still have to pay everything back, or file for bankruptcy. Personally I don't think taking on that immense of a risk, that could potentially ruin my life is the same kind of risk to your health as making coffee and selling donughts. So personally I think yes, often times when the owner has to take on that kind of risk he should reap the rewards. It's like if you get a loan to buy a boat, pay for hours of scuba diving lessons, dive in cold Pacific waters every day for two years in order find treasure, while paying a guy to drive your boat to these diving spots, and then when you find the treasure after doing all the research and leg work to make it happen, you have to split your portions of the profit with the boat driver, even though you're already paying him. That doesn't make sense to me. As for that last sentence I'm not sure what you're talking about, you'll have to clarify that for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does not you're right. But it does require A LOT of money, and good credit which requires a lot more work than a lot of people are willing to put in. Aside from that I believe any successful entrepreneur will tell you that an absent business owner is doomed to fail. I used to work in a business where one owner lived in another city and we saw him once or twice while we worked there. The other travelled for months at a time, and we saw him maybe 1 or 2 months out of the year. The business crashed hard, because the employees weren't really required to work hard, while getting paid. Aside from that there's nothing stopping a manager from building credit, saving money, getting a loan and starting his own business. It's just a lot more work than many people are willing to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay...I don't want to sound like a dick...but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that you have no idea what capitalism is... Capitalism is an economic system based on the trades of goods and services by the free market (the people) instead of the government. In communism and socialism you're giving the power to distribute goods to the government, and there is nothing to stop the people in power from saying "Fuck you people, I'm not distributing shit equally, even though I said I would." Which has happened time and time again. It happened with the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, China, North Korea, Cuba, and it's happening right now with Brazil and Venezuela. And this is coming from me, a guy who voted for Bernie Sanders, and thought socialism was the way to go when I was 18 years old. The reason why I used to think Socialism was the tits was because I didn't know what capitalism meant. I thought "Oh look America sucks, America is a capitalist country, it must be because of capitalism." Well there was a flaw to my logic back then, because I didn't realize so many things that sucked weren't controlled by the private sector. You can directly link skyrocketing student loans, and the economic collapse of 2008 directly with government involvement. Once the government gets involved in a market then it loses the thing that makes it capitalistic. So let's jump into this chart shall we? Because it's extremely misleading, and cherry picks information, that frankly aren't even related to capitalism. And one can't even argue against that dumbass chart because of the rules on r/laststagecapitalism. First off 8mil die from drinking dirty water. Now you have to go deeper than. What in the dirty water is killing them? Who's making the water dirty? Is it naturally deadly to drink? There is absolutely no data beyond that number. Whoever made that chart literally slapped a number on a chart, and blamed it on capitalism without any evidence as to why capitalism is responsible for those deaths. 7.665mil people die of hunger. Same as the above statement. Why is capitalism to blame for people dying of hunger? None of this is explained. 3mil die from cureable diseases. Well in the United States the healthcare system is fucked...but again you can blame it on government involvement. The free market dictates how much things cost. If something is too expensive then no one buys it, and that will drive the price down. In America you're forced to buy health insurance, even if you don't want it. Back in the day, in the 50's and 60's you walk into a hospital and they have prices for different services. That doesn't exist anymore because hospitals charge the insurance companies, not the people, so they charge the insurance companies these ABSURD prices, which means people who don't have insurance die from something that would have costs as much as your lunch to fix. Direct goverment involvement grossly inflated the price of medicine and medical care. Here's a more in depth explanation from Peter Schiff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSE_dNKVrGs Last is the 500,000 deaths a year from Malaria....ummm wut? The private sector has done so much more to cure Malaria in the past 10 - 15 years than the government has ever done. To say that capitalism is the cause of 500,000 deaths due to malaria is simply an outright lie. I don't even know why one would put up such an easily debunkable statistic, it's ridiculous. Now lets get into this paragraph you wrote. People like me are the cause of your family suffering? Internet marketing Ecuadorians cause your people to suffer? That makes no sense. Then there's this whole thing: "They lack for medical care, education, even the most basic opportunity. They are the constant victims of attack from militarized police, chances are high that on any given day they will be abducted by the state and placed into a forced labor camp run by Capitalists." What the fuck are you even talking about? Education and healthcare is free to poor Americans. This is the last comment I'm posting on here, because everyone I've talked to on this thread so far is very misinformed. Then there are people like you making wild baseless accusations, without even knowing what capitalism is. It's honestly a huge waste of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely agree. I was on the baseball team, and every day the gym and the weight room were full of jocks and fit kids. And some of these kids were ASSHOLES. We even got into fist fights every now and them, in the fucking gym, because of bullies either pulling pranks (which was super dangerous) or just being straight up douchebags to people trying to work out. So I don't blame these kids for feeling that way, but I have never ever ever experienced this in an adult gym. As a matter of fact I feel like people in adult gyms are usually supportive and friendly.</TEXT>

I literally just ask her what she's majoring in, her name, real small talk kind of stuff and this weirdo blurts out "I'm a virgin and I plan on keeping it that way til I'm married". It was so awkward, especially since that was the furthest thing from my mind. I'm not into beastiality.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-12-26 16:49:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been living in an apartment building in Brooklyn, and there has never been sufficient heat here. If anything the heat comes on randomly, it's very low, and it's not anywhere nearly enough to heat my apartment. Some days when it's really cold (like today it's 26 degrees) it's particularly unbearable. I essentially hole myself up in my room with the door shut, with two space heaters, and some blankets. I've called the super many times, texted him many times, and he hasn't been able to fix the problem. I've called the managing agency, and rather than letting me talk to someone that can help I keep getting redirected to people who don't pick up their phones. It's gotten beyond ridiculous and illegal. Does anyone know anything I can do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[ADVICE] Update on my no heat issue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-05 21:30:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So...I finally got heat, thanks to the advice I got on here. After around 2 months of no heat December hits, and it became too unbearable. The super was useless, he couldn't even tell me what the issue was. The managing agency who I rented my apartment from rarely answered their phones (called them dozens of times, I would estimate I called them around 80 times) and they only picked up once. Bunch of useless cunts if you ask me. So I started complaining to 311, and I did so often. They got a bunch of violations, and still no heat. A few weeks of more complaining, and after 3 months I FINALLY get heat! That was a week ago. This morning I woke up and there was no heat or hot water, no signs in my building telling me there was an issue, nothing... The heat did come back several hours later, but when I tried calling the managing agency they didn't answer my call again. Left a message, but I've left many messages, and have never heard back from anyone. I've had enough, I want to move out, so I called an attorney and asked what could be done in order to get out of my lease. He told me to sue them, take them to small claims court for breach of contract. Get a partial refund for the months with no heat, get my security deposit back, and leave. He told me the 311 call records, and combination of texting evidence with the super is more than enough to prove a breach of contract. I got super excited, because this is amazing news. I was starting to think I was fucked until my lease was up, so I said thank you and hung up... However in my excitement I forgot to ask him what to do. I've never sued anyone, don't know how to go to small claims court or anything like that. Do you guys know what my next steps should be?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree, a quick Google search tells me that 2/3rds of American women are overweight or obese. (40% of all American women are obese) So only about 33% of women aren't overweight, thus making the average American woman fat. She's not fat, therefore that alone makes her above average in my opinion (different people have different tastes, and might find bigger women attractive, different strokes for different folks).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good job! And yeah it's ridiculous, my friend (a woman) does Muay Thai, and one of her childhood friends used to make similar claims about strength and how she was healthy and stronger than most men and blah blah blah. Recently this overweight women decided to stop lying to herself, and ended up taking a free beginner Muay Thai class. Her first step to weight loss. She couldn't finish it. It was too difficult. The class consists of doing some drills, practicing a basic leg kicks, and then holding pads and practicing the move they just learned. She couldn't finish the drills they were way too hard. And when it came time to hold pads, she learned for the first time that she wasn't anywhere nearly as strong as she thought she was. She didn't hit as hard as she thought, and people who were much lighter, who were still beginners in the sport, we're striking much harder, for much longer periods of time.</TEXT>

He tried being a life coach, but no matter how much he put into advertising he couldn't get enough clients to sustain an decent income. So he ended up taking his site down, stopped advertising, and switched to real estate coaching, and actually is making a fuck ton of money helping people learn basic real estate stuff through Skype calls and seminars.

    <TEXT>I had cancer when I was three years old. The care from those kind doctors and nurses are some of my first memories ever. My mother used to be super religious (father wasn't and neither was I even as a kid) and I remember even at a really young age I'd get mad and argue with my mom about religion, because whenever I told her I didn't believe in God (more accurately the Bible) she'd get really upset and say shit like "how can you not believe in God, after all he's done for you? You wouldn't be here today if it weren't for God!" So even at like 10 I'd snap back and say shit like "Yeah it was totally god who cured me, definitely not the doctors who have a combined 80 years worth of experience." Not to mention that by her logic god would be the one who gave me cancer in the first place.</TEXT>

And eat whatever you want, I'm not judging, in my opinions, I'd rather spend 10 bucks on a philly cheese steak, soda, chips, and a banana, than be in Katz old ass restaurant, full of loud ass drunk tourists. And I guess it depends on the person. I'm in New Orleans now, but I went to visit two weeks ago and I stayed on 3rd and C with my boy. We went out to Ludlow, met some girls, and we just got a bunch of steak sandwiches at the deli on 4th and a, and ate it in his crib, which is way more comfortable than being in that dingy ass restaurant. But again, it's just a personal preference. Katz is great, everyone agrees, it's just not my cup of tea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I worked for an ad agency, and I was doing an online campaign for a mid sized online business. I've been doing this for a while, I have a lot of experience, and I usually have a really good idea of what will work and what won't work. This particular client gave A LOT of ideas, constantly emailed me, gave a lot of criticism, and I constantly had to explain why her ideas probably wouldn't convert well. Eventually after working on the campaign for a few weeks, I was done, sent everything over, with a detailed explanation of every decision I made, and why I went the route I went, and didn't use her ideas. I even provided links to case studies so she can see why I made the decision I made, and she seemed very happy about what I sent her over. Fast forward a few weeks later and my team gets a very disappointed email from this woman, and I end up on a call with her, with my boss. We look through the campaign, and almost nothing I did was being used...yet she wouldn't stop putting the blame on me, my team, and the agency. She was very emotional the whole time. Told us she can't believe she spent that sort of money on us etc etc And you know...this has happened before, but never to such an extent. The woman seemed to be on the verge of tears. I calmly tried to explain why her ideas didn't work, and in the middle of my explanation my boss says "Enough with the excuses." Just completely makes me look like an unprofessional little cry baby, who was making excuses for bad work. When in fact my work wasn't even really being used. It was embarrassing, and all I could think about in that moment was punching his fat face. He tells the woman we won't make the same mistakes again, we'll fix everything, and ends the call. Right when the call was done he continues scolding me, and he's done this before...where he'd put the blame on his team for something the clients did. But this time I don't know if he was more stressed than usual, or what but he really laid into me. I already didn't like this boss in particular, and the more he spoke the more I wanted to beat the shit out of him. And eventually I just couldn't take it anymore. I said something along the lines of "Dude...show some fucking proffesionalism, were you even on the same call? Did you not see the campaign she showed us? You've been checking my work all month, and that's not what I submitted. Do you want to fuck her or something? Because I have no fucking clue where your head at is right now." We started yelling at each other, and I ended up quitting mid argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what study they're talking about, it was a study done in 2006 by a sexologiat Dr. Meredith Chivers. In that study women were also turned on by a video of Bonobos fucking. This doesn't mean any of those women are interested in fucking animals. And there were many women in that study that identified as straight because they never had any sexual interest in women, nor do they plan on or intend to sleep with women in the future. Just as there were lesbians in that study who have no interest in a romantic relationship with a man. The study simply shows that women are physically aroused by a wider spectrum of things than men (both gay and straight) and the study also goes to explain that mental stimulation and physical stimulation both have to work simultaneously for women to be completely aroused.</TEXT>

Women we're physically aroused by all of them, where as men got aroused by anything with a woman, and gay men got aroused by anything with a man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't understand why some people believe fat is the default state of human nature. My dad is from Ecuador, and he was raised in a small farming village that didn't have indoor plumbing or electricty when I visited as a child, and certainly not when he grew up there (last I can remember they got all that stuff around the 2000's, name of the town is called Olmedo). Anyways, not a single fat person in this village. They eat what they grow and farm, or what they hunt, and live in these small stilt houses. It's the closest to humans in a natural habitat that I've ever seen...not a single fat person in the entire village. Not one. Maybe a chubby kid here or there, but no fat people and nothing that could even be mistaken for obese. And it's the same for all sorts of small rural villages, all around the world, that have more natural food supplies. And this isn't even counting the more isolated tribes of people in the Amazon and Africa, who are almost untouched by the modern world. Again....NONE of them are even close to fat. So why do these people see being fat as the natural state if man, when people who are living naturally would never even be considered anything close to fat?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been dating a woman for a few months now, and she loves sending me pictures. She sends me pictures every single day, multiple times a day, pretty much all day haha. Whether it's of her at the park with her kids, her dressed up to go somewhere, what she's eating at a restaurant, but mostly dirty pictures when she's horny. I think it's great, I love them, gives me a nice glimpse into her day, and I think she's hot so I obviously always appreciate them. I'm not much of a picture taker, even when I'm out and dressed up I don't really take pictures, and she's been dropping some hints that she wants me to send more. Yesterday she asks what I'm doing as I was in the gym bathroom getting ready to leave, so I just snapped a sweaty shirtless post gym pic, and she LOVED it. Today i sent another one wearing these tuxedo boxer briefs, while I had an erection, and she loved that one even more.  #8203; But aside from like one or two other ideas...I'm kind of out of ideas haha  #8203;</TEXT>

Think about it, a woman who has desires to be trashy, and advertises it with her appearance WILL get treated differently. So why would she?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live with 4 people, and we often go out to eat together. As a matter of fact sometimes we exclude the girls (1 of the roommates is a girl, and a few of us have girlfriends) and go on man dates. Where we pick fancy restaurants, drink, and eat delicious foods (the girls do the same without us). But...despite going to new places to eat being a big part of the house culture, sometimes some people don't wanna go out. Sometimes only one person wants to go. Sometimes that person is me, other times it's a different roommate. So what do we do if no one except one person wants to go? He or she goes anyways. Takes pictures, tries something interesting, enjoys their time, and their solitude. Maybe they bring a book, and their headphone, maybe they spend the whole time hitting or making friends with the servers. Then they come back, share their experience, and if it's a good one we usually go back together as a group. No loneliness. No feelings of being left out. Just a different kind of experience. Sometimes those experiences are great, sometimes they're just okay, but they're never sad, lonely, or pathetic. And that's because it's a lot sadder to feel some sense of superiority towards a stranger you know nothing about, than enjoying a nice meal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes actually, and when I reflected on why I got into the relationship in the first place, it didn't come down to me being manipulated, and while I felt like the victim at first I realized I wasn't a victim. I was afraid of being alone, and I was needy, and actively chose to stick around out of irrational fears that I had. I could have left whenever I wanted. After that I worked on myself, worked on my insecurities and neediness. I learned that it was okay not to be in a relationship, to be alone, and it was okay to walk away from toxic people, and not settle, just because I didn't want to be alone.</TEXT>

Instead I made the decision to stick around because I was afraid of being alone. And I never said it was anyone's fault for being abused. I said it was a reflection on her, because it was her choice, just like my decision to sticking around in my past toxic relationship was a reflection of how needy I was and how much confidence I lacked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean...this whole subreddit is about judging people hahaha And I never blamed her for anything, so I'm not sure what you think I'm blaming her. Anyways, I've been there. I was in a toxic relationship in the past, and after reflecting on it a lot...I realized I could have left. I saw the red flags before we committed to each other. But I was needy and insecure and I was afraid of being alone, so I stuck around, so I actively made the decision to stick around out of illogical fears. Me sticking around was a reflection of myself, sure my ex sucked at the time, but so did I, which is why I stuck around. Which is why I don't understand why people post stuff about people they dated, sure that guy is a "niceguy" weirdo...but you made the decision to date him. It's not like he's some random guy who you gave your number to on tinder, or a classmate who has your phone number from a group project, and he says some psycho shit...it's someone you made a decision to go on a date with/date.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off your girlfriend is wrong, 200 silver half dollars weigh 2,500 grams. No matter how you look at it her retarded brother stole 2,500 grams of silver from you. Collecting silver, gold, and other precious metals is a very common investing tactic, because precious metals hold their value, and can be sold at a higher dollar value if we were to go into a recession (again...which might happen again soon). Second off...the kid is 19, and he spent it on weed. It's not like he's an addict who spent it on crack, and has a serious issue. He didn't make this decision based off a serious addiction, he made the decision because he's a fucking asshole, who has no consideration, and is taking advantage of his sisters kindness. Honestly...I think most people I know would beat him up and kick them both out of the house. I wouldn't suggest beating the kid, instead gather evidence that he stole the coins, and how many coins he stole. Maybe put your phone in your pocket, or hide a camera in a room when you talk to him, and get solid evidence that way. Then demand your girlfriend and her brother either get back the coins (maybe contact the dealer and see if you can give him $100 cash in exchange for the coins, maybe tell him it has sentimental value like someone else in the comments suggested) or pay you back the value of the coins. Then either move out, or kick them out. No one should ever be forced to live with a loser thief who they can't trust, and the fact that your gf belittled something you cared about, and sort of took her brothers side is absolutely ridiculous. No way you deserve to be treated like that. Find a new girl, one who doesn't have a piece of shit for a brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Digital marketer here, this isn't fat logic. Its false advertising logic. It's very easy to take a picture after a heavy meal, where you're slouching, pushing your stomach out, turning your body slightly to the side, to make it look like you have a huge belly, and calling it a before picture. Followed by taking a laxative to take a huge dump, going to the gym and working out super hard for a few hours, throwing on some dehydrating lotion (to make your muscles pop), and flexing as hard as you can, then take a picture, and call it an after picture of you looking ripped. Then putting these pictures side by side, and claiming "I've lost 15 pounds in 3 days!" When both pictures were taken the same day. It's actually super common for people to practice such shady business practices on other more lenient ad platforms. Instagram is owned by Facebook, and Facebook is trying to have an extremely honest ad platform. If it were fat logic you would never be able to post before and after pictures. You are, you're just not allowed to pay to advertise a before and after pictures because of snake oil salesmen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fitness is one of the biggest niches that advertise on fb/ig. There just aren't enough people to comb through the thousands and thousands of submissions to post a paid ad on these platforms a day. So rather than going through every single before and after post, they just ban them all. And like I said, she's totally allowed to post before and after pics on her Instagram, she is just not allowed to make a paid before and after post/ad. What she can do instead is fill her IG with those kinds of pictures, grow her following organically (and through a different sort of paid traffic that isn't a before and after) and those non paid before and after posts could draw in customers. That's a strategy that Greg O'Gahlliger uses (I might be spelling his name wrong). As for how else is she supposed to promote herself, there are lots and lots of ways. I recommend she hire an ad agency, but off the top of my head I think something like a carousel post would do great. The first pic could be a great picture of her ass, followed by three or four ass workouts that show off her ass following that first good ass shot, then the last picture could just be a white background with black text saying something like "The 15 minute a day workout for bigger, more toned, attention grabbing glutes" or something like that. Like I said, it's one of the biggest niches out there, she could just check out what her competition is doing (and there's a lot), because they're not using paid before and after ads. And yes it says "this ad would have made people feel bad about themselves and her entire message is wantingto help people feel good about themselves and in their bodies." And it might be politically motivated, but I've never seen that on fitness ads I've made. I guess there were too many people appealing these sorts of ads, so they just made a different excuse as to not have to spend hundreds of man hours a day looking at ads to determine whether they're fraud or not. Again this niche draws in a lit of scammers. Easier to just ban something than to sort through scammers and non scammers. Not to mention haters who will report you out of pure jealousy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If there's a promised amount of weight lose in a certain time frame that's super against the rules. I suspect it's an influence sponsored post, and not a paid ad. This is when, for example, a meme page or something like that will get paid directly from a company to make a post promoting their product, and then take it down after a certain amount of time. Always report these. Instagram wouldn't even allow you to say "lose x pounds, in x days." on a paid ad. It wouldn't get approved. So shady companies rely on influencers to promote them, because the actual company is a lot less likely to get penalized, since it's not on their page, and it gets taken down anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're probably confusing a paid ad with a influencer sponsored ad. A paid ad is if for example if you sell golf clubs, and make an IG for you company, and make ads that target people who like golf and are fans of tiger woods or whoever is famous in golf, and pay a certain amount of money per day to show those people you targeted, ads to buy your golf clubs. An influencer sponsored post is when a meme page or something like that, gets.paid directly by a company to promote their shitty products that wouldn't get approved on the Instagram ad platform. These are usually only shown to that influencers fans, and these influencer usually only leaves these sponsored posts up for a few hours. This makes them less likely to get flagged. That's probably what you're seeing, not a paid like in the original post.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These people need to read the meredith chivers bonobo study. To sum it up, a group of men and women, who identified as gay and straight, sat down and watched various videos, while their blood flow (arousal) was measured, to see what turns them on. Videos ranged from just a naked man/women, to lesbian and gay sex, straight sex, to two bonobos (think mini chimpanzees) fucking. Turns out gay guys like stuff with dicks, straight guys love stuff with vaginas, and women loved every video. This might be TMI but I once double teamed a woman, with her husband, and the dude kissed me in the heat of the moment. I immediately went softer than a soggy spaghetti later it turned out the guy was in the closet and they got divorced, which to me shows that her study was pretty spot on. Anyways, point is that people don't seem to realize (or care) how much biology plays into attraction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm actually poly, and not monogamous. Its SUPER hard to find other poly people in some cities. The second I put up a picture of my partner, and put that I'm poly on my tinder profile, my matches dried the fuck up. Granted it's easier to convince people after I meet them, but even then there are a lot of nos. This person lives on the internet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Huh? I'm not sure what you mean. Being poly doesn't mean being unfaithful. It means being ethically non-monogamous. She's allowed to date and sleep with other men and women, and I'm allowed to date or sleep with other women. We discuss everything before and afterwards, and if I don't want to meet some of her needs she's allowed to meet them elsewhere, and vice versa. There's no cheating, its dating with different rules. Rules that allow the two of us to have more freedom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #128514; #128514; #128514; That sounds like insecure projection. And no, she's not getting dicked down almost constantly. First off, most guys don't satisfy her sexually, so she tends to fuck women. Second off she sleeps over my place almost every night, or I hers. As a matter of fact we spend most days together, and when we don't we're in contact most of the time. Third off, we both have secondary partners, both our secondary partners are women, and if she found a male secondary partner I wouldn't care. And lastly most of the sex we've had with other people have been threesomes.</TEXT>

Would I feel.weird if she were banging a new dude every night, yeah. And we'd talk about it, and she either wouldn't do it, or we'd break up. You're assuming that's what women want.

    <TEXT>A little background on my situation. I'm a straight guy, I have a primary partner, and a secondary partner. My secondary partner is married, but we spend a lot more time together than she does with her husband. My primary partner has a secondary partner in another city, so she sees him on some weekends, but she's actually been seeing him less and less since we started dating, and since she's met my secondary partner. The three of us hang out a lot. We do regular every day things together quite often, and regularly go on adventures just the three of us. We all have high sex drives, so two or three of us are usually fucking each other at any given point of the day. Both are very attractive, more attractive than me for sure haha On multiple occasions I've gotten guys asking me "Dude, you're just okay with your girl fucking a new guy every night?" Obviously these guys have no idea what they're talking about, and I usually just brush it off with an explanation like "I wouldn't be comfortable with them fucking a new guy every night. We always discuss when one of us are going on dates with new people, we have veto power, and we usually just fuck each other, with very few exceptions. The only time we really fuck other people is when we fuck our other partners, or go to sex parties." Usually that's the end of it. However...the other night my secondary partner and I are at a bar, basically on a date, and we run into a few friends who are with other people I know. One guy didn't think she was with me, because she's more attractive than me (at least in his eyes) and starts hitting on her. She wasn't interested and comes clinging to my arm. He apologizes and says he didn't know she was with me. I say it's okay, and we end up taking shots, and getting mixed in with this group of people. About an hour later he starts hitting on her again, someone told him that we're poly, and he took it as a green light to hit on her again. Again she comes and clings to my arm, and I just turn our backs to him. I then overhear him tell one of my friends that I "cockblocked him" and calls me an asshole. So I turned around and say something like "dude, you think I'm cockblocking you from hitting on my girlfriend....who isn't interested in you?" Immediately his reaction was something like "Whatever she's probably just some slut who fucks a new dude every night. She's using you bro! I'm just trying to help you out." This pissed me off to the highest degree, and the combination of disrespect and alcohol made me lose my shit. I start poking at his chest, start threatening him, and ask him if he wants to go outside. I really really wanted to fuck this guy up. It's not the first time I've gotten wildly disrespectful comments like this. Am I alone here? Does anyone else face this sort of disrespect? And what do you do? I'm usually more calm and collected, but I was kind of drunk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Veto power comes from if she wants to sleep with someone whom I dislike, or something like that. She has the same power. I've never actually vetoed anyone, but she has vetoed someone I wanted to sleep with. It's also not my veto power, its OUR veto power. And it would make me uncomfortable if she slept with 365 guys in a year, yes Just as she would feel uncomfortable if I did the same. After all we don't use condoms with one another. Sometimes she wants to be more promiscuous and I encourage her to do so, just like she encourages me. We call it going into "rampage" mode. We have equal power and rights in this relationship, and I don't "feel the need" to throw anything in anyone's face. Those are literally the rules we came up with, and I just explain them to people who ask. If you're curious we got them from a book called "Opening Up".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a HUGE assumption. There were two friends of mine, both very non judgemental, both very accepting of my lifestyle and choices. The rest of the group, including the guy who got rejected, were their coworkers. I asked my friends what was up with that dude later, one of them said he doesn't like that guy and avoids him, the other one said something like "he asked me what's the deal with you two, and I told him she's your girlfriend, you two are in an open relationship, and that you have another girlfriend too. That's it." I'm very open about stuff, and I see no problem with what he said. It's not his fault that this stranger took me being in an open relationship as a green light to hit on my partner and act like a douche. What's with people on reddit just making these weird assumptions.</TEXT>

I chose to react with aggression, that was my choice. It wasn't that I couldn't "keep my cool, because my feelings were hurt". That's an assumption you made, there have been a lot of assumptions about me on this thread. And that's your excuse? I'm an idiot because I was willing to get physical because there's a chance I could get hurt? Dude... I'm not going to let people mistreat and verbally abuse my partner, not gonna happen. Just like I'm not gonna let someone call a black friend the n word, or a gay friend the f word. Also "bigger and well trained" jesus dude... you're speaking out of fear. I havent been in a street fight since I was in college, when my friend got jumped at a bar. I spent a night in jail, before that I never got in trouble for a street fight, because I'm not dumb enough to stick around. And lastly I've been doing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai since I was 15. I get fucked up in the gym 2 or 3 times a week, a little beating isn't a big deal.

I personally didn't care at the time, but I have met guys I don't like in the poly community who I'd feel uncomfortable if she slept with. But I don't think it's an issue because she finds them weird or manipulative too. She's actually the one who presented all the rules, she got it from a book, and I happened to agree.

    <TEXT>NTA I have a "useless" degree. After college I applied to thousands of jobs, and only got called back from places like Starbucks and whole foods. I had to spend time and money on developing a new skill that actually translates to market value (digital marketing) it felt like all my friends had a huge headstart, particularly the ones who have a CS degree. Here's what your daughter doesn't understand... Let's forget the fact that you're asking her to lay out a plan for the future, and you're being a total dictator and saying "I'm not paying for a LA degree no matter what, get over it." Even if that were the case I don't think you're the asshole, to an 18 year old 4 years might seem like forever...but it's not. Its actually a relatively short time. She could still take LA classes as electives (which I highly recommend anyone does) and once she has her degree she can start making anywhere between 70k - over 6 figures. She'll have the power to work shorter hours, work remotely, and travel the world. With a LA degree she'll be working as a server with zero applicable skills to the real world. She'll have fun for four years and be miserable for 10. It's a very short sighted way of thinking. And like a mentioned above a lot of my CS friends work shorter hours, have the ability to get whatever job they want, and have so much time for fulfilling hobbies and adventures. Lastly don't listen to academics on this one. College professors dont live in the real world. They live in an academic bubble. They go to college, and then stay in college for the rest of their lives. Of course they're going to think you're the asshole on this one, because they have no understanding of what it's like to make it in real life, have no idea what it's like to work grueling hours as a server, while studying at night to learn a new skill while their friends are out travelling the world and taking on new hobbies.</TEXT>

It's not her kid, she's not close to her sister, family doesn't automatically mean you HAVE to be there for someone, especially if the family isn't close, or loving in any way shape or form. You're saying OP is an asshole because she doesn't want to drop her life to take care of a child she doesn't really know. Her sister basically sounds like an acquaintance. And yeah I understand, this child is probably going to be traumatized, but it is in no way shape or form OPs fault. It's 100% her sisters fault. This isn't a cat, or a hamster or anything. It's a fucking baby. It needs years and years of love, and support. You shouldn't have a baby if you aren't responsible enough to take care of it. You shouldn't have a baby if you don't know who the father is, if you know the father is going to be absent, or if there isn't another person helping you raise said child. Your reasoning is beyond flawed and the whole "BUT IT'S FAMILY" argument is complete bullshit.</TEXT>

Although she has brought it up before. In the beginning of the relationship, based on a gut feeling I've had about what she told me about her past (she was monogamous for a long time and cheated on all her partners) that she will have to earn my trust. That conversation didn't go over well. That being said, she is dedicated to the poly lifestyle, and I think she will take it seriously. With that being said, what are your thoughts now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was making close to 300k in marketing when I lived in NYC. I worked anywhere between 60 and 90 hours a week. I got fat, my relationship suffered, I almost never got time off, I took up smoking, and my health deteriorated in several ways. I quit, started my own thing, moved to Thailand, and now I'm living in paradise where I only work about 12 - 20 hours a week. The rest of my time is spent travelling, doing Muay Thai, going on dates, eating at new restaurants, and I get to SLEEP for as long as I want, only making 65k/year. This is some real sheep shit to think your life would be better as a slave to your pay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the tweet is still wrong. But of course that's subjective and this is my personal experience. If I kept my job I couldn't move, ANYWHERE, not even another state with a lower cost of living. And it's going to be like that for the vast majority of jobs that pay you half a million dollars a year. Most people don't realize the time energy and dedication needed to get to the level where you are making that sort of money. Your life expectancy goes down because of all the added stress, and your hormones go out of whack. It's hard to keep in shape and almost impossible to keep up with your hobbies because jobs that pay that much require a lot of mental and physical energy, not just time. It completely unbalances your life when you dedicate that much time to ONE thing. I was in a relationship and that went to shit while I was at this job, and if were single dating would have been too hard. I had the skills to start my own business and move on basically around the time I got the job. But I figured I'd work, do my own thing on the side, and when the business grew I'd move on. If I were to do it over again I wouldn't wait. I would have quit years earlier, gotten a lower paying job that is much less of a commitment, and worked on my own thing until I launched my business and moved out. In the tweet he's basically saying I'm a fool for quitting my job and making way less. I'm saying I'm a fool for staying around as long as I did out of fear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually started a drop shipping store to see if it actually works (I'm in marketing so I already had a lot of knowledge about selling shit online) and actually... I did make around $1k in profit after 3 months. BUT it does require a lot of time AND luck. Unless that's you're only hustle then you shouldn't do it. It's not a get rich quick scheme like a lot of people make it seem. It's tedious, and takes a lot of time. That being said if you find a decent niche, and you can build your store to the point where you make enough to use a fulfillment center then it could very well be worth it... But that will take years, not weeks like these fucking gurus pretend it will take.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA, I live in Thailand and I have a friend who was living in China for a long time. Long story short someone alerted the police that he smokes pot, they came to piss test him, and then arrested him and put him behind bars for three weeks. He REFUSED to leave his house until he was able to leave his key behind, contact 10 - 15 friends, and find someone who would watch his dog while he was behind bars (3 weeks). If this dude could find someone to take care of a dog, in a few minutes, while under pressure of arrest by Chinese police, then your roommate could have made arrangements for the dog LONG before his trip. Your roommate sounds like TA and sounds like a wildly inconsiderate and irresponsible person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YTA, you got so wasted that you blacked out, and you had to physically be carried inside, and have the nerve to get mad at your roommate who tried to help you. Learn your limit, and stop being a burden to your housemates. Two more things: If you were so wasted that you forgot your keys, AND had to be carried home you probably would have missed your test anyways. Also I know you're in college and $1000 seems like an unthinkable amount of money at the moment, it's nothing compared to most people's student loan debt. You can negotiate that $1000 down. You have a fuck ton of time to pay it too, so stop acting like it's a huge deal, because it's not. I literally took 5 years to pay $1300 for an emergency room visit when I had kidney stones. It's only bad in your mind, in reality it's not really a big deal. You literally don't even have to worry about it for a while.</TEXT>

He was a little shit growing up, and would throw massive tantrums when he didnt get his way (think a more realistic version of Eric Cartman), or he'd play dumb. If he wanted candy he'd throw a fit until my mom gave him money for candy. He didn't want to clean the dishes or do his laundry, he'd pretend like he didnt know how to do them until my mom did it for him. He started cutting school and and drinking, they didn't do anything about it . He grew up to have poor social skills, had trouble getting girls, and just wasn't the most likeable human. He's doing great now, has a CS degree and a great job. But he 30 just graduated, still lives at home, and is just recently started making changed to his life. He still has a ways to go.</TEXT>

I'm a South American immigrant, and grew up in a neighborhood with many Hispanic immigrants, many of which came here illegally, and they came here for varying reasons. From dangerous conditions, to simply wanting to earn more money to send back to their families.</TEXT>

They found nickel bags of weed on two of us, and arrested us, we then spent the weekend in a holding cell. When we saw the judge on Monday she said don't do it again and let us go.

My last relationship was like this, she begged me not to sleep with another woman WHILE I was on a date. A month later she sleeps with another guy without any sort of communication, and when I expressed my concerns she broke down. Dumped her right then and there. Lots of unstable women are drawn to being poly, and in would say most poly women are pretty unstable. The ones who are stable still do get jealous, but they also tend to be encouraging about other relationships, despite their jealousy. However... these girls are rare.</TEXT>

If you were with a woman you probably wouldn't hang out with straight people who constantly teased you for being bi, and choosing a woman over a man, because they're shitty people. Don't play to their double standards. When they're finally in the real world and out of their bubble most people aren't going to like them, and they're going to be wildly unsuccessful (I've seen this MANY times before, when college babies finally leave their bubbles). I remember a few years ago this annoying gay dude, fresh out of college, started working at my old job. He constantly said things like "POCs can't be racist" and constantly teased "the straights". No one liked him, he got fired, and cried about it on social media for months. Find yourself people who don't suck.</TEXT>

I also lived in New York City throughout most of my childhood and teen years, while stop and frisk was a thing, and kids got stopped on the street for not being white, or wearing baggy clothing. Police corruption and violence, overall, is FAR worse and more rampant, in most South East Asian, and South American countries. I was even held at gun point, in Laos, by police at an ATM and made me empty out my account. You made a good point about more non-lethal weapons, in an advanced first world country there should be better systems in place. But let's stop pretending like American police are the worst this world has to offer, when that's far from the case.</TEXT>

Later on in life he took forever to finish college and get a job, was the last one to move out of mom's house, was a nightmare for future roommates and women he lived with.

Shaun King acts like he has had a black upbringing, but is a quarter black, grew up in a white neighborhood, and in a white family.

You're assuming that me being from Ecuador and having the last name Sanchez is me trying to prove that I'm not white. Anyone who can see, can see that I am white. I'm very white actually. That's not why I stated it though, and it would be pretty silly to try and argue that I don't have white skin. Me stating my country of origin, and last name is proof that I'm not culturally white. Culturally white, culturally black, and culturally Hispanic are all different things. And if you think despite a Hispanic upbringing that I'm culturally white, because my skin is white... then I don't know what to tell you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You were arguing semantics, which is why I said that you're arguing semantics. And I DON'T know what motivates you or what you desire, I never claimed to know either. Which is why I said "IT SEEMS like..." because in my (and many people's experiences) a person who is arguing semantics isn't trying to understand the other persons message. Now, sometimes semantics are important and need to be brought up, and I probably could have done a better job at clarifying my speech, but one always runs the risk of coming across like they're not paying attention to the message when arguing semantics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LMFAOOOOO okay dude, when you call someone racist because they're disagreeing with you then that's a sign that you've lost it, and that you're a whiny little baby dick, so this is the last I'll be responding to you. First off, that's not why I don't want to be called white. Like I've mentioned before, most people who call me white, don't call me white because they're referring to my skin color. Most people call me white to invalidate my upbringing. Most people know the difference between being white and having white skin. You don't for whatever reason. I don't identify with being white, I identify with being Hispanic. Just like most Jewish people have white skin, they have their own culture and are usually referred to as Jews. Not as white people. I can tell you about Hispanic culture, for one most Hispanics speak Spanish in the house growing up, most of us eat rice and beans with every meal, we dance different dances like salsa and bachata, we listen to a different style of music, watch an odd version of soap operas called novelas, play dominos on the sidewalk. There are just things Hispanics tend to do, culturally, that other cultures don't do. Same with black people, white people, Jews, Asians etc. I grew up in a mixed black and hispanic neighborhood, but I cant really tell you about black and white culture. Because I don't, nor ever claimed to know what it means to be culturally black or white. But when I googled black culture plenty of articles, including a wikipedia article popped up. Also ask a black person, or several black people, they will tell you what are things that are part of black culture. And to deny that different groups of people don't do things differently as a culture is just wrong and weird... you're either being weird or stubborn on purpose to win some meaningless internet battle, have no friends who are of different races and ethnicities, or are just an idiot. And I never dictated Shaun Kings race... I even said i think it's unfair to call him white, and that he's mixed IN THIS THREAD you fucking potato. As a matter of fact everything I've been posting on this thread are reasons why OTHER PEOPLE consider him white, WHILE saying he's mixed and saying I don't find it fair to call him white. And if Shaun King, who is mixed (3/4th white, 1/4th black), and was raised by black adoptive parents, in a black neighborhood, then yes... he'd probably be culturally blacker than if he grew up with white parents in a white neighborhood. Not a hard concept to understand, you fucking dipshit. And sure, there are differences among different countries in South America, and you could go more specific and use terms like Colombian or Brazilian culture when referring something done uniquely in that part of Latin America. But there are still a mountain of similarities, and those similarities amongst Hispanic countries, are what people refer to as Hispanic culture. Just like things are done differently in New York, and Louisiana. But I've lived in both states, and while there are many many differences, there are also many similarities, and many people would consider those commonalities to be part of American culture. Can't believe this had to be explained. You're either dumb as fuck, or just like to win arguments rather than trying to understand someone else's meaning. Fuck you I hope your isolation sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not saying that at all. I've travelled a lot, and have lived in many different places. I know theres an English culture, and a French culture, and an Irish culture etc. But I believe when the term white culture is used, its often referring to Americans whose family has been in this country for several generations, with the vast majority (or all) of their ancestors roots being from predominantly white European countries. I guess lots of people use the term white culture and American culture interchangeably.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA this sounds painfully similar to the relationship my brother and I had back in the day. I also thought my older brother to be condescending, entitled, and just an overall douche, and he sounds extremely similar to your brother. As we grew older I realized I was a lot more liked than him, for good reason, and he started making the whole "I just don't like people." excuse. Which I discovered after meeting several people like that, that it normally means "People tend not to like me, so I generalize that people are dumber than me and I tell myself that I don't care what they say or think, in order to make myself feel better, and as a justification for being an antisocial douche, because it's easier to make these excuses than admit that I'm an insufferable cunt and I need to change because now I'm lonely and often depressed." Oddly specific, I know, but I've seen that a few times. Anyways, cut the cord. I did with my brother, and so did a lot of other people. It took him learning that people dont want to be around him in order to seek feedback and actively change. Now at 29 years old, while my brother still has some annoying habits, he is a much better positive healthier and happier person. I love being around him and we talk all the time. But I guarantee this wouldn't have happened if I didnt distance myself from him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is actually pretty funny considering how much of the world hates Chinese tourists. I currently live in Thailand, and every South East Asian country I've been in has claimed Chinese Tourists to be the kings of shitty tourists. And are often seen as dumb, entitled, annoying, and disrespectful. I remember I once invited a girl over to my place, and she asked if I could come to her instead because there were too many Chinese tourists in my neighborhood and she didn't want to drive around in the neighborhood. At first I thought she was just kind of racist... but after living in the neighborhood for 6 months there were tons of motorbike accidents around me, mostly coming from Chinese tourists, and food delivery drivers. I also once saw a 5 year old chinese kid take a shit on the street, and his mom just wiped his ass with baby wipes, and walked away like it's no big deal. Also what you said about white skin is spot on. In every Asian country I've been to tons of people use skin products with bleach, use umbrellas on sunny days avoid tanning, and even wear gloves and coats when they drive their motorbikes to avoid sun exposure. Its ridiculous but also hilarious and sad. I once met this GORGEOUS Thai girl on tinder who was bullied hard growing up for being so brown. She once showed me a text conversation she had with a friend where her friend told her she needs to stick with dating westerners, because high quality thai guys wouldn't be interested. Things can be weird in Asia lol</TEXT>

A few years back, when I finally started making a decent income, after a long period making between 1 and 2 thousand dollars a month, the first thing I did was move into a nice new place. An old friend and his girlfriend were looking to move into this city. My buddy and I both grew up poor, in a shit neighborhood, and when he saw my new place he started making all these assumptions. First thing he said when he walked in was "you selling drugs now dude?". I explained to him that no, I paid 10k (used credit cards, didn't actually have 10k) to a marketing coach for a few months, and he helped me tighten my skills, and taught me a bunch of things, and I used my new skills to pick up several high paying clients, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to work from home. He was supposed to stay for a week, and then he and his gf would go find a new place. On the FIRST day he kept bugging me while I tried to work, and when his gf told him to leave me alone because I'm busy he'd say shit like "he doesnt even do real work, hes just on his computer all day." He made a few more backhanded comments like "man, you're so lucky you don't have a REAL job" and things of that nature. I brushed it off a few times, cause... well... I had work and I couldn't be bothered lol But later that night he asked me if I wanted to go day drinking the next day, since he had the day off. I said no, I can't I have to work. Again he made another comment about me not "really" having to work. I realized it was gonna be an issue so I put my foot down, and said listen man I have this apartment with a spare bedroom, and an office because not only do I work hard, but I also work smart. My job may not be physically demanding, but its mentally demanding and sometimes I have to work upwards of 12 to 15 hrs in a day. If you're not going to respect me enough to let me get my work done, then you're out. Get a hotel or an airbnb, but theres no way I'm gonna let your jealousy interfere with my money, idgaf how long we've been cool for. He gave a half assed apology, his gf gave a real sincere apology, and that was that. After that there were no more backhanded comments, I worked in my office during the day, and wed chill and watch movies/play video games at night, and the week passed with no more issues. Maybe it's a Hispanic thing, idk, but my mother and father never tolerated any sort of disrespect in their home. Their home is their kingdom, and while civil debate and disagreement is welcome, disrespectful comments and behaviour is not. NTA and OP please don't let people disrespect you in your own home, life is short, you have kids, ain't nobody got time for that shit. Good on your husband for sticking up for you the way he did.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Buggy The Clown Theory</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-26 17:03:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay, I'm sure this has been spread around before, so if this theory already exists please direct me to a youtube video about it or something. Anyways, I think Buggy is mega strong. Like Yonko commander or admiral level strong, maybe even yonko level. I once saw a theory on Jar Jar Binks, saying that he was originally supposed to be a sith lord, and he was just portrayed as a bumbling idiot to throw off the viewer's, but he was so unliked by the audience that Lucas Films scrapped the idea (if you're unfamiliar with the theory here's a youtube video explaining it: https://youtu.be/PlyRLtAngxo) So anyways, what if Buggy isn't a bumbling idiot, who keeps getting really really lucky, but really he's using his amazing observation haki to constantly avoid death? And what if hes also secretly super strong. Shanks asked Buggy to join his crew in a flashback (maybe there was more than one instance idk). It could be simply because he and Buggy were on the same crew, but MAYBE he knows Buggys true strength. The only other person Shanks asked to join his crew that we've seen is Marco, who is a first division yonko commander. Shanks is also known to have a smaller, more carefully selected crew, if Buggy isn't strong or useful in some regard, why did Shanks ask him to join? Speaking of Shanks let's look at the flashbacks with those two. In one flash back neither were scared going up against white beard, why would he be so cowardly now if he wasn't in the past? There was also another flashback where shanks and Buggy are arguing over which pole is colder, the north or south. They're both scratched up, and seem to have taken the same amount of damage. If they were once on equal levels, or at least competitive towards one another, how could the disparity in their strength have grown so much? And the last thing I can think of was that one time when Buggy carried Jinbei around, while he was flying, and jinbei weighs like a ton. So yeah, idk, what do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've listened to Tim Pool and Dave Rubin talk about getting BOMBARDED with hate from the left for expressing right leaning or even center leaning opinions, sometimes even left leaning opinions. Tim Pool was grossly treated for having a free speech event, where Daryle Davis (the black guy who convinced many KKK members to give up being racists) spoke. Profit is potentially one of the reasons why, but if I got treated like shit by crowd A, and treated far better by crowd B (while making money) then I'd probably begin creating more content for crowd B.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No offense to the Vegans out there... but as a group of people vegans have been stereotyped as crazies for a reason. With that being said I live in a town with a community of lovely people, many of which are vegans, and most of them are absolutely wonderful. However, there are many, even the ones who seem wonderful, who show their crazy and irrational side when it comes to being vegan. I once got into a debate with a woman in our group who believes being a vegan is by far the healthiest diet/lifestyle that exists. Its not for the vast majority of people, and there is a mountain of evidence to prove it. In our debate this women would make wild claims about veganism, which I'd quickly google and show she has the wrong information. It seemed like a civil debate, until later that day when I got bombarded with messages of other vegans calling me an asshole. Turns out she got upset and told all our friends what a horrible person I am for disagreeing with her beliefs, and going as far as using google to 'shame her'. You're NTA, and next time something about diet comes up try and realize that many vegans will be complete irrational assholes, driven by their ideology.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Capitalism is a system where a country's trade and industry are controlled by the free market, and private owners for profit, rather than the state. Socialism is a system where the means of production, distribution, and sales are owned and regulated by the state. Not a single country you mentioned is a socialist country, they all operate on a free market economy, but have socialist policies. Nothing wrong with socialist policies, and I actually believe America should adopt a few more socialist policies. Also all three countries you mentioned dont JUST have socialist policies for health care and education. All three have private AND public schools and hospitals. They all have mixed systems, as does America. America isn't a purely capitalist country btw. The reason these countries have both private and public healthcare and education, is because governments tend to suck and running things. Take our education system for example, most mediocre and cheaper private schools are much much better than the best public schools in that city or state (with some exceptions), and the best private schools in our country are light years ahead of our best public schools. Now, let's look at ACTUAL socialist countries, where the government does control the means of production and distribution. Every single one of these countries has failed, is in the process of failing, and were/are a nightmare to live in (China, North Korea, Venezuela, USSR, etc.). They may have started "for the people" but soon became tyrannical, and that pattern was repeated in history over and over again. As for "capitalism" is holding the world back, I disagree whole heartedly, but a few years ago I would have agreed because a few years ago I didn't ACTUALLY know what socialism and capitalism were. Let's look at American health care for example. Years ago I was in Chicago for work and I had a kidney stone, I was in INTENSE pain, I went to the ER, and all they did was give me morphine and sent me home. My bill was $10,000, and they wouldn't accept my New York insurance in Illinois. I straight up refused to pay because I was in and out in an hour. They hounded me for months to pay my bill, one day I indulged the debt collector at the hospital and spoke with her, and told her to give me a detailed receipt for everything I'm paying for. Immediately my bill went from 10k to 1k... still too steep for me, and I negotiated (I have an extensive background in sales) and got her down to $500... which in hindsight is still too much considering it was literally only one shot. This was one personal bad experience I had with the healthcare system that actually led me to believe capitalism was evil, at first. But the American health care system is the antithesis capitalism. The price of medicine and treatment is decided by hospitals and is then negotiated with insurance companies. The free market has NOTHING to so with the cost of medicine and medical services in America, you can't even call a doctor to ask for the price of an x-ray, and prices of medical treatment has gone way way up, despite the reduction of manufacturing costs, and the improvement of technology, it's totally backwards Currently I live in Thailand which also operates on a mixed system, but I'm not a Thai citizen so I don't get state issued insurance. However they are true capitalists with their healthcare as well, and when I wanted an std test a few months back I googled the closest doctors, called them up, asked for the price of an STD test, and went to the cheapest one (it was only $24). Not to mention I pay $6 for an inhaler here, in the states I paid $60 without insurance, or if I lost it before my next refill. Guess what? Ventolin inhalers are manufactured in China and cost less than $2 to make, and while it would be more expensive in America due to shipping prices it shouldn't be 10x the price it is in Thailand, and it wouldn't be if American healthcare ran on a free market based system, but it doesn't.</TEXT>

I had it real bad, but I have asthma, and the worst if it ended in a few days. I was pretty sick for a week, a lot less sick for another week, and I couldn't breathe right for a few weeks after that, and I feel great now a few months later. But most people who die are over 60, and/or obese, and/or have other pre existing conditions. And for the most part younger and healthier people don't die from this, or have terrible symptoms. But there are exceptions, and I don't think anyone understands why yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one who has responded to your comments here has compared it to the flu. We know its different from the flu in the rate at which it spreads, but theres also a lot of evidence to suggest that there is a much higher rate of infection than thought, meaning the death rate is probably much lower than the original 2% - 4% that the WHO originally thought.</TEXT>

My buddy says yes because he was kind if a dick at the time, and we were both berated by her and her friends for about 20 minutes. Wildly uncomfortable situation and I just sat there and ate the insults.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think making it sound like he would get a title shot if he beat Travis Brown was a douche move. I've seen all his fights in the UFC and the ultimate fighter show, and not once in his career was he ever even remotely close to getting the title shot, let alone being champ. Not to mention all his big wins were nobody's and people past their prime. With the exception of Matt Metrione, he couldn't even get past mid level fighters. What's the point in sucking your own dick and making it look like you were a big name who was inches away from UFC gold when your entire career has been documented, and it's clearly a lie? He makes it sound like he was on the same level as dudes who are great but never got a title. Like the Diaz brothers, Cowboy, Gufstason, Rory McDonald etc. He was barely a mid level fighter, in the worst division in the UFC... this really rubs me the wrong way.</TEXT>

But media in the US is absolutely garbage, they've been known to film within crowds to make certain crowds look way bigger than they actually are, or do the opposite and film from a distance to make crowds look smaller. People believe things are way worse than they actually are because of the garbage media.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right about the president. But most of these protests aren't massive, not even a little bit. And they are country wide, and they do have large support systems. But the media conveniently fails to mention that many of the cities have small populations, never had capacity issues at their hospitals, and weren't short on respirators/hospital rooms. So why would a small town in Minnesota, with 100k population, whose cases are dropping, have to abide by the same rules as a city like NYC who has a population of 8million and a smaller area size? This is what I mean about bullshit media manipulation. Right now I live in Chiang Mai Thailand, we were on lockdown, had mask rules, social distancing rules and a curfew. But as cases declined some things began to open up, and right now we still have a curfew but we can go to restaurants and other businesses open as well. However Bangkok is still completely on lockdown, because it's a big city, with a big population, and they still havent flattened the curve. America wants to do the same thing we're doing here in Thailand, America is a massive country, with a massive population, and not everywhere is being effected the same. But the media doesn't mention any of this, they just feed us whatever causes the most outrage, and highlights the worst and craziest protesters which causes further division. The American media is a joke, and the whole world is laughing at us for allowing this bullshit to continue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't agree with this sort of behavior. And many? No, that's not accurate. More like a couple of protests involved guns. I watched a CNN piece where they talked about that one protest where people raided a government building with guns... but failed to mention there were only a handful of people outside, only 5 people inside, and the building was empty. Yet the cnn story tried to make it look like this was normal conservative behavior. It's not, they took the worst conservatives they could find and tried to fool us into thinking this is how half of the country acts. Bullshit media manipulation causing further division. What's even worse is these sort of lies and half truths are fueling Donald Trumps fake news narrative, and I won't be surprised if we get another 4 years of that clown. Currently I'm living in Thailand and the people here don't look down on Americans, but they do think our media and politics are a joke... and they're right.</TEXT>

So I'd guess if you want an accurate representation of a protest standing across the street, or like 30 feet away. Btw this isn't something I'm pulling out of my ass. It's based on a video ad I made for a concert two years ago. Standing 15 feet away from a crowd of 30 people made it look like a full concert.</TEXT>

The reason I pointed that part out in particular was because it's the part that isn't true. I agree that extremists morons make up a tiny minority on either side of the political spectrum, but if you're going to use absolute words like 'nobody' don't be surprised when someone corrects you, because words don't stop having universal meanings just because it wasn't your intended use of the word.

    <TEXT>I'm gonna sound like a dummy here, but until I read this post I actually didn't see a problem with IE. I do it all the time, I eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm not. I don't count calories and am in pretty good shape. But I work out a lot, I actually live in Thailand currently and have a visa for learning muay thai, admittingly I don't always eat healthy food (def love cookies and soda) but for the most part I eat pretty healthy. I also lifted weights before the pandemic and have workout equipment at home. I cook at home a lot, and I only really eat until I'm full when I get stoned at special events like Christmas. Eating out in Thailand isn't as bad as in the US because the portions are a lot smaller. Didn't realize until reading this post that this is not what IE is to Fat Activists. This post made me realize how dangerous the concept of IE is if you're an emotional eater, and/or have a food addiction. Hope you get back to a healthy weight and lifestyle OP, if a dummy stoner like me can stay in shape, I know you can too. Besides, being self aware is a big first step, I wish you the best of luck.</TEXT>

It helped me understand my bad habits and addictions, what triggers my bad habits, and how to replace them with good ones. I was a massive sugar addict, still am addicted to sugar but slowly weening off more and more to healthier and healthier levels, thanks to this book, as well as helped me increase my exercising habits. I was a yo yo exerciser because when I worked out, I worked out hard for months, and then stopped for months, now I've been consistently working out at least 3x a week, for the past year. And I cook healthier and tasty meals on a regular basis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Jones is better at avoiding shots than Stipe, and better at finding openings. Overall he's a very intelligent fighter who is hard to hit. Not impossible to hit, but still very slippery. I just got fight pass, and watched a bunch of their old fights - a buddy of mine is new to mma, and wanted to watch some good JBJ fights, I also showed him some Frances KOs, and Frances just isn't the most technical striker. And one thing I forgot about is how JBJ destroyed DC and Gus in their second fights. I believe, and I could be wrong, that once JBJ knows how to beat you he'll do it in stellar fashion. Stipe outlined how to beat Frances, and I think he'll execute that game plan pretty well, and beat Frances pretty decisively.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Thailand, and I thought Thai people were racist against the Chinese because of how they constantly spoke badly about them... but they actually do tend to be pretty awful. I once saw a little kid just pull his pants down and shit on the street. His mom wiped his ass and they then walked away like it was totally normal, with a big pile of human shit baking in the sun on the sidewalk. Worst part is that Thai people are extremely polite and they just let these chinese tourists walk all over them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA when I was ten I handled boa constrictors and all sorts of pythons, iguanas, large lizards, guinea pigs, etc at the Boys Club in NYC (one of the true shining gems of my childhood in a ghetto ass NYC neighborhood) Even at 8 I think I may have fed some of the snakes, not quite sure. Anyways, my point is there is no reason for his children to be that irresponsible. That's just bad guidance. It's not your responsibility to teach them to respect the animals, it's your brothers especially since you brought the issue up. Don't fold, those kids will be spoiled little shits if you do, tell your brother to stop being a bad dad and teach his children personal responsibility or else they're gonna be losers. Harsh, I know, but that's what happens when you let little kids do whatever they want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean... if my girlfriend punches me it might sting, but it wouldn't hurt too much, and unless she shoots me or poisons me, I'd easily over power her if she tried to attack to kill or seriously injure me. On the other hand one good upper cut from me could easily give her a concussion, and if I tried to really really hurt or kill her, she probably wouldn't be able to stop me. (Not that either of us have or ever will attack each other) So there can be a risk for higher physical trauma to a woman, from a man, than there is to a man from a woman. That being said this doesn't account for emotional trauma and manipulation, most people don't leave after they're abused, their confidence gets destroyed, they become fearful of being alone, and they learn to live with the abuse. Men are less likely to report domestic abuse, because theres a history of it being ignored. Guys who are abused by their girlfriends or wives often get laughed at by cunty people. For all domestic abuse victims there is a wide wide array of scenarios that can happen, and just because one side might have it worse sometimes, in some cases, doesn't mean you're allowed to completely dismiss the other side, especially when you can't back up the claim. Domestic abuse cases towards men are a lot more common than we think, with number comparable to domestic abuse cases towards women. Neither situation should be placed above the other, they are both terrible, to say one is worse than the other, and dismiss the side that isn't yours is just a cunt move</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A big portion of your taxes also go to the military, and tons of other unnecessary government spending. It's no secret that our government spends way too much. And like I said, he literally pays more taxes than anyone on the planet, and a higher percentage of taxes than the vast majority of people on the planet, and that money DOES fund roads, welfare, law-enforcement, etc. Not to mention ALL of his money, except 0.1% (which is going to his kids), is going to help make the world a better place. And dude... every billionaire in America could get taxed 100% of their income, and that still wouldn't be enough to pay for everything. Also, the idea of a perfect utopia is silly in my opinion. Perfection is impossible, and someone will always find something to complain about, so the most we can work for is better than yesterday. Which Bill Gates is constantly trying to do. Lastly, it's easy to blame billionaires, because they make up a tiny minority, and have tons of power. That being said painting them all with one brush is silly. They're humans, some suck, others are average, and others are amazing human beings. We can't vilify an entire group of people, and pretend like they're the cause of all or most of our problems. The world is far more complex than that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You didn't strike a nerve, that's an assumption you're making, I was simply responding to your comment, as I'm doing again right now. "I know they pay barely any taxes overthere, as they do over here." We're not talking about all billionaires, we're talking about one in particular, Bill Gates. You're speaking in generalities about billionaires, when the conversation is about one specific person. You're not even arguing the same thing as me, and speaking on billionaires as a whole has absolutely nothing to do with my original comment. "Also, who do you think funds the lobying groups that cause the U.S. Congress to form an opinion? And has the U.S. ever invaded nations for a single company?" Again, we're talking about a specific individual. Which lobbying groups is he funding, to form which opinion? When did the US invade a nation on behalf of Microsoft or any other company owned by Bill Gates? "Billionaires may be amazing people but they didn't het where they are by playing fair, and they do cause issues but you just blame that on others." Again, we're talking about one man in specific, Bill Gates. What issues has he caused, bring any specific issues directly caused by something he did, and we can address that specifically. And no I'd don't blame it on others, I clearly mentioned above that some billionaires suck, some are average, and some are amazing people. I dont think all billionaires do good for the world, and I don't think they're all evil. I judge them on an individual by individual basis, and don't make generalizations about ANY group of people. "Who do you think bribed the U.S. government to keep wages from rising?" I'm not sure what you're referring to. You think Bill Gates bribed the US government to keep wages low?</TEXT>

You just walk into a hospital tell them what you want, they tell you the price, you do it, and go home. We just asked for antibody tests, what country are you from? As for medication, they put me on antibiotics when I first got it. However I went back in March cause my lungs weren't great and I had a bad asthma attack. They put me on prednisone, nasonex, and symbicort. As well as my rescue inhaler and allergy meds. I also cut back on smoking weed, and did cardio. Started with 10 minutes of cardio in the morning and some calastyetics, and then pumped it up over time. However even when I got to 30 minutes of cardio every day my lungs STILL didnt feel at 100% for a while.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-05 09:04:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all! I've never woodworked before, and I really want to get into it. This may not TECHNICALLY woodworking, so if I'm in the wrong sub, please let me know. I want to make a table like this one: https://preview.redd.it/c5e9eb1h02351.png?width=564 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=34801e50b3a2312395fcdbb656259766f761d961 I'm thinking of going to the lumber yard near me, picking out a piece of wood, cutting it, coating it in different color epoxy's to make a cool pattern, and then screwing some legs on it. But I can't seem to find a good tutorial on this that goes from start to finish. I know this is probably a totally straightforward kind of thing to most of you, but if you have any resources that would be great. Here's where I'm at so far: Supplies I'll need - Wood (obviously), sander, sanding paper, Get the wood, get it cut, and then sand it... but I've never sanded anything before. Is there a sanding tutorial I can watch? lol. I also don't know what kind of sander or sanding paper I should get (again, I'm completely clueless) Then there's the epoxy - what kind of epoxy should I get for this project? As for pouring I've seen a lot of tutorials on that, I think I'm good in that area. Also, after the epoxy dries, do I need to sand again?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you, or anyone finds funny is subjective. All I'm saying is that this is satire. I saw on another subreddit, I think it was r/iamatotalpieceofshit, where a girl tweeted "Going to the hospital to find out if I'm having a girl, or an abortion". This was a joke from Borat, with the genders swapped, and I thought it was funny - and it was clearly satire - but people believed her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did the math for white people too between 2016 and 2019, 0.007 to 0.009 for both black and white people. Numbers are much lower if we go by police encounters, there are 10mil+ arrests a year, and 30+ police encounters a year, but I don't have that number by race. And I'm also not counting other factors, which could skew the numbers to make the percentage higher for white people. But I don't feel like looking for that data, because I've tried and it's super hard to find, if it even exists. Also the percentages seem negligible, so its pretty fair to say white and blacks get killed by cops at seemingly similar rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came here to say this. I'm a copywriter by trade, and that's what I spend most of my time doing. When it comes to creating ads - I use software to do my interest based targeting, and lookalike audiences for cold traffic. And then I have a retargeting campaign. I can create both campaigns on my own no problem. As for creatives, there are far more talented people than me who can look at my copy and get the perfect image, or create a much better video ads than I ever could. For analytics I have a friend who I pay, I just send him my stats and he can point out all the leaky buckets in a report he writes up. I don't even have to worry about this too much. So by focusing on writing copy, I can leverage in many useful ways - like writing ads, sales pages, emails, and content - and outsource almost everything else to people who would do a better job than me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For interest based targeting I use connectio and you make lookalike audiences in the Facebook ads manager using an existing list of people of over 1,000 - or a list of at least 1,000 people who interacted with your pixel. You can make lookalike audiences with site visitors, an email list, people who interacted with a specific video or page, etc. Lookalike audiences tend to convert better than interest based targeting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been running ads on FB for 6 years. Let FB do the lifting, keep the placement automatic, don't specifically try and target one platform or another. FB will determine where your best conversions lie. You just gotta focus on getting 50 conversions a week, so that the algorithm can properly place your ads, and do the hard work for you - better than you or I could do it ourselves. Hope this helps :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As long as you're getting 50 conversions a week minimum, FB will distribute your budget according to what will convert better. Often times the life of an ad is far longer than marketers think. When the ad stops working FB will automatically stop putting money into that ad. Make sense?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I Almost Died And Made An Epic Discovery In The Process</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-19 11:41:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last Thursday on the 9th I woke up, barely able to breathe, and made my way to the emergency room, they gave me some nebulizer treatment, prescribed me some steroids, and sent me home. Same shit that's been happening for almost 3 decades now. This day was different though... I got back home and my asthma started acting up again. I used my home nebulizer for close to an hour... But NOTHING happened. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a full breathe of air, and things got worse and worse. I called an Uber, went back to the ER, and on my way there it got progressively harder and harder to breathe. Not gonna lie people... I was panicking. It has never been this hard to breathe in my entire life. At the ER they tried giving me more nebulizer treatment, but nothing was happening. I felt my consciousness fading. No matter how hard I tried I to get a lung full of air nothing happened. I no longer had the ability to string together more than a few words, and I was passing out. I kept fading in and out of consciousness, refusing to pass out (out of fear of dying) to the point where I began hallucinating. At one point I snapped out of a daze, forgot where I was, and tried to fight my way out of bed. The doctor told me it took 6 staff members to restrain me and tie my limbs and forehead to the bed, so they could treat me. They ended up intubating me, and then putting me on a respirator for two days, which was extremely uncomfortable and painful, and I had to eat through a feeding tube. Needless to say I felt like dog shit melting on the sidewalk on a scorching summer day. My asthma has never been under control.... Since I was 7 I've regularly used a home nebulizer and always keep an emergency inhaler with me. I've had pneumonia every single year since I was in the second grade, usually around the same time. I've had pneumonia so many fucking times that there have been times I woke up sick, and already knew what it was. I've had pneumonia so many fucking times that there have been times where I don't even go to the doctor because I know I could just fight it off, and be good in a week or two, and I'd rather just suffer through it then spend all that money on treatment and hospital visits. But this was still by far the worst asthma related experience I ever had, luckily I was released in 4 days (stayed in the hospital Thursday - Sunday.) Before the incident I had been keeping in shape. Doing Muay Thai, eating healthy, running, but I have still used my inhaler every day, despite my efforts to stay healthy. After I was released my friend told me about a Joe Rogan podcast episode with a man named James Nestor https://youtu.be/U5o9b2RVC2E I laid in bed listening to this episode, the whole thing and my mind was blown. The man claims that most breathing problems could be fixed simply by breathing through your nose. Which may sound ridiculous, but made perfect sense to me since I have been a lifelong mouth breather, and have always had problems breathing through my nose. After the podcast I immediately bought his book, which I'm still reading (I had to finish another book before I could start - I can't switch mid book that's weird to me). Here's what's happened so far. 7 days since I came home from the hospital and started exclusively nose breathing and I haven't used my inhaler or nebulizer once. I normally wake up to an asthma attack, it hasn't happened yet. I normally wake up in the middle of the night die to sleep apnea, this hasn't happened yet. Both of these things despite my doctor telling me it would be a rough week for breathing. I'm still in a lot of pain because the tube they shoved down my windpipe was a thick boy, but my breathing feels fine. Its still too early to tell, but despite all the pain I was in, I could feel a major difference after only 2 days... It's been a week so far and I'm recovering really well. Hopefully things will get permanently better for me as I continue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Read my comment above. I have a deviated septum, have terrible allergies, and haven't felt like I've been able to breathe through my nose since ever. After two days of only nose breathing I felt a change. It's been a week now of only nose breathing and I can already feel WAY more air being able to pass through my nose. Don't make the same mistake I did. I've been recommended nose breathing before, and just wrote it off thinking "I can't do it, this isn't a solution for me." And look at me? I literally almost died at the age of 29, and spent my 30th birthday with a thick breathing tube shoved down my wind pipe. Just check out the book, and give it a try. Seriously, what's the harm?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's a few things I do that I have evolved into doing over the years. 1. Only 2 campaigns with many ad sets and ads. Cold traffic, and retargeting. (You can ad a 3rd one simply for spreading content and gaining recognition if you'd like) 2. I bid at the campaign level, not the ad set level. Facebook's algorithm will allocate money to the best converting adsets. 3. I allow automatic placement. Let Facebook do the heavy lifting, they'll know which placement will give you the best conversions. 4. Don't be clever with your copy, be clear. Let them know exactly what they're getting, and the direct benefits of your product or service. 5. This is a bonus, but I find it saves time and works better in the long run - hire someone to make your creatives. Again if you're good at making creatives that last one doesn't apply to you, but a good videographer can make a much better and shirt video ad, than I ever could.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah of course, each problem should solve a specific problem or help you achieve a specific goal. So let's take social media for example and you go with a lead magnet  gt; tripwire  gt; core product funnel. Your lead magnet (free offer in exchange for an email address) could be something like 'How To Get Your First 1,000 Followers In 2 Weeks', your tripwire upsell (a cheaper product that's like between $5 and $20) could be something like 'Generate Organic Traffic To Your Social Media Accounts to Make Up to $10k A Month', and your core product could just be 'Ill do it for you so you can spend your time banging your wife and playing video games'. You spend 80% on your ad spend going to cold traffic directing ads to your lead magnet, and 20% of your ad spend retargeting people with ads to your tripwire and core product.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been a digital marketer since 2014, and I've had several wealthy mentors who have told me the same thing, I've also read it in several books - from authors like Seth Godin and Russel Brunson. I'm by no means rich, but I have worked for ad agencies in the past on Madison avenue, have made over 6 figured a year for the past 4 years, and run my own agency. Currently I live in Thailand, and have lived in 3 different cities, and have travelled to 10 countries in the past two years, because I've been able to leverage my skills to have the freedom to work from wherever I want, based on two primary skills, while paying a remote team who can fill in the gaps. I've designed my ideal life, which is only getting better by leveraging those two main skills. I also never said he shouldn't have a broad understanding of marketing. As a matter of fact the three books I recommend will give him a broad understanding of funnel building, and different ways to get traffic, from various sources of traffic. There is a difference at having a broad understanding of a topic and mastering a few skill sets within that topic. That being said it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know if you try mastering copywriting, fb/ig traffic, content writing, video editing, Google/YT traffic, analytics, etc. You're just going to be mediocre at each skill. Each agency, and website I worked for hired me because I was a specialist, not because I had surface level knowledge of several subjects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been writing copy for 6 years now. It's one of my main digital marketing skills, and I've made a lot of money as a copywriter. Heres my suggestion - buy a course from a prominent copywriter, that includes access to a Facebook community. These courses tend to b expensive anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to $1,000. But it's worth it. Go through the course, take copious amounts of notes, and really get a good grasp on what you were taught. Post on the FB group regularly. You're also going to pick a specific niche, market wise and copywriting wise. For example email copywriting, in the spirituality niche. Once you have your niche figured out go on an affiliate website like clickbank, find a bunch of products in that niche, go through the sales letters and video sales letters for those products, and bang out a bunch of emails for those products, and put them in a portfolio - maybe even your own domain. A simple WordPress or square space website will work perfectly for this. Take it a step further and post these emails in that private FB group and ask for feedback. OR the better and more effective route is to find someone in that group, who is a seasoned copywriter, and pay them to mentor you and sit with you giving you feedback and help you edit those emails in real time. That person might even pull you into new circles, and even help get you a job. It's happened to me. Remember, when it comes to writing copy (or any marketing skill for that matter) knowledge is crap. Experience, application, and actual results are what matters most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA I have asthma, and during allergy season I can't do a hike that hard or even nearly that hard. Once I bailed last minute on a hike in Pai Thailand that was pretty much a 6hr walk in the forest, because my allergies were bad. Another girl who also has asthma and allergies, but is overweight and out of shape, actually called me a pussy for bailing. After a mile in she cried to go back, and I kept my mouth shut, but anyone with eyes could see she was going to be a problem. You were being smart the ones calling you TA are just stubborn, or virtue signalers or both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA - I run a marketing agency, not the same thing as the agency you mentioned I know, but I often hire freelancers to do some work with clients. I tend to hire the same freelancers for certain contracts, but there's no fucking way I'd defend or work again with a man or woman who insults a clients secretary. Especially if they were to chicken shit to repeat their words. I'd hear both sides, and in this case apologise profusely, harshly tell the freelancer they're never working with me again, and offer you a free service as an apology. If I were you, I'd reply to those negative reviews with your side of the story, and leave negative reviews for that agency, while recommending your new agency in said reviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know, it's been tough for them, I personally know several thais who rely on the spike in tourism for extra cash. Several expats and I have set up donation funds for locals in need, and the government is doing a decent job, but unfortunately it's not enough for everyone. Particularly these elephant sanctuaries and restaurants. Thais love their elephants like their family, and many elephant places no longer allow you to ride the elephants and don't force the elephants to hang out with tourists. As a matter of fact I've been to an elephant sanctuary twice, and one time there was only one elephant who wanted to hang out. The others just did their own thing until we fed them, then they ate and left. So it's really sad knowing that some of these people have taken such a big blow that they can no longer make a living caring for animals they love so deeply.</TEXT>

I once found a picture of a cute kitten and tested that out, and that picture revived a long running ad for a few days. Every now and then I'll test headlines, and body copy too. A good tool to do this is adespresso. And no, it doesn't mess with the learning phase. As a matter of fact it HELPS the algorithm learn better. I've found the most success by setting most things to run automatically. When you get 50 conversions a week the algorithm will work for you. The more creatives you use the better FB could figure out which creatives convert better for your audience.</TEXT>

My best friend growing up was the same as OPs friend, he also has ADHD. We started doing what OP did, but he caught on to us, and started coming super late to everything again. One time we missed a boat party because of him and that was the final straw. So the simple and obvious solution was to just start leaving him behind. He'd throw fits and bombard us with messages and phone calls (time he could have used to get ready and leave), so we started silencing and turning off our phones. Finally that's when he got a clue, and started going from 1-2 hrs late, to 10 - 15min late. While I'm typically a few minutes late for almost everything, I can't blame my ADHD for being 1 - 2 hrs late, that's ridiculous.</TEXT>

Same with sitting for too long anywhere really, but most 'nomad' working environments aren't great. Someone suggested devices to work while standing. This has helped me. So has buying a butt pad.

But nose breathing. I saw a Joe Rogan Experience podcast with a man named James Nestor, he wrote a book about the importance of nose breathing called 'Breath'. Nose breathing helps you sleep better (lots of science to back this up). Before nose breathing I tossed and turned a lot, woke up in the middle of the night a lot, etc. Since nose breathing I sleep like a baby, and no longer wake up feeling aches and pain. I still stretch in the morning, which has been great, but the nose breathing has helped a lot.</TEXT>

That was a year ago, I want to make more money again, but I met most of my clients at conferences (lost my email list so I can't reach out to most of my old clients any more), and through a guy who worked for my client but he got fired and I lost contact with him. I stumbled upon the idea of a customer acquisition coach randomly scrolling through Instagram, did some research and found a guy name Sean Ferres (@seanferres on IG). His coaching costs $3k, but I reached out to some of his students, all gave him REALLY good reviews, so I'm gonna do his course soon. He seems pretty flexible with payment plans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well for a little background I've been writing copy for 6 years, and I'm pretty good at it. Especially when it come to writing emails and landing pages. In America I had several clients, but I got burnt out, dropped all of them except one (who pays me $65k/year) and moved to Thailand. I essentially decided to take a mini retirement for like a year. I got a few requests for jobs here and there, but no one trying to get me on retainer, nor did I realize I should have been upselling people on a retainer fee. A year has passed and I want to start making 6 figures again, without the one off jobs. Previously I met all my clients at conferences... In Thailand that I can't go to these conferences. So you can see I was in a pickle. One day I'm on ig and I see some guy who claims to be a client acquisition coach, like you I thought to myself 'wtf is that?'. I reach out to him,  amp; he told me he helps copy writers and other digital marketers get clients. I googled him, I reached out to his clients who he tagged, I saw we had mutual friends on fb and I reached out to them too - the consensus...this guy was between legit and a rockstar depending on who I asked. It's my 2nd week in the course (out of 10), my goal is to make between $10k - $15k/month (I'm currently making $5k/month), and I already have calls lined up with two potential clients who want to pay me $3k and $4k a month. IF I land both of them the course already paid for itself and I will have hit my goal. It's too early to know if this course is worth the $3k I'm paying, but I'm seeing the potential so far (it's a FUCK ton of work). Many times coaches are garbage and total internet scams. Just for reference at my peak I had 7 clients and made close to $300k in my highest earning year (the year I got burnt out and realized I need a team when doing THAT much work). So I have warmer people to reach out to and more experience than most people on the course. However... There are literally college aged dude's who have taken his course who make six figures. Like I said earlier... It's too early for me to tell if it's worth the $3k, but it seems very promising.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tell them I'll write them something for free, usually 3 - 7 emails, and if they like them and they see results, hire me. If not then that's fine, it only takes me like an hour to write 3 emails. That's way less time than going through a whole interview process with multiple meetings. This is like a lead magnet/free trial. Also...have you ever had to look at resumes and portfolios? So fucking annoying, tedious, and time consuming. This cuts right to the chase, puts your work at the top of their stack, and if you're worth your salt as a copywriter you'll get hired immediately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA Tell your son to stop being such a pussy. If he can't handle mild criticisms about his wealth, despite being from a very wealthy family, then life is gonna chew him up. This is life, actions have consequences, and if he can't understand it, too bad. It's better that he gets it now before he picks on a dude at a bar who makes him swallow his teeth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, I'm looking for some products or courses I can check out. If you ever went through anything that REALLY helped you please let me know (I know there's a lot of bad shit out there, and I've paid for some pretty crappy products before). I'm also possibly open to coaching, so if you know some awesome coaches that you can tell me about please do. Hell, even some good youtube channels would be great. Trying to dive back into this stuff after a long hiatus.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Freelancer Client Acquisition Hack</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:33:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've met a lot of freelancers where I live (digital nomad here living in Chiang Mai Thailand) who are absolutely clueless on how to get work. To be honest some of them suck, and wouldn't do such a good job - BUT I've also met some decent copywriters (and other kinds of freelancers) who have been stuck with the same client for years and hit a pay ceiling. For the past few years I've met a lot of clients at conferences, but with Rona that's not possible - and I'm also transitioning with what niche I want to write for. Sooooo.... I've been learning how to find clients online and here's a sick little trick I figured out. 1. Go on job a job site like indeed or monster or whatever - and search for jobs you can do/want to do. 2. Download (I suggest the paid version) hunter, which is a chrome extension that pulls emails from a website. 3. Email the company directly with an entertaining email, which puts your copywriting skills on display. I like to offer a free trial of my work, and I haven't gotten anyone ask me for a resume or portfolio.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've never used Fiver or upwork. Last week I sent out a bunch of emails doing what I mentioned above, and got 7 leads, 2 of which I'm speaking with about putting me on retainer. I actually have a call with one of them in 3 hours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You suggest it as well? Did you forget to log out of your main account, before commenting as if you were someone else? Or are you saying I should use these platforms on top of the strategy I mentioned? I do have a website by the way, I make multiple six figures a year as a copywriter, and I've also been writing copy for 6 years. I'm providing a strategy to bypass the mountain of competition from sites like fiver and upwork - and get retainer clients, which provides much more long term income than constantly doing freelance jobs. Not to mention I keep the emails I scrape from this extension, and email periodically with value based emails. Many of them reach out to me in the future to do one off jobs (like a sales letter or an auto responder), and if I don't have time for the job I pass it off to one of my friends for a fee. To me, this is a much easier, and more efficient big picture/long term strategy than hustling on these freelancing sites.</TEXT>
