    <TITLE>(rant) I went to a slaughterhouse yesterday</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-02 02:11:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Our DxE group were on the slaughterhouse gate with signs and stuff, watching the trucks packed with terrified animals go inside one after other, then leave empty. We only were there for a few hours and in that short amount of time, I saw (out of many other stuff, with the sounds of pigs screaming like little children being gutted in the background) 1. A calf with their leg sticking out, stuck on the truck door, being forced to balance themselves. 2. A panicking young bull with his horn stuck on the door, squeezed by his mates, unable to move and drooling waterfalls due to stress 3. A truck unloading its animals; one of the cows in particular absolutely did NOT want to go down, fought with their life to climb back to the truck over and over until a worker dug an electric stick to make them jump down, and was made to walk to their death along the others. At that point I started weeping, which triggered other activists to also cry, and the guard at the gate started laughing at us as if it was the most hilarious thing! And telling us "that's the way god intended it to be". By the way, right by the other side of the road, all while we tried to comfort those animals who were on their way to their death... a woman was petting and hugging her happy dogs, not a care in the world. Left side: cute doggies!!!!!! Right side: yummy food!!!! So fucked up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...when you purposely ignore how all recent studies say veganism is necessary for the enviroment, good for your health, and the most moral option. *Just because of your own baseless personal feelings.* I just ugh, it irritates me to no end how meat eaters mock ignorant people who deliberately ignore science and facts and harm people around them in the process... but turn around and do the exact same. "The WHO labeled meat as carcinogenic? I mean, isn't *everything* considered carcinogenic these days anyway lol?" "I know it anhiliates billions of animal life and endangers millions of human lives, but I just like the taste it gives *me* and it's what I feel is right for *me*..." "Cows have to give birth to produce breastmilk? smh, look at those vegans again with their propaganda! (a cattle rancher told me this is just vegans spreading misinfo. #128513;)" "uh, yeah, studies say that cattle ranching is destroying the amazon but UHH... THERE IS NO ETHICAL CONSUMPTION UNDER CAPITALISM. checkmate veegunz " "Okay, animals might have the exact same nervous system as us humans, but WHAT IF plants have magical, spiritual connections (that have yet to be discovered by science) that allow them to feel just as much as a puppy does?" We'll just keep seeing more and more news and studies on how the ocean is getting emptied, how marine wild life is dying more and more due to fishing nets and litter, how more wild species die due to land being cleared for raising cattle, the amazon diseappearing, more studies urging people to go vegan... and people will just keep making more and more baseless excuses to not lift a finger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She arrived january 1st. A tiny fluffy yellow mutt with white freckles on her nose. Someone found her on a highway in the middle of nowhere and my mom decided to give her a home. I was hesitant but Morgan quickly earned our hearts. Smart girl learned tricks so fast and loved jumping to your lap like a cat. Never tore any stuff aside of some underwear. Such a well behaved baby! We just had a happy, normal walk day on tuesday and then two days ago she starts seizing nonstop and acting out of her. Her liver wasnt working. At the end she was stuck in an eternal seizure  amp; we took the difficult decision to let her go. I dont have many friends and ive posted about her loss in social media  amp; have barely gotten any response. Nobody has told me any 'sorry for your loss' or cared at all. I feel devastated and alone. I need please someone to aknowledge her existence and loss. I feel like Im on my own on this. I miss her so much. She was a light on my life and I couldnt save her. She trusted us and I feel like Ive failed her. I burst into tears when I think about how her toy will never be played with anymore. She was only a baby and she didnt have a chance. The disease was inherited and no one could have suspected it. I keep thinking I'll wake up from this nightmare. Everything was alright just a few days ago. ------------- edit: you're all amazing, thank you so much for the love. In the middle of this pain it genuinely means so much that other people know that she was existed. Thank you.</TEXT>

Bet ya jealous those artist can get such attention over 'cringy' stuff while the only way you can get even a crumble of that attention is by taking screenshots of tweets for a couple orange arrows. Even posting times and hours of when you'll do so, because of course, everyone is **dying** for such **incredible** content you provide. Can't think of anything lamer or cringier.

    <TEXT>I think it's just lame how a sub that could potentially be funny is just harassment hub for artists minding their own business. It's always the same two or three people reposting and ganging up on the same artists because of 'dark' fictional concepts. Who cares if someone wants to use their hard earned skills by drawing jotaro being fucked by a dolphin? Is that really grounds to harass someone? Do you seriously not have any interest that could be labeled as 'weird', maybe some strange hentai genre or a violent videogame you enjoy? Calling fictional concepts "bestiality" and "pedophilia" screams 'puritan mom who thinks grand theft auto causes real life violence".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's okay, I completely understand. The fear of being called out for defending that type of content is big, but do you really think we should cause this grief to other people, too? If fandom climate is shitty, why not start by being kind ourselves? You don't have to be the most vocal advocate, you can do your part by not inciting harassment like this. Again, I get that you didn't want to do harassment, but the artists are getting it regardless. Some of them *may or may not* be friends of mine, actually, and they *may or may not* be having a shitty time due to the harassment your posts have caused to them. I'm glad that we do think alike though, regardless! You sound like a very nice person despite everything. I'd really encourage you to think about this. Take care!</TEXT>

If you can't separate fiction from reality and seriously are unable to understand that just because someone enjoys a fictional concept it doesn't mean they want to act on it in real life, you are at the understanding level of a child, and no different than a puritan mom who thinks that their kid playing FPS means they'll become a school shooter.

    <TEXT>**eggs**: Hens have been bred to overproduce eggs, which leads to de nourishment of calcium and other nutrients that the hen needs. Laying extra eggs also apply pressure to the egg-laying organs which cause premature death. By consuming eggs, even  #8220;farmed raised #8221; and backyard ones, you are telling others that it is ok to consume eggs, so long as the hens are treated in a way that you are comfortable with. **honey** Due to the immense demand for honey, bee-keepers have to take short cuts to keep up with production quotas and end up harming the bees in the process. Bees won #8217;t make honey unless they have a queen, so to stop the queen flying away and leaving the hive her wings are often cut or pulled off. She is artificially inseminated repeatedly (therefore denied natural mating behaviour) and to extract sperm to impregnate her with, the male bees are crushed/squeezed to death until their reproductive organs pop out and the sperm can be taken. Queen bees can live to be 5 years old but are usually killed and replaced every 1-2 years. New queens are transported long distances and are often roughly handled, damaged or even killed in the process. Whole hives are also transported from place-to-place which is distressing for the bees and confuses their natural navigation system. In large-scale honey farms before winter the bee-keepers will often take 100% of the honey and replace it with a cheap, watered down sugar substitute which is not as good for the bees or, if that option is too costly, they are simply all killed off via gassing and replaced with new bees in the spring. https://katelouisepowell.tumblr.com/post/124587891449/as-a-vegan-do-you-eat-honey-and-if-no-whats-so</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, its no good to apply hypotheticals when it comes to discussing whether if its okay to exploit sentient beings. OP is already using this hypothetical to justify supporting harm to actual beings.  gt; so if we all stop buying honey then bees will disappear. the species of bee used for honey production (Apis mellifera) are not even close to being endangered and the honey industry only helps increase numbers of these domestic honey bees, not wild bee populations. This is a big problem since these domestic bees they exploit for honey are actually extremely threatening to wild bees populations, wild bees that are better pollinators and are crucial to the environment. https://m4w.tumblr.com/post/184270378713/severelynerdysheep-ellesmalbec#notes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the 'remember the human' in the comment box, meanwhile everyone is cheering about potentially killing humans because they don't agree with killing sentient beings? As if half of reddit wouldn't gladly be protesting as well if it were 'cute doggos' or 'tiny puppers OwO' the ones who were on their way to slaughter. Dogs, pigs, cows, cats; due to their identical nervous system, they all got the same ability to feel and there's no moral difference between killing either of them. But hey, I guess 'lol chicken tendies!!!!!' are good enough of an excuse to mass kill sentient beings and run over humans. But sure, vegans are the inconsiderate weirdos. Alright then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm happy to see such a strong movement for black lives, though I wish we could do without those comparisons. The amount of beautiful art I've seen in favour of the movement is inspiring, but there's also so many portraying pigs being beheaded or tortured as anti-cop symbolism, and I can't help but being disappointed. Pigs can be gentle and friendly, love being pet and scratched, the ones at the sanctuary I volunteer at will nudge at you with their snouts until you give them attention. Fuck cops and the system they belong to. Pigs would never!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>****TRIGGER WARNING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE**** For context, I was raped at 4-5 by a then step uncle, then molested several times by his brother, my then step father, all while my little sister (his daughter) was in the bed too. I was 12. I told my mom but all she did was made him apologize and he kept visiting our place like it was nothing. My sister wasnt made aware of this, all to keep the peace. Fast forward to today, I'm 24 and living with my 19yo sister. my mom will ocassionally bring up my abuser and i'd be obviously uncomfortable and such. the other day she brought us a dish and it was delicious! all my sister and I could say is that we needed more! This was all under the impression that the cook was her current boyfriend. Surprise! Today the food place calls me and it's the goddamn restaurant where my pedophilic molester works! That means my mom has been talking to him. And that I just paid money that will go to the salary of someone who to this day shows up in my dreams trying to sexually abuse me. I want to die! I don't want to cut off my mom from my life because shes probably the only person aside of my sister who cares about me. I've cut off all of the rest of my family already for unrelated reasons. I'd be alone in life. But I also can't live with this anymore. I can't. I need to bring it up to her and I don't know how. I want to write some long ass letter explaining this to her, ask her to keep her distance while we sort things out. I feel guilty for not having brought it up before. I'm so fucking tired. What kind of mother gets a call from their child in tears, asking to come home because shes been sexually assaulted AGAIN, and that mother just remains buddies with said pedophile? Guess what my lunch is gonna be lmao! That is, if I manage to eat with how much I fucking want to cry right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't stop laughing at the mental idea of "the food comes out exactly the way it was ingested". Like they legit thing instead of a turd it'll come out celery? That's ridiculous. "This effect is usually among +5 year vegans who have depleted their body's nutrition stores" starvation doesn't take years. If you're eating a shit diet you'll be starved within weeks and months, not **five whole years**. My whole irl vegan circle are people who have been vegan for over 5, sometimes 10 years and their bodies "haven't bee depleted of nutrition stores". I've been vegan for six years and my bloodwork comes out perfectly. OP: if you're believing this, you're not being properly informed about veganism. Please consider looking for diet advice from other vegans and watching documentaries, because if a reddit comment like that is enough to make you reconsider long term veganism, as long as you don't educate yourself, you'll end up quitting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gonna agree with this; from a poor place in south america, I grew up on a lentils rice and beans diet, maybe some potatoes, texturized soy (about 3 times cheaper than meat) or plantains thrown in there every now  amp; then. I've grown to absolutely loathe lentils, only now I'm learning to like rice and beans again. It's just a constant reminder of poverty. I think it's good to recognize that yes, poorer places may stick with a plant based-ish diet so that's a good argument against the "veganism is classist!!!!" bs... but also it's not really a diet I'd advocate to sway people towards veganism. Odds are the people making those arguments can afford some faux meats and cheese or fancier fruits and veggies which will actually make their diet enjoyable!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-16 19:38:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>TW: CSA Please remember that lots of women who hear you say stuff like that are child sexual abuse survivors themselves, and it's absolutely horrid to hear "the only reason anyone would find you attractive is because they remind you of a child". "Only perverts would be into you". "Your body is just wrong". It doesn't matter how flat, or short, or thin, or petite a woman is, it doesn't matter if she dresses with "childish" dresses, an adult woman is an adult woman, she's not "child coded", she's not "cattering to pedophiles", it's not "pedophile culture" that men can find us attractive. Pedophiles aren't attracted to adult women on pigtails, they're attracted to kids. If attraction to kids could also apply to women, there would be no need to even exploit children for sexual acts on camera; they'd just hire short flat women for videos. Please stop calling us "child-like" for features we can't help. It's incredibly hurtful. Moreso if you preach body positivity or whatever, you're doing the exact opposite of it. **editting to add** that I 100% disagree that women with my body type being sexual in porn can normalize pedophilia. Please realize how popular incest categories are, and despite it, incest remains as one of the biggest taboos in real life. If it's involving a consenting adult woman, it's not even remotely pedophilia. "but it's still creepy for men to be attracted to girls who look younger"; There are teens who look +18, is it suddenly not pedophilia to pursue them because of their looks? The little toddlers at child pageants made to look as older women for older people's entertainment (gags), does it stop being pedophilia because "they don't look child-like"? Pedophilia is the attraction to children. An adult woman isn't a child. Attraction to an adult woman, no matter how she looks, if she shaves, if she's flat, is not pedophilia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but I will say that dressing childish (like popular egirls) and doing the voice stuff is child coding and normalizes pedophilia. Pedophilia is attracton to children. An adult dressing childish or having a high pitched voice (which I happen to have too) isn't catering to pedophiles for the basic reason that they're not a child. A woman can dress with diapers and a bib even, yet at the end of the day that's the body  amp; mind of a grown woman, not a vulnerable child being coherced, manipulated  amp; forced into sex acts which is what pedophiles are attracted to. Porn is full of "step-dad sex" or "I fucked my sibling" categories which are also incredibly popular, and not only most people who watch those have zero desire to fuck their actual mom, but incest in general isn't even close to be normalized. Anyone confesing to actually wanting to bang their step father is gonna get ostracized.</TEXT>

Disagreeing here; at 19 I had already moved out into another country, paid my rent  amp; bills, voted, could legally drive  amp; consume alcohol...  amp; of course decide whether I wanted people to flirt with me, even if older than me(and I did), because I was a legal adult. If anything, it really pissed me off when people infantilized me due to my age when I was legally  amp; mentally a whole adult. Not fond of the idea idea that women can't be responsible of their acts even after being 18. When do we get our independence, then?  gt; Plus not sure porn is what we should look up to morally and ethically wise, since every woman it displays is "cut" into pieces that are then turned into a fetish :// Disagreeing here too; particularly on reddit you can see women sharing their pictures for sexual gratification. Are they "cutting themselves into pieces" or "fetishizing themselves"? Why is it now Woke to deny sexual agency to adult women? Why aren't we allowed to be horny, to show off our body; are we really taking a couple exploitative industres as an excuse to take back women's sexual liberation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; there IS a trend of utilizing OPs body type for normalizing pedophilia. Pedophiles are into children. If a pedophile is aroused by children's bodies,  amp; according to you my body type also counts to arouse a pedophile... Does this mean I should be suspicious of every person I've ever had sex with, despite them being grown adults having sex with me as a grown adult? I sure as hell am not a pedophile  amp; could never sleep with anything that reminded me of a child. But if my ex boyfriends were into me, does that mean they were pedophiles? Please think on how hurtful it is for people like me to survive a whole childhood of sexual abuse, only for people to say my ADULT bodytype can normalize attraction to children. Pedophilia is a mental disorder, a paraphilia, they're attracted to the innocence, the idea of being prepubescent. You can't normalize it in the same way step-father porn hasn't normalized incest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but she's wrong to act like certain bodytypes aren't used to normalize pedophilia. I disagree. Pedophiles' fantasies are kids, not women dressed or who "look" as minors. By that logic, creepy men who are into dolled up toddlers from child pageants don't count as pedophiles anymore because those girls are dressed  amp; caked in makeup to the point they look much older. And by that logic, men who pursue teens who look older (think 15 year olds with lots of make up  amp; big boobs but who can pass off as +18) suddenly don't count as pedophiles because "she looks older". I don't think we should judge whether someone's a pedophile or not based on the looks of the girls they find attractive, but whether or not they're interested in actual kids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair if that's what you feel. Before 25, adults know right from wrong  amp; know to be responsible for their actions. I don't think a 18 or 24 year old should be tried as a child for a rape or murder. Trying to control adult women's sex life (even those in their early 20s), or implying that because an adult is young they don't have proper agency just feels really backwards to me. Speaking about science, the psychologic outcome of young adults not given agency by their parents is not really a good one. Toddlers can't control their rage until a certain age, but that doesn't mean we should allow them to rage away. They are, after all, being prepared for a future life on their own. Same with young adults. Just because someone still has some growing to do doesn't mean they need to be their hands held  amp; kept in a bubble from potential harm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think "buying responsibly" sounds nice, but even registered breeders have their issues. When a puppy is born and they deviate from the breed, or is born with a congenital defect, or seem to have behavior "defects", they're usually euthanized. My friend's dog is a cairn terrier who was born white (and undesired colour) and they got to convince the breeder to adopt her out to my friend instead of euthanasia; same with a family member who took in two rhodesian ridgebacks who were born without ridges. Those english bulldogs puppies who can't even run around and play without collapsing from not being able to breathe also come from registered breeders, too. I say this as an absolute nut for dog breeds, I get people's wants for purebreed dogs, some breeds are just stunning and temperaments that seem perfectly tailored to you. But it's really not fair to treat sentient beings as commodities and bring them into existence to buy them when there are so many others who already exist and would likely be as good of a match (sure, not always, but even then we should really not feel entitled to own anyone).</TEXT>

Sexual assault is traumatic, having a natural reaction to it isn't "being exceptionally inappropriate".

    <TEXT>If it was an honest mistake, that's fine, it's great to hear that you'd never eat your chickens, too. Even the fact that you've given them names  amp; such, you sound like a genuinely kind person. I'd encourage you to educate yourself  amp; find more info on how the chickens you fed to your chickens were abused (+eggs, too); it's standard procedure for chicks to have their beaks burned when female, and to be ground up when male because they're of no use for the meat/egg industry. Female hens are fattened, hung upside down  amp; have their throats slit while fully conscious. I highly recommend dominion, earthlings, or cowspiracy on netflix. Those chickens are also deserving of kindness  amp; to have their lives respected.</TEXT>

Why can't I then keep them from consuming eggs, which are to blame for millions of baby chicks being ground up alive every hour worldwide? If my kid kicks the shit out of my poodle because they find it funny, should I allow them to do so because "they should be able to have fun with what they choose"? No? Then why should I be okay with them contributing to cows, pigs, fishes, turkeys, etc being killed?  gt; within reason. True. And abusing animals unnecesarily is out of reason.

But you were a just a kid, and it doesn't seem like you had any bad intention, or even knew you were doing anything sexual. I think you could benefit from therapy. But please, please don't kill yourself over this. A child opening her shirt to another kid and quickly apologizing when theyre uncomfortable is very, very different from a grown up family member taking advantage of you  amp; sexually exploiting you. You're not a bad person.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Science has long established that gender is defined by the brain, no genitalia. Trans women's brains match much more closely cis women's brains than cis men's. Google David Reimer, dude lost his penis during a botched circumcision as a child  amp; his parents decided to raise him as a girl instead. He ended up identifying as a male anyway when he grew up, but the whole thing fucked him up so much he ended up killing himself. So genitalia or the way you're raised is definitely no indicator of gender, at least according to science. Only brain is.</TEXT>

Do you have access to rice, beans, potatoes, veggies, grains? It's very likely you don't have to kill any animals to be healthy. I've been vegan on a mostly rice, grains  amp; veggies diet (I'm pretty poor for any fancy vegan alternatives, also living in a shitty poor af latin american country), I suplement B12 every now  amp; then,  amp; I haven't gotten sick related to my health in over six years. I haven't had any meat in over 12 years, either. It's fantastic that you have empathy, but do keep in mind animals don't really care if their corpses are "respected" or not. They're dead. They only care about not getting killed in first place,  amp; if we have alternatives to killing them... why not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Eating vegan either costs more money, or requires more food prep work Nah, I'm a low income vegan from Colombia, I rarely ate animal products even before I was vegan, except for eggs or very rarely tuna. Beef, cheese, yogurts etc are pretty expensive. My daily diet then  amp; now has mostly been rice, beans or grains (peas, lentils, chickpeas, etc, leave them soaking overnight  amp; pressure cook for under half  amp; hour), texturized soy (cheaper than meat  amp; can be fried with tomato  amp; onion  amp; some spices  amp; it'll be pretty yummy!), + some veggies on the side. My situation has improved in the last years so I'll ocassionally get plant milk  amp; some $3 faux sausages every now  amp; then. Of course they don't taste identical, but impossible meats being yummy (I wouldn't know as I haven't tried them yet) isn't worth stabbing sentient beings in the neck.  gt; I do try to purchase more ethics animal products If you mean free range eggs or meat, do keep in mind that there are no ethical ways to obtain them. Male chicks who are of no use to the industry are mass ground up like strawberries or buried alive, male calves who won't produce milk will be separated from the mother  amp; sold as veal,  amp; once his mom's productivity declines she'll get shot in the head for meat. If this wouldn't be ethical to do to a dog, it's simply not ethical period.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If you're human and live in society, you're still hurting animals. You're being disingenous. Vegetarianism actively funds masturbating bulls, anally  amp; vaginally fisting cows, ripping away the baby from the mother as soon as they're born  amp; shooting his head for veal if male, forcing her into the same fate as her mother if female,  amp; taking the breastmilk so humans can have that veal with melted cheese until the mother is so spent she'll get shot for meat. The dairy industry is the meat industry. Of course walking around means you'll step on ants  amp; consuming carrots means some mice  amp; crickets got crushed during harvest, but it's the minimal amount of accidental harm vs actively paying to torture animals. Cows need to eat, too, so harvesting tons of extra soy for them kills even more mice  amp; crickets than eating that soy directly. Your argument is basically saying "uh, yeah, I bet on dog fights  amp; attend bull fights, but so what? If you're human and live in society, you're still hurting animals!" which is ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Is being liked what we're going after in this condition? That sounds more like a narcissistic trait, If I'm not being rejected it's because I'm liked, or at least, not being disliked, no? I think wanting people to like you is a pretty default human trait, not a narcissistic one.  gt; We try to get our selves out of the way and avoid people situations, that's not a strategy that would lead to be liked by anyone. And that's why avpd can be so painful; I avoid my work, my friends, my family to the point no one likes me  amp; that hurts. If I didn't care about what people thought of me, I'd probably be more schizoid PD rather than avoidant PD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not hypocrisy though; computers  amp; phones are necessary to hold down a job ( amp; therefore, eat, pay rent  amp; survive), so are clothes (unless you want to freeze to death or be arrested for indecent exposure). A yogurt or mcnuggets aren't a necessity for most people here  amp; can be replaced with a hundred other recipes that don't involve directly killing a sentient being. I'm aware that my clothes are most likely made by some enslaved kid in asia, as I can't afford local clothes. That doesn't mean I get to enslave kids myself when I have the /choice/ not to, and if I did, I'd certainly be an hypocrite to condemn other kid abusers when I'm doing the same myself. The keyword is choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Black americans are being executed on the street for jogging, birdwatching or trying to break up a fight. Saying "we're all the same!" ignores the fact that people from different backgrounds struggle with different experiences. I'm from latin america and while black people aren't killed at the same rate, people will still discriminate, call them ugly or inferior or dirty or monkeys or slaves. Those are experiences light skinned people won't have in the same way.  gt; promoting division and discrimination. People are ALREADY divided and discriminated against by systematic racism. Aknowledging the plights of different 'races' helps us target that hatred and fight against inequality, but being "colorblind" isn't useful at all when our society already treats people as different based on their race, as much as a social construct that is.</TEXT>
