    <TEXT>If you're in Taipei I would checkout Shilin Night market. Even though its more food orientated I noticed lots of youths hang out there and remember seeing lots of clothing stores directed to the youth. You won't find a lot of branded stuff but just really nice basics you might not find anywhere else for a good price.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Need help on sizing for Common Projects Achilles Low. I've read that sizing is a bit weird. My feet measure roughly 9.75" to 10" inches. I wear size US8.5 for Adidas NMD Primeknit and US9.5 for Adidas UB3.0. It would be Appreciated if anyone would happen to know what size would be best suited for me? My feet aren't wide and I am considering between size 41 and 40 but worried one of them will be too long. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion since you are going to be playing golf with clients attending. I would still want to look professional inside and outside of work and that is having the right attire for golf. Because you don't want to not impress or lose your clients. Joggers are fine but as long as they don't look out of place of the entire outfit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know most items on ASOS would re-stock but to me considering the type of shirt and design it looks like there would be a low chance of a restock. But since its made by ASOS themselves it could be easily produced again? But it doesn't hurt to contact customer service and ask if they plan on re-stocking it.</TEXT>

A bit out of budget but you should check out [Nike Bonded Woven Joggers](http://www.asos.com/au/nike/nike-bonded-joggers/prd/6744193?iid=6744193 amp;clr=Black amp;SearchQuery=nike%20bonded amp;pgesize=8 amp;pge=0 amp;totalstyles=8 amp;gridsize=3 amp;gridrow=2 amp;gridcolumn=3) or [Nike Modern Woven Joggers](http://www.asos.com/au/nike/nike-modern-woven-slim-joggers-in-black-805098-010/prd/6428718?iid=6428718).

    <TEXT>I've gone with the advice of going half size down or going with your converse size. But since you have wide feet I would go TTS it would leave a bit of room at the top but it'll be more comfortable on the sides. Also just got my Achilles too tho I went half size down and have normal feet and they are quite snug on the side. Just waiting to break into them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since you're on the road to losing weight I would start losing weight and reaching that goal before buying anymore clothes otherwise it'll end up being too big for you once you reach that goal. Because I know you will! have the right mentality, tell yourself you want to look good in clothes and reach that goal. Doesn't have to be at the end of august. Losing weight is a long road and for some it's even longer. But by then if it's a year later you will appreciate how far you have come. It's not easy but since you are now becoming more aware of how you want to dress you'll want to push yourself further than ever before to look good. My personal opinion for shoes is to start with Vans Old Skool or Stan Smiths. If you've got the money get some Common Project Achilles. You pay for what you get and I believe they're on sale now at SSENSE. Start watching [Frugal Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyL0RJe41itDFjd70KKZIZQ). He has some informative videos like [colour blocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZazRSoLB2_s) and [styling basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrW0brSB7O4).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can't keep it under $100 but I'll always recommend [Ultra Boost](https://www.jdsports.co.uk/product/black-adidas-ultra-boost/240267/) or any shoes with Boost technology. I honestly never thought about dropping so much on a pair of shoes but boy was I wrong. The sole itself changed the way I would view shoes. It is so different to other shoes and has shown a whole different world of comfort ability for me. I would recommend it if you're always on your feet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>B is the best grade you can get for boxes on AmiAmi. I've never seen anything above B. I've ordered a bunch of pre-owned figures with B grade boxes and they come in almost in immaculate condition. The minor wear or damage is seriously so minor. You really have to be nitpicking it to consider it something. I've never received anything that made me think there was any wear or damage. The worst thing is probably some damage on the plastic mold that holds the figure because it does take some force sometimes to get the figure out of there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[CP Achilles Low Gummy in Off WHite](http://imgur.com/a/PrL6z) Was in the need for a white pair of sneakers but this Achilles Low in 'Off White' was so damn attractive. I had to get it. It's more on the borderline of cream but still as white IMO it still works well as a white pair of shoes. The 'Gummy' means the shoes got a different finish. The leather is more rubberised and has more of a matte finish and feel to it which I feel it won't heavily crease as much as the standard leather Achilles low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've only got a small handful of DVD/Blu-Rays. Just my favourite movies and anime series. I've also got quite a few manga sets that I enjoy. Just this year I got into collecting art books/illustrations. So far I've only got every art book/illustration of Makoto Shinkai's work. It is an extremely expensive hobby but it is something you can cherish for a lifetime and possibly pass it down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jeans looks fine to me. If you feel they are too tight I think going one size up would be a much better fit. I would personally want to hem and taper them to give your legs a bit more shape. Also I wouldn't suggest on bulking on your thighs and hamstrings if your calves are lacking. You're gonna end up with some bad proportions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I feel the crotch and thigh area look uncomfortably tight when standing giving an unpleasant shape and especially when sitting down. From the knee and below once hemmed the fit there would be perfect. For me, I would suggest going a size up where your thigh and crotch area are more relaxed and fitted. Then take the pair to a tailor and bring in the waist line. Also some tapering if needed since you've sized up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me personally this is what I would do. * Day of arrival spend the remaining of the day visiting Kinkaku-ji * Next day wake up early spend the day hiking Fushimi Inari. If there is still time left before the afternoon I would suggest making a detour to Tofuku-ji. It is only 1 train station away from Fushimi Inari. In the evening I would spend the day at Kiyomizudera and its surroundings and go along Matsubara Dori. * For Todaiji it really depends how early you go and how fast you spend your time there. There is also Kofuku-ji along the way to Todaiji. I ended up spending the whole day there because I got too distracted playing with the deers. If you do end up only spending half the day there and leaving at 2pm you will still have time to spend the remaining of the day in Kyoto at Nishiki Market closes at 6pm. * For Osaka personally I found visiting the Osaka Castle in the afternoon during sunset to be the best. Umeda Sky Building at night because the views at night are just something else. Dotonbori at night because its so lively and full of neon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Checkout Simba Sea Trips. They are on the more expensive side of tours because they're not the typical tourist traps that you can book in Phuket. You have to book in advance and a lot ahead of time. There is plenty to do and see in Phuket so research! what I suggest is asking your hotel to book you a private taxi. You pay an hourly rate for it. I found it to be my best option of transportation for taking to me markets, viewpoints and temples . Saves the hassle of haggling the taxi drivers and tuktuks that want a fixed rate from A to B. Sundays at Old Phuket town have a market street, best to visit during the afternoon/evening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* Feb 22: If you go early to Fushimi Inari then on the way back I suggest also checking out Tofuku-ji which is only 1 stop away. Kiyomizudera and the shopping is an excellent choice. Even more beautiful in the afternoon and evening once you've spent the whole day at Fushimi and Tofuku-ji. Nishki Market closes at 6pm so you may not have time. * Feb 24: It takes a lot of time to get to Kinkaku-ji so you may not be able to fully enjoy Arashiyama as half your day would be gone once you've finished with Kinkaku-ji. If possible I suggest spending a whole day at Arashiyama. After Kinkaku-ji you will have time to visit Nishiki market and Gion and end your day there. * Feb 23  amp; 25: My suggestion as to what I would of done is go Aquarium in the morning. Osaka Castle in the afternoon. It is just absolutely beautiful in the afternoon as the sunset shines on the castle. Then see the night skyline at Umeda Sky Building. * When in Tokyo checkout Nihonji Temple. A lot of hiking and walking up and down stairs to be done there. Also Kamakura for Daibutsu and various hiking tracks surrounding the area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me it just all came down to how I really wanted the clothes to look on me. I moved from following trends and trying to copy a bunch of instagramersto to pretty much dressing basically with some lowkey hyped pieces or some designer. I had yeezys, fog denim, assc etc pretty much all of that is gone and I've stuck with wearing Achilles low or some basic sneakers with slim tapered pants and a pretty basic upper. [Heres what I wore](https://imgur.com/a/j0xWj) all year round last year and plan on doing so for a long time. Guess ive matured a bit?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks decently planned. You will definitely need to get into more detail on what temples, shrines, attractions etc you want to visit it to. Consider how much time you will spend at one place and how long it takes to get there and to the next location. Timing is important for a trip like yours. If you'd like some tips on planning your days don't hesitate to ask I'll try my best. For your partners birthday I suggest eating at Misono Shinjuku store. Going to be expensive but it will be the best cuts of meat you'll get and possibly the best views of Tokyo too. Restaurant is located on the 51st floor of a business building.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About $50 to $150 CAD above your budget but I highly recommend the The North Face 3 in 1 Jackets. Basically you get two jackets that can fit into one or you can just wear one of them if the weather gets warmer. You'll get one outer shell that is weather/water resistant and a inner jacket that is either a normal insulated jacket but pay a bit more it'll come with down feathers for extra warmth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually trench coats won't come any thicker than that because it's just a coat to get away from the rain. Similar designs that are thicker but probably not weather resistant are peacoat, double breasted coat. great coat, and chesterfield coat. Only brand I know of that would go down to the knees is Burberry. You can researching Korean brands and Korean Online shops because they're known to wear coats and jackets way past their knees.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* VIE Hotel Bangkok MGallery by Sofitel. Just in front of Ratchathewi BTS either a 5 minute ride or 10 minute walk to Siam. The service here was great, the rooms are spacious and the breakfast buffet was probably the best I've ever had. My favourite place to stay in Bangkok due to its surroundings of shopping centres and those shopping centres house some good quality food! Plus being in the city centre it wasn't so bad travelling to any attraction. * Amata Resort Patong. 5 minutes walk from Bang La Road and the largest shopping centre in Phuket I believe. 15 minutes walk from the beach via Bang La Road. It's budget friendly with great rooms, service is ok for what you're paying but location for the price is what made me come the second time. Breakfast buffet is something I don't care if I skipped it.</TEXT>

Lake Kawaguchiko, Churito Pagoda, Oshino Hakkai, Komagatake Ropeway. These spots we didnt get to be right up close or step on Mt Fuji but they gave the best viewpoints for photos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me and my partner roughly spent just over 12k AUD for a trip just over 3 weeks. I would bring a lot more spending money if you want to buy anime merch, games etc because what we spent was just food, clothes, souvenirs, assorted goods etc. Please check with your airline and what country you are coming from about your luggage allowance and what you're allowed to bring back. If you still have kgs to spare in your check-in luggage what I've always done is buy a heavy duty postage box and put all my things that can't fit in my luggage and have that checked-in as well. I've travelled through both autumn and winter and would do it again.</TEXT>

I even hoped on the trend and gave them a go at the end of 2017 with a pair of Triple S. [Some of my fits here](https://imgur.com/a/hcoVy). What trends am I gonna go for this year? I started to really like Asic Gel Lyte III and V since I saw them everywhere in Japan but right now I'm currently leaning towards distressed sneakers. Even picked up a pair of Golden Goose Supersstar and looking to get MM Paint splatter replicas. I'm just someone that can't stand beating clean new shoes that cost a bit of money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A hell of a lot. I initially made this reddit account due to this sub and the introduction of the WDYWT thread. I liked commenting rather than submitting a post itself. I fucked with a lot of hype when I started I had Yeezy v2s, I had a bunch of NMDs. I honestly just put whatever was expensive on and was like ['yup this is it'.](https://imgur.com/a/AYIh0) Being more involved in this sub showed me having the 'coolest' kicks doesn't mean you'd have the coolest outfits. I then opted for CP achilles low but still had absolutely no clue about proportions. Like look at [this](https://imgur.com/yH8ewpE) and [this](https://imgur.com/Gea9Clp). A lot of feedback and inspiration has helped me progress. I begin to experiment with [colour](https://imgur.com/xiMAXcT) and going back to properly [proportionate my outfits.](https://imgur.com/a/74QwM) And right now my current staples for [FW looked like this.](https://imgur.com/a/UxToM) As of late I've found a lot more of my style is no longer what I'd consider 'streetwear' and haven't been active in the WDYWT threads because I feel they're more geared towards mfa. Also at one point at the end of last year I heavily fucked with the [Balenciaga Triple S and still have my own pair.](https://imgur.com/a/hcoVy) [Bonus some of my summer outfits](https://imgur.com/a/w3Kke) but honestly half the time I'm like in really short shorts with a singlet paired with some Suicoke sandals or in winter a hoodie, joggers with some GGDB to ve comfortable. TL;DR: fucked with Yeezy's and NMDs bought a pair of CP Achilles low and drastically changed my style and moved to mfa.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-27 22:20:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>3 guys in our early 20s. 2 of which are first timers in Japan. Looking to experience some good food (meat and desserts), alcohol and night culture and some temple/shrines with some hiking. What we have planned is to do the absolute basic and most touristy stuff to get possibly more than a taste of what Japan has to offer. While keeping it a moderate relaxing pace. * We will arrive at 5AM at Haneda and will spend the first 3 nights in Tokyo at Shibuya at Shibuya Excel Tokyu Hands Hotel  gt; 18 October - 21 October * Following 9 Nights in Osaka at Ibis Styles Dotonbori in Namba. During this time we will be doing day trips to Kyoto and Hiroshima / Miyajima  gt; 21 October - 30 October * Last 5 Nights will be spent in Tokyo at Shinjuku Gracery Hotel  gt; 30 October - 4 November *What recommendations and critiques are we looking for?* Would love some of your personal recommendations on some of your favourite restaurants and Izakayas in the areas we will be visiting. Restaurants with typical foods like *Tonkatsu, Ramen, Soba, Udon, Sushi, Yakininku for Wagyu* etc. What we have so far are places such as Ichiran, Afuri, Maisen.. For desserts we're typically looking for sit down places such as *Parfaits and those big fluffy pancakes* at Flippers and anything else.. which hasn't come to our minds yet. As for *Bars and Izakayas* we have a few listed in our Google Spreadsheet Itinerary but most of the time I personally think it would be best to wonder around the various Yokochos in each Ward and sit down whatever looks good but any recommendations would also be considered. And any critiques to our itinerary that you might think would be a better option for us or your own personal choices which we would look highly into too. Along with any other recommendation of other Wards and Sites that are somewhat a *must* visit in your own opinion. Forgot to mention. Would love some *Cafe* recommendations for some good coffee. I haven't found an extensive list anywhere or should I wonder to any Cafe? So far I only have %Arabica in Kyoto and Koffee Mameya in Harajuku. [**My current Itinerary that is detailed with a list of things we are doing day by day and during the day with lots of options during the evening to which we will pick on what we *feel* like**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZmiKVouNkT8sDo-Uq9wjk0AcdaDWcfmbmsStsHpGhM/edit?usp=sharing). Probably best viewed on desktop but also slightly mobile friendly. *Also will post on this post a more summarised version for those that wish to not access [my Google Spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZmiKVouNkT8sDo-Uq9wjk0AcdaDWcfmbmsStsHpGhM/edit?usp=sharing)* ___ **Day 1 Thursday 18-10**  gt; *Morning* * Arrival 5AM at Haneda * Check in our Hotel at 8-9AM. Have booked an extra night to do this. * Shower / Freshen up, check out Shibuya Crossing  gt; *Before Midday* * Asakusa  gt; Afternoon / Before Evening * Akihabara if we are done with Asakusa by 2-3PM. Will have time for it tomorrow  gt; *Evening / Night* * Explore all of Shibuya ___ **Day 2 Friday 19-10**  gt; *Morning* * Tsukiji  gt; *Midday* * Akihabara if we didn't go the day before. Might skip and save it towards the end of trip.  gt; *Afternoon* * Meiji Shrine and Harajuku  gt; *Evening* * Kichijoji ___ **Day 3 Saturday 20-10**  gt; *All Day* * Kamakura  gt; *Evening* * Ebisu / Shimokitazawa ___ **Day 4 Sunday 21-10** *Tokyo to Osaka*  gt; *Morning* * Leave for Osaka and arrive at 11AM  gt; *Midday* * Drop out luggage off and check out Osaka Castle and surroundings  gt; *Evening* * Dotonbori / Namba / Shopping Streets ___ **Day 5 Monday 22-10**  gt; *Morning till afternoon* * Nara  gt; *Early afternoon towards Evening* * Depending on time if we leave Nara at 2:30-3:00PM. Go Inari and catch the sunset over Kyoto at around 4:30-5:00PM half way up the top. ___ **Day 6 Tuesday 23-10**  gt; *All Day* * Day trip to Hiroshima ___ **Day 7 Wednesday 24-10**  gt; *Morning* * Arashiyama  gt; *Afternoon to Evening* * Nishiki Market then walk to Gion and after Higashiyama ___ **Day 8 Thursday 25-10**  gt; *All day* * **USJ** ___ **Day 9 Friday 26-10**  gt; *All Day* * Miyajima ___ **Day 10 Saturday 27-10**  gt; *Morning* * Inari in the early hours if we didn't go on the previous Monday  gt; *Rest of the day* * Shopping in Shin-Osaka / Umeda ___ **Day 11 Sunday 28-10**  gt; *Morning* * Minoo Park  gt; *Rest of the day after** * Unplanned, possibly more shopping somewhere. ___ **Day 12 Monday 29-10** *Last full day in Osaka*  gt; *Morning* * Sumiyoshi Taisha  gt; *Rest of the day* * Unplanned ___ *Would be going to Harukas 300 or Umeda Sky Building at night in one of the evenings and also Spa World* ___ **Day 13 Tuesday 30-10** *Osaka to TOkyo*  gt; *Morning* * Possibly catch Shinkansen around 11pm and Arrive in Shinjuku at 2-3PM to Check-In  gt; *Evening* * Explore all majority of Shinjuku ___ **Day 13 Wednesday 31-10**  gt; *Morning* * Ueno  gt; *Afternoon* * Akihabara? * Hang around Tokyo Station and surrounding. Sightseeing and shops? Ramen Street? * If bothered Yokohama for China Town  gt; *Evening* * Koenji and Nakano ___ **Day 14 Thursday 1-11**  gt; *All day* * Sightseeing Mt. Fuji and Onsen at Fuji Five Lakes. Have a booking at Yamadaya Hotel.  gt; *Evening* * Most likely tired and will base around Shinjuku **Day 15 and 16 Friday / Saturday 2nd and 3rd of November** *Our last 2 full days in Tokyo*  gt; *Unplanned* * So far our last 2 days are unplanned and don't think we'd be in the mood for any day trips on the outskirts of Tokyo by then * Most likely we'll revisit some wards. Do some more shopping and eating around. *Any new recommendations I should consider, please advise* * Will be spending one of our Evenings in Ginza for some nice A5 Wagyu * Roppongi (Maybe) heard it is quite the tourist trap and overly priced cover charge or table something? ___ Did not expect my post to be this long and quite of a write up myself. *Forgot to mention what will the weather be like? Since its Autumn just a light jacket / sweater and pants most of the time?* Every comment, recommendation and personal experience will be highly appreciated. Thank you. **TL;DR** would love recommendations for **desserts, sit down cafe and dessert places. Wagyu beef, noodle dishes, coffee and bars / Izakayas** that you personally recommend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We sort of didn't want to bring our luggage down to Hiroshima then back to Osaka just for a one night stay / 2 day trip. And seeing Hiroshima and Miyajima in one day feels to tight and long. Plus we wanted to spend as much as time at the peace memorial park and museum along with the Shotengai that's close by. For Miyijima we wanted to spend the day hiking up Mount. Misen. I have looked at Nikko but no Karuizawa. What would you prefer out of those two and what are some of your favoruite attractions from both of them? I'm quite intrigued with the bridge in Karuizawa though. I'll keep on note on both of them and see how we feel towards the end of our trip if we want to do a day trip to those places. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ohh.. I guess your idea isn't bad. It was just in my mind the whole time we wanted to spend majority of our evenings in Dotonbori or somewhere in Osaka with lots of night life. And the long train rides to Hiroshima would help us recover from our nights with alcohol. When googling Karuizawa I saw this [image](https://www.ampersandtravel.com/media/490447/Karuizawa-Japan-3-.jpg?mode=crop amp;quality=95) and was heavily intrigued by it. But after seeing Shinkyo Bridge I think I'm quite set with Nikko. I would assume you have to take a car if I wanted to go to Okunikko after seeing Shinkyo bridge? There wouldn't be a hiking trail?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would still advise for express pass no matter what the crowd predictor said. I went in the middle if January this year and the 25th of last month. Wait times averaged 100 minutes to 120 minutes for the most popular attractions like Harry Potter, Dispicable Me, Flying Dinosuar etc. Even rides like Spiderman, Jaws, Jurassic Park still had an average of 40 minutes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you thought about a private tour? I've been on one of those tours and it's honestly not the best experience let alone going up to the 5th station where you can't really get a good view or photo of Mt. Fuji instead when you look up to see Mt. Fuji you'll be blinded by the sun at the same time. The boat ride on Lake Ashi and Oshino Hakki was both underwhelming with flocks of tourists everywhere. But going up Komagatake Ropeway and seeing the views was honestly breathtaking. I did a private tour on my recent trip which I could decide on what I wanted to do for the day. It is pricey which costed about $900AUD for three people which included a guide and a private van that picked us up from our hotel and dropped us off in Tokyo. They were also able to book us a private onsen session for the day which had a spectacular view of Mt. Fuji. If you're more interested, please do message me for further inquires. 3: I would say its pretty family-friendly. A lot of animated girls on big billboards and what not but nothing that is too explicit for adult content. Anything that is R18 related would explicitly say its for adult content before you enter or its behind some curtains. 4: Very bad if you're travelling with a 12 year old. Especially on the Yamanote line or basically any other line. But I would say its worth to experience it just once if you're interested.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know any other private onsens besides the one I went to which was my first experience. It was at Yamadaya Hotel at Fujikawaguchiko. It costs 3000 yen per hour and extra 200 yen to rent a towel. Avoid between 7:30AM and 9:30AM then 5:00pm and 7:30PM.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could probably hit all the major popular wards among tourist in under 5-7 days honestly. Throw in a few day trips to see Mt. Fuji, Kamakura or Nikko too and you'll still have plenty of time. 2.5 weeks for just Tokyo is plenty of time imo.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questions before buying a Fury Edge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-30 09:59:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Fury Edge will be my first vape and first time smoking from a vape. I usually smoke with my partner and almost never by myself. So Ive got a few questions. 1. How do I know when theres no more to vape or do I keep vaping until the 5 minutes has finished? If the capsule is finished before the 5 minutes, how does the device reset? 2. When Im done with one of the dosing capsules. Can I just replace it with another and start up the vape again? Or do I have to wait for it to cool down before continuing another capsule? I think 1 capsule will not be enough for 2 people. We usually get pretty well baked from a .75g joint 3. Lastly, how odorless is this device? Id like to try vape in my room by the window. Cheers</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Joint with no tobacco. Is it a common thing for a joint to be mixed with tobacco? I just use RAW Cones and pack my goods into. No mixture but definitely a different high to a bong. Not too keen on the Dynavap where I have to work for it to heat up and Im not too keen on getting a heater for it. Reason I wanna try vaping is to be a bit more discrete than to have a whole set up.</TEXT>
