    <TITLE>Were there any periods of your life where you were actually skeptical of astrology?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-07 03:28:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>And what was it that converted you? For the majority of my life, I never really engaged with astrology beyond curious amusement (without any actual belief or conviction). There was always an underlying skepticism involved. One day, I met a new colleague that I had this amazing, in-depth conversation with. At one point in the conversation, she paused and said  #8220;I #8217;ve been talking to you for about two hours now, so I think I know you well enough to guess your sign. #8221; She got both my sun sign and moon sign correct very first attempt. Her deductions and reasoning were mindblowingly accurate, and was enough of a catalyst for me to at least consider the validity of astrology as a study.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a simple/lighthearted post to show some appreciation and distract from the peripheral craziness we #8217;re experiencing! Anyway, here #8217;re my favorites: Fire: Aries (I absolutely love the pure-heartedness, independence, and catalytic energy that y #8217;all exhibit. Also the fact that you #8217;re usually down for ANYTHING have made you guys such amazing friends in my book :)) Air: Gemini (Lighthearted, intelligent, and stimulating! Conversations with Gemini-heavy people are one of the most FUN things to indulge in, in all their mercurial magic and cerebrality!) Water: Pisces (I notice that even the youngest representatives of these natives have such insight/wisdom beyond their years. Pisces people often have an unrivaled knack for making the people around them feel loved and special) Earth: Cappies (Your deadpan roasts are my guilty pleasure and I #8217;ll take them ANY day of the week  #128524; Jokes aside, Caps are so inspirational in their own right, and to have a Capricorn genuinely see the potential in you is the most flattering feeling!) This Taurus loves y #8217;all  #129392;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leo Risings are generally regarded to be the very embodiment of the  #8220;confident, outgoing, and charismatic #8221; archetype. However, as a Leo Rising, I #8217;m actually pretty introverted/reserved and that description honestly feels so far from the truth sometimes! I remember a colleague once tried to guess my rising sign, and she literally had to go through the ENTIRE list of the 12 signs before finally realizing that Leo was the only one left, and she looked at me dumbfounded lol. For those of you who have the placement, do you fit the image of a Leo Rising? And since it #8217;s typically seen as one of the most  #8220;obvious #8221; risings to detect in people, are you usually able to tell when you #8217;re in the presence of one?</TEXT>

Decans and their influence on personality seem to have a fairly ubiquitous presence in astrological literature/websites though. Do you incorporate decans in your chart analysis, or do you think their bearing on personality is negligible?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help with finding the name of this esoteric aspect</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 21:23:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I recently read up on this one aspect but completely forgot the name of it; it seems to be more esoteric in nature rather than the commonplace aspects like square, semisextile, etc. This aspect has been described by others as a  #8220;shadow self #8221; or  #8220;mirror #8221; aspect (but it #8217;s not an opposition). It basically functions by starting in between Cancer and Gemini, and from there on out it radiates outwards to create  #8220;mirror #8221; associations between the signs. These would be each of the sign pairings for this aspect: - Gemini-Cancer - Taurus-Leo - Aries-Virgo - Pisces-Libra - Aquarius-Scorpio - Capricorn-Sagittarius I #8217;ve also heard the terms  #8220;parallel #8221; and  #8220;contra-parallel #8221; associated with this aspect, if that helps narrow anything down Any help in finding the name of this aspect would be much appreciated, thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Beautiful way of describing it :) I feel like a lot of Scorpio moons experience the phenomena of feeling deeply  #8220;scorpionic, #8221; yet noticing they #8217;re fundamentally different than Scorpio suns pretty early on. We tend to experience Scorpionic energy in a really intense/concentrated form (similar to Scorpio Mars people imo).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Loved this insight! Now that I #8217;m looking at her chart, I agree that Aquarius rising seems to be accurate for a number of reasons. I can see why people chose it; the concentration of planets in the upper hemisphere is a pretty typical marker of celebrity charts since it tends to generate people with very popular public personas (pardon the alliteration lol). And yes I #8217;ve heard of air-sign eyebrows haha (ever since I first read the eyebrow theory on r/astrology I #8217;ve been on the lookout to verify it in real life lol) and I agree her brows look Aquarian. She #8217;s also grown into having the more square-shaped jawline that #8217;s associated with fixed ascendants. Aside from appearance, one thing that particularly stuck out to me was her Chiron in the 4th. It makes sense in the context of the continual problematic (and probably karmic af) ties she has with her brother</TEXT>

The chart generated from her being an Aqua rising seems convincing and draws a lot of real-life parallels This is just an aside but since we #8217;re discussing Nicki this reminded me of something a friend and I were talking about last night lol, do you agree with the idea that Anaconda walked so that WAP could run?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You may be identifying with your chart ruler, which is considered to be your  #8220;dominant #8221; placement and has the most sway over your chart/personality. To find your chart ruler, simply locate the planet that rules your ascendant. Since your ascendant is in Aquarius, your chart ruler will be whatever sign your Saturn is in. Looking at you post, it #8217;s be your Saturn in Cancer, and this could bring some clarity it #8217;s thought to signify a *difficulty* or *blockage* with typical Cancerian traits like emotional expression and domesticity. I #8217;d look further into how Cancerian energy is filtered through Saturn and see if anything resonates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Highly aspected means that it forms a lot of  #8220;connections #8221; with other planets. Aspects can mean conjunctions (when two planets are located very close together in your chart, like in the same sign), oppositions (when two planets are in opposite signs or 180 degrees away from each other), and squares (when two planets are 90 degrees apart from each other). There #8217;re a lot more aspects out there; most online birth charts will actually tell you which aspects you have between planets (aspects are the colored connective lines you see on your birth chart), and then you can Google information about those aspects to learn more about them and how they influence your personality :) if you need anything clarified or have any specific questions I #8217;ll do my best to help A good intro to aspects: https://cafeastrology.com/articles/aspectsinastrology.html</TEXT>

To me, having a Scorp Venus-Pluto conjunction in the 8th would actually make for an individual who takes loyalty/intimacy pretty seriously tbh!</TEXT>

From one Scorp moon/Leo rising to another, I know these placements are anything but easy :/ but just know that with your Scorpio sun + moon, you also have have an *incredible* capacity for personal transformation and evolution. It #8217;s what scorpionic energy was born to do; the process is excruciating, but as time passes, your Scorp energy will mature, and your Leo rising will become less of a burden and more of a tool.

    <TEXT>Scorpio moon/mars person here; what helps me when I find myself in an obsessive loop is actually the technique that psychologists often recommend to people suffering from anxiety/obsessive disorders. If you find yourself in an obsessive thinking loop, the key is to redirect your attention via *mindfulness* techniques. What does mindfulness mean exactly? Simply put, mindfulness is the act of focusing on the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. Just noticing and accepting what is. People suffering from obsessive thinking disproportionately focus their attention onto their internal experience, often trying to work through or  #8220;solve #8221; their obsessive thoughts. This doesn #8217;t do anything except validate those irrational thoughts even further, which integrates you *deeper* into the obsessive loop and leaves you in a worse state than before. Instead, when you find yourself in an obsessive thinking pattern, take a mental step back. Accept the thoughts non-judgmentally, and let them go. It starves the beast that #8217;s trying to entangle you instead of feeding it. It may take some patience at first to get into the groove of it, but I guarantee it #8217;ll help loosen the grip your obsessions have on you. Here #8217;s a [link](http://bethspatterson.com/using-mindfulness-meditation-to-tame-intrusive-thoughts/) on mindfulness meditation techniques. Hope this helps in some way!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, he #8217;s a doozy. He started out under the name Passion Legitimate and would make bizarre posts about Leo and how Pluto was exalted and Leo, and every single time he #8217;d do this while also finding weird reasons to bash Scorpio (claiming that Mars is weakened under Scorpio, that all Scorpios are evil bullies, etc.) People eventually started catching onto his weird bias and would call him out, and the mods would remove his posts the day he submitted them. Then he made an account called Beneficial_Bar (one of the guys that replied to your Mars post) and started up the same old habits, hoping people wouldn #8217;t notice. He also made a bunch of fake alternative accounts that he would use to feign popular appeal for his bizarre ideas. If you go on his account and look at his latest r/askastrologers post, he even used an alternative account to comment under THAT to make his chart look special. In the past, Benefical has also been caught multiple times lying about his placements... And he had to delete a bunch of his old comments and posts since he #8217;d always get downvoted to oblivion lol. But yeah, he #8217;s just some weird guy with a peculiar obsession :/ and he #8217;s attracted to any topic that has to do with power struggles and masculinity, hence why he was drawn to your Mars post.

    <TEXT>That #8217;s what makes Tauruses and Scorps such magnetic pairs from what I #8217;ve seen, like that potent Mars energy couples so well with that more receptive Venusian energy and it #8217;s just *hot* lol (unfortunately I haven #8217;t dated any Scorp guys yet but a lot of them are hella attractive). And yeah I can see what you mean, I noticed a lot of scorp moons like to hit people with that silence + *stare* combo  #129396; I #8217;ve heard other people describe the general scorpionic stare (sun, moon, etc.) as straight  #8220;eye-fucking #8221; and I #8217;m inclined to agree  #128064; /j Moon in the 8th?

In my psychology class we learned that the bar for men is set so low in terms of parenting that any normal display of good fathering (like being a single dad, or just a good dad in general) is praised to the HEAVENS, even though women are already expected to do these things all the time. That #8217;s why this meme is so hyped up: stepping up to be a single dad is so rare and not expected of men that people disproportionately put them on a pedestal, even though there are single mothers who do this all the time and go completely unrecognized (and even *ridiculed*).

    <TEXT>The efficiency of a rectangular wing like this goes with the ratio of the span (tip to tip) to the chord (front to back).

This plane model wouldn #8217;t really be applicable on a practical scale though, since the crazy gyrations experienced at the wing tips would be too much to bear for any pilots/passengers residing there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I can tell, ads aren #8217;t so pivotal that they flip a switch in viewers #8217; minds they make them decide  #8220;Yes, I want to vote for this person! #8221; Ads operate a lot more subtly in that they establish a sense of familiarity with potential voters, searing their presence in the back of people #8217;s minds.

With him knowing that there #8217;s a good chance he #8217;ll lose the election, this appears to be a shift in strategy.</TEXT>

He knows he #8217;s not in a good position to win, so this is a natural shift in strategy. A lot of his rhetoric leading up to the election has been centering around vague jabs at polling fraud and  #8220;rigged elections #8221; to warm people up to the idea that any loss he undergoes isn #8217;t legitimate.</TEXT>
