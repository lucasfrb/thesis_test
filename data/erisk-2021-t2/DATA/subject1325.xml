    <TEXT>Its a very difficult thing to overcome. I know because I also overthink everything. As a result it has ruined a lot of relationships. Try to take it one day at a time. Be yourself. Instead of overthinking the negative try to sometimes overthink the positive. Also try to talk to him about it. If by some chance it doesn't work out, that's ok. Don't put that on you. Sometimes that's just the way it is. Although (from what you have written about him) he sounds like he will understand. I hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Love his character and performance. Happy with his ending. Can understand a lot of his issues and where he comes from. The only thing I didn't like was the Jasmine stuff. I wish they could have explored more with him and gave him an actual redemption arch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure if I should post here, so apologies. Basically I am someone who was taught to hold a door, pull out a chair or let a lady walk through an entrance first,etc. However there have been a few recent situations where I have been told off/berated for doing some of this. Surprisingly about seven time in the last few months. Recently it was a lady getting on to the bus first. I was told off because apparently the only reason a man let's a woman go first is to look at her behind. Or the incident in which I was holding a door and was screamed at for being sexist. (I honestly was just holding the door for everyone (six people, two males include) at that time. She was just the last to enter) I dont seem to get told off by anyone older then a certain age. It seems to be the younger individuals that seem to have an issue and only on an extremely rare occasion someone from an older generation. So should I just stop?</TEXT>
