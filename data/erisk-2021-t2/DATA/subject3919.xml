Looking mainly at pvm but would like to play some 3v3 kolo too. I have around 27mk to spend. Also when building a mono or omni character is it better to go for a pure power set or elemental?

It's mainly for pvm and I need some set ideas, I've tried dofus fashionista but to be honest I don't like the sets it gives me. I have scrolled both agi and int so is it a good idea having 200 in each (100 scrolled and 100 extra) and then just adding a few items which give int and agi and going for power as well? I'm really bad when it comes to building dual element sets so hoping someone can help me! Looking to spend around 4mk I have an ap shield, shaker ready for 100 and also an ap/mp gelano.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A lot of people who are high levels with unlimited funds will create new characters to go into lower lvl kolo. Unfortunately because of this it's very hard to get a 'fair' fight because like you mentioned someone who is the same level as you or even lower will more than likely be a lot more powerful because of their stupidly strong gear for their lvl. If I were you I'd just keep grinding away and enjoy the pvm side of the game, that's what I've been doing because kolo especially at lower levels is extremely frustrating.</TEXT>

I've taken a few breaks from Dofus before and I think for me it's the fact I never have a clue on how to make kamas which would then allow me to have fun with my character, experiment with different builds, do pvp etc. What would you guys suggest that I do in order to make the game more interesting? I really just want to grind a profession that will eventually start making me a lot of money in the game but I never know where to start. I play on Ily and please dont suggest quests and achievements because I know they give you some okay kamas but I've been doing those for about 3 weeks straight now and just want something else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agi cra is good at pvp around that lvl. You've got plaguing arrow which doesnt require line of sight, retreat which of course gives you that pushback, magic arrow to steal range and of course absorptive arrow for that life steal! The sets are fairly cheap as well because you can rock a today set with mad tofu cloak and then fill the rest with whatever you want. The one set I'd stay away from if you want to do just kolo is the normal blop pieces because you will have -resistance in one of the elements which can be unfortunate. Because your budget is 2km you can get some vit maged items too just to give you more of a survival chance. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm a returning player and I have a 97 RP. One thing I want to understand is the charm system, from my understanding you get charm points for fully unlocking a creature or getting a certain amount of kills right? My big question is: should I start farming charm points on lower lvl creatures to gain them quicker or is it just better to pick them up as I hunt along the way? Also what charms are good to get on RP? (Off topic question: any English speaking guilds recruiting on Antica?  #128513;) Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

Then we had and still have the ultimate difficulty, how has that not been fixed yet it's been months!! For me I get so bored of career mode and I salute the ones who actually go past even the first season because for me I just find it so boring and repetitive, not only that but playing on Legendary becomes far too easy and I've tried to mess about with the sliders but then a few games in it becomes super easy again, switching to ultimate just isnt an option because of how broken it is. What's your opinion on this years career mode? Is there someone that actually works on career? Because it honestly doesnt feel like it. Are you as disgusted as me at the fact that these people at EA get away with this shit year in year out just because us fifa players want to play a decent football game and there isnt exactly much competition out there. Would love to hear others opinions because I just cant believe how bad this game is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a 110 cra and I've been playing omni just for fun but I wanna narrow it down to just 2 elements and I'm thinking cha/str for pvp? I had a cha/str cra just over a year ago before I quit dofus and I had a lot of fun with it in kolo but dunno if it's still any good? I am scrolled in both stats and currently working towards a crimson. I know people say go single element until higher lvls but tbh with you I find playing one element very boring. If anyone has a set I could wear that would also he very helpful! (currently without a crimson but do have an ap/mp gelano, shaker, nomad and ap shield) Thank you in advance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Career Mode - What can I do? (FIFA 20)</TITLE>

    <TEXT>[photo2](https://ibb.co/qyHmVJ9)[photo1](https://ibb.co/b18x5v5) So after a month of not playing career mode I decided to have a go today. I picked the ultimate difficulty with Cutzy sliders and lost 6-0, I think I managed to have one shot and they absolutely battered me. I then downgraded to Legendary and as you can see I dont think I've ever played an easier game of fifa, I was literally just walking through their defence. I've played fifa for a good few years now and I've never stopped playing career mode this soon and it's simply for the fact that there seems to be 0 balance when it comes to the difficulty? Legendary has never been this easy and Ultimate is just ridiculous. How can I make Legendary more challenging? Does anyone have any enjoyable sliders?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel your pain. I've seen people on here saying they've been using different sliders put out by youtubers out there, I've tried them all and tweaked them as much as possible but I still find this game unplayable. Ultimate for me no matter what sliders you use is just completely unrealistic because all the players seem to have the same maxed out stats, the gameplay just feels shocking. On legendary I find that you might get the sliders right for a game or two but then it becomes extremely easy again because again it just feels like the players cpu stats are bad? I got to the point today where I was literally changing the cpu stats every goal I scored or every 10 mins because it was so easy to play against. I salute people who are enjoying career mode still but for me it's just too broken. Its crazy how EA have gotten away with first of all releasing a broken game with all the bugs in career mode to then breaking it even more with patches and just leaving it. I think football manager is the way to go, no way anyone should ever give another penny to EA because all they care about is the income from ultimate team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel your pain, I've levelled my professions but I find farming the resources so boring because of all the campers. I started doing treasure hunts and would highly recommend them. It's not exactly passive income because obviously you have to run around a little but using https://dofus-map.com/en/hunt you can easily find the clues. 10 of those and you're looking at around 100kk but bare in mind the fact that you can sometimes get lucky and get the rose of sands multiplied by 10 or very rarely 100 which is the jackpot. Treasure chests also can drop you scales and map fragments which can sell for around 500kk. What I like to do is run my treasure hunts and just collect all the resources I find for extra kama, also always have some empty soul stones on you because you will encounter some archies at some point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo I recently came back to Dofus on Echo and managed to find a guild straightaway and people to play with. I found it quite boring in the following days because of course people play on multi accounts there so even though you will find someone to help you out it's hard to actually find someone to play with. I was in a similar position because I have a lvl 150 on Echo with tons of living objects and stuff I didnt want to lose but decided to move to Ily and start from scratch. It's definitely something I would recommend, there are a lot of returning players with lower lvls so you will always find people to play with, there is also a great English speaking community If you have time on your hands then I say go for it and eventually you will make enough kama to buy yourself any living objects you like using!

    <DATE>2020-05-19 11:06:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I recently came back to Fifa. I left when they made ultimate basically impossible haha. I've been using legendary and without sliders it's far too easy, no challenge at all and 0 realism. I adjusted the sliders and it is somewhat realistic, when they attack it's difficult to defend against which is great. The issue I'm having is that when I attack its still very easy for me to just dribble past everyone and theh dont put enough pressure on me. I also manage to get to every ball before them even though I've adjusted the sliders to make it as challenging as possible. Does anyone have any really difficult legendary sliders they use for 6 mins half? I dont know what I can change to make them press me more and make them better at tackling. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the best thing to do is to just give it a shot and see what you think for yourself! I recently came back but I find myself distanced from the game and I cant get 'addicted' again (last time I played was around 8.1) and I think the main reason i feel like this towards it is the so called pay to win side of it, exp boosts and being able to stack up on runes and potions for real money so that you can just powergame the shit out of it. Having said that it doesnt mean you have to spend money to enjoy the game because the big positive now is that its definitely easier to make money and lvl so that you could even grind yourself to premium and whatever else you might want to buy from the store which back in the day was virtually impossible. There are also a lot of new features which make the game interesting to play so my advice is just to give it a shot because we all have different opinions and expectations. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Better teams easy to play against</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 00:05:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I recently found some sliders which make legendary a lot more difficult and fun. I'm playing as Valencia and just to give you an example one of my recent games was against Mallorca where I really had to grind to get a result, which is great. The game that followed this one was against Barcelona and for some reason they were very easy to play against, I mean I could dribble past every single one of their players without a problem and they were very easy to defend against, Messi was non existent. Does this happen to anyone else where the better teams are just so much easier to play against? By adjusting the sliders did I somehow break the game haha? Surely not right, the fact that the sliders make the CPU a lot better should mean that teams like Barcelona are extremely difficult to play against which just isnt the case. This really does take away from the fun and realism, not to mention the fact they had Seamus Coleman playing at right back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what you class as sitting back then? Because we edged possession and in terms of shots we were pretty much equal. In regards to the press what I'm saying is they caused us problems when they pressed us which youre right didn't happen too often but when it did we struggled to play out the back just like we did against Southampton and Chelsea which is why I said it was worrying, I wasn't just talking about this game in isolation but in recent weeks this is something that we have struggled with and it needs to be worked on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the guy is just knackered at this point especially considering he had a long term injury and he's played a lot of football recently. I did think he was frustrating today because he tried to take people on all the time and it just wasn't working out, I love the fact that he's direct but he should have switched it up today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really don't think you read what I said, I gave him praise today because he's always the one who gets criticised in our back four. Also nobody says he's class, if anything the opposite. He's a ball playing centre back and the physical one beside him should be Harry Maguire who also has mistakes in him but doesn't get half of the criticism that Lindelof does. Both need to improve a lot.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Fearing my appointment</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 20:28:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have an appointment scheduled tomorrow, essentially I had a fractured tooth which I neglected for a long time due to my fear of the dentist and didn't end up getting it fixed until it started really hurting (I know that's bad) this was around 6 months ago. So he fixed that tooth for me and another one which was a smaller filling and despite 2 injections I still felt a lot of pain, is this normal? I'm going tomorrow because the tooth that was fixed has been playing up recently, there is still a kind of hole on the side of it which was left and it does hurt when I bite down but nothing too major. I also have an abcess on the other side of my mouth under a different tooth which again isn't too painful but I want to have it sorted before it gets worse, so I don't make the same mistakes this time round. I just want to ask what sort of treatment can I expect especially to get rid of the abcess because I've never had that before. And also why is it that after a couple of injections I feel that my mouth is numb but I still feel pain, this happened on my last visit and the one before which was at a different practice but I feel like this doesn't help my fear of the dentist haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your answer! This is the thing, last 2 times I went I had 2 injections on both occasions and still felt a lot of pain, the dentist then just said when it gets too much just put your hand up and we'll stop and then go again. Am I within my right to say I won't continue until I'm completely numb?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-30 21:20:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is the right forum but I have a question regarding travelling to Italy. I'm due to fly out on Monday and I'm going for 11 days, i received an email about 'mandatory travel documentation' from RyanAir and it's just a list of countries with links to a form. This form includes a lot of things about where I'll be self isolating for 14 days, the purpose of my 'essential' travel etc. I'm actually only going to see my girlfriend so I have no idea if I need to fill out this form? Because it sounds like it's a form that would be required should Italy go into lockdown again and got rid of the air bridge between the UK and Italy. Just wanna know if anyone has travelled to Italy recently and if they had to fill out this form? It might be me being an idiot and not understanding the email haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I just checked it out and it basically says that from the 9th of July you have to fill out the form which you linked in the first post, on that form you have to declare that you will be self isolating at an address for 14 days. Another plot twist comes just below that information as it says that 'passengers travelling from this list of countries (includes the UK)' will not be required to self isolate. This is why I'm so confused</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mad how at the start the tables were completely unrealistic and ai would play their reserves against you so then they 'fixed' it by making it the complete opposite, basically impossible to win the league when you're playing on higher difficulty or with more difficult sliders. Are they capable of fixing anything without completely fucking it up?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You just know that they're going to announce Telles on Monday or Tuesday now, the way this club is run is beyond a joke at this point but we all know this already, where do we actually go from here when another one of our managers is about to be hung out to dry. I dont want to overreact after one result but it was blatant to see at the end of last season where we needed to strengthen and so far we've added a great player in Van de Beek but arguably in a position where we didn't need to strengthen - a centre back, right winger and a defensive midfielder should have been our priorities. It's just heartbreaking to see this club being run so so poorly.</TEXT>

The priority was a STARTING right winger or centre back</TEXT>
