    <TEXT>Ok,bud. You've earned my respect. And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out;for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque,unless they fight you there,slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.(Baqarah 2/191) Yeah,in today's world;that is terrifying but we should consider that Quran has written in the middle of an Arabic desert 1300 years ago. Life wasn't easy in those days and a great number of Muslims were killed only because of their religion. Okay, I am not saying that is innocent but Muslim side lost more people. Btw I am a Muslim too and in 2020,no one is killing someone because of his/her religion except that fuckers named ISIS. Sorry for grammatical mistakes bud,have a good day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Leon evet iyi bir filmdi ama bence asla tarihin en iyi filmi gibi bir s #305;fat #305;n alt #305;ndan kalkamaz. Biraz entellik olacak ama ben Akira Kurosawa'n #305;n Seven Samurai,Ingmar Bergman' #305;n Persona ve Christopher Nolan' #305;n Memento filmlerini ilk 3'e koyar #305;m. Mansiyon  #246;d #252;l #252;n #252; de Godfather Part II'ye verirdim. Not:Memento da asla en iyi film gibi bir  #351;eyin alt #305;ndan kalkamaz ama  #231;ok d #252; #351; #252;k b #252;t #231;eyle  #231;ekilmesi ve o d #246;nem beni  #231;ok etkilemesi a #231; #305;s #305;ndan  #252;ste koydum.

    <TEXT>Fuck no. Mitch stays here. MY MAN IS THE GOAT. BIG MEECH. To be serious, warriors won't accept this. Mitchell is one of the knicks' best but they will know what they are buying. Wiseman, on the other hand, has infinite potential. Yes, curry and klay are getting old but warriors can wait one or two years to have a chris bosh level player. Meech is great, but not enough to be the main part of a team which plays for the ring.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The case of Theo Maledon at 27.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-23 18:19:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Theo Maledon is a 19 year old guard. He played in ASVEL last year. I watched him last year and I think that this kid is one of the greatest sleepers in the draft. He is projected to go around 25-33 in the draft. *advantages* 1-He is only 19. He'll have time to improve his game. Despite his age, he played over 100 games in his professional career. He has Euroleague experience. 2-His stats are way better than Frank. Theo's Europe stats per 36m- gt;14.6pts-4.8ast-4.6rb-1.2stl-0.3blk-%51 fg Frank's Europe stats per 36m- gt;9.8pts-3.0ast-3.9rb-1.3stl-0.3blk-%46 fg Also, they're both French, they can make a great guard duo in 3-4 years. 3-He is 6'5 now and has a 6'7 wingspan. He can go up to 6'7 or 6'8 as a point guard. Long boi. 4-He is a decent athlete. If we compare with dsj, he is less athletic but he has much more bbiq and he shoots better. 5-We're trying to create a team culture and Theo is a suitable player for our team. He always tried his best in Asvel. He'll give his %100 for his team. 6-He had a mentor like Tony Parker. I'm sure that he learned some tricks from him. *disadvantages* 1-He shot %35 from 3 in Euroleague. They often double teamed him and always defended him well but, this is Euroleague. In NBA, his percentages could drop. I think this is not a big problem. He always can improve it. 2-His defence was in somewhere between mediocre-decent in Euroleague. That is not enough for NBA. He works hard on defence but it won't be enough. He'll get used to the Nba and will improve but things can be hard for him in his first 2-3 years. 3-He is a bit weak for Nba. He should put up some weight. Conclusion: Theo has potential to be an All-Star level player and Knicks is a great option for him to shine. Ceiling- gt;Poor man's Tony Parker/All Star Floor- gt; Nando De Colo/Euroleague Legend PS: Sorry for the bad English. PS 2: Asvel finished 15th this year in Euroleague and also Euroleague got cancelled in March. Keep that in mind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're right but I don't think that Garland-Sexton is a great example. Frank has a language barrier. Yes, he speaks English but it won't be the same. Also, he could be homesick too. Another Frenchman in the team can improve Frank's stats and concentration. Also, they played together for France in 2019. They know each other.</TEXT>

Now, we have 1,500 cases a day and I know 15-20 people who were tested positive. One got intubated, luckily he survived. Also, If we compare this year's daily death toll with other years, there is a giant increase in deaths. Sorry for the bad English.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cause Pakistanis love Erdogan. Pakistan has a lot of bigots and Erdogan is a one. And also, there is a commision called Organization of  #304;slamic Cooperation. Pakistan is a member, India isn't. It might have something to do with it. I personally prefer India in international partnership. Tbh, it feels like India supports Armenia just because of Pakistan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, there are a lot of Armenians in the area but that place was given to Azerbaijan with international treaties and this puts Armenians to the invader role. And yes, there are locals in the painted areas. It's only representing the area's size. Also, there are a lot of Azerians in the area and they're unhappy because of living under the Armenian flag. Thanks for not swearing and presenting an argumant. Upvoted you just because of that. Both sides can be toxic sometimes.</TEXT>

(He fucked up in ManU and Arsenal but that's an another story) And the only Armenian I personally hate is Kim Kardashian and that has nothing to do with politics. But you are brainwashed by Armenian propaganda and i bet you want some Azeris to suffer. No one wants a genocide to Armenians. But all of you are living in a fantasy world and you see Turks like barbarians. We don't ride camels in Istanbul, we don't kill anyone just because of his/her ethnicity/religion/colour etc. I support Azerbaijan because I thinked about the events unbiased and their arguments are more valid imo. Hello, wake up. Edit: Oh,I also hate System Of A Down. Shit music, nothing to do with politics.</TEXT>

I don't want any bloodshed for both sides but your country are doing the propaganda wrong. What the fuck is the photo about priest holding a gun? The fuck? Also, what's the point about every famous Armenian are talking about politics? What tf can Kim Kardashian know about the politics? Or what is the point about Henrikh Mkhitaryan holding a press conference about Karabakh? It feels like there is a lot of hate.

Maybe it was a genocide, maybe not, i just don't want to being blamed for something that my great grandfathers did or didn't. 3 of my ancestors got killed by Hnchak-Tashnak and I didn't blame any Armenian because of that. Cause it happened a lifetime ago. So, you're right about that. We're responsible of what we've done.</TEXT>

He is not so well now but, he was. 2-Your architecture. It's fucking amazing. An another level. 3- All the Armenians I met in person was great, helpful, honest people. 4- Aivazovsky. Fucking genius. I have no words. 5- Some of your people are bigots but you always find a way to keeping alive your culture. That's a respectable thing. (6)- I just read in the comments that Kasparov is Armenian too. I knew him Azerian and I'm too lazy to check. If he is an Armenian, he is one. Definitely the GOAT of chess in his prime. He forces Carlsen to draw even in his 60. This five just came in my mind.

But the Armenians think that this is patriotism. It isn't. https://mobile.twitter.com/armenia/status/1310165919344320513 2- It's bullshit that celebrities making comments on the politics.

They did really great in last season(last year, they were the 1st seed in the Turkish League until February) but they sold 2 of their key players (Mert Hakan to Fenerbahce and Emre Kilinc to Galatasaray). Still a good team tho. I think Qaraba #287; will take the second place. They looked so well and ready in the Legia match. Sivas will be the third.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Armenia gets the body, they'll take a photo of him and add some sweet little lies. For example; Armenian MoD; "Arman Harputyan, was a farmer in his village in Artsakh. Azeri soldiers came to his village, and they took Harputyan's food with threating him. He said "Are you going to kill ne like you did my ancestors in 1915?" Because of that, Azeri soldiers shot him 7 times, they looked the body, he was still breathing. They shot another 9 times and he gave his good soul to god at that moment. Pray for him. #ArtsakhStrong." I just made it up in half a minute. Like that Comrade Ogliyv story in 1984. People will believe it and no one would know the truth. Maybe he'd be the symbol of the "next Armenian genocide". Kim Kardashian would definitely tweet that story that i just made up. That's because it is dangerous.</TEXT>

Everyone is looking for something like that to blame Azerbaijan. They won't miss that if Azerbaijan does something like that. Yes, i watched the Stepanakert videos. They looked fake to me.

    <TEXT>Thanks bud for correcting me. I always do fact checking but i just didn't have time today to check it. Just did a quick search on Google, there was nothing. But anyway, they just gave civillians 2 hours to leave the city. That is not enough. The tweet has posted in 9.50 am (gmt +2) and the attack happened at 12.00 am. They should inform the civillians at least 24 hours ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The name doesn't matter. There are a lot of disinformation about Stepanakert/Khankendi issue. First, social media claimed that AZ used Turkish made 122mm's. That photo was fake, because Turkey does not have a 122mm like that in their inventory. Than Harutyunyan (i googled his name to write it correctly, sorry) claimed that AZ used BM-30 "Smerch" (Uses 300mm btw) to shell Stepanakert/Khankendi. I watched some videos about the damage. Not a military expert but the damage will be a lot higher in a Smerch use. If Azerbaijan shell civillians, fuck them too. But i believe they didn't.</TEXT>

Their economy is a little troubled. Not trying to insult but Armenia is just a ordinary country in the Middle East shithole except their Diaspora and their history.

    <TEXT>I don't believe the Stepanakert shelling. If the bombing really happened, fuck Azerbaijan too. But i have my reasons (you probably won't listen tho) 1-First, Aotsrun Hovhannisyan claimed that the rockets in Stepanakert are Turkish 122mm's. I dag up about it, and found the truth. Turkey does not have 122's like that in his inventory. Yes, there are Turkish made 122's but they are not the same with the one in the photo. If we look at the damage, 122 matches with the potential results. I dag up more and found an another truth. Azerbaijan didn't buy 122's from Turkey! They're using BM-21 "Grad" now. Soviet made. And i couldn't find any 122mm rocket buying from AZ. So, that's a lie. I can send the sources i used from message if you want. 2-Arayik Harutyunyan claimed that AZ used BM-30 "Smerch" in the bombing of Stepanakert/Khankendi. Smerch uses 300mm if you don't know. I watched all the videos i could find about the bombing. Not trying to insult but the damage was little. The damage won't be that low in a potential Smerch use. It would fuck the whole city up. Not just exploded cars, or cracked tiles. So, it is %99 a lie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, Armenia denied 2 hours ago. I got a lot of work to do tonight, didn't see that. Thanks for that, deleting the comment rn. About that tweet, the first two makes sense but there is nothing wrong about the sign. The hydroelectric power station is a commonly used place. Also, unexploded missles are common things at war. The attack %75 happened anyway imo. It may not have been done too. We should wait for the morning to see the damage. PS: Physics was always my worst subject in school but let me think. A sharp object which has a nice 300-400 km/h velocity can easily drill soft asphalt without debris. Think like the car crashes. If a nice orange Lambo which has 350 km/h velocity crashes to a wall, it'll drill it a little without debris too. A little because the pressure on the car is a lot less than a missle. That happened a lot. So, it could be real anyway.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-05 18:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry for the typos. We got their 2021 1st round Pick in the KP trade. And it could be our chance now. Mavs would choke and their pick would go high. Here are the reasons. 1- Injury prone KP He actually managed to play 57 games this season, but he is injury prone. If he gets injured again next season, things won't be good for Mavs. 2- Expiring Contracts They've lost some players and they won't sign great players because they're planning to sign Antetekounmpo in 2021 Free Agency. JJ barea, courtney Lee,Michael kidd gilchrist, trey burke, willie cauley stein (player option) and tim hardaway jr (player option) are the expiring contracts. They will fill the gap but there's a chance that they would get mediocre players. 3- A potential Luka overload or injury Mavs is nearly nothing without Luka. He is everything of Mavs. If he overloads ( it probably won't happen) or gets injured, Mavs would suddenly start losing. My opinion: a lottery pick from Mavs would be perfect. It is a stacked draft next year and we would get an another hot prospect.</TEXT>

Imo, the percentages are like this: Armenia MoD: %25 truth %75 bullshit Azeri MoD: %50 truth %50 bullshit I try not to buy fake propaganda, but i maybe believed some. Who knows. The land was given to AZ by UN. Not talking about that Stalin thing. USSR is gone, so its decisions. But UN gave the area to AZ. That's it. Check the UN General Assembly Resolution 62/243. Also, you keep giving unsourced news. Give the unbiased sources about it and than we'll talk. I couldn't find the source about that Georgian trucker thing. Also, same as ethnic Armenians banned to enter AZ. If you have sources of that, message me please. Finally, i am saying this for the 10th time. If AZ shells civillians, fuck them too.

    <TITLE>An honest article about your transfers from a Bursaspor fan.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 16:42:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>First, i know that my team is in a fucked up situation. We're probably going down to BAL. Please, just please, do not mention it. 1- Marcel Tisserand I watched him in his Wolfsburg days. He sometimes does stupid mistakes but except that, he could easily enter the top 3 cd's in the league. 2- Naz #305;m Sangare Idk about this one. I mean, he is Turkish and he played great both in Antalyaspor and National Team but i have serious doubts about him. 3- Dimitrios Pelkas Could be the greatest transfer of Fenerbah #231;e this season. You'll see. Just saying one thing. Trust every single Greek footballer. Erol Bulut has strong connections in Greece. 4- Mauricio Lemos Could be the worst transfer of Fenerbah #231;e this season. And it costed you 1,5 million. He could be the next Bekir  #304;rteg #252;n. Sorry folks. 5- Diego Perotti That is a classic sentence but it suits this guy's situation. A healthy Perotti will fuck the league up. Will he stay healthy, we don't know about that. That guy is a gamble. 6- Papiss Cisse I know the fact that he is 35 but he won't cost much and he can still play great for a year. Great transfer imo. 7- Mbwana Samatta The real "raw meat eater" Has potential to score 25-30 a season. But he is a little unstable. Def a good transfer. 8- Jose Sosa Not so sure about that too. He'll play great for a season but he could be overpaid in his other seasons. 9- Sinan Gumus The worst footballer Fenerbah #231;e has bought this season. He fucks the team chemistry up, he won't play well and he won't try to play either. 10- Mame Thiam Don't expect a Diagne effect. He is a normal player for Turkish League and mediocre for Fenerbah #231;e's team. 11- Filip Novak He could be the greatest attacking back in the league but the worst defending back at the same time. Idk, it is a gamble too. 12- Enner Valencia Another gamble. He could blow up and go to Germany or Italy or he could be a average Anatolian team player. We'll see i guess. 13- G #246;khan-Caner I don't really want to comment about them. They're both great. Professionals. But they could ruin the team either. 14- Mert Hakan Yandas He is still young and could improve but he didn't show much potential in Fenerbahce. Idk about him too. Has potential to make a 7-8m Euro transfer to Europe. Sorry for the bad English.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"wipes his tears" Let me tell you a story, son. It all started in a warm night in May 2010. Long story short, our current chairman is in debt himself and he doesn't have any chance to save the team. Actually, my father is a former Bursaspor board of management member, so i know some dirty shit too. If you're curious, message me and i'll tell that part. Edit: No one wanted to be the chairman except one crazy guy. That one crazy guy is the chairman now. He and his board of directors are swimming in their debts. They can't pay 700m Turkish Lira when they can't even pay their personal debts. For example, our chairman has debts to three casinos in Cyprus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Our roster is U21 team and last year's transfers combined. FM 2020 says that Bursa has 3 world class potential footballers now (Ali Akman(18) Eren G #252;ler(17) Abdullah Tazgel(16)) I want to believe it because it's our only way out. We have this Ali kid, he is dominating the league in his 18. We have Burak, you were interested in him this season. Definitely has talent, but he smokes too much. Like, way too much. He needs to run a lot due to his position and if he damages his lungs, he'll become useless. Also we have  #214;zer Hurmac #305;, Serdar  #214;zkan etc. Idk, It's not a play-off team but we won't relegate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1- A 14 y/o boy is not a reliable source. I read the article. It could be real but there are no clues about that. 2- UN General Assembly Resolution 62/243: "The Situation in the Occupied Territories of Azerbaijan", is a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, which was adopted on March 14, 2008 at the 62nd session of the General Assembly. It became the fifth United Nations document concerning Nagorno-Karabakh and the first United Nations General Assembly document on it. The resolution reaffirmed "continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Azerbaijan "within its internationally recognized borders", demanded the "immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan", and emphasized that "no state shall render aid or assistance" to maintain the occupation of Azerbaijani territories. Voted for: 37 Voted against: 7 Abstained: 100 Absent: 46 Result: Resolution adopted https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_62/243 Idk man, you choose. 3- What did i tell you about the Azeri MoD? %50 bullshit. That was the bullshit part. Also, Armenians didn't claim nice things about Turkish. A friendly reminder: Please put sources in your claims. For example, i knew that Azeri MoD thing, if i didn't, i would accuse you of lying and that would be meaningful. Put the sources. It's not that hard. Edit: why are you not replying lmao.</TEXT>

Billions of dollars, committing endless war crimes, probably causing WW3, probably being killed and probably collapsing both countries. Just because Aliyev doesn't like Armenians lmao. If you really believe this, go ahead. The earth is flat, uhh idk vaccines are bad and there is no such thing called covid. Good luck. Also, it's funny af that you think that people of AZ will go and kill Armenians lmao. You're so hateful that you think everyone in AZ is that hateful. No. Simply no.

    <TEXT>Aliyev does a lot of shit. Some good, some bad. I'm not a brainwashed puppet, i can judge his moves. Yerevan is not Azerbaijan and Aliyev also knows that. But he has to say it. If you get genocidal meanings of that, you're just brainwashed. Uhh, idk about the new music clips. Tbh, i just listened Radiohead and Iron Maiden last week. I know, a strange duo. But it goes well. No one encourages anyone to go and kill Armenians. Like a normal 21. century country. I never spoke for sure. Maybe Armenia didn't shell Ganja. Maybe Azerbaijan shelled Stepanakert/Khankendi. But you speak sure my friend and that is a mistake. I watched a lot of Stepanakert/Khankendi videos. And idk. Imo, AZ shelled Stepanakert/Khankendi just once or twice and Armenia is exaggerating it. I have my reasons, i can tell you from the chat part if you're curious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you know anyone else except these, comment it. Armenian or Azeri, doesn't matter. Sorry for the potential misunderstandings. This is the list of the Twitter accounts which posted fake news even once and has more than 2,500 followers. 1- 301_AD Has a lot of bullshit. You can check his page. https://mobile.twitter.com/301_AD/status/1314225023264190464 There isn't a bomb code like that in NATO inventory. Also, i couldn't find the Anna News source. https://mobile.twitter.com/301_AD/status/1313854624043020290 Officially denied by a lot of sources if we don't count Azeri MoD. https://mobile.twitter.com/301_AD/status/1313433300841779200 This is not the Morek base. There are houses nearby. Also the walls are not like that in the base. https://mobile.twitter.com/obretix/status/1164868171452600320 2- Paul Antonopoulos Greek City Times writer. Is suffering from Turkophobia Usually does fake news and the account over posts it. There is a adjective for people like that in Turkish slang. We call "a #287; #305;z ishali". It translates like "diarrhea in his mouth." That adjective suits beautiful on that man. https://mobile.twitter.com/oulosP/status/1301196519429767170 They demolished the church to restoration lmao. The restoration business is taken by The Muncipality of Nilufer. We just respected your culture. www.ntv.com.tr/sanat/19-yuzyildan-kalma-tarihiaziz-georgios-rum-ortodoks-kilisesi-yikildi,mvfjHkxlFEmVtNJeKMOYhQ https://mobile.twitter.com/oulosP/status/1311437545771872257 Lmao not even gonna comment about that. Funny guy. https://mobile.twitter.com/oulosP/status/1313947166956818433 A journalist and a soldier cannot look alike according to this guy. Also, the journalist is way more fat. 3- As Source Imo, this guy is trying to be a war journalist, unlike the others. But that doesn't change the fact that he posts fake news. Also, it usually gives the first account as a source. https://mobile.twitter.com/ASBMilitary/status/1313896680056594433 Captagon is like sEveRAl tAuusAnD years old bruh, didn't Azerbaijan find something modern lmao. They really believe this shit. https://mobile.twitter.com/ASBMilitary/status/1313868698571223040 Azerbaijan doesn't have a Rapier in their inventory lmao. https://tr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier https://mobile.twitter.com/ASBMilitary/status/1312856608813264904 He accidentaly confirmed the Armenian attacks. https://mobile.twitter.com/HikmetHajiyev/status/1312827586452414465 https://mobile.twitter.com/ASBMilitary/status/1312460528506163200 Lies.

    <TEXT>Aliyev's speech was rough. I first thought that this war will end in a week but he seems determined. What is the possible scenarios from now on? Is there a possibility of a regional war (that is the most scary one. Everyone kept saying that Russia is weak now but a weak Russia is still one of the most powerful countries in the world.) Or the things are going to end in a week or two?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are a lot of high ceiling players in the late first (Kira, Tyler Bey, Mannion, Maledon etc). 8th however is a complete mess. We might choose a bust, or we might choose an all star level player. In this trade, we share the risk and try not to choose a bust. We'll choose good old Cole in 14 and we will have another 3 picks in the first round. For example, Theo Maledon. I am a European and i often watch Euroleague. This kid was shining in his 18. (Unpopular opinion) I think his ceiling is higher than Vassell, which we'll probably choose at 8. Mannion, Bey and Barbosa also looks cool Edit: Turns out i need a cup of coffee too. The guy i tried to mean was Leandro Bolmaro, and my brain auto corrected it to Leandro Barbosa. And i didn't mean him lmao. That guy is bust as fuck. I was going to write Hampton. A chain of mistakes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Celal Sengor. Turkish geologist and a potential "herbokolog". Actually, he is a well educated and intellectual but he sometimes does, you know, different things. He declared that he ate his own shit in 2018. In 2019, he declared that he is against organ donation because "the guy who needs the organ might be a dickhead." And in 2020, he fell asleep in a TV show which he was supposed to talk. I mean, he is a well educated and a smart guy but he has his moments. In fact, everyone likes him in Turkey. Some think that all of this is PR, some think that the guy went crazy after years of research. Surely an interesting one. Edit: I almost forgot. The guy is a geologist originially but has two books and profession about History and Philosophy.</TEXT>

But that is war. An armed man is running to you to kill you. Will you look to his age? That is survival instincts. You shoot him. That soldier can't think about religious rights or become sad for the dead young boy at that moment. If he became upset, he'll be the next one. That is sad but it's real.

If Aliyev plans a genocide, he won't find even one soldier to kill Armenians. Please, don't dramatise the situation that much. Armenian nation won't be damaged. 2-Yes, you're right in the second paragraph. I ain't going to argue about Aliyev. He is kinda a dictator. Not totally, but kinda. I think that "you all disgust me" at the end was written in a moment of hate. Both countries losing their youth, that doesn't make sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1- We won't genocide any nation. There are a lot of Armenians in Turkey and Azerbaijan. I currently live in Turkey now,  #305;'m going to talk about Turkey. For example, one of the Turkey's biggest football club, Besiktas's fan leader is an Armenian, Alen Markaryan. There's Ara G #252;ler, photographer, famous around the world. Hrant Dink, you probably know him. When he got killed, whole country nearly fucking started a riot. I have 3 Armenian friends. I never saw them racism against them. Why would two nations which are so combined try to genocide the other one? We all good in Turkey. When i was in Azerbaijan, i didn't see a thing like that too. Erdogan has a lot of bullshit. A lot. If i start to write his bullshit or lies from 2002, the year he got elected, i'll have to write until evening and that might not be enough. Not gonna argue about that. I won't try to defend something he said. You're usually right if you're against Erdogan. Nazis and Hitler is kinda different. Hitler got elected in 1933 and the Holocaust started in 1942. 9 years of terror, corruption and brainwashing. Raining propaganda. Also, we're in 21st century now. Everyone can learn anything now. That is impossible now. No one hates Armenians except some Islamic extremists (and people hates them. They're called "badeci" for some disgusting shit they done. I can't explain it rn, you can search if you're curious) and i'm sure that your nation has that bad apples too. Imo, you're right about that. USSR is dead, so its decisions. UN and EU should sit and talk about the issue. General Assembly gave the area to Azerbaijan, but the real UN or EU didn't say something about the topic. Both nations did fucked up things 30 years ago. Both nations shouldn't do something about that in worldwide arena. I mean, a couple days ago, it was the anniversary of Khojaly. That is sad af but Azeris did similar things to Armenians. We don't have rights to complaint.</TEXT>

For example, 5th one posted John Travolta looking around(i mean, It's that scene from Pulp Fiction. Hope you understand because i fucked up while telling) in Hadrut. AI cannot understand that joke and post it. So, 5th one is not a bot too. 4th one however, is different. I still think that she is a bot. The account always retweets some specific accounts.

    <TEXT>I suppose you are an American because any European or Aussie wouldn't do this comparison. Euroleague is much more defensive. In Australia league, no one touches no one. It is a bit more aesthetic. But in Euroleague, some teams defend better than NBA. You can't win anything without defence in there. It is a bit boring comparing with the other leagues. Now, Luka had all the spotlights when he was in Real Madrid. He was the new golden boy. So, they focused on him, double teamed him, and didn't let him breathe. Well, Luka wasn't the same in that time. If we look his 17-18 stats; His ACB (spanish league) stats: 24,0 mpg-12,8 pts-3,5 ast-4,2 rbd-2,1 tov with %46 fg and %27 3pt (tried 4 a game) His Euroleague stats: 25,2 mpg-16,0 pts-3,5 ast-4,2 rbd-2,3 tov with %45 fg and %33 3pt (tried 5 a game) And he always had a double team on him. And do not underestimate this guys, a great offensive player with no defence can't live in Euroleague. He was the big deal in Euroleague and that guys started to disturb him. When he started to play in NBA, he found more open area, and turned to that Luka we know. Now that is impossible for Lamelo. Please, watch a random Euroleague and Australia league match. No one plays defence in Australia league. Even Lamelo himself waits the opponent to attack and he just stands there in half court lmao. You can't do that neither in NBA nor in Euroleague. Now, if we look to LaMelo's stats; 31.3 mpg-17,0 pts-6,8 ast-7,6 rbn-%25 3pt (tried 7 a game) Please watch this video and see the "defence" on him lmao.

    <TEXT>His style is better than Lonzo (which is not a big thing, i am 1,75 and 210 lbs but i still can shoot better than 2018 Lonzo). But i couldn't see something special in his shooting. The important thing is, his shooting choices are like shit. He always tries from half court twice a game. He just shoots and misses, no matter the place, the defence or the open teammates. That's the thing that concerns me about him. Everyone can learn to shoot. Even Lonzo shot average this season. But, if he does things like that in NBA, he can't live there.</TEXT>

But he didn't develop his jumpshot a bit and that is a problem. 2- I knew that he shot with %34-35 in a season, i thought it was with Lakers. 3- We're Knicks nation bruh, even theoreticals and "if"s sound great. 4- I meant that Julius is not a first option, but he'll do well as a 3rd option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>COVID spreads with contact and it can spread in air. We saw footage from Ganja, from Stepanakert/Khankendi , and we see footage of soldiers. No one has prevention. Which means that COVID can spread faster now both in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Also, the testing process will slow down because of the war. Now, Azerbaijan actually coped with the virus well but i couldn't find their test numbers. Last week, they announced 80-200 patients a day. But, they aren't sharing information with WHO daily, which is a pretty scary thing. Also, i couldn't find any national preventions in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is closed to nearly every country rn, which'll prevent the spreading. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/azerbaijan/ Good thing they have only 3000 active cases. But the number can increase. Armenia's situation is a little tense than Azerbaijan. They have 10k more cases than AZ despite that their population is less. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/armenia/ Armenia started to announce more cases per day since the events started but there isn't a dramatic increase. Their active case toll is increasing, which is terrible but their tests/1m population is great. Also, they have more preventions than Azerbaijan. The most scary thing is, they're open to US, which leads the world in Coronavirus cases. There are 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenians in US, and they're returning for some obvious reasons. They can spread the virus. Take care of yourselves, **AND WEAR THAT DAMN MASK**</TEXT>
