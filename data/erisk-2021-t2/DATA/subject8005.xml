    <TITLE>Why this 16 year old wants to kill herself</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-30 10:52:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Multiple reasons, but I'll start somewhere. One is that I #8217;ve failed 6/10 GCSEs by certainty because I didn #8217;t go (I don #8217;t want to talk about why) and on Results Day my life and future is going to be shattered with a hammer. I am ashamed of myself beyond words, and there isn #8217;t another option for me next year, other than my school #8217;s Sixth Form. At least not one that involves education anyway (I #8217;ve said that to a few teachers but they #8217;ve never got what I was implying). I was one of the super smart kids. I am the biggest disappointment of my Year grades-wise; highest benchmarks (six benchmark 8s) to lowest GCSEs (failing MOST). I NEVER revised ONCE in all the years. I #8217;ve wasted my education and wasted everyone #8217;s time. I #8217;m BEYOND what you call a disgrace. There is no college that will have me and I can #8217;t go to college. I struggle to make friends as it is. There #8217;s no way, college is all wrong for me. My sister is going to be getting good GCSEs. She #8217;s passed them all and is expecting a few 9s (A**). I #8217;m the biggest disappointment everyone knows. I #8217;ve let down everyone I know; my family, my teachers, my peers and everyone else. There is no happiness for me if I don #8217;t get into Sixth Form. You need 5 passes and I can get 4 at the max. I #8217;ve thrown away my shot. Especially as I #8217;m very naturally intelligent, it #8217;s so embarrassing that I #8217;ll probably be getting a 2 or 3 in English. My sister is expecting a 9. I don #8217;t know how I #8217;m going to react on Results Day when I open that envelope and my world comes crashing down. I will probably be in shock. I #8217;ve ruined my future. What is there for someone who gets, say, 2 GCSEs. It #8217;s 2019. I also believe, especially as, as far as I know, my school #8217;s never had a suicide, if anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having few friends slowly erodes your self-esteem, not that I had much left after being bullied and being the laughing stock of the Year. I never did ANYTHING to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn #8217;t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years  #128557; #128557; #128148; #128148;. If I killed myself, all those kids would think  #8220;She really did it #8221; and would say  #8220;WE drove her to this #8221; and kids at neighbouring schools would say  #8220;You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide #8221; and  #8220;A girl from (my school) killed herself! #8221; And  #8220;Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking  #8220;Oh it #8217;s (my name) so it #8217;s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and tell her to KILL HERSELF #8221; and now she #8217;s dead. #8221; No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. Also if I kill myself before too long after I #8217;ve left Year 11, the school will sort of take responsibility and will put up a memorial (I should hope) and try to remember me and do memorial assemblies, etc. I do have bonds with some legend teachers though so that would be sad. I just hope to god for my own HAPPINESS/LIFE they give me a Sixth Form place without the required grades because of  #8216;exceptional circumstances #8217;. I went to Sixth Form Induction Day and I LOVE it. That day was an amazing day. It #8217;s something positive to look forward to - I #8217;m so excited about it but it might not get to happen. If I #8217;m going to end my own life at some point in my life, it should be in high school because they are the people who started the chain of events that will ruin my life (although the bullies should know they have done that already to me). If I do it as an adult, they probably wouldn #8217;t even know or would remember me as merely  #8220;someone from school #8221; so it wouldn #8217;t have a good effect. However, if I did it while in school, all the people who hated/bullied/laughed at/teased me are in one place and you never know maybe they #8217;ll actually care about me or feel sorry for what they did when they know I ended my life. Also if I do it in college or something (if I have to go there, god forbid), school wouldn #8217;t make a big deal out of it. I #8217;ve just realised this sounds like I want to do it for attention but that #8217;s not it at all, it just sounds like that because I #8217;m writing about what they would do if I was gone which is what I sometimes think about. Also, I have caused 2 people I live with health problems. I gave my mum chronic fatigue, which meant she was out of work for 6 years, by being an incredibly stressful MONSTER of a young child, and my sister has anxiety which she 100% blames on me. I am no good for anyone. I wish my mum didn #8217;t have twins and just had my twin sister and not me. I feel very sorry for them that they have to live with me. My mum called me  #8220;the most difficult child in the world to live with #8221; and calls me disgusting so much I should start a tally. My twin sister said she is DISGUSTED, EMBARRASSED, HORRIFIED and ASHAMED to be related to me. I don #8217;t deserve anything. I #8217;m a waste of oxygen. Sorry this ended up longer than I thought. Sorry for wasting your time and thank you for kindly reading xx P.S. It's 11am and I haven't slept yet and I haven't eaten since 8pm yesterday and yesterday I work up at 3pm so I skipped breakfast and lunch  #128556; P.S.2. A bit about me: I love Panic! At The Disco, I love music in general, I love my cats, I love musical theatre, but one thing I hate is myself :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;m a PDAer who doesn #8217;t have most of the symptoms of PDA?? (16 year old female) Anyone else high-functioning?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-02 12:27:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>From autism.org:  #8220;Appears sociable, but lacks understanding, experiences excessive mood swings and impulsivity, comfortable in role play and pretend, sometimes to an extreme extent, displays obsessive behaviour that is often focused on other people, physically incapacitating themselves, withdrawing into fantasy, lack of embarrassment, language delay as a child, sensory differences, high level of anxiety #8221;  #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; #8212; this is ALL NOT ME!!!! Like THIS IS NOT ME AND EVERYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS IT. Yikes. Especially stuff about role play/fantasy, I DONT do that and never have even thought about it in my life. I am also completely sociable and completely socially fit in with my peers at school and no peers or teachers have guessed I #8217;m not neurotypical in 5 years!! I do things I #8217;m asked to do in a classroom just as a neurotypical person would. My mum thinks some things she #8217;s read about OTHER PEOPLE #8217;S PDA are true for me when they #8217;re NOT (though she does admit they are different people and have much more severe PDA than I do) and thinks I get  #8220;anxious #8221; when asked to do things and she will insist she is correct:  #8220;You DO (my name)! That #8217;s what pda IS! #8221; If I am asked to do something at school I #8217;ll do it and I don #8217;t even notice it #8217;s a  #8220;demand #8221; let alone have a  #8220;hit of anxiety. #8221; Yikes. I am extremely defensive (understandably since being bullied) about anyone e.g. teachers knowing I have PDA because I blend in like a neurotypical person and I don #8217;t want them to get Googling and find a load of stuff which they will think is  #8216;weird #8217; and think ITS ME WHEN IT REALLY REALLY IS NOT and I don #8217;t do those things and I don #8217;t have those symptoms. No one would guess I have autism. My mum even said to a professional I had  #8220;Extreme anxiety #8221; when she LIVES WITH ME and knows I don #8217;t have anxiety. I #8217;ve sent her posts written by people with terrible anxiety of what  #8220;EXTREME ANXIETY #8221; is like and I #8217;ve gone  #8220;this is SO not me, I #8217;m like at the opposite end of this! #8221; And I #8217;ll say  #8220;You KNOW I don #8217;t have anxiety you LIVE with me have I ever had any of that? NO #8221; and she #8217;ll just sigh and say  #8220;I don #8217;t know (my name)... PDA *IS* anxiety #8221; which is so ignorant. It #8217;s like she WANTS me to have all the symptoms and just wants to believe I have the symptoms as if its just easier to think I have all the textbook symptoms when I #8217;m clearly very high functioning. It #8217;s EXTREMELY frustrating and infuriating, Communication and social media wise I completely fit in with my peers. I understand very well what anxiety is and I don #8217;t have moderate anxiety let alone  #8220;extreme anxiety #8221;. I don #8217;t care if that #8217;s what the PDA symptoms list says. Extreme anxiety would affect you every day. I don #8217;t even feel anxious often, and never without reason to be... I #8217;m like a person without anxiety when it comes to anxiety haha. I know myself and I know I don #8217;t feel anxious when someone asks me to do something. My mum has tried to say  #8220;you just don #8217;t notice it #8221; but this is ridiculous, I know myself, I #8217;m a 16 year old who is very in touch with myself and my PDA haha. I #8217;m sorry this turned into a kind of rant haha. I was diagnosed around age 8 with PDA and I am NOT saying I was misdiagnosed; I am just wondering if anyone else is (or knows of someone who is) also high-functioning with PDA? :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Scared to tell people if you feel sick?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-04 01:24:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw a comment that said  #8220;The scariest thing to do when you #8217;re having a panic attack is say  #8220;I #8217;m having a panic attack #8221; #8221; and I REALLY relate to this comment (anyone else?) but also I can #8217;t say  #8220;I feel sick #8221; like I can never get the words out!! Say I #8217;m in class and feel queasy I will be internally shouting at myself thinking (about tapping a friend on the shoulder as whispering it)  #8220;Just say it!! Just say it NOW!! #8221; but I can hardly ever bring myself to say it, or I #8217;ll managed to weakly quietly say it (and I always want no one else to overhear) and they #8217;ll say  #8220;What? #8221; And they won #8217;t have heard me and I #8217;ll have to say it again and then when they understand it will be really awkward arrghhh!! Also when I was younger I could never tell my mum if I felt ill. When I was like 9 or 10 it would take me to literally breaking point of a mild illness (like a headache or nausea) to say  #8220;I don #8217;t feel very well #8221; and burst into tears. Still now (I #8217;m 16) I never tell my mum if I feel nauseous! I just never ever have! I just suffer in silence until it #8217;s over. It #8217;s usually at night as well and I don #8217;t want to keep her up and I think the reason why is because I don #8217;t want to admit I feel sick! Like I #8217;ll just think  #8220;it will go away soon #8221; and I don #8217;t want to admit it #8217;s a problem because it will make me feel worse. I literally CANNOT voice it in school though to a friend, just like when I #8217;m having a panic attack. Does anyone get me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;ve liked my crush for 5 years. Age 11 (he was 12) when we met, to now age 16.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-04 03:16:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>HELP ME. Also I know I have no chance with him. The like peak of me being madly, deeply and passionately in love with him was probably when I was in Year 9 and the start of Year 10 but now I think I just have admiration for him and think he #8217;s beyond extremely hot. I thought about him EVERY DAY, and a lot every day. I had dreams about spending time with him and because this is Confessions I #8217;ll say I was pretty stalkery haha (and I have pictures of him on my phone still he didn #8217;t send me PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISNT WEIRD). I still think of him now even though I #8217;m not mad about him, I #8217;ve accepted I can never be with him, so I #8217;m not really in love with him anymore so much as having an admiration for him and he still makes me smile when I think about him and when I see him around school (he #8217;s in Sixth Form). And I do get butterflies when I see him or walk past him and I get super self-conscious/nervous when I message him/talk to him in person. I do worry though that if he #8217;s in my tutor group when I join Sixth Form it will be it for me and I #8217;ll relapse into having a crush on him haha I #8217;m serious though yikesss. I think he #8217;ll probably come to mind when I hear his name for the rest of my life. He #8217;s had 3 girlfriends while I #8217;ve been in love with him and I loved him more than his girlfriends and that #8217;s an absolute fact. I was Eponined. I need to get over him now! Also is it extremely bad that I #8217;m 16 and kind of hoping the person to take my virginity could be him? SOMEHOW like if he #8217;s single again one day. Realistically it would never happen but I want to lose it to someone I #8217;m in love with and I #8217;ll never love anyone as much as I loved him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>College is not an option. Thinking about R\*sults D\*y/September/A Levels/School just makes me feel sick. I am very worried about what my mental health will be like in those 2 weeks between R Day and start of term. It all depends on place or no place. Sixth form place given = Now I can finally enjoy my summer and look forward to September and when it comes I'm gonna throw myself into school and love every minute of it and get so involved with like Student Council and being a Subject Ambassador and stuff. No place = an unimaginably scary thought, I \*am\* worried for my health and my life ultimately. I don't think I would survive 2 years if I wasn't in education. For those wondering, I failed 6/10 GCSEs by certainty (dont even ask). I either got 4 passes or 3. They said they will consider letting me in on 4 passes. If I open the envelope and there is only 3 they won't even consider it and I don't know \*what\* I'll do. I'll probably be in shock. I'm quite worried about how I'm gonna respond. I could be in crisis in September. I'm a girl and I am told I'm pretty and nice (i dont believe this) yet I was bullied for all of high school. It's damaged me and played a major part in my mental health diminishing. I've barely left my house all summer because I'm depressed. I need this sixth form place to save my life</TEXT>

Especially as I #8217;m very naturally intelligent, it #8217;s so embarrassing that I #8217;ll probably be getting a 2 or 3 in English. My sister is expecting a 9. I can #8217;t believe I was such a clever child and I #8217;ve wasted all this potential. I #8217;m a waste of oxygen. I don #8217;t know how I #8217;m going to react on Results Day when I open that envelope and my world comes crashing down. I will probably be in shock. I #8217;ve ruined my future. What is there for someone who gets, say, 2 GCSEs. It #8217;s 2019. Saving grace is if I happen to get 4 passes, we are having a meeting with the senior staff members where they will TELL ME if they can give me a Sixth Form place on 4 PASSES or not. They previously did it for a girl with 3 GCSEs. I have a valid reason. If I get that paper and there are 4 passes, I will be able to relax for the time being but nothing would be set in stone - they could still say  #8220;We spoke to the people.. and we #8217;re really sorry you WOULD have needed 5 passes so we can #8217;t offer you a place #8221; and I #8217;ll probably throw up or be in complete shock and won #8217;t be able to answer them or will walk out of the room in shock. If I only get 3 passes, however, they won #8217;t even consider it. I am scared for how I #8217;ll react to that. The absolute feeling you #8217;ve let yourself down, the impending guilt, the shock realisation you #8217;ve screwed your life over because you won #8217;t be in EDUCATION and you subsequently won #8217;t be able to go to UNI without the UCAS points and you CANT DO AN APPRENTICESHIP or anything. If I #8217;m not at my Sixth Form next year I #8217;m not in education. Trust me I #8217;ve thought about it for a whole year. (At Christmas I thought I would kill myself on Results Day.) If I #8217;m not in education next year I #8217;m going to have to isolate myself in my room every day to not be a problem for my mum. I really want to be put into a children #8217;s home (in order to move out before you #8217;re 18) so I can be out of this house for the good of my mum and my sister. They #8217;re better off without me and I feel guilty living here daily. I.. I don #8217;t know what to do. I #8217;m really, really scared. Like I #8217;m shaking writing this. I don #8217;t think I would survive 2 years not in education. I #8217;ve already been severely bullied all of school, hate myself and HAVE NO FRIENDS to beyond what you even think  #8220;having no friends #8221; is. I #8217;ve accepted my RESULTS and because I know what they are I #8217;m not worried, I #8217;m just worried about if they #8217;ll give me a place or not. It means too much to me. They can #8217;t throw me out, surely, but they say they may not be allowed to give me a place. There #8217;s no hope.</TEXT>

My results: English Lang - U English Lit - 4 Maths - 5 Science - U French - U Music - 6 Drama - 1 (a ONE!!) Photography - 5 My dad did Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Maths for A Level and look at my grades. He is from an Asian family that were very academic.

I felt so paralysed in my brain like something kept hitching as I tried to push against it. I really couldn #8217;t make myself write and I was almost sobbing. Was it because of pressure?

    <TEXT>I mean I didn #8217;t get the 5 passes you need to get in, I got 4 and I #8217;m grateful they gave me a place on that. But they put me on a 2 week trial (because last year I missed school for mental health reasons) and they #8217;re watching my work ethic, attitude and attendance when I was always a WELL BEHAVED KID, I just struggled with REVISION and ATTENDANCE because of what we #8217;re almost certain is undiagnosed ADD (on a waiting list to see someone). So yeah they didn #8217;t have to give me the place but can they really take it away? It #8217;s the same as a permanent exclusion  #8212; for this? This is bad for my mental health. I have missed 3 days already (school started 9 September) due to physical ILLNESS and we even paid  #163;20 for a doctors letter so they would believe me. So I had a REASON!!! And because of the attendance my mum thinks they #8217;re gonna THROW ME OUT, IS THAT EVEN FUCKING ALLOWED?!?!!! There is no where else I can go; because of anxiety I can #8217;t get on a bus to go somewhere else, and my school is great and in walking distance. The pressure is giving me more anxiety. They #8217;re giving me the worst possible start to the year. And  #8220;work ethic #8221; when I get anxiety in lessons and can #8217;t concentrate seriously????! I #8217;m trying my best. This just takes me back to leading up to Results Day I was SO terrified if I #8217;d even get a place. I thought once I got a place it would all be over. Now they #8217;re not even  #8216;confirming #8217; my place and I #8217;m so fricking anxious and worried, I just want closure. I can #8217;t say them assessing me for things I struggle with because of undiagnosed ADD is discrimination because I didn #8217;t get the grades anyway so they didn #8217;t have to give me a place apparently (or I think they did because otherwise I would have had nowhere AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN EDUCATION RIGHT.) It #8217;s the Head Of Sixth Form whose idea this was by the way. And the worst thing is my mum agrees with it. My mental health is really bad and I #8217;m anxious about school now and will be for a bit even if the situation improved. At school I was like  #8220;I #8217;m ill I wasn #8217;t even gonna come in but I have to keep my place #8221; and they were like what the fuck. If I get diagnosed with ADHD can I come back at them for this?? Because they #8217;re assessing me on something that #8217;s not my fault.

I #8217;ve said to my mum  #8220;see my friends think it #8217;s wrong as well! #8221; and because she agrees with school she #8217;s like  #8220;well they don #8217;t know the backstory #8221;.

    <TITLE>I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-10 02:11:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is that the right term?? This is what I mean: As far as I know, my school #8217;s never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn #8217;t be SURPRISED. I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn #8217;t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years  #128557; #128557; If I killed myself, all those kids would think  #8220;She really did it #8221; and would say  #8220;WE drove her to this #8221; and kids at neighbouring schools would say  #8220;You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide #8221; and  #8220;A girl from (my school) killed herself! #8221; And  #8220;Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking  #8220;Oh it #8217;s (my name) so it #8217;s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it #8217;s nothing #8221; and now she #8217;s dead. #8221; Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasn #8217;t there. I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout  #8220;GET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE. #8221; in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, I #8217;ve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever? I don #8217;t want to stall too much so that I #8217;ve left school when I do it because then the school won #8217;t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn #8217;t because of them. I don #8217;t want the wrong people to be blamed. I don #8217;t know how much longer I can go on. It #8217;s like a candle is burning, and I don #8217;t know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn #8217;t much. It wouldn #8217;t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No motivation to do anything but lie in bed or on the sofa and watch tv or something or go on my phone. I #8217;ve stopped going to school (I #8217;m 16). We went back on I think the 4th September and I only went for one day. I don #8217;t leave the house. I just spend 7 hours a day on my phone</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does EVERYTHING make a note? And do some people have more acute/accurate perfect pitch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-21 00:48:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>(I don #8217;t have PP, cries) Well the title #8217;s slightly hyperbolic, I mean normal every day things; shutting a door, turning a light switch out, floorboards creaking, cupboard doors shutting??? Or DOES everything make a note? I wouldn #8217;t know... I was just listening to this podcast and Charlie Puth hit the table and said it was an F and then the host did it and it was a D, and it sounds just percussive to me and I didn #8217;t know objects could just radiate notes.. somehow?  #128514; But like it just sounded like someone hitting a table to me! And when Charlie Puth did it it was so quiet and as quick as just slapping a table not even hard. Can you hear notes in things like hitting a table or other things? Also this is probably a stupid question but do some people have more acute perfect pitch than others and be able to hear closer to the nearest cent (I guess) or is everyone the same? X</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I heard someone with AP talk about how if they #8217;re hanging out with you and hear a helicopter overhead they have to say  #8220;that #8217;s a C# #8221; or whatever so they can like know they acknowledged it and then they can forget about it like an OCD thing. I don #8217;t have AP and if I hear a song on Spotify and the FIRST chord is the same as the first chord in another song I literally feel like I have to compulsively put them in a playlist of  #8216;same chord #8217;  #128514; It #8217;s the nerdiest thing I #8217;ve ever done haha maybe I should remember what the chords are so I can identify them haha</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have I left it too late to learn an instrument?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-21 03:18:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 16F, I have been playing piano for about 4 years, but hardly ever; I have attention deficit disorder and could probably practice piano for 10 minutes if I had to. Not even half an hour. I #8217;m ashamed. If I sit down at the piano to just mess about it #8217;s honestly for about literally 1 minute to just play out something that was in my head. When I did lessons I could play grade 3 pieces. I REALLY REALLY love music and listen to it MOST of the time I go on my phone which is a terrible 6 hours a day. I have decent relative pitch and should be so much better at piano than I am for how long I #8217;ve been able to play it but I #8217;ve never had the attention span. I #8217;m going to see about ADHD medication to really help with my focus, but have I left it too late to get good at an instrument? My dad also has ADHD and struggled to practice but it #8217;s okay you know why? Perfect pitch. And I inherited the adhd from him and not the perfect pitch haha fun times. I really want to learn bass, drums, piano and guitar so much. I want to be able to be GOOD though like my dad. I want to be able to improvise on a keyboard and be able to have a repertoire of piano pieces/popular songs I can play because right now I can #8217;t play anything the whole way through. Do you think this is doable? Should I get piano lessons again? Any tips? (Also would like to know about how to begin to get into jazz (it #8217;s foreign to me right now) if possible) Thanks</TEXT>

I #8217;ve never seen any Batman movies - would I still get what #8217;s happening? I #8217;d be going with my mum. Would I spend most of the time shielding my eyes from it or is it not that scary?

    <TITLE>Hey guys. This is a bit of my story and what I #8217;ve learned about how bullying can impact lives. #Antibullying I love you all, you matter xxx feel free to dm me</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-07 19:51:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I #8217;m Jess and I was severely bullied in high school. For 4 years. Every day. By a total 14 people, and 6 at once. I am now 16 and should be in Sixth Form (Year 12) but I am off school because of mental health problems. Recently I have been feeling quite useless and would like to put myself to use. Today I was extremely extremely upset, crying to my mum about how I #8217;ll never understand why I was bullied and telling her how much it has impacted my life. Self-esteem: You wonder why is it ME that they have chosen to pick on. You think what is wrong with me, am I just naturally dislikeable? How can I fit in better? You get laughed at for everything you do and get teased. When you think everyone hates you it brings your self-esteem down SO much. I used to be really confident and outgoing, I liked drama and had no problem talking to groups of people. But by Year 11 I had half the confidence I used to have, actually developed stage fright (which I was embarrassed about because everyone knew I liked drama) and my heart would start racing when it was nearly my turn to talk in class (if we were going round the class). I didn #8217;t like myself and my looks at all, and was really insecure. Bully victims are the least likely people to do things like apply for House Captain, or audition for something, or speak in front of their tutor group or speak in an assembly. Bully victims are less likely to take part in general because they don #8217;t want to draw any attention to themself. This brings down their confidence and makes them more introverted people. Anxiety/social anxiety: I haven #8217;t developed agoraphobia (fear/worry about interaction with people e.g. going to the shops and having to see other people, and having them see you) but I would really not be surprised if they are linked. In fact I know bullying can cause social anxiety. Like someone on First Dates could very well be like  #8220;I didn #8217;t leave my house for 3 years. I was bullied in high school #8221; and they could be an ADULT. Bully victims walk around school feeling like they stand out, constantly afraid that someone will open their mouth and in my case shout at them. This breaks my heart to remember this is still happening to people. The ANXIOUS like ANTICIPATION that it is going to happen is awful. I actually just got used to it. That makes me really sad to think about but I just got used to being treated like that at school. I remember very occasionally I would come home and be like  #8220;Hello?! Yeah mum I had a great day! #8221; But I realised that was only a NORMAL DAY. If I had a NORMAL DAY it was an  #8220;amazing day #8221;. It was a great day for me if no one spoke to me. I completely see why people who are bullied are more likely to have shyness / social anxiety and be more introverted. Self hatred / self-loathing / lowering self-worth: I don #8217;t know about anyone else but I questioned myself extremely deeply. I thought I was wrong and I began to hate myself and have urges to punish myself because I thought it was MY fault. I thought it was MY fault. It is NOT your fault. It is NEVER the bully victim #8217;s fault. If I asked a bully  #8220;Why do you pick on them? #8221; And they were like  #8220;They #8217;re weird, they shouldn #8217;t be so weird then #8221; I would tell them just how awful and idiotic they are being. It is always the bullies fault. You do NOT deserve it. It is NOT your fault. People #8217;s self worth gets lowered if they are picked on, teased or bullied. You think  #8220;clearly no one likes me #8221;. You are beautiful, brilliant, brave, smart, nice and incredibly cool. I honestly think you #8217;re an amazing person. These bullies are not saying you are negative things because it is true - please know it is not true and they are always saying it for some other reason e.g. to be entertaining or just to hurt your feelings. Depression and anxiety is incredibly common in bully victims. I am devastated that this is happening. Bullying happens at every school. School was RUINED for me. I then got terrible GCSEs as a result of missing school because of mental health problems. I felt so alone. I felt so, so alone. Imagine then getting awful results. I felt like such a failure and had no self-worth. Things started getting really bad and I was very distressed. I started having suicidal thoughts. If someone at school has clout and power and has the power to make people turn against you and turn away from you.. that is dangerously powerful. Bullying affects lives a lot more than people think. They people who bullied me are very popular and have friends and are very privileged and will have good jobs and good money. I know what it #8217;s like to feel like you don #8217;t belong, to feel like you #8217;re disliked by everyone and people are horrible to you. And I don #8217;t want anyone else to feel like that. Bullying is NOT OKAY. I really really want to help anyone who is going through this. You are worth so so much and you are very loved. Giving so much love to you all  lt;3  lt;3 It will get better, I promise. Please feel free to dm me if anyone wants to talk :)) I don #8217;t want anyone to feel distressed and depressed because of bullying. No one deserved deserves to feel like that  lt;3  lt;3  lt;3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ADHD and learning musical instruments</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-21 23:50:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Does anyone else struggle with learning instruments? Help! :( ADHD and learning musical instruments! I love music. Like I get chills from music especially if it means something to me, I just get all the feels. Music has done a lot for my life in improving my happiness and I don #8217;t give it enough credit. Music is amazing. Fuck, it #8217;s just everything. I own 2 ukuleles, a guitar and a piano. It should be the case that 4 years is enough for anyone to get good at an instrument (putting in the practice) I #8217;m 16 and have played piano for about 4 years but I #8217;m terrible. I have decent relative pitch and am passionate about music. I should be so much better at piano than I am for how long I #8217;ve played it. My piano teacher actually dropped me because I wasn #8217;t practicing. I always felt like it was such a chore and wouldn #8217;t have motivation. I #8217;ve wanted to learn Bohemian Rhapsody on piano for about 5 months. The first day I decided I wanted to do it, I learnt the opening and was learning at a normal pace and found it easy. Bohemian Rhapsody is the greatest song ever but actually not that hard to play on piano - I think I could have had it playable and up to speed in about 2 weeks. But I haven #8217;t gotten round to learning the next bit! And now 5 months later I know the same amount that I did 5 months ago! I wanted to have a repertoire of piano pieces I can play by now, 4 years after starting piano! Also I make mistakes on piano every time I play something. I press the wrong keys every time even playing something I know well, I swear that #8217;s not normal haha. I think my hands just go too quick because I #8217;m quite a fast moving person and always have too much energy. I don #8217;t have the attention span to play piano for literally more than 10 minutes! You have to be practicing for hours a day ideally! :( I would love to be able to do it for hours in a day and get good. I feel so pathetic. I just can #8217;t make myself do it. When I had a piano teacher I ALWAYS left it to the day of the weekly lesson to quickly go over what I was supposed to practice for the week. I would put it off even if I had the TIME to do it. I am extremely appreciative of music though, listen to it almost all the time and just love it so much. If only I could devote the time I hours I spend LISTENING to music PRACTICING playing music. I want to be really good at piano, guitar, bass and drums one day. I feel like I just wasted 4 years of my life where I could have progressed at piano. Music is something I really love and I want to be good enough at it that I can do it for fun. Vent: my dad has the gift of perfect pitch which means you #8217;re naturally musically gifted and practice is not necessary  #8212; IF ONLY I inherited perfect pitch from him and not ADD!!!! I would have a GIFT instead of a hindrance!! It would solve a lot of problems and I would feel GOOD AT SOMETHING - I #8217;m not good at anything. I want to be good at music so much. If I could have wishes from a genie that would be one. I hope this IS my ADD and I #8217;m not just bad at playing instruments.. I #8217;m good at music theory and all that and have a good ear. I don #8217;t want to believe I #8217;m just awful. Does anyone have any advice or does anyone relate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m turning 17 on December 17th and am not in school because of mental health problems. I really want to be in school for when it gets all Christmassy but I don #8217;t think it will happen at this rate, my health is too bad. No one at school has asked if I #8217;m okay, not a single person. I suffer from absolute loneliness and complete friendlessness. I have a twin sister who goes to a different school who has a thriving social life and she will come home on our birthday with literal presents from friends. I don #8217;t leave my house at the moment due to extreme anxiety and if I stay at home on my birthday and am not in school I will be so depressed and it will be the worst day ever and I will spend the whole day crying. I feel so alone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Could smoking weed help me with executive function stuff?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Like concentration, hyperfocus, motivation to do boring shit like work and revision, not being lazy, being able to do the same thing for a long period of time e.g. writing something, or practicing a musical instrument for hours. Would sativa or indica be best? I #8216;ve never smoked before and I #8217;m broke so in order to not waste weed by not being productive should I NEVER get high for fun and ONLY to be PRODUCTIVE like if I plan on doing some work? Also would it help me more creative like for making music?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In BBC #8217;s Bodyguard, an ex-veteran with PTSD, David, is a bodyguard for a politician called Julia. He fucks her and then they go to bed in separate rooms. In the morning she comes to his bedside and touches his face to gently wake him up and he gets up and strangles her completely out of the blue and pushes her to the ground - and she is fine but completely alarmed and he apologises and is upset because he didn #8217;t mean to do it. I #8217;m just wondering what that may have been and how it was related to his PTSD.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How a teacher sorted my bullying! :))</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-13 04:13:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is what COULD happen ideally if you tell a teacher. I was bullied by 13 people in 4 years, 6 at once and this is what I did. You tell the teacher, they should take it very seriously because there is a  #8216;zero tolerance for bullying #8217; at all schools. I #8217;d suggest going with a parent/guardian for support. Give them the names of the bullies. They will take notes and write what each one does summed up because sometimes people bully in different ways (I was bullied by different people who all had a different way of bullying me). Express your concerns about being called a  #8216;snitch #8217;, getting in trouble for telling a teacher etc. They have worked in schools for years, they will understand. They won #8217;t do anything yet. Aim to have it appear to the bullies that OTHER PEOPLE reported the bullying and not the victim. Yes it #8217;s a lie but it #8217;s the best thing to do. I know with bystanders, it may be hard for the bully to believe that someone reported it. Everyone in the room may laugh along at the time, so the bully may think it could only have been the victim. Teachers will hopefully keep a watchful eye (e.g. my photography teacher would tell my bully to go back to her seat when she approached me). A senior staff member like the Headteacher or Deputy Head can drag these kids into their office and have strict words and say  #8220;I know you are bullying (name). #8221; Agree it with the headteacher that they can say to the bully  #8220;some students overheard you picking on her #8221; or * #8221;the teacher on duty saw. #8221;* No one is going to question that. If the bully is being told off by a teacher who says  #8220;a teacher/a student saw... #8221; the bully won #8217;t question it, they just won #8217;t, trust me. It will never be made out to be you guys reporting incidents, but of course it will be you guys; report bullying every time it happens. The same DAY so it #8217;s fresh information so they can do something about it. Take note, get it reported. The teacher helping will go about it with discretion don #8217;t worry. When your headteacher speaks to the bully they can say  #8220;If I hear that you spoke to (name) again you will be in trouble. #8221; In my situation, our headteacher reassured me that  #8220;I #8217;ve told him not to talk to you. If he bothers you again, you come and tell me and he #8217;ll be straight back here getting told off again. #8221; It made me feel relieved and safe that we had a plan and the teachers were amazing in helping. The moment it happens, you report it in straight away (my mum and I used to write an email after school saying  #8220;in maths today.. #8221; etc), and they #8217;re in the office again. It took a long time for my bullying to stop but it did eventually and it wouldn #8217;t have stopped without this teacher shouting at the kids for me and being like  #8220;we do not have bullying in my school! #8221; Bullying should be treated like a serious matter. I #8217;m so sorry you #8217;re being treated differently/horribly/unkindly/unfairly. I think you #8217;re amazing and I hope everything improves soon (it will!!). Good luck :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m so freaked out! it #8217;s been minutes since I went to bed and I went to sleep and dreamed and then woke up. I had gotten into bed then dreamt I was awake but super tired downstairs like I was and then passed out on the spot then woke up in my bed and hadn #8217;t left my room. And it was so REAL. My sister was saying  #8220;and what do we have here, Lara #8217;s notebook! #8221; teasing me that she was gonna look through it. And I remember I put voice recording on on my phone for some reason and I was SO tired (like I am right now) and then passed out on the spot into a SCARY deep sleep that felt like sleep paralysis and like my body was being dragged downwards in my bed and the dream ended and I WOKE UP. And I hadn #8217;t moved from my bed and I was surprised to see my phone was wear I left it and I hadn #8217;t touched it to do the voice recording thing. I was properly like  #8220;Oh that was all a dream #8221; and I #8217;ve never had that before. And that was only the first mini-dream. And this was all in a mixture of sleep paralysis and when I was waking up (in the dream) and going back to sleep (in the dream) I was in sleep paralysis and I felt like the dream was DRAGGING me in like I was being pulled in by the dream. I wasn #8217;t aware I went back to sleep again at all. I thought I stayed awake. I had fallen asleep again and this time, my body curled up in my bed INVOLUNTARYILY and I moved to the end of my bed without myself MOVING and then down onto the floor and to my bedroom door and I was gliding along the floor like in a video game or something and I was thinking (SO I GUESS I WAS LUCID DREAMING)  #8220;this is so weird that I can #8217;t feel anything #8221; and I wasn #8217;t in control of myself and even thought  #8220;am I having a fit? I need to get mum #8221; and started panicking. I had a half-awake/half-asleep/extremely tired feeling. But you don #8217;t feel tired when you #8217;re ASLEEP so I thought I was AWAKE. So it was like lucid dreaming because I was aware sum was happening but I didn #8217;t know it was a DREAM and couldn #8217;t MOVE so it was like lucid dreaming with sleep paralysis? Lucid dreaming while awake? Anyway then I woke up and was so SURPRISED to be in bed. I FELL ASLEEP IN MY DREAM?

    <TITLE>Why do some perfect pitchers not like listening to music?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-11 03:13:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>My dad has perfect pitch. He never listens to music. Like he #8217;ll listen to music a few times a year. He doesn #8217;t know any music artists and basically just ISNT INTERESTED in music. He has a piano and plays piano (by ear) sometimes but he #8217;s not really big into it. He also has high-functioning autism (I don #8217;t know if that could be anything to do with it.) I just find it so odd because surely AP would make you MORE interested in music. Meanwhile, I listen to music like MOST of the time lol, completely completely love music and am struggling because my ADHD gets in the way of me learning instruments and it #8217;s so hard for me, and if I had perfect pitch, I could basically skip the practice stage which I so struggle with because of my brain, and then I would have a help instead of a hinderance. And I #8217;m like the one who is obsessed with music and I love music so much and I #8217;m not good at anything, and my dad basically doesn #8217;t use his perfect pitch. Kind of gonna be depressed about it for the rest of my life lol</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I give my bully twin presents on our birthday tomorrow?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-16 10:04:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have got her a card and some small things. She got me some things as well. She is an absolute bully, she is a vile bitch who goes out of her way to TEST my anxiety and try and distress me and provoke a reaction from me. She is extremely manipulative and horrible. She makes jokes and derogatory comments about my disability. She pokes fun at the fact I am house bound due to struggling with a mental illness and she goes to school and I can #8217;t. She is rude every day before I do anything to her - my mum could tell me to tell her tea #8217;s ready, and when I go and knock on my sister #8217;s door to do as my mum said my sister will scream vile things at me before I say anything. She would come in from being out/sleepovers and not say anything and go straight upstairs or not respond when I say  #8220;Hi #8221;. She has hardly spent time with me all year despite the fact that I wanted us to work on our relationship and spend more time together because I #8217;m extremely lonely. She has been extremely MEAN and horrible to me all year. She is the most mean child I know (and I was bullied by 13 people) and I wish I didn #8217;t live with her. I had to change my sleep pattern and become nocturnal to avoid her. If I don #8217;t give her the birthday presents because today she distressed me so much and I was crying because of the way she was purposefully obstructing and opposing me in order to test my anxiety (and our birthdays tomorrow), I know she won #8217;t give me mine. So that does make it a negative day. But she DOES NOT fucking deserve anything, the vile horrible bitch. She calls me all kinds of names and treats me like her slave, walking all over me. I #8217;m fed up of my twin bullying me. In the card I wrote for her I couldn #8217;t even write stuff like  #8220;you #8217;re the best sister ever #8221; and all that bullshit so I just wrote  #8220;Happy birthday! I hope you #8217;re nicer to me next year #8221; and was crying as I wrote it and didn #8217;t even wanna put it in the envelope so my mum did it. We #8217;re also supposed to be going out ice skating tomorrow evening together. It is the one day of the year we are supposed to get on so I want to do it, but it is guaranteed she will make me beyond angry and do something to upset me tomorrow so I don #8217;t think it will even happen. My birthday is going to be the loneliest most miserable day of the year. The only person I can spend it with is absolutely horrible to me and makes me cry. I can #8217;t avoid this being an awful day. Like what am I celebrating, the beginning of another year of this hell I #8217;m living? So basically should I give my twin birthday presents and pretend to like her or not. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I #8217;m 17 and having suicidal thoughts</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-19 19:14:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>Turned 17 the other day. I have been having thoughts for months. It started out as no-one-would-care-if-I-wasn #8217;t-here things. I deeply considered how people at school would react to me dying. I am still considering it a big probability that I won #8217;t reach 25. It depends how things go. Loneliness is a pain that can consume you. If things haven #8217;t gotten better in a few years I can #8217;t say where I will be. I have had suicidal dreams.. of slitting my throat, shooting myself in the head and standing on the edge of a bridge. I think if I did it while I was in school they would possibly put up a memorial like a little plaque or something to remember me. And it would be more effective because the people that started the chain of events and damage to my mental state are bullies at school. So they would all be there to see the effect of what they did. I have suicidal thoughts quite a lot. I don #8217;t have an urge to harm myself though. I have thought of a method; inhaling helium to pass out in a bath full of water and drown, but as with every method it might not work. I #8217;m kind of scared that I #8217;ve come up with an method now because for the next 5 years I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll forget coming up with it. Things have gotten so bad that I think of these things.. but I #8217;m not even depressed to the level that I have been DEPRESSED before, I just hate my life. I don #8217;t feel depressed like I used to though. But I have an immensely stressful home life and I feel like the stress is crushing me and I will have lots of mental problems when I #8217;m older because of the stress.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice for a girl feeling pressured to lose her virginity?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-23 16:40:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I used to have a crush on this boy and was so in love with him that I thought I #8217;d love it if it was him I could lose my virginity to. Now I #8217;m 17 and people in school this last year were talking about it and I sort of was like  #8220;oh fuck oh yeah we #8217;re 17 people are doing that #8221;. I have never had a boyfriend and there #8217;s no one I fancy. This boy who I was friends with has offered me sex lots but I don #8217;t want to do it with him because we #8217;re just mates at best and I want it to be with someone special, someone I LOVE. So doing it with a boy who #8217;ll have me would be a complete last resort. I sort of feel like I #8217;m 17 and people lose their virginities younger than me and friends have mentioned their sex lives to me and I feel like I #8217;m just.... behind. Some people who have had sex before just ask people to have sex with them (I #8217;ve been asked lol and say no) but I feel like I would have to be in a relationship... but I #8217;ve never been in one. So do I have to wait for that to have sex. And I feel like, what if that special person doesn #8217;t come along that I really fancy and have a crush on. And then I could be 17, 18, 19 and not have done it because no one loved me. Does it matter who you lose your virginity to? I do want it to be someone I #8217;m in love with but maybe I #8217;ll have to.. make do? Hahaha Also I #8217;ve never even been half naked in front of a boy and would be so insecure of my body lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I shared with my friend Casey my idea to make a calendar for this band we like and sell it to some of the fans we know online. She was all  #8220;That #8217;s a great idea! #8221; and we were chatting about it and I was saying what kind of photos I #8217;d use. Then today, about a week later, I saw on her Twitter she had tweeted a calendar she made. I was really surprised that she had made one since it was entirely my idea. In the comments one of the fans of the band asked if they can buy it and she was like  #8220;you can! I #8217;m dm you #8221; and she #8217;s selling it. There is a lot of comments of people interested. I #8217;m actually annoyed. Because I #8217;m gonna make one because I thought of it. And I can #8217;t tweet it because Casey tweeted it and people will think I #8217;m jumping on the band wagon of  #8220;her #8221; original idea, and I certainly can #8217;t sell and make a couple quid because people commented on Casey #8217;s they wanna buy. Casey has genuinely done me wrong here. Especially if she ends up making money out of my original plan/idea (I did say to her I was thinking I could sell to vros), which takes the opportunity away from me. Like I can #8217;t do that now, she #8217;s taken the chance away from me. No one else thought of it, it was my smart idea that I just shared with her. It #8217;s straight up disloyalty. And I could have got more followers with it being retweeted and got more popular in the fan community. Now even if I make one, like I was going to, I couldn #8217;t sell it because hers is being liked and talked about. I really want to keep her as a friend but this was so disloyal and I #8217;m upset</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mum has only said a handful of apologies to me in my life. She is a bad mum in many areas and is in the wrong very often. She never admits it, saying  #8220;oh yes, blame me for everything! #8221; but she hasn #8217;t thought that she IS to blame!!!! I bought mum a pan because she wanted one for Christmas. It just came in the post. She was happy but was all speaking so patronisingly to me and LITERALLY said  #8220;WoW sO cLeVeR! yOu MaNaGeD tO oRdEr A pAn AnD gEt It DeLiVeReD tO oUr HoUsE! #8221; to me as a 17 year old she knows shops online (and does everything else a 17 year old would in fact). As if I was a 10 year old or someone severely autistic and ordering something online is not within my capability. I #8217;m a very highly functioning 17 year old. How offensive. She ruined the mood when she said that. I was like no mum I am fully able thanks????? Wtf And the mood had changed and she didn #8217;t take me seriously when I said she should apologise. She didn #8217;t think it was wrong even when I was shouting at her saying  #8220;what if you heard someone else say that! You would think it was wrong! #8221; That #8217;s got to be one of the most offensive things she #8217;s said in the last year. There #8217;s nothing wrong with my mum in the way of social understanding, she #8217;s just incredible rude, insulting and offensive. I #8217;m so offended. Mums be thinking their kids have to treat them with so much respect but then apologising doesn #8217;t apply to them lmao. My mum often conveniently forgets doing things like  #8220;I never said that!! #8221; to avoid apologising, hoping I #8217;ll forget. I am so sick of her thinking she can get away with not apologising!!!!!!!! It makes me so frustrated!!! She offended me and hasn #8217;t said sorry. She makes me want to be even less autistic now because of her offensive out of the blue comments. My mum is in the wrong SO OFTEN yet always believes she can never be wrong. She has never apologised for anything ever but always makes me apologise. My mum has NEVER considered changing her behaviour. Even if we did family therapy and they suggested the apologising thing to her she would never even think about it. She desperately needs to change her behaviour but she never will. She just can #8217;t ever admit to being wrong. I went and bought her something even though I thought she didn #8217;t deserve it, to be nice, and she just let me down again, twice, with the comment and not apologising so she #8217;s not getting it now. I just told her that and she said  #8220;I don #8217;t care! I #8217;m not falling for the manipulation #8221; wtf!?! She owes me an apology, she just plays the victim. She crunched the cardboard box the pan came in so I can #8217;t return it (unless anyone knows how?) and get my money back. I don #8217;t mind fucking throwing it in a bin somewhere.</TEXT>

She crunched the cardboard box it came in so I can #8217;t return it (unless anyone knows how?). I don #8217;t mind fucking throwing it in a bin somewhere.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-07 00:31:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 17 and have an incredibly extremely high stress home life and have had for about 6 years. About an hour ago I heard a voice that sounded like the siri male voice but less monotone but I couldn #8217;t work out what it was saying like the only other thing I was listening to was the tv and the tv was like 85% of it and the voice was 15% of the noise and it wasn #8217;t in the tv. And it could have come from no where else but I haven #8217;t heard it since. This is the first time I #8217;ve ever heard a voice - can they just come and go like that? I was really scared and wanted to say to my mum  #8220;can you hear someone talking? #8221; but I didn #8217;t want her to look at me all surprised and freak me out more. It wasn #8217;t the tv though I thought about that possibility at lot. It was for like 2 minutes over my tv. Clearly a person talking. My mum didn #8217;t react to hearing anything. Also this probably sounds stupid but it did sort of sound like it was  #8216;in my head #8217;.. the way it was so distorted and I couldn #8217;t hear any words</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On trigger warnings on twitter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-09 07:00:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>No one take any offence because I mean none at all, Do we have to put a trigger warning to post selfies on Twitter? I saw a stan twitter girl tweet  #8220;tw//body image #8221; and then post 3 mirror selfies that only showed the top half of her body (dark because of the flash) and she was wearing a jacket and they were so harmless, didn #8217;t show her body and weren #8217;t to do with body image  #8212; even if it had been, you see people posting about body confidence on Instagram (and so they #8217;re probably aware of the influence of social media) and they #8217;re not gonna put a TW on photos of their body if they #8217;re overweight, nor are they if they are extremely fit  #8212; so I felt like it wasn #8217;t necessary. If people do get triggered by mirror selfies where you can #8217;t see the persons body I don #8217;t know how they cope with seeing people. I feel like it #8217;s not always necessary and we see people all the time on twitter. I also see people TW food which everyone is used to seeing online, on tv and in life. I #8217;m very aware of eating disorders but I know people who have recovery accounts on Instagram and post pictures of food and have no problem talking openly about it. I would see the point more if it was a picture of a Macdonalds order for 8 people but if it #8217;s a picture of you eating a toastie at costa with your mate I don #8217;t feel like people should have to trigger warning their posts. Like are we gonna TW water next lol A discord I was in once had banned a whole list of random sounding things like Harry Potter because they were people #8217;s triggers and so those people had stopped the whole chat talking about them forever when they won #8217;t be there 99% of the time because they don #8217;t like it.  #8220;Ravens #8221; and  #8220;bats #8221; were banned because of being people #8217;s phobias and I thought but I #8217;m not gonna ban everyone from mentioning spiders and feeling trapped you know. Another thing banned was  #8220;lonely #8221; and I was thinking this is a mental health support dicord... What else should everyone TW? I #8217;ve looked up being triggered by food on ED pages, Reddit, everywhere and it #8217;s never been mentioned even by ED sufferers so I think this is one that has come out of Twitter. I feel like a lot of the time the tw is more potentially triggering than the actual non-shocking tweets themselves and it #8217;s for the same things we see on Snapchat, Instagram, life, (like food isn #8217;t a rare thing like obviously how SH is triggering, it #8217;s something we are all used to since we were born, I of course understand eating disorders though) and and it wouldn #8217;t be triggering if there wasn #8217;t a TW (unless it #8217;s obviously triggering). It just reinforces how everyone can get triggered by everything these days. Please understand my perspective. I #8217;d like to know your thoughts :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people waste their time being assholes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-10 00:40:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Seriously, it still shocked me that people actually WASTE THEIR TIME saying shit online. Just BE THE PERSON YOU WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE TO YOU. Would you want someone to be mean to you? People honestly spread hate literally everywhere and I can #8217;t believe they are wasting their own time doing that when it #8217;s not gonna change anything. This girl was singing on a live (she had a great voice) and some people were laughing in the comments like  #8220;she can #8217;t sing  #128514; #8221; and were being so mean. If I genuinely thought they weren #8217;t very good, I would never tell them and would instead just be nice. Being nice is so much less energy than mean anyway. Don #8217;t waste your time doing hate. Just leave it. Like if you #8217;re chatting with friends and you #8217;re like  #8220;oh I really hate this thing... #8221; that #8217;s a different vibe. But to go out of your way to personally spread negativity is so immature and you #8217;re just being a pest. Someone joined my live the other day and just said  #8220;fucking tramp  #128514; #8221; before I got the chance to say anything and I was like exfuckingSCUSEme? We were just laughing in the live like is he really just going round lives saying shit like that and not waiting for a reaction because it #8217;s.. fun or something? YIKES  #128514; They must be pretty bored and sad to do that. Spreading hate or no reason, causing drama, being negative and thinking the worst of people is just such a sad way to go about life. Like would you go up to stranger in a store and be like  #8220;I hate your sweater? #8221; No of course not. It #8217;s okay to do things like that out of love, if you want to be nice and friendly to someone on the internet but I don #8217;t know how it #8217;s entertaining to drop hate places or be so negative. What you give out you receive back. Go figure out what you love and go expend you #8217;re energy into something useful instead of being so sad :)</TEXT>

I think it #8217;s just a self-reassurance thing.

It #8217;s literally only 15 minutes away, like a super short 15 minutes in the car we #8217;re actually so LUCKY to live so CLOSE #8221; and she #8217;ll be like  #8220;yeah isnt that great! #8221; but whole time I secretly am anxious and dreading the journey because 15 minutes is too far away but I #8217;m trying to trick myself I guess. I guess I just try to counter the anxiety with pretending to be more excited about the thing and thinking positively. I guess it #8217;s a self reassurance thing.

So I pulled a person aside and begged them to shoot me and explained why and said please just shoot me and they put the gun to my head and explained what being shot would be like and I was saying my last words and kept saying  #8220;WAIT! #8221; to make sure I said everything I wanted to say. And then be shot me and it was such a loud bang but it didn #8217;t work and I was hyperventilating and he told me to stay calm and then did it again. And then what was weird is fast forward in the dream, I was still alive and wrote the guy a note saying I woke up the next day and felt fine. Hmm.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just saw a tweet that was like  #8220;TW anxiety - anxiety is being a real bitch today can it just fuck off thanks #8221; And I was like. It #8217;s like the first word. And I #8217;m like everyone #8217;s encouraged to talk about that it doesn #8217;t have to be  #8220;triggering #8221; also NO ONE with anxiety gets triggered by reading the word and if they did you just said it twice without censoring it or anything. I also saw one that was  #8220;TW weather #8221; without anything of a current natural disaster or something it was just about the nice weather that day, and  #8220;TW body image #8221; when a girl wanted to post 3 mirror selfies on twitter with the flash where you could only see like half her face. I thought about being like hey you don #8217;t have to trigger me warming your selfies. I see severely underweight people on Instagram post actual full body images without having to trigger warning their post. In this girls 3 selfies you could literally only see the side of her face and her jacket. I thought post a selfie on twitter if you want. I #8217;m like the  #8220;TW #8221; actually makes it more negative than if you didn #8217;t have it. Also this is gonna make me unpopular, but people do a lot of  #8220;TW food #8221; to just mention food and I #8217;ve googled and searched reddit and looked on eating disorder pages and the only thing that comes up is trigger foods for IBS and  #8220;TW food #8221; is basically something twitter just created that has come out of twitter. Idk I just feel like these people are actually unaware and are just using  #8216;TW #8217; for everything because it #8217;s trendy or something or their followers like it because it #8217;s  #8220;making sure everyone #8217;s safe #8221; and a lot of these people usually on stan twitter completely overuse  #8220;trigger warnings #8221; about literally everything to look good</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I think I was misdiagnosed by mum mum. A professional never diagnosed me, and the label just makes me miserable</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-28 11:29:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I meant: misdiagnosed by my mum I #8217;m 17 and  #8220;am diagnosed #8221; with a thing called Pathelogical Demand Avoidance which is basically where commands give you anxiety. I was  #8220;diagnosed #8221; when I was 8. I live in the U.K. and no one has heard of this thing and the label has always made me feel different and the odd one out but I don #8217;t present as having it and I appear to be neurotypical. My mum is absolutely fixated on that I have it and we have argued over it for years. She tries to relate everything I struggle with back to PDA (like saying motivation issues are because of your PDA when I #8217;m depressed or lazy). She has also once said I  #8220;freeze #8221; when she tells me to do something and she  #8220;sees it in my eyes #8221; and I was SO disgusted and mortified at this bullshit she was saying because she basically makes it up and half admits she doesn #8217;t know what she #8217;s talking about. I follow through on commands around the house MOST of the time she just only noticed the rare times where I say no. I don #8217;t actually have any of the official symptoms when you google them. Symptoms are stuff like  #8220;being extremely comfortable in role play and pretence #8221; and some PDAers have imaginary friends they spend 20 minutes talking to a day  #8212;- this is completely NOT ME and I don #8217;t want anyone to find out I have PDA because it #8217;s completely not me. I have showed my mum in the past year that I have most of the symptoms of primarily-inattentive ADHD and more than enough to be diagnosed and I think I have it. The doctor even gave us this official questionnaire and my mum and I filled it out together and she agreed with what I was putting down on the sheet, and it really seems like I have ADHD. I like reading r/adhd because I relate with a lot of the stuff there. Also if I get diagnosed with ADHD there #8217;s actually a community I could be a part of. But then she said I was just trying to  #8220;cover up #8221; having PDA and she felt betrayal because I was trying to disagree on the label she #8217;s put on me for years. She really believes I have it when all my symptoms are ADHD symptoms. She thinks I have PDA because I can #8217;t meet deadlines etc, but people with PDA have a thing where they almost automatically say no to all commands without thinking about it and I definitely don #8217;t. My mum has said before it would be hard for me to get an ADHD diagnosis because  #8220;you see, you #8217;re already diagnosed with PDA #8221; but it #8217;s not actually on paper anywhere and my mum just doesn #8217;t want me to get diagnosed with something else. I think it #8217;s so much more likely I have high-functioning autism (I don #8217;t present as having it because I #8217;m so high-functioning but I do have some traits of it) and ADD. I have told her  #8220;at parents evenings have my teachers ever said I was disobedient?! #8221; And she has said  #8220;in school you probably just do as your told to not get found out as having it by the other students. #8221; And I #8217;ve shown her videos of me as a toddler following commands even when the person doesn #8217;t say  #8216;please #8217; and doing as I #8217;m told. To have PDA you have to have avoided commands from a young age. The things she thinks are PDA symptoms are: my general anxiety, lack of motivation, not being able to concentrate, being talkative, being distractible, being lazy as in never tidying my room (she says I can #8217;t deal with the silent demand of tidying my room), completing work at the last minute and procrastinating. I feel like she just says everything is PDA. She also went through a phase of calling me  #8220;PDA kid! #8221; when I was about 13 but she has deeply and meaningfully apologised for this. I have NEVER identified with this diagnosis and it has just made me miserable. I want to get diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder because A) people have actually heard of it and even though people don #8217;t have a full understanding, they will at least not think you #8217;re unusual B) it could actually benefit me because I could get medication which would really help me with school C) I wouldn #8217;t mind telling my teachers because it #8217;s ALL THE EXPLANATION THEY NEED because I have ADHD symptoms, and if they look up PDA they will just think I think I #8217;m a cat which is NOT ME and I CANT HAVE PEOPLE THINKING I DO THAT. My mum for years has been trying to make me think I have PDA but I just don #8217;t identify with it. She has bought books (I just went and wrote on it all the things that are completely not me saying  #8220;you know your daughter!!!!! You know this isn #8217;t me!!!!! #8221;) and left printed out pages on my bed for me to read and I throw them away and get so annoyed. Then today I found out PDA isn #8217;t even diagnosed in the U.K.! It #8217;s not recognised enough as an ASD profile. Therefore I #8217;ve had this label placed on me only by my mum and not a professional that has made me feel depressed and like I was just different when I could have had an ADHD diagnosis and been happy with myself and got medication and things would have actually made sense. I said to my mum  #8220;I just found out PDA is not actually diagnosed in the U.K. I have never identified with it and the label only makes me miserable. There is no benefit from a diagnosis - no medication, people wouldn #8217;t know what it is if I told people I had it, and it has a load of weird sounding symptoms (to neurotypical people who don #8217;t understand) I don #8217;t have. Therefore I identify with it even less and I want to just forget I  #8220;have #8221; it. #8221; My mum will never change her opinion and I #8217;m sure we #8217;ll still be arguing about it in years to come.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have suffered with anxiety and have not been able to leave my house (bar very very occasionally going to my grandma #8217;s house) since September and haven #8217;t been able to go to school. I decided I should start running to get out of the house more and build up my confidence but it seemed pretty hard to even get out of the door. I didn #8217;t manage to go on a run for the whole of January but it #8217;s 1st of February and I went on my first run!! I am very unfit and stuff from not getting exercise for months and months but I jumped in at Couch to 5k week 4 because I want to join up with the running club in my town and that #8217;s where they #8217;re up to so I wanted to see if I would be able to do it and I could!! :)) I ran very very slowly but I really loved it!!! I was listening to energetic music some Queen, Journey, Avicii (can #8217;t have a running playlist without some Avicii) Panic! At The Disco, some 80s songs and some of The Greatest Showman soundtrack. I feel so good now that I #8217;ve done my first run!!! I #8217;m going to try and run 3 times a week now. Also loved Sarah Millican #8217;s commentary on the app  #128522; Feeling good!!!  #128516; #128150;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am 17 and have no friends. I have never had friends and am unimaginably lonely and depressed because of it</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-04 21:42:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>17 year old girl and I have never had friends. I have never had ACTUAL friends. I have a few people who like me and who might say  #8220;of course I #8217;m your friend #8217; if I were to ask them but we #8217;re not friends. They have their own friends. I have zero people to meet up with. My life is so so embarassing. I #8217;m the lamest person ever and I feel like no one should know about me because teenagers don #8217;t want to be friends with someone who has no friends. I am extremely behind my peers and it feels so wrong. I really struggle with my age because of the fact I will be an adult this year and I have been robbed of my teenage years. It feels so weird to be able to drive soon but not have done anything fun as a teenager. I basically have not been a teenager. I haven #8217;t done anything teenagers do. It feels so weird and embarassing not having done anything  #8220;bad #8221;. It #8217;s so not normal. And it #8217;s not because of responsibility/maturity; I was ready to do these things years ago, I just have no friends. I sob about it weekly because it is so painful. I haven #8217;t met up with anyone in months. I have about 1-2 people to meet up with per year (as opposed to every teenager having 5-10 friends to meet up with) and I wouldn #8217;t see them very often at all. I have never had a social life. Teenagers go to festivals, concerts, into the city. I #8217;ve never had to go on a bus, never been on a sesh, never been drunk, never been to an actual party with alcohol (went to about 3 (no alcohol) in FOUR YEARS as opposed to everyone going to at least one a month) and never even hung out in a park with people in the dark  #8212; NEVER. People like me in school. They chat to me and say I #8217;m nice. I don #8217;t come across a loner or weird kid. I blend in with them, you wouldn #8217;t know I #8217;m the one with no friends. Having no friends has extremely damaged my self esteem. My mum bought me a self esteem help book that had  #8220;list positive adjectives that describe you #8221; so I wrote them and realising I am nice, caring, understanding, funny etc makes me so depressed because I have no friends. People online (I live stream occasionally) compliment my personality and I get quite a lot of attention from boys who say I #8217;m attractive. But I have no friends and I mean zero. I don #8217;t have any friends and it #8217;s awful. I have always had no proper friends. Some people on my live have even said stuff like  #8220;I need you as a best friend #8221; or said  #8220;I bet you throw great parties #8221; or say  #8220;Do your friends...? #8221; and I don #8217;t let it show but it hurts me so much inside. Self help books presume you have friends. Everyone presumes you have friends. Because every teenager has friends even if you #8217;re not good looking, even if you #8217;re odd. Everyone else had friends. I will never understand why I don #8217;t have any friends because no one has ever said I #8217;m doing anything wrong. I feel like I #8217;m destined to be alone forever. And I won #8217;t have a social life and go clubbing when I #8217;m 18-30 because I won #8217;t have any friends. It has already been like this for 17 years so I #8217;m almost certain nothing will change. I #8217;ve also never had a boyfriend. I #8217;m going to be alone forever. I am diagnosed with high-functioning autism but don #8217;t present as having it at all. No ones picked up on it in 5 years of high school and my subject teachers have never thought anything was wrong with me. I definitely don #8217;t think I have any social skills problems (I communicate just like everyone else, face to face and in text), but then I don #8217;t have any friends. So something is clearly wrong with me. It #8217;s like I just have automatic no friends syndrome. My few friendships have never lasted. It #8217;s never because of a falling out. I get told I #8217;m so nice and some of them were so complimentary of me so I don #8217;t understand why I have no friends. I seem to be like a magnet repelling friendships. I #8217;m never important to anyone for a long amount of time. The furthest I #8217;ve ever gone with a friend is 20 minutes away, while people in my year go on holidays with friends. Everyone knows the names of their friends mums and has friends to FaceTime and talk to and gossip to and be there for and go out with and have fun with and talk to. I have no one. I have complete friendlessness and absolute loneliness and it makes me not want to be alive anymore. I can #8217;t believe I have 1 year left to be a teenager. Nothing is going to happen for me. I would give everything to have friends. I would pay tens of thousands to have friends. Meanwhile my twin goes out most nights of the week and goes to a party every month and drinks with friends and is a teenager and goes to friends houses and goes on sleepovers and invites friends to our house and is normal. She probably has 400 friends round for every 1 time I have a friend round. I don #8217;t care about the look of my bedroom because no one will see it. No friend has been in my room for about 3 years. There is nothing I can do about this and it will be the biggest factor if I committed suicide. Imagine what you would do without your friends. I can #8217;t believe I am having to live like this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>17F and ideal weight. I have been house bound due to depression and anxiety since September, only leaving once every 2 weeks to go out for maybe an hour to a cafe. I am very weak and stiff. I have recently started a running programme (Couch to 5K) to improve my mental health and right now I can run for 8 minutes. One of my fitness goals is to tone my body and I know you have to do weight training. I want to go to the gym (never been before) and start lifting weights, but the other day I did 15 squats and 15 lunges and it was enough to tire me out and be it for the day (pathetic I know, I #8217;m so weak from not going out) so I #8217;m worried if I go to the gym I #8217;ll have to quit and go home quickly and will be disappointed in myself. Just going 15 squats really made my legs ache, so should I wait until I get better at running before I go to the gym?? Or would it help me get stronger without me hurting myself? (Also if anyone could recommend any vitamins/supplements for someone who hasn #8217;t left the house or seen the sun (been legitimately nocturnal for months) for ages that would be appreciated)</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-14 13:16:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a lap tray to eat food on. We all have one. The kind with a sort of cushioned bit underneath. I have had it for as long as I can remember but never thought anything of it until today, when I thought I would lose it. The hob was on and I leant the tray on it by accident. Smoke started rising and when I lifted the tray off, all these little white polystyrene balls (the filling) were falling out of it like snow because it had burnt a large hole through the bottom of the tray. It was funny for about 2 seconds but then I started sobbing and went back to the sofa and cried. My mum and sister started cleaning the mess up, and no one comforted me. I thought they were binning it and was screaming (while sobbing)  #8220;I WANT IT FIXING! #8221; I really wouldn #8217;t have been surprised if my mother put the whole thing in the bin despite my distress, because she is so inconsiderate. They put it all in a bin bag and said it could be fixed. We all went back to the sofa in the living room and I was really really upset and said I couldn #8217;t eat now. My mum scowled  #8220;that #8217;s because it #8217;s a rule you #8217;ve made! That you need that tray! #8221; (She was very annoyed about the whole deal) I was so distressed and my mum made me feel extremely strange and weird because she was not acting accepting that I was upset about it. She made me really angry because she said something extremely rude (can #8217;t remember what it was) and I was telling her how EXTREMELY rude it was. While sobbing my eyes out, I really strongly said  #8220;You are so RUDE because you don #8217;t respect my autism and what is important to your autistic daughter!!!! You are being completely disrespectful #8221;. And she burst out laughing at me. I left the room. I went upstairs and put the white balls back in the tray and used duct tape to seal the hole while crying heavily. It took maybe 10 minutes and no one checked on me. My mum didn #8217;t actually give a shit about my distress the entire time. I managed to fix it. I went downstairs and said to my mum  #8220;I don #8217;t suppose you would have helped me. Because you just laughed at me. #8221; Honestly, I thought that would be enough to get an apology from her. I added,  #8220;And you wonder why I don #8217;t want to be autistic!!! #8221; She didn #8217;t apologise. She never apologises because she refuses to believe she #8217;s ever in the wrong. I think it #8217;s an authority thing. She tried to dodge apologising as I told her how she offended me by being highly insensitive and laughing at me. Then she yelled at me to get out of the room. She is so selfish. She also said it was  #8220;too big of an upset #8221; that she  #8220;didn #8217;t want to be bothered with it. #8221; She has previously told me to  #8220;turn my emotions down #8221;, as my  #8220;emotions were offensive #8221; and has told me condescending things like  #8220;just keep it quiet #8221; while I #8217;ve been in immense distress and she #8217;s turned the other way. Basically if I #8217;m  #8220;too upset #8221; she doesn #8217;t want to be bothered with comforting me. One time I was extremely depressed about having no friends and she supported me while I was extremely extremely low and sobbing my eyes out and then she later referred to it as my  #8220;barrage of noise she had to deal with #8221; which I was shocked by and that made me feel guilty for having emotions. Also one time she said  #8220;because of your MeNtaL hEaLtH problems #8221;, saying it in speech marks, when she knows I have been off school since September due to anxiety and depression and I have been prescribed an antidepressant. It was such a rude comment. She is so rude, selfish and disrespectful.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-15 17:53:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone. I #8217;m 17f and off school for the whole year (I stay at home and don #8217;t go out and have no friends) and realised I have lots of opportunity to smoke because my mum and sister go out for 1 hour or half an hour multiple times a day, or they have work and school. I #8217;ve never smoked before. If I could get weed and start smoking weed, I just know every single time I do it I would be so worried about them finding out when the get back home. We have an extremely high stress home life and I couldn #8217;t deal with fights over it. My mum would make endless offensive and rude comments over it and so would my sister and I just can #8217;t deal with that shit. Would it be worth it to smoke? Is it likely I #8217;d be caught?? I #8217;m 17 and haven #8217;t done anything teenagers are meant to do, and I #8217;ve wanted to do all of it since I was 13. Also it would give me something to do during the day... it would be fun. Also it might help me focus on school work or playing piano for hours. And I could enjoy music and just have a good time and relax. Would they notice me being high?? They #8217;d be looking me straight in the eye all the time. My sister has been high before, and she couldn #8217;t know either if I smoked. Would they notice me being in a really good mood? Could I just act it off???? When you get high can you still act not high or can you not control it? I really want to start smoking but can #8217;t get caught. Thanks x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see how my life #8217;s gonna go. I will be utterly friendless (always have been), will be unemployed, will have awful debilitating anxiety, will be depressed and will suffer from extreme stress, will be self medicating, will have so many emotions built up that I won #8217;t be able to manage, will realise how fucking much I #8217;ve failed and how my 10 year old self would be so disappointed about what I #8217;ve become. I won #8217;t have a boyfriend, I will not have a good relationship with my family, will be a complete burden/problem to my family like I always have been. I am taking this year off school because of mental health. I haven #8217;t done a SINGLE piece of work because I have hardly had motivation to live let alone do work that I don #8217;t think matters anymore. And when I go back to school my ADHD brain will be too overwhelmed with how much I have to catch up on that it will probably block it out and make me less interested in learning. So I won #8217;t pass any of my A Levels and at GCSEs I passed 4 and failed 6. I will be really poor. I will do job interviews and keep failing. I will be absolutely friendless and my self esteem will be destroyed. I will be painfully lonely like I always have been. I won #8217;t matter to anyone. I won #8217;t be able to look after myself and will feel so disgusted with myself and angry at myself and will start self harming. I won #8217;t enjoy things anymore and every day will look the same; filled with nothing but pain. And I #8216;ll find a way to kill myself. This could happen before I #8217;m 26.

    <TITLE>I think I was misdiagnosed by nmom, professional never diagnosed me and the label and her offensive comments just make me depressed</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-22 02:04:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 17f and  #8220;am diagnosed #8221; with a thing called Pathelogical Demand Avoidance which is basically where commands give you anxiety. I was  #8220;diagnosed #8221; when I was 8. I live in the U.K. and no one has heard of this thing and the label has always made me feel different and the odd one out but I don #8217;t present as having it and I appear to be neurotypical. My mum is absolutely fixated on that I have it and we have argued over it for years. She tries to relate everything I struggle with back to PDA (like saying motivation issues are because of your PDA when I #8217;m depressed or lazy). She has also once said I  #8220;freeze #8221; when she tells me to do something and she  #8220;sees it in my eyes #8221; and I was SO disgusted and mortified at this bullshit she was saying because she basically makes it up and half admits she doesn #8217;t know what she #8217;s talking about. She #8217;s also told me before I get a  #8220;sensation #8221; when she gives me a command which I just don #8217;t??? She can #8217;t see into my mind. I follow through on commands around the house MOST of the time she just only noticed the rare times where I say no. I don #8217;t actually have any of the official symptoms when you google them. Symptoms are stuff like  #8220;being extremely comfortable in role play and pretence #8221; and some PDAers have imaginary friends they spend 20 minutes talking to a day  #8212;- this is completely NOT ME and I don #8217;t want anyone to find out I have PDA because it #8217;s completely not me. I have showed my mum in the past year that I have most of the symptoms of primarily-inattentive ADHD and more than enough to be diagnosed and I think I have it. The doctor even gave us this official questionnaire and my mum and I filled it out together and she agreed with what I was putting down on the sheet, and it really seems like I have ADHD. I like reading r/adhd because I relate with a lot of the stuff there. Also if I get diagnosed with ADHD there #8217;s actually a community I could be a part of. But then she said I was just trying to  #8220;cover up #8221; having PDA and she felt betrayal because I was trying to disagree on the label she #8217;s put on me for years. She really believes I have it when all my symptoms are ADHD symptoms. She thinks I have PDA because I can #8217;t meet deadlines etc, but people with PDA have a thing where they almost automatically say no to all commands without thinking about it and I definitely don #8217;t. My mum has said before it would be hard for me to get an ADHD diagnosis because  #8220;you see, you #8217;re already diagnosed with PDA #8221; but it #8217;s not actually on paper anywhere and my mum just doesn #8217;t want me to get diagnosed with something else. I think it #8217;s so much more likely I have high-functioning autism (I don #8217;t present as having it because I #8217;m so high-functioning but I do have some traits of it) and ADD. I have told her  #8220;at parents evenings have my teachers ever said I was disobedient?! #8221; And she has said  #8220;in school you probably just do as your told to not get found out as having it by the other students. #8221; And I #8217;ve shown her videos of me as a toddler following commands even when the person doesn #8217;t say  #8216;please #8217; and doing as I #8217;m told. To have PDA you have to have avoided commands from a young age. The things she thinks are PDA symptoms are: my general anxiety, lack of motivation, not being able to concentrate, being talkative, being distractible, being lazy as in never tidying my room (she says I can #8217;t deal with the silent demand of tidying my room), completing work at the last minute and procrastinating. I feel like she just says everything is PDA. She also went through a phase of calling me  #8220;PDA kid! #8221; when I was about 13 but she has deeply and meaningfully apologised for this. I have NEVER identified with this diagnosis and it has just made me miserable. I want to get diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder because A) people have actually heard of it and even though people don #8217;t have a full understanding, they will at least not think you #8217;re unusual B) it could actually benefit me because I could get medication which would really help me with school C) I wouldn #8217;t mind telling my teachers because it #8217;s ALL THE EXPLANATION THEY NEED because I have ADHD symptoms, and if they look up PDA they will just think I think I #8217;m a cat which is NOT ME and I CANT HAVE PEOPLE THINKING I DO THAT. My mum for years has been trying to make me think I have PDA but I just don #8217;t identify with it. She has bought books (I just went and wrote on it all the things that are completely not me saying  #8220;you know your daughter!!!!! You know this isn #8217;t me!!!!! #8221;) and left printed out pages on my bed for me to read and I throw them away and get so annoyed. Then today I found out PDA isn #8217;t even diagnosed in the U.K.! It #8217;s not recognised enough as an ASD profile. Therefore I #8217;ve had this label placed on me only by my mum and not a professional that has made me feel depressed and like I was just different when I could have had an ADHD diagnosis and been happy with myself and got medication and things would have actually made sense. I said to my mum  #8220;I just found out PDA is not actually diagnosed in the U.K. I have never identified with it and the label only makes me miserable. There is no benefit from a diagnosis - no medication, people wouldn #8217;t know what it is if I told people I had it, and it has a load of weird sounding symptoms (to neurotypical people who don #8217;t understand) I don #8217;t have. Therefore I identify with it even less and I want to just forget I  #8220;have #8221; it. #8221; I just don #8217;t want to identify from something that will just make me miserable and this makes my mum so annoyed. My mum will never change her opinion and I #8217;m sure we #8217;ll still be arguing about it in years to come.</TEXT>

My twin is learning to drive and saving up for a car. I see myself failing so much every day. I know I won #8217;t be able to pay for a car until I #8217;m maybe 19. I #8217;m so unwell mentally. I can just see my life going down. There #8217;s no job or career I can see myself doing at all. I think I #8217;m going to be homeless. I can #8217;t go to school because I #8217;ve been signed off for the year because of my mental health. My chances at good A Levels have gone down the drain, I probably won #8217;t pass any.

    <TEXT>I suffer extremely from depression. I feel like for a lot of people with depression the wizarding world is sort of like this escape, a happy place only in their imagination that they want to believe exists. How much I #8217;d give to be able to go to Hogwarts and escape everything. Should I start reading the books? I #8217;ve never read them. Thanks for the award!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently feeling very very depressed and lost about the fact I #8217;m not 17. I am. But I don #8217;t feel it at all. I haven #8217;t done anything teenagers are meant to do  #128557; #128557; #128557; I #8217;m extremely not independent and am reliant on others and my mum. I can #8217;t do anything for myself.

I need to sell my old clothes I don #8217;t wear, buy new clothes, learn everything I #8217;ve missed out on, experience things I haven #8217;t experienced, learn to be independent, and fucking earn some money. I #8217;ve completely missed out on being a teenager because I #8217;ve never had friends  #128557; #128557; #128557; I #8217;ve had no friends my whole life and that #8217;s why I feel extremely out of the loop and alone. I feel like a massive walking embarassment. I feel so wrong and am suicidal because of my life generally and just need to feel normal. I just want to feel normal  #128557; #128557;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>17f. I have very long, straight, thick dark brown hair. It is always SO greasy to the point where I feel like I can #8217;t go out because of how it looks. It #8217;s been like this for the past 3 years and I used to have to heavily dry-shampoo my hair to go to school. I have been doing the r/curlyhair method for about 3 months which is small bit of shampoo at the roots, and generous conditioner (which I fully rinse out!) on the lengths and ends (both sulphate and silicone free) and then wash with deep cleanse clarifying shampoo once a month. I was my hair every other day. It has not improved the problem. My hair is SO greasy the next DAY after a shower. I could wash my hair in the AFTERNOON and the next day it will be greasy!!!! I feel like I only have every other day to go out! The greasy hair days I just stay in and most of the time don #8217;t bother getting dressed because I #8217;m ugly and won #8217;t even answer the door. My hair just sticks to my scalp because it #8217;s so greasy and dry shampoo won #8217;t even fix it. I just want to not have greasy hair! No one else has greasy hair  #128557; I am completely at my wit #8217;s end with this. I have major self esteem issues and just want to like my hair without it being such a problem  #128557; I would be so appreciative if anyone has any tips please?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>17 year old girl and basically a tiktoker called jesskeo makes fashion tiktoks because she loves the 70s-80s-90s style (like stranger things) and she literally wears clothes like that in every day life.

    <TEXT>Did you pick on me because everyone picked on me? Like would I have been your target if everyone else didn #8217;t pick on me Did you know that 13 people were being very horrid to me, but 5 other people were actually bullying me at the time that you were bullying me? Did it genuinely make you feel cool? Did you enjoy being a bully? How much did you actually know about my life? What was wrong with me that made you want to bully me? When did you realise you wanted to make me the target of your abuse and harassment for another 3 years? Did you ever think you should stop being so mean to me? Did you pick on me for any particular reason? Like could you see a reason why I deserved that? Did you really hate me as much as it looked like you did? Did you ever worry that I would harm myself because of the damage you were doing? (Stupid question) Did you actually want me to move schools because of you? Did you mean anything you said to me? Were you ever unnerved by the amount of damage you were doing? Did anyone ever come to you and say  #8220;I think you should stop bullying her/ you shouldn #8217;t do that #8221; and try and discourage you? Was tormenting me and teasing me a positive thing in your day? Did you ever care about how it made me feel or how it was affecting me? (Stupid question) Do you have a rough idea of how much damage you cause to me? If you could go back in time, would you be telling yourself not to do it or would you be encouraging yourself? Do you regret bullying me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>17f. I have immense, immense fear of the future. I only passed 4 GCSEs (approx 1.6 gpa) and didn #8217;t even get English Language. I got 4s and 5s (just about a pass). I am currently in Year 12 and am having to take this entire school year off due to mental health. It #8217;s not my fault, but it is my problem now. I entered high school as one of the smart people, predicted As and A*s. I was bullied severely and it took a toll on me. It looks like I #8217;m not going to get A Levels. I hate all the options I have for school in September. Some of them I really can #8217;t do because I can #8217;t commute because of my severe anxiety (I #8217;ve hardly been able to leave my house since September). I don #8217;t have many skills. I also have ADHD which means I struggle with executive function things: time management, prioritising, organisation etc. It all feels very weird because I am very behind my peers. I #8217;m extremely lame. I #8217;m 17 and not even had their first kiss, I #8217;ve never even held hands with a boy, never been drunk, never even had alcohol with friends, never been to a sesh, never been to a party, haven #8217;t had a friend round or been round a friend #8217;s for about 2 YEARS, never been to a concert or festival and never had a job. I #8217;ve missed out on being a teenager so thinking about becoming an adult is very weird. Everyone my age can drive and I can #8217;t even begin to think about driving lessons because I #8217;m broke. I am unable to work at the moment because of severe anxiety. I don #8217;t have a penny to my name apart from about  #163;100 Christmas money which needs to last me this year. My family is poor and my mum is on benefits and I don #8217;t want my life to be like this in the future. I want to have money. I am extremely extremely lonely and crave a social life so much. I want to go to uni, would I even get into one? When I recover my health and start thinking about getting my first job, I need to make a lot of money fast. As for a career, there is no job I could see myself doing, nothing I think I would be good at. I #8217;m completely at a loss. I have never felt more hopeless in my entire life. When I #8217;m 18+ my mental health will definitely spiral because I will be a failure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope it is okay for me to ask this question. I am 17 and trying to understand about the difference between Jesus and God. Do people pray to God or pray to Jesus? I think I have heard people say both. I #8217;ve also heard people say they worship God and I #8217;ve heard some say they worship Jesus, the son of God. I #8217;ve also heard people say  #8220;Jesus is Lord #8221; and also that  #8220;the Lord is our God. #8221; So are Jesus and God the same entity or are they separate individuals? If Jesus is God then why does he speak to God as though he is someone separate? If Christians worship both Jesus and God then why is it said that Christians worship one God? Also is Jesus a person? Please reply in terms easy to understand as I don #8217;t know much about Christianity :) Thank you</TEXT>

They probably won #8217;t be able to film in Summer 2020 because of the virus, and because Season 2 hasn #8217;t even been confirmed and they don #8217;t know what their casting needs will be, so will probably film in Summer 2021 after a lot more planning and release Season 2 around April 2022</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I daydream about it and think about it at night. But not in a pained way, not while in distress. Just calmly. I like the visual idea of me being in a hospital bed sending a Snapchat story out of me being there and alerting everyone on my social media that I tried to take my own life. I sort of idealise me being in that situation. But not me being dead- me having attempted but survived. I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s a thing of me wanting people to care about me or if I #8217;m being weird. I sort of feel like a bad person for romanticising me being in that place. Maybe I think if I was really in that situation people would care about me, people would finally like me. That I would have to be living on the edge for people to show they value me. I daydream about being in a hospital bed or being in a psych ward, sending a snapchat of my hand with a drip taped to it or me crying. I imagine if I would get replies of people showing concern and that they care about me. I sort of want that to happen. Not to attempt suicide but to receive the care some (not all) people receive afterwards. I want people to know how much I am struggling. Maybe I think I would have to be in that place to speak up. To reach out for help and write on social media about it. Then maybe people would listen</TEXT>

I said. anything. about a graveyard, Professor And it reveals Mad Eye Moody knew about it. I saw it in another movie where someone mentioned how  #8220;She drowned #8221; and they were only supposed to know she died and not that she drowned and the characters were like  #8216;HOLD UP- how do you know she drowned? #8217; and everyone in the audience is GASPINGGG because it reveals they were involved in the person #8217;s death In Episode 7 of Outer Banks, Ward white telling John B what he knows about their quest to get the gold, says  #8220;I know it could be in Figure Eight, it could be to do with Redfield, it could be to do with Tannyhill, Sarah gave you a map of Tannyhill...... #8221; and John B goes  #8220;What did you just say? #8221; Ward: The map of Tannyhill John B: No the other thing. And then it flashes back to the compass with Redfield engraved in it and I GASPED OMG. I just think it #8217;s such a good reveal and was wondering if there #8217;s a name for it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They say it in situations where they would only say  #8216;John #8217; like in fight scenes and intense shouting scenes. They also say it more than anyone else #8217;s name and in times where they would ask him a question without saying his name. They would still end the question with  #8220;.....John B? #8221; It #8217;s like in To All The Boys on Netflix with the girl called Lara Jean. That #8217;s her middle name but they always call her Lara Jean even in times when they would just say Lara. It got annoying. Also I #8217;m on episode 8 and I found the Ward vs John B boat fight kind of not believable. And also the Big John vs Ward fight was very unbelievable. Shows good though</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If anyone likes Outer Banks you might like ABC #8217;s Graceland</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-02 18:20:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>They took it off Netflix about a year ago but it #8217;s on Hulu and online It has the same vibe of surfy beachside mystery. It #8217;s set in California. 6 agents from the FBI, DEA and Customs all live together under cover in a beachside mansion called Graceland. 3 seasons. 25 episodes a season.  #8220;Gripping, addictive and sexy #8221; was used to describe it. It #8217;s very binge-watchable. Very deep characters. Once character Briggs is like an iceberg. There are no secrets in Graceland. They all have to keep their cover so their lies are their life. There #8217;s action, romance, comedy, drama basically every genre. If you like the last 5 episodes of Outer Banks you #8217;d like Graceland. The acting is REALLY good and realistic! It #8217;s action packed. There are some surfy vibes. Plus the cast is hot :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow what a great story!! TW/ self harm High Hopes also means a lot to me and is my favourite Panic song (I hate the idea that liking a band #8217;s most popular song makes you a fake fan - it #8217;s a great song.) High Hopes was the first song that really got me into Panic. I used to love hearing it on the radio because all the pop songs kind of sounded the same but then High Hopes would come on with the horns at the beginning and that glorious triumphant sound that is so uplifting and energetic. It has saved me from hurting myself a few times. I used to have urges to cut myself and I would put the radio on while I contemplated it. The first time, I was about to do it when the radio host said  #8220;Hang in there, we #8217;ve got High Hopes on for you next #8221;. Then the song came on. It distracted me instantly and made me rethink.  #8220;What am I doing? #8221; I listened to the song and I walked away from being about to hurt myself. The second time, I again put the radio on and I had such a strong urge to do it. I told myself  #8220;I #8217;ll stop if High Hopes comes on but it won #8217;t #8221;. It was the next song in the playlist. I was so surprised. I still had the urge but I thought  #8220;I CANT do it because that song just came on I #8217;m not doing it. #8221; It must have been a coincidence but this song kept coming on at the right moment and it kind of freaked me out. I then began thinking how Brendon wouldn #8217;t want me to do this and I put the tool down. I then googled into the lyrics and got obsessed with Panic. I haven #8217;t had any urges since and I #8217;ve discovered an awesome family of loving individuals, made friends, and found so much more music that I enjoy :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! This trigger list is courtesy of langfrd on twitter I probably should have put that. I haven #8217;t actually started the show yet because I #8217;m also a bit nervous so I can #8217;t say sorry. I would think it #8217;s one of the climactic episodes since some shooting happens. Someone on twitter said  #8220;Episode 6 is so unnecessary and has loads of scenes that would be so triggering to anyone who has been involved in a school shooting #8221;. Someone else said  #8220;The bit where Clay expressed his feelings in episode 6 was really hard to watch because no kid should have to go through that. #8221; Someone else said  #8220;gotta take a breather after episode 6 #8221; and someone else said  #8220;be careful if you watch it #8221; because apparently there #8217;s a school shooting in that episode x</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New girlfriend for Topper or Rafe?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-06 22:27:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m rewatching the season, I #8217;m on episode 3 and I #8217;m realising they are putting a lot of attention on a pretty blonde girl. She hangs out with Topper, Rafe and Kelce. I thought she was just an extra but actually at the pool party scene they put a lot of attention on her and she has wayyyy screen time than any other extra but she doesn #8217;t have an actual speaking part in the show. She looks like she could be a pretty, popular mean girl character in season 2 and new girlfriend to Topper or Rafe.</TEXT>

Is football a big thing at high school? Do you have like cheerleading and marching band and volleyball and softball and football and all that at your school? Do people actually refer to the sporty kids as  #8220;jocks #8221; or is that just in movies?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Not a Doctor) Heya I #8217;m so sorry you #8217;ve been having these problems. You #8217;re probably right that Xanax didn #8217;t cause the panic attack, it was just your anxiety. Thinking it was Xanax probably made you a bit hyperaware about taking it. The disorientation during panic attacks might be a thing called dissociation. I relate with having anxiety about anxiety and anxiety for no reason. It really sucks. I #8217;m glad you #8217;re seeing a therapist. There is absolutely hope to get better and to be able to enjoy life again. To answer your question, I #8217;m on amitriptyline which is a sedative antidepressant which isn #8217;t an SSRI. I really hope things look up for you soon friend :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, another teen here. You might find it helpful if you posted this in r/puberty. Having trouble finishing is very common. It can happen for a number of reasons; medication, medical conditions, alcohol, age, but the most common culprit is a very frequent and specific self-pleasuring style. So if you #8217;re attempting it very often or with a vigorous movement it might be harder to get off. Maybe try going slower and more gently so you don #8217;t get desensitised (making something less sensitive) too quickly. Also when you have a sexual experience with a partner for the first time, it is common to suffer from performance anxiety or nervousness which can affect your ability to get it up or finish. Performance issues are completely normal and some other culprits for it are drugs/alcohol, medications like antidepressants, dehydration, exhaustion, stress, and smoking. If you #8217;re worried I would suggest using the internet to find some resolutions as I know it would be embarassing to speak to a professional. Hope this helps :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I have an embarassing problem that #8217;s ruining my life</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-13 20:00:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Info: 147lbs, height is 5 #8217;7, I #8217;m currently on amitriptyline for anxiety. I have a thing called pollakiuria. I have had it for about 2 years. It was never that bad and I could still go to school and had to go to the bathroom between every lesson but I could still attend school. After an embarassing incident where I had to get up and leave a lesson because I needed to leave the bathroom and everyone laughed at me like I was a weirdo for leaving, my pollakiuria got a lot worse at school because of anxiety of needing the toilet more frequently. This meant I had to take about 2 weeks off school because I needed to go every 15 minutes at worse. I was a victim of very severe bullying throughout school that had only just cleared up by this time, so I was very anxious about this problem because I didn #8217;t want to get teased for having to go to the bathroom frequently. After that, my mental health spiralled and I was signed off school by a doctor. I have missed a whole year off school. If I am in a place where I #8217;m unable to access a bathroom, like a car journey or school assembly or just out with friends, the pollakiuria is stronger because of anxiety about not having access to a bathroom. An awful vicious cycle! Because of this, I can #8217;t go in car journeys for more than 5 minutes, can barely go on a run without having racing anxious thoughts, can #8217;t go to school and just can #8217;t go anywhere. My problem definitely gets worse when I #8217;m anxious. And I #8217;m anxious ABOUT IT which means it #8217;s such a vicious cycle and it #8217;s so inconvenient that I need the toilet more when I can #8217;t actually access a toilet. I have tried medication to relax the bladder and it hasn #8217;t worked. I am on an antidepressant for anxiety but I haven #8217;t seen it work. I really want my life back. I am too embarrassed to go out with friends because of how often I would have to go into food places or shops to use the bathroom. Even if I wanted to, they aren #8217;t open because of lockdown so I can #8217;t meet people. I am supposed to be going back to school in September and I #8217;m moving down to the year below. I have huge anxiety about this especially as I was previously bullied, and this will probably make my condition worse. I #8217;m so embarrassed about this problem that I can #8217;t tell anyone I know about it other than my family. My problem is EXTREMELY debilitating. I basically became a recluse in my house this year and only went out for about an hour a week. Returning to school seems so impossible to me that I think I might have to get addicted to benzodiazepines just to get through the last 2 years of school. I #8217;m desperate for this to get better but I don #8217;t know what I can do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it #8217;s not about that. It #8217;s if you are using something for a reference. If you are singing a song in your head and using the starting note to remember what C# is, you do not have perfect pitch. People who have perfect pitch know that C# is C# in the same way they know blue is blue and green is green. There #8217;s no thinking or connecting</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is not just a  #8216;chance #8217; that they will commit suicide if they #8217;re in this situation. I don #8217;t think you understand what it takes for a person to be suicidal. They have to be actually very unwell not just have strict parents that don #8217;t let them do stuff. Many people have shitty things in life. It does not mean there #8217;s a chance they #8217;ll commit suicide. As for why he shouldn #8217;t say stuff like this- no one in OP #8217;s described situation wants to hear something like that. I was bullied at school and I would have felt extremely uncomfortable and probably fearful if someone told me  #8220;you #8217;re probably at risk of suicide #8221;. No one wants to be told that people in your situation would be close to killing themself by now. That is very harmful. Many many people have strict, controlling or narcissistic parents but that does not mean they have a mental illness!!!!!! Saying  #8220;this is the typical scenario of a suicide victim #8221; is a messed up thing to say. Also there is no  #8216;typical scenarios #8217; of suicide victims! You said  #8220;if there is any chance a child would commit suicide they should be taken out of that situation #8221; - nothing here implies they are mentally ill. Many parents don #8217;t parent their kids well. Some add unnecessary pressure, some don #8217;t accept them because of sexuality or something. You can #8217;t just ASSUME that the child is at high risk of suicide because their relationship with their parents is not ideal. Having strict parents does not at all mean the child has a severe mental illness, is at risk of suicide, or unsafe !! You shouldn #8217;t assume that someone #8217;s situation could put them at risk of suicide and tell them this like you know anything about their life or their mental health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s a bad fear. I find it frightening that I have to commit to thinking about life in a whole different way and completely changing my outlook on life to  #8216;save myself #8217;. I find it pressurising and now that I know about it, I feel forced to believe in God, because of the pressure to save myself when I didn #8217;t even believe in this a few days ago. I #8217;m very sensitive and I feel guilty because I don #8217;t know if it #8217;s offensive that I am scared. I completely don #8217;t feel ready to become a Christian, while I do respect it and find some of it interesting. I #8217;m overwhelmed. Now I feel wrong about moving on with my life and coming back to Christianity in a couple of years when I #8217;m ready. I feel like from this day forward I #8217;m sinning. And I feel guilty. I don #8217;t know what to do. I wish I hadn #8217;t learnt about Christianity this week because I #8217;m not ready to commit to the faith. I wish I could unlearn and the relearn in a couple of years when I am actually ready to come to God. Then I wouldn #8217;t feel like a bad person until then. I also worry that by me not practicing Christianity until I am ready, it #8217;s like God has reached out his hand to me and I am rejecting it. I feel guilty. I feel alone. I feel lost instead of found having learnt about Christianity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you!! Is it okay if I choose to not start my journey now? I wish I could unlearn and relearn when I #8217;m ready to commit to the faith. I feel very uncomfortable and anxious that I have discovered this at the wrong moment. It really doesn #8217;t feel right to me and I am overwhelmed and want to wait a couple years before I consider becoming a Christian. All the concepts are frightening and new to me. I don #8217;t feel ready at all and I don #8217;t like this feeling that I #8217;m forced when I don #8217;t want to embark on that journey yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine would be twitter because I enjoy it most of the time and it #8217;s interesting but sometimes it gets a bit crazy because it #8217;s full of people #8217;s opinions so it gets a bit controversial sometimes.

    <TEXT>Lol. I just think it #8217;s not actually free will. People are presented with the terrifying consequences of living without God and they feel forced to follow God now that they have heard that. For me, when people tried to share their faith with me after I asked questions about Christianity, I was terrified and so overwhelmed I was crying and shaking and wished I never asked. I know they meant well and were trying to be kind but they really scared me about it. And I made the choice to continue being atheist because that #8217;s what I want to do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm that sounds tricky. Maybe reinforce that you #8217;re on their side and want to help, and ask them for details so you can get something done about it. Then if they say it #8217;s not a big deal, tell them that any accusations need to go to officials like teachers and the school board instead of spread around the school like Chinese whispers which doesn #8217;t help anyone, especially when the culprit doesn #8217;t think it #8217;s a problem big enough to be investigated. Let them know how serious accusations are and how much it can be turned into something serious they didn #8217;t want happening if they let the rumours run around the student body. The accusations are so serious that they need to be investigated by officials if they #8217;re legitimate and remind everyone that they #8217;re welcome to come forward to the student council to file an actual official report if they want to make a complaint.</TEXT>

So at least it #8217;s a legit shop lol. And yes I have ordered stuff and love it!!! My favourite shop :)) I actually have another order in the mail waiting to come right now lol. I would just warn you some of the items are made of cheap material. In the item description it tells you what material it is. So if you had two similar T-shirt #8217;s and one was 100% cotton and the other was 20% cotton 80% polyester, go for the 100% cotton As for hacking, I have never experienced that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tell yourself a gentle reminder that negativity and worrying you can do in the day, but night is for sleep and resting. Gently remind yourself that these negative feelings are not serving you, so you can try and let go of them and relax for the night. If the thoughts come back you could just gently note it as  #8220;thinking #8221; or  #8220;feeling #8221; and acknowledge them and they should pass. Have an attitude of self care / self love (I know it #8217;s easier said than done but you deserve it) and think  #8220;I #8217;m going to take care of myself and sleep now #8221; and maybe try watching something relaxing before bed.

School and normal life (I #8217;m not able to spend more than half an hour out of my house, especially with places with bathrooms being closed) seems impossible. I also would be risking benzo addiction. It is so important that I finish school so I consider it worth the risk. It #8217;s such a tricky situation.

    <TEXT>I have never lost a pet so I admit I don #8217;t understand about the grief. But if I could offer any advice it would be to spend a lot of time with your pal and make happy memories. The good memories, as I saw someone write here, will help with the grief as you will remember them with smiles and happy memories. The joy of having the pet in your life for so many years, all that joy will be greater than the pain when you lose them. I know the love and the bond is so strong, I #8217;m sure your cat is the goodest boy. The fact you have time to prepare as well will soften the blow as it won #8217;t be unexpected and since you can come to terms and accept the fact that it #8217;s going to happen you probably won #8217;t have the denial stage. I can only imagine how awful losing a pet would be. If I lost one of my cats I would honestly cry non stop for months. Some vets offer pet bereavement services, by the way. My grandma went to one after her dog was put down and she said it was amazing and helped her a lot. The people were all extremely kind and understanding. Grief will be hard but you can get through it. Remember the good times, cherish the memories and remember your pal with smiles. Also take lots of videos, even just of them walking around and purring and licking themself and meow-ing. And if it was me in this situation I would want to take some of my cats fur (it #8217;s malting season because of the heat) and put it in a little box. Also think about how your cat has had a long and good life. I #8217;m sorry if this hasn #8217;t helped at all. Sending all the best wishes xx</TEXT>

I was thinking about how my life was a lot nicer when I could go to the mall 20 minutes away or meet with other people my age but now that is all really impossible.

    <TEXT>I woke up with a frown on my face, silently made my bed, silently got dressed and came to sit on the sofa downstairs. Everything is quiet. I feel like there is no sound in the air around me. I feel like I #8217;m a bug and someone #8217;s place an overturned glass on top of me - I feel cut off from everything and alone. The fight we had in our household last night affected me. I #8217;m tired. I feel like I could cry but nothing has even made me upset yet. I feel like I can #8217;t smile. I feel like my mood has fallen miles below where it was yesterday and I #8217;m too tired to do anything about it. Are there some words that describe this feeling that aren #8217;t depressed?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish they had some shots of the audience or the theatre to build the atmosphere! Not throughout the show, but at the beginning as like an intro to the movie, like what they do in a documentary. Music like an overture and shots of the beautiful theatre interior, stage manager being like  #8220;places #8221;, Lacamoire and other musicians preparing, shots of the Richard Rogers Theatre outside and audience entering through the doors, crew tearing someone #8217;s ticket upon entrance, and the house lights going down (that really builds anticipation when you #8217;re in the theatre!) and then Burr entering and delivering that famous opening line. And just one shot of the thunderous standing ovation at the end would have been awesome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you yeah I will try to let her know it has a bad effect on me. I think she has either paranoid or histrionic personality disorder. She overreacts extremely. Last time she cut me out of her life for 3 months it was because I aired her without even meaning to. I reassured her I didn #8217;t even mean to but she said I was no good for her. She might have a fear of being abandoned by friends causing her to end it when she thinks they might leave her</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I might watch the show. I have heard episode 6 is the extreme one. I am a very sensitive person who has severe anxiety. I enjoyed the first 3 seasons. I don #8217;t like tense stuff. I don #8217;t like scary scenes or traumatic scenes. Last time when I watched season 1 episode 13 and season 2 episode 13 it was in my mind for the following weeks and I couldn #8217;t shake it. Is episode 6 very intense???? Should I skip the whole thing? Or would it be okay compared to the other season 4 episodes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry but what the FUCK??? This is SO fucked up! I #8217;m really sorry she had to put up with your homophobic ass. And you sound like a fucking AWFUL person, my god. Sorry but what the fuck you #8217;re  #8220;waiting for her to die #8221; so she can go to hell? Go fuck yourself you horrible and homophobic person. And don #8217;t push religion on other people just because you #8217;re a homophobe. I don #8217;t care if she fucking bullied you, homophobia or wishing for someone to die is not okay. This tells me a lot more about you than about this girl. You #8217;re horrible. Also you don #8217;t have to wait for someone to die for you to forgive them- haven #8217;t you ever heard of  #8220;as we forgive those who sin against us #8221;???? Yeah shut up. I can #8217;t get over how you said you #8217;re WAITING FOR HER TO DIE Jesus fucking Christ you #8217;re evil. And by the way make sure you keep your homophobia to yourself. 1) being gay is okay 2) I seriously home you never intend to bully someone for being gay.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What #8217;s your screen time? And how much of your usage is Tiktok?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-10 18:18:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>My daily average for the week is 10h 32m! My total weekly screen time is 52h 40m. I spend 6m on YouTube as opposed to 17 hours weekly on Tiktok! 17/52 hours is Tiktok. That #8217;s roughly 40% of my time on my phone. I really do have a problem. The moment I fix my sleep pattern from being nocturnal, I will set up Screen Time limits. A friend of mine told me she only spends about 10 minutes on her phone because she is so busy, which is really admirable. I feel ashamed because I am legit addicted to my phone. I want to improve and aim to bring it down to 6 hour daily screen time instead of 10.5 hours. Also I #8217;d appreciate any tips :) Here are some tips to reduce screen time that I have got from these comments! Listen to the radio so you don #8217;t pick up your phone for music. Try and find a new hobby like drawing for example. Watch video content on a laptop or TV so you #8217;re not watching a small screen. You might not like this one but having no phone from 7pm is really good!!!! Only takes about 2 weeks before it becomes routine. It was our house rule until we were 16 and it worked great and we would just watch tv in the evenings! Inverting colours on your display settings (iPhone) sets your phone to black and white and makes you not pick it up so much and watch less video content! Also powering you phone fully off instead of just clicking the screen off is helpful. Also someone suggested leaving your phone in different rooms instead of waking around with it on you :) Even if you just do one of these you will really help yourself :) hope this helps x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they didn #8217;t go out of there way to make your school experience a misery and target you I #8217;m not sure. But exclusion is definitely a big way people bully people. I think the friend telling you you were annoying to be around was unkind. People can be mean and nasty without bullying. Bullying is defined as  #8220;to seek to harm, intimidate or coerce someone who is perceived as vulnerable. #8221; If they didn #8217;t make continuous efforts to do this to you it wouldn #8217;t be bullying. Obviously I don #8217;t know everything about your experience and I would never want to belittle someone #8217;s experiences. These are just my thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;People are lying until they get an official diagnosis #8221; - straight up not true. That is a really really harmful mindset to have. Firstly, if we take depression for an example: suicide is the leading cause of death in men aged 29-40 and the third leading cause of death in people aged 15-19 - most people are not faking depression. Secondly, I don #8217;t think you realise how hard it is to get a diagnosis! Here in the U.K. the waiting list to see Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services is 7-9 months!! If someone is depressed they know they are depressed. Depression is a feeling like no other. If this persists for a long period of time they probably have a depressive disorder and should seek treatment. In America where they have to pay for healthcare people often struggle to get diagnoses due to that. Also diagnosis does not = validation!!!! Most people who struggle with depression for a significant time in their life aren #8217;t diagnosed. This does not mean they FAKED it and this does not belittle or invalidate their struggle. If someone says they have anxiety or depression I swear to god please don #8217;t fucking ask if they have been diagnosed. Also please don #8217;t just assume people are lying about their mental health!!! This really really adds to the damaging stigma that people who struggle with mental illness are attention seeking. Many people don #8217;t even consider reaching out for fear of being called an attention seeker because people like you assume the worst in people. I mentioned I had depression in a comment on a YouTube video of an uplifting song and some asshole went and replied  #8220;probably fake depression #8221;. What a JUDGMENTAL ignorant asshole to assume I #8217;m faking my illness. I told them how invalidating it was seeing as they don #8217;t know the first thing about my life and have no right to tell me how I do/don #8217;t feel and how harmful it is for them to assume people who have depression are attention seekers. It #8217;s the most you could possibly do to add to stigma around mental health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is a really really harmful mindset to have. Firstly, if we take depression for an example: suicide is the leading cause of death in men aged 29-40 and the third leading cause of death in people aged 15-19 - most people are not faking depression. Secondly, I don #8217;t think you realise how hard it is to get a diagnosis! Here in the U.K. the waiting list to see Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services is 7-9 months!! If someone is depressed they know they are depressed. Depression is a feeling like no other. If this persists for a long period of time they probably have a depressive disorder and should seek treatment. In America where they have to pay for healthcare people often struggle to get diagnoses due to that. Also diagnosis does not = validation!!!! Most people who struggle with depression for a significant time in their life aren #8217;t diagnosed. This does not mean they FAKED it and this does not belittle or invalidate their struggle. If someone says they have anxiety or depression I swear to god please don #8217;t fucking ask if they have been diagnosed. Also please don #8217;t just assume people are lying about their mental health!!! This really really adds to the damaging stigma that people who struggle with mental illness are attention seeking. Many people don #8217;t even consider reaching out for fear of being called an attention seeker because people like you assume the worst in people. I mentioned I had depression in a comment on a YouTube video of an uplifting song and some asshole went and replied  #8220;probably fake depression #8221;. What a JUDGMENTAL ignorant asshole to assume I #8217;m faking my illness. I told them how invalidating it was seeing as they don #8217;t know the first thing about my life and have no right to tell me how I do/don #8217;t feel and how harmful it is for them to assume people who have depression are attention seekers. It #8217;s the most you could possibly do to add to stigma around mental health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;I #8217;m not saying they don #8217;t have it #8221; yes you are. You #8217;re the most ignorant person I #8217;ve ever seen in this sub. And yes they do get to fucking talk about their mental health thank you very much. You do not get to silence anyone or make your attempts to add to the stigma around mental health.  #8220;If you haven #8217;t been diagnosed especially with all the free resources here #8221; you clearly don #8217;t know the FIRST THING about what a diagnosis is. You are openly saying people who struggle with mental illness are attention seeking and use it as an excuse. How extremely JUDGMENTAL and ignorant. You have CLEARLY never struggled because otherwise you would know people don #8217;t throw it around as an excuse at every mile inconvenience and you would be at least slightly educated and understanding instead of oozing extreme ignorance. You clearly have the fucked up, irrational, judgmental and damaging idea that people who struggle with mental illness are attention seeking. You have an extremely harmful and toxic mindset and if you want to be a decent person you need to change.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People who think people fake depression for attention have clearly never been in that situation because then they would know that unlike when you break your arm and everyone runs forward to sign the cast, if you say you have depression people turn the other way. People who struggle with their mental health more often than not become more isolated, they don #8217;t receive a lot of support for opening up. You also seem to think it is easy for people to get help. Thanks to people like you, many people don #8217;t even consider getting help for fear of being viewed as an attention-seeker. If you have an ILLNESS that is eating away at you and causing suffering you need to get help. Your  #8220;attention-seekers #8221; attitude is very harmful and you fail to see it because you #8217;re ignorant and can #8217;t understand how you #8217;re stigmatising. I #8217;m so surprised as someone who has struggled with it you are so ignorant. Were you diagnosed?? Because otherwise  #8220;people who aren #8217;t diagnosed are lying #8221; so you must have been attention-seeking(?). Do you realise how extremely toxic and invalidating it is now? Calling someone struggling an attention seeker is extremely offensive and will make them feel hopeless and like they #8217;ll never be understood.  #8220;If you wanna sit on this broken arm forever and get people to sign it and talk to you I #8217;m gonna think it #8217;s fake #8221; - you CLEARLY have zero clue about how to support a person with depression!!! This reeks of ignorance. Did you even go to counselling??????? A person opening up IS them helping themselves. To open up about ones mental health is a very brave act. I would have thought someone who has been there themselves would want to promote talking instead of adding to stigma and being part of the problem. Your last sentence just rounds it off as  #8220;If you talk about it I #8217;m gonna think it #8217;s fake. #8221; I feel very sorry for your friends because you are so unsupportive about mental health problems, extremely ignorant and extremely judgmental. You are doing the most you can to add to stigma about mental health and you are so cynical and ignorant that you would turn the other way to people who are struggling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah yeah also some people didn #8217;t understand that they showed Hannah still going about her day as normal. But it just goes to show how much of an invisible battle depression is and how people who seem fine and cheerful can be going through a whole lot you know nothing about. I wish they showed more of her behind the scenes struggle though. I think something really affective to have would have been a shot of her arriving home one evening. and the camera doesn #8217;t follow her in and remains on a wide shot of the front of her house, she shuts the door and we hear her break down sobbing. I saw that done in a movie and it was so heart wrenching and effective. Or they could have shown one of Hannah #8217;s mornings. Slowly, silently, getting out of bed, walking to the bathroom, brush teeth, get school bag, leave and go to school feeling so empty and exhausted. I wish we saw more of how upset Hannah was when she was alone. Because there just have been so many of those times. It would also help with showing the affect bullying has on a person</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it weren #8217;t for the fact that my family would be sad, I would give my life up for Brendon Urie. I watched his twitch stream for 4-8 hours every day of 2019. Some days it was even longer and we did a 24 hour stream a couple times. Our community is so tight knit. We have all experienced worry over if we lost him as we sometimes tragically lose people in the music industry. We #8217;re always excited to see him every day and he spoke to me more than my dad in 2019 lol. Feel free to judge but we do have such a good-artist relationship with him. I know how many people would be broken if we lost him and some beautiful people would take their lives, so I #8217;d for sure die for him lol. Too deep?</TEXT>

People without perfect pitch can do it. If you have perfect pitch of course you have to learn that that tone is called A, and learn the names of the notes, but once you know what it sounds like you will be able to identify an A wherever you hear it without using anything as a reference if you have perfect pitch.</TEXT>

Choirs can go into the next song in their set without hearing the starting notes off a piano. Little kids can sing pop songs in the right pitch. My mum can whistle round the house on key. Most people even those who aren #8217;t musicians can just sing in the right key but would not be able to say  #8220;that #8217;s a G #8221; if they were played a G</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OMG YESSSS! Keep going it is sooo worth it. If you don #8217;t get results, reassure yourself you build your MENTAL strength too by doing these workouts and you will have mental gains for sure. I know how challenging the 2 week shred is!! But I also know you can definitely do this!! Once you complete the challenge you will feel so proud and will probably see the point in continuing for another week or two. It is so worth it!! I would really advise walking a lot every day, or going on a run every other day in addition if you want results. Doing these workouts means you accomplish something every day. I think they #8217;re so great and we #8217;re so lucky to have this for free. I know it #8217;s hard to get motivated sometimes (I had so many days where I didn #8217;t want to do it) but think how happy you will be when you #8217;ve completed it!! You #8217;ll be like  #8220;I fucking did that!! #8221;! I #8217;m proud of you for doing it today and even if tomorrow you only do a bit of it then I #8217;m proud of you for that.

    <TEXT>My personal view is that this isn #8217;t bullying, but rather an extremely critical and toxic friend who made you feel bad about yourself. The reasons I think it #8217;s not bullying are A) it #8217;s not performative B) they don #8217;t seek to intimidate or harm you, they probably think they are just expressing their frustrations (albeit ridiculous) about you or are trying to help you improve yourself (which obviously hurts your feelings because they #8217;re being ridiculous) C) it #8217;s in a friendship. Also the leaving you out thing is awful. I #8217;m glad you #8217;re not friends with people who are that unkind without even thinking about it. My twin has had an overly critical friend who also kept her out of plans so I know it #8217;s toxic. Abusive friendships are a real thing and can be as traumatic as abusive relationships. I wouldn #8217;t call it bullying though, it #8217;s a different kind of relationship</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My opinion: unhealthy Although it #8217;s great she inspired you to improve your life (I changed a lot when I had a crush too) I think your chances with her are small as you already know so it is unwise to spend this much time thinking about her. I feel like it #8217;s almost a waste of your time and emotions. Love is great and also sucks. I know how when you have a crush you seriously seriously cling on to any kind of hope the love will be reciprocated but really try to think:  #8220;how great are the chances, are the chances really in my favour? #8221; Let me advise you as a person on the internet: I don #8217;t think you have a big shot so I don #8217;t think it #8217;s worth your energy. I think the two things you could do are A) try and get over the crush B) Tell her you have feelings for her and see what her reaction is. If it #8217;s positive then GREATTT, if it #8217;s negative then at least you have closure, knowing she #8217;s not interested will mean you can get over her quicker, it won #8217;t be too embarassing because you hardly see her, and you can begin to get over the crush and move on.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hi! I #8217;m a trusted victim assistant here, I #8217;d like to introduce myself</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-23 23:08:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! I #8217;m a TVA here which means I am available to give you guys support. I was bullied severely for 4 years in high school (was also teased and tormented in middle school but it was nothing compared to high school) by 13 different people and 6 of them at once. It was very much gang bullying and people knew me as the  #8220;most hated #8221; girl in the year. I have had to take this year off school due to my mental health which spiralled as a result of the bullying. I used to come home with notes written on my hand of all the things that were said to me and then when I would get home I would break into tears weekly. I know what it #8217;s like which is why I can understand what you #8217;re going through. If you #8217;re being targeted and are a victim of bullying, and would rather talk privately feel free to message me and I will try my best to listen and support you. I won #8217;t ask who you are, I won #8217;t reveal who you are, I won #8217;t judge you and I won #8217;t ask any further questions if you don't feel like talking. I am also completely fine with you not answering messages straight away. There is no pressure to reply straight away and if you don #8217;t feel like talking or it #8217;s a few days between messages that #8217;s totally okay! :) You need to rant? I #8217;ll listen. You need advice? I #8217;ll try my best. You need to get something off your chest? It will stay between us. No matter what you have experienced, I will try my best to support you. Again, I'm a Trusted Victim Assistant which means I am available to chat and I want this role so don #8217;t feel ashamed or like a bother for messaging me!! By the way my pronouns are she/her. I respect you and your gender identity :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey my friend, I #8217;m sorry things are so difficult right now. If you #8217;re in the UK, what I would suggest you do is contact social services. It #8217;s not as scary as it sounds. You could go to the Childline website and do a 1-2-1 counsellor chat. You can ask them for the email for the Children #8217;s social services in your area. You can email them and just say exactly what you have said in this post. They are used to receiving emails of children needing help in situations like yours, so it won #8217;t be weird for them to receive. You can say at the end  #8220;Please contact me and let me know in the case that you need to share information or contact my parents #8221;. It will all be confidential and they won #8217;t take any action without talking to you first. They would be the people to chat to for you to get help with the living arrangements and support about having family who do drugs. Another way you can get support (if you #8217;re in the U.K.) is emailing Samaritans. Now, the phone number is for crisis situations, but the email is for anything! It doesn #8217;t have to be crisis. You can email jo@samaritans.org and a volunteer who will use the name Jo will answer. You can write paragraphs about anything you #8217;re going through and your feelings, and you will get a reply. It is completely confidential and they can give you advice and support. I hope this helps. Things will get better soon, trust me</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why the heck is sexual assault normalised?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-24 22:22:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>An post on rape culture including how you can help abolish rape culture. Rape culture: a culture in which sexual violence is treated as the norm and victims are blamed for their own assaults. It is about cultural norms and institutions that protect racists, promote impunity, shame victims, and demand that women make unreasonable sacrifices to avoid sexual assault. It #8217;s situations in which sexual assault is ignored, trivialised, normalised or made into jokes. Although rape culture has its roots in long-standing patriarchal power structures that were designed to benefit men, today #8217;s rape culture burdens men too - for instance, by ignoring the fact that men can be victims of rape and sexual assault, and women can be perpetrators of it. Male victims are also left without legal protection and social support and it is even harder for male victims to speak out about it and be believed. Rape culture blames victims which allows for impunity of perpetrators. It treats rape and sexual assault as a result of the behaviour of potential victims rather than the behaviour of potential rapists. In 2011, a Toronto police officer sparked the global  #8220;slutwalk #8221; protest movement when he told female students that  #8220;Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order to not be victimised. #8221; This blames victims for their ordeals of rape or sexual assault. Shifting the blame off the rapist and onto the victim allows for the rapist #8217;s exemption from punishment which is part of the reason so few rapists are convicted. There is also the unwillingness and/or inability to punish the perpetrators of rape or sexual assault. Police officers, prosecutors and juries often cling to the stereotypical image of  #8220;real #8221; rape, where the crime consists of a forcible attack, perpetrated by a male stranger on a female victim who had not been drinking or behaving in a sexually provocative manner, and is immediately reported to a law enforcement and supported by ample physical evidence. Crimes that do not fit that stereotypical pattern are often overlooked by law enforcement or the cases are dropped by prosecutors who believe - often correctly - that they will be rejected by juries. And it isn #8217;t just the legal system: schools, universities and the military routinely fail to address sexual assaults within their institutions. Rape culture makes accounts hard to measure, which makes rape more common than reported. Stigma, victim-blaming and the (often correct) assumption that reporting a rape or SA to law enforcement won #8217;t result in prosecution makes many victims reluctant to come forward and the stereotypes about what constitutes  #8220;real #8221; rape affect the data-gathering because if the crime is too narrowly defined, then the information won #8217;t be added to statistics. . How you enable rape culture:  #8226; You remain friends with known/accused perpetrators  #8226; Your first instinct is to discredit a victim #8217;s story or ask  #8220;What were you wearing? #8221;  #8226; You refuse to educate yourself of women #8217;s struggles and see no need for feminism  #8226; You continue to support known abusers (celebrities, public figures, etc)  #8226; You joke about rape - recognise the privilege you have to be able to joke about it while others have to live with the trauma of it forever  #8226; You think some women are  #8220;asking for it #8221; or deserve to be raped because they were drunk or dressed a certain way  #8226; When women talk about abuse you bring up how men can be abused too. It #8217;s like saying  #8220;All lives matter #8221; in response to  #8220;Black lives matter #8221;; it #8217;s truthful, but hurtful and insensitive in the moment. If the only time you bring up male abuse is in response to women speaking about their experiences your concern is not legitimate. . What you can do to help abolish rape culture (source: UN Women): 1. Create a culture of enthusiastic consent. Instead of listening for a  #8220;no #8221;, make sure there is an active  #8220;yes #8221; from all involved 2. When discussing cases of sexual violence, consider a victim #8217;s sobriety, clothes and sexuality irrelevant 3. Rape culture is allowed to continue when we buy into ideas of masculinity that see violence and dominance as  #8220;strong #8221; and  #8220;male #8221;, and when women and girls are less valued or even objectified. Instead of supporting this, counter the idea that men and boys must obtain power through violence and question the nature of sex as an entitlement 4. Self reflect. Take a look at what masculinity means to you and redefine masculinities to have feminist principles 5. Never call anyone a slut or any other derogatory term relating to a woman #8217;s sexuality 6. Broaden your understanding of rape culture. 7. Recognise your privilege if you are male. Recognise that if you do not fall on the LGBTQ+ spectrum and can stay out of prison your chances of being raped are so low as to be negligible (of course there are still male victims) and you are not taught to fear walking alone or after dark in public spaces. If I was a guy for a day I would simply go for long walks in the middle of the night. 8. Follow feminists (reminder that it does not mean to support women rather than men, but to support equality between the sexes) and activists 9. Listen to survivors and hear their stories 10. Don #8217;t make rape jokes and if you see someone make one, call it out 11. Educate the next generation and talk to friends about how you can help end rape culture in your communities I found this information educational and important so I thought I would make a post to share it in this sub, as it is always key to raise awareness about modern social issues.

I said something polite and wasn #8217;t mean but I wasn #8217;t as kind as I could have been and I #8217;m sure I hurt his feelings.

    <TEXT>Hey, I #8217;m sorry you #8217;re going through a difficult time at school. These people sound so awful. Such ugly, ugly behaviour from them. I was bullied very badly at high school so I can understand what it #8217;s like. They are bullying you because of their own issues, you don #8217;t deserve a single second of it. They are probably targeting you because you #8217;re a good person and it will make them feel better about themselves if they can make you feel worse about yourself. Bullies are threatened by brilliant people, so in a weird way it #8217;s a compliment. They see themselves as superior and feel the need to pick on the best people and bring them down to raise their profile. There #8217;s one way to get back at bullies and that #8217;s by being happy and successful. To heal, forgive and love yourself is the best revenge. These despicable people who treat you like this are likely very sad. No one 100% in love with their life wants to bully another person. One thing you can do for yourself which is like a sort of defence shield in a way, is you can know your own truth. Because the bullies are going to try and make you think things about yourself. That is their whole goal. They want you to think you #8217;re the problem (when actually it #8217;s just their own issues). They want you to think that you #8217;re not likeable. It #8217;s very important that you know this is absolute bullshit  #128154;. Bullies are manipulative and they are liars. They are mentally messed up anyway because they are resorting to pushing someone down to try and feel better about themselves. They are gonna try and make you feel bad, and like you #8217;re not a good person. It is so so so so important to know this is a lie. It #8217;s essential for your mental health that deep down you know in your heart and always understand that there is nothing wrong with you, no matter what they tell you. Know that you are amazing (and all the other good qualities you are) and these people are just insecure and their words do not mean anything. They are liars who are just pathetically trying to be unkind. It is really helpful to know these truths: 1) I am too brilliant, kind and amazing that these insecure people can #8217;t resist trying to hurt me because of their own insecurities 2) I am worth so so much and I am in love with the person I am and I don #8217;t need to change 3) the bullies #8217; words are meaningless and empty. Their words stem from a place of jealousy and unkindness and aren #8217;t accurate. The bullies #8217; words about me are not true and therefore have no power over me. 4) these bullies have little to no matter to me. They are not important to me. Therefore I do not value what they say about me. 5) I pity the bullies for wanting to put so much of their energy into being toxic and being so negatively obsessed with me. Instead of choosing to believe the horrible things the bullies were saying about me like I wasn #8217;t likeable, I wasn #8217;t enough - I chose to believe these things ^ because these are the statements that are true and the bullies #8217; taunts are so inaccurate and pathetic that they #8217;re not worth anyone #8217;s time. A really good idea, if you haven #8217;t done it already, is to tell the school. There are ways to go about it where you won #8217;t look like a snitch (also it #8217;s not actually being a snitch- snitching is when the thing doesn #8217;t affect you, like if people steal from school and you tell on them, but when it does affect you it #8217;s not snitching, it #8217;s getting help). You and your parent can email the teachers and talk about it and if the teachers speak to the bullies, they can tell the bullies that  #8220;A member of staff has found out and told me that... #8221;. Teachers intervening is how my bullying was ultimately stopped for good. My mum and I would report the incidents to the teacher through email, saying which teachers were nearby, the Deputy Head would bring the bullies into his office, tell them he #8217;d heard word of the bullying from staff, shout at them and tell them to leave me alone or else they would be straight back in that office. The bullies tested it a little bit for a few weeks but then left me alone and it was over. For support, a really good service is Childline. It #8217;s great. I think the fact it #8217;s called  #8216;Child #8217;line and not something more adult sounding puts people off lol. I called Childline for the first time the other week and a counsellor named Sue answered and was extremely nice and understanding and spoke to me for a good 40 minutes. It was so nice to speak to a stranger, and someone who really listened and understood me. Now I #8217;ve called it once, I #8217;ll definitely do it again. There is also the 1-2-1 counsellor chat on the website. And of course, all of this is confidential. Another way you can get support (if you #8217;re in the U.K.) is emailing Samaritans. Now, the phone number is for crisis situations, but the email is for anything! It doesn #8217;t have to be crisis. You can email jo@samaritans.org and a volunteer who will use the name Jo will answer. You can write paragraphs about anything you #8217;re going through and your feelings, and you will get a reply. It is completely confidential and they can give you advice and support. My last advice would be to just try to stay positive, stay hopeful and know that none of these people will matter in a few years time. Also, by all means, take days off school if it will be best for your mental health, but don #8217;t stop going like I did; it has really put a spanner in the works. Just focus on your GCSEs, practice self care and do things you enjoy. Things are going to be so good so soon just hang in there and don #8217;t worry about it too much. Keep being great and remember how dope you are.  #128154; I hope this helps :) from El</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some random questions I have</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 12:50:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Number 5 may be a sensitive topic 1) Can people who aren #8217;t Christian listen to and enjoy Christian music? Or is it for Christians because it #8217;s kind of to worship God. (If it #8217;s allowed, can anyone tell me what are some good songs) 2) Can people who aren #8217;t Christian go to church? If I go to church with my family at Easter and Christmas is that okay? Also is it like allowed but a taboo thing? 3) My auntie is Christian and she tells me off when I say  #8220;oh my god. #8221; I say it freely and basically subconsciously all the time and it #8217;s only when I am around my auntie that I realise it because she tells me off. I understand how it offends her and I respect it, so I #8217;m trying to be better at not saying it. What are some other things that Christians find offensive? Is it offensive to say words like  #8216;saviour #8217; and  #8216;worship #8217; and  #8216;repent #8217; if you #8217;re not talking about Christianity? Is it offensive to say things like  #8220;amen to that #8221;? A band that I am a big fan of calls their fans  #8216;sinners #8217;? I #8217;m fine with it because I #8217;m not religious, but would it be offensive to a Christian? Also is the phrase  #8216;hallelujah! #8217; allowed to be said by people who aren #8217;t religious? 4) How is God good if he sends good, innocent people to Hell? Say if a little girl passes away. A good, innocent person who is wonderful. Would God really send that little girl to Hell? How can he do that if he is good? It seems evil to me. And how is he forgiving when he #8217;ll send good people to Hell. God isn #8217;t good if he #8217;d send innocent, good people to Hell. Also God isn #8217;t good if he #8217;d send good people to Hell just for not believing in him. 5) Is suicide a sin? Do people who die this way go to Hell? Suicide is death because of an illness so surely God would understand that? Thanks</TEXT>

Reassure yourself that this girl isn #8217;t going to reach you and that time is behind you both. She should be focussing on herself and what the agency can do for her and is probably not thinking about you. It doesn #8217;t matter what she is doing as long as she stays away from you which she will. Reassure yourself that this girl is not interested in you negatively anymore and you are through the ordeal of being bullied by her. Try to think about all the opportunities this agency can bring you and everything positive you can get out of this experience. Stay positive and grateful, know your worth and know that you #8217;re value is not determined by this girls opinions. She doesn #8217;t matter anymore and we don #8217;t give a fck about what she thinks because you get to have something you deserve now</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol I just mentioned JoJo Siwa to my twin and she said  #8220;the sight of her makes me feel sick #8221; and I can #8217;t stand unkindness to good people for no reason especially about their looks so I ordered her to leave my room. She laughed and said she was gonna phone her friend straight away and tell her I did that. Sometimes I wonder if I #8217;m too sensitive. And now I #8217;m crying about it, sometimes I wonder if I #8217;m to sensitive squared^2</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My first impression favourite when I first watched the show: Ross! My favourite was Chandler for the first 5 seasons, and Joey for the next 5! Chandler was so witty which I loved about him but then he stopped being as funny when he got with Monica. And Joey is the most relatable and just adorable! I love them all!!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I might be getting an Xbox, what is Fortnite like on there? And what is Xbox like?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-30 06:03:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Fortnite is my first ever video game which I started playing 4 months ago on mobile. It is really killing my phone storage so we are thinking of getting an Xbox. I don #8217;t know play other video games, so I only need it for Fortnite. I have never played Xbox at a friend #8217;s house or anything so I have no clue about it. Is Fortnite free? Do you have to buy a disc of it like you have to for Wii games? My cousin said something about  #8220;Xbox gold #8221;. What is this? Is it necessary for Fortnite? What should I be buying? Can you also play Fortnite on a PlayStation? Is PlayStation better or worse than Xbox? If Xbox Gold is necessary for Fortnite, is Fortnite cheaper on a PlayStation? How easy is Fortnite to play on Xbox? I have only been playing on my phone which I find very easy except for building. Is the aim okay? I #8217;m guessing the left toggle is movement direction and the right toggle is look around. How do you pick up loot? Are there different models of Xbox? If so, which one should I get? How does Xbox connect to your tv? Is it just one HDMI connection into tv? Is there a split screen 2 player mode so I can play with my sibling and both of us can play on the TV? For voice chat, would just iPhone earphones with a mic suffice? How do you connect headphones? Should they be Bluetooth? Thank you very much :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am SO ANGRY my mother tells me off for my shouting but is okay with my twin doing it to me and calls my twin #8217;s compulsive RUDE MOUTH a  #8220;healthy coping mechanism #8221;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 12:43:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>My mother is not okay with me shouting at her but is okay with my bitch of a sibling doing it to me. She has refused to accept for months that my sisters RUDE MOUTH is what causes all our arguments even when i have been pointing out EVERY FUCKING DAY to her that it #8217;s my sisters UNPROVOKED vile comments that spark every fucking argument. My sister is has the RUDEST mouth I have ever known of and her rudeness is so compulsive sometimes I think she needs to go to behaviour therapy. She has no fucking respect for me and even if I did something nice for her I would be met with rude comments. My mother CLEARLY DOES NOT WANT THE TOXIC HOUSEHOLD TO IMPROVE because she is refusing to fucking acknowledge it #8217;s my sister #8217;s rude mouth that is the problem. She just told me off for shouting and I #8217;m like maybe it #8217;s a  #8220;HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM #8221; because I have to put up with my sisters CONSTANT shit. I #8217;m so fucking angry. Like maybe in protest I should shout even more. How the fuck has my mother not realised it #8217;s her other daughters VILE UNPROVOKED RUDENESS that causes every argument and that #8217;s what seriously needs to be fixed. She is just okay with me suffering the abuse of my sister but can #8217;t stand it the moment I try and shout some sense into my mum. Wow. My mum should accept my shouting as a healthy coping mechanism if my sisters unprovoked abuse is a HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM TO HER.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same haha I #8217;ve been keeping a dream diary. Sometimes they #8217;re just odd, but occasionally I #8217;ve noted down  #8220;10/10 highly enjoyable dream #8221;. In one of those I was paragliding above what looked like the visible personification of paradise, and it had the most amazing turquoise waves and I went surfing and I just wanted to stay there forever. I had another one I really loved which was about university (a completely unrealistic portrayal of university but I loved it) where we had an Induction Day but then a whole team of parkour athletes started free-running around the roofs of the uni and it was so awesome and blew my mind in the best way. Another 10/10 dream was when I  #8216;found my tribe #8217; (sounds cheesy haha). It was night time at this beautiful beach with bioluminescent algae in the water so it was sparkling blue along the shore. There was a bar on the beach and the most amazing people were there, people who just  #8216;got me #8217;. I remember there was a girl called Tulla and a girl called Sarah and a few boys and I just remember feeling like I belonged, and we all went surfing. I #8217;m gonna be switching my meds soon and if I don #8217;t get these cool dreams I #8217;m actually gonna be sad and miss it lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually tried Baileys (in my Xmas stocking I got the little truffles and 3 miniature bottles) and I hated it with a passion it was like burning my throat and tasted like a chemical lol. I was sipping it straight from the bottle though (I legit could only have like 1 drop at a time because it was burning my throat lmao), are you supposed to like put it in coffee or hot chocolate?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Do you still have the victim mindset #8221; I don #8217;t really like how you put that it sounds unkind even if it doesn #8217;t mean to be, I presume you mean  #8216;or are you still affected #8217; I have low confidence in friendships; if someone liked me I would be surprised; I think I #8217;m tolerable at best. I have no friends actually. Legitimately not one friend. It #8217;s hard to see my twin go out every single day with friends while I have only met up with a  #8220;friend #8221; once in 2020. I #8217;m completely alone and haven #8217;t been around anyone my age since I was in school. I have severe anxiety and haven #8217;t been to school for the last year and a half (I #8217;m 17). I spent about half of that time not leaving the house at all because of debilitating anxiety which I believe I never would have developed if I wasn #8217;t bullied. I have turned to self destructive coping mechanisms and have had suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts came around because of the stress. I was the biggest disappointment in my year group grades wise (comparing grade to predicted grade) because of the bullying (there were other factors like my adhd making it difficult for me to complete revision, but bullying for sure was a big one) and was up to 8 grades below target in subjects and only passed 4/10 subjects. So that #8217;s really put a spanner in the works. Bullying ruined my life. And it affected my health, shattered my dreams and took away my hope for the future. As for positives, I support people online every day because I know what it #8217;s like to feel alone and I don #8217;t want anyone else to feel like that.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-06 10:31:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m 17 and I #8217;ve been off school for the last year and a half due to my mental health. I have done no work while I #8217;ve been at home (not even one piece!!) and haven #8217;t achieved anything not school-related either. Like I haven #8217;t learned a skill or got good at something or anything. I have legitimately done nothing for a year and a half, I #8217;ve been as productive as a hospital patient haha. It was probably partly my anxious avoidant brain trying not to think about school so I could focus on recovery. Anyway I am at the stage where I need to start thinking about getting my life back together now. How can I get back into the swing of being productive? I don #8217;t even have any work to do. How about I make it routine to wake up and clean the house every day or something? Also my sleep schedule has been on a 24 hour rotation (i.e. going to bed always 5 hours later than the night before so I #8217;m nocturnal like half the time) all year! Every time I try and correct it to like a 10pm bedtime I relapse into being nocturnal. If anyone has any tips so I can get that as the first bit of structure back in my life I #8217;d appreciate it :) and any other lifestyle changes you recommend</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really wouldn #8217;t recommend it unless it #8217;s absolutely necessary. I feel it has done a lot more bad than good for me and obviously at the time of signing off I thought I couldn #8217;t go to school any longer but in retrospect I really should have stayed because the isolation made all my problems worse and I didn #8217;t leave my house for half of the time I was off school. School brings structure and social time, it #8217;s honestly so much better :) take care and it #8217;s okay to have days or even a couple weeks off school if you need to  #128150; a year honestly does more bad than good lol and has put a real spanner in the works for me in terms of finishing school and further education after that</TEXT>

    <TITLE>We #8217;ve hit a brick wall with downloading the update and we need helpppp!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 11:41:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>The update was saying it would take 99+ hours to download. We eventually gave up and quit the download because it literally wasn #8217;t shifting and we needed to use the TV. We tried again and it was 10% through  #8220;preparing to update... #8221; not even actually downloading. It was left on overnight and didn #8217;t shift from 10% so I tried to start the entire process again. Even when I fully restart the PS4 when I open it up it is still on  #8220;10% #8221; through  #8220;Preparing to update... #8221;. (It also says  #8220;preparing to update... Version 2.79 #8221; when google says the update should be a much later version, so I #8217;m confused about that) We #8217;re fully stuck. We have borrowed an Ethernet cable from our neighbour to connect the PS4 to the WiFi modem because apparently that will make it download quicker. Sorry for the frustrated tone haha- we are at our wits end and are thinking we might have to sell the PS4 and get a new one if we can never get passed this, since Fortnite is the only game I play on here (don #8217;t judge lol) Does anyone have any suggestions of what we can do please?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey yeah when you #8217;ve gotten so used to something and it changes for the better I understand how we can not feel as liberated as we thought we would because of how it #8217;s affected us. Reassure yourself that these people cannot reach you anymore and that they no longer think about you in a negative way. That time of your life is behind you and you are free to move forward and grow and heal. The best revenge is to heal, forgive and love yourself. Be accepting of how things were before; what #8217;s done is done. In order to not let those bullies get to you anymore and to get total freedom from them you have to accept and let go.  #8220;I #8217;m not going to let myself for another second of my life now that the bullying has ended feel small because of these people. #8221; You deserve so much better. You deserve to be happy, to not live in fear of these people and to be yourself and flourish. Don #8217;t look for happiness in the same place you lost it in the past, and don #8217;t dwell on the past because then you won #8217;t be able to move forward. This is a new chapter of your life starting right now. Try to stay present and allow yourself to move on. You don #8217;t deserve to still feel small because of these people for another second. What you have gone through has only made you stronger and you can rise up and be happy and successful and overcome this. Make your younger self proud. Your feelings are valid, and I felt like this for a long time after I was bullied, but then I decided that I would do what #8217;s best for me and heal from it and love myself. I completely understand how you feel and where you #8217;re at right now. I hope this helps xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I personally don #8217;t think it #8217;s worth it. Lawsuits can fall through and it will be a lot of emotional labour for you to recount it all and put yourself back in that headspace of being bullied for the duration of the case. You will be reliving it all. Are you sure you would feel better if there was even an outcome? I personally think the best revenge is to heal, forgive and love yourself</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please continue school. I have been off school for the last year and a half as a result of bullying. I really wouldn #8217;t recommend it unless it #8217;s absolutely necessary. I feel it has done a lot more bad than good for me and obviously at the time of signing off I thought I couldn #8217;t go to school any longer but in retrospect I really should have stayed because the isolation made all my problems worse and I didn #8217;t leave my house for half of the time I was off school. School brings structure and social time, it #8217;s honestly so much better :) take care and it #8217;s okay to have days or even a couple weeks off school if you need to  #128150; a year honestly does more bad than good lol and has put a real spanner in the works for me in terms of finishing school and further education after that, it #8217;s seriously ruined so much. You can do this, I know you can. Stay strong xx</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m 17 and I haven #8217;t been to school for the last year and a half. I got terrible GCSEs (the big exams you do when you #8217;re 16 here in the U.K.) - I failed 6 subjects and passed 4. I #8217;m not actually dumb enough to have got those grades - my predicted grades were five grade 8s (which is an A*). My bad results were due to adhd making it damn near impossible for me to revise, severe bullying happening at school, and the fact I only attended for half of the year due to my health. I didn #8217;t even pass my English GCSE so I will be retaking that at some point. I don #8217;t know what I #8217;m doing about A Levels. I may not pass all of them. If you don #8217;t get the required qualifications to  #8220;get into uni #8221; can you still go? Cos like it #8217;s your money right? So are there like alternative ways to get in that people don #8217;t normally hear about? Can anyone go to uni if they want to and get a degree? I really need to go to uni to have a chance at a social life in my 20s haha but right now things with my education are such a mess and people are worrying about getting in to a uni who actually have decent grades haha. Going to uni is really important to me because my mental health will seriously spiral if I am isolated and not having a social/normal life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How hard is surfing? How much harder is it that it looks?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 12:34:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Asking because I am super passionate about it despite the fact I don #8217;t surf yet haha and I literally have dreams about it and am wondering (I #8217;m 17) if I could actually achieve being able to surf half well as a goal. What are your tips for making great progress? Surfing is kind of all I want to do with my life and I really want to progress and get good at surfing. I #8217;ve only ever gone surfing 3 times haha and it was all surf lesson numero uno. I really want to pursue surfing though as it makes me so happy. I live 2 hours from a beach, but they did just open a wave garden 20 minutes from my house but you know surf sessions are expensive hahah</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes I #8217;m in the U.K. :) Hey you will be okay!! Keep things in perspective- there are so many pathways and so many people to support you through whatever path you choose to take. Don #8217;t be too disheartened if you don #8217;t get the results you hoped for. These grades are just a number and they don #8217;t define you so be kind to yourself, especially as you did your best. Focus on how far you #8217;ve come and your own progress instead of comparing yourself to friends or anyone else. Don #8217;t stress too much because it #8217;s all done now so it #8217;s not really in your hands anymore anyway. I know you did brilliantly and after you get your results you should go celebrate and be proud of yourself! Good luck :))</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have you ever met a really cute boy and never seen him again?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 16:57:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>One time I was in the shop Lush in the city with my twin sister. There was a guy who worked there who looked like Ansel Elgort but like a lot hotter. He was chatting to us about the products and we were smiling and laughing for like the chat which was a couple minutes. We were in the store for like half an hour because it was a big store. He came over to me again and said something about the products I was looking at, and I was so excited because he was so flipping cute. Also the fact he was swearing in conversation to me as a customer idk that confidence was attractive. I thought about him the whole way home and was sad that I didn #8217;t know his name (I should have asked for his social media but I was too nervous) so I couldn #8217;t look him up and would probably never see him again. Even wanted to go back to the store for a chance of bumping into him but we never did. He was so hot. Another time, I went camping 2 hours away from my house. There was a guy there, little bit shorter than me, super cute, brown hair, really really charming. We hung out a couple times around the camp site. His smile omg- gorgeous. And he was charismatic and funny. It turned out he was coincidentally actually from my area!! My twin told him that she was joining a drama club in his town and he said  #8220;No way I go there!! So I #8217;ll see you there #8221;. It kind of broke me. I secretly fancied this guy and he was going to get to spend 3 hours a week with my twin and I would never see him again. Surely enough, that was the case and I had to listen to her mention him for weeks being silently sad. Meeting him was the best thing about the holiday for me. At least I have a selfie we took together. He gave me his snap at the camp site but then never added me back when I added him. It made me sad at the time but I #8217;m over it haha it is what it is</TEXT>

    <TITLE>High school advice for Year 7s!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-15 08:32:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Idk if there are many 11 year olds lurking here but I wrote this for my cousin and I thought I #8217;d share in case anyone has any siblings going into Year 7 :) . Enjoy it! Don #8217;t stress too much in Year 7. Seriously just enjoy it Be yourself, don #8217;t try and be someone you #8217;re not or be like anyone else, be you :) Don #8217;t get caught up in too much drama. I got involved with wayyy too much drama in school and I wish I spent less energy on beef and drama and more on things that could actually benefit me. Don #8217;t worry about getting told off for something like being late to a lesson - the teachers know Year 7s are just getting used to the school and will be understanding After your first lesson of each subject in the first week, say  #8220;thank you #8221; to the teacher as you leave. It #8217;s polite and sets a nice precedent for others to follow :) Get involved with lots of stuff! Join clubs! You #8217;ll be able to meet new people who share the same interests Ask questions and contribute in lessons :) It shows you have a good attitude to learning and teachers will appreciate it because they want to know the class are engaging with the lesson If teachers seem strict it #8217;s probably because they are used to teaching older year groups. Try to make your school bag as light as possible! Don #8217;t do what I did which is lugging all of my books around every day - just bring the ones for the lessons you have on that day. And make your PE kit as light as possible. Grab a top locker!!! Thank me later Make copies of your timetables: one for your blazer pocket and it would probably be handy to also stick a copy of your timetable to your bedroom wall so you can wake up and straight away see what lessons you have that day. You can also write your timetable on your hand e.g.  #8220;M E S  #127925; D D #8221; for Maths, English, Spanish, Music, double Drama If you have planners/journals USE THEM! It will really really help you stay organised! They will be set out like a diary so use it to write in when your homework is due. I did it from Year 7-9 and it was so helpful! You can also write in any lunchtime events, after school events or reminders for things you need to bring to school on a certain day. It kept me organised every year :) It #8217;s good to get your homework done straight away so you can forget about it :) Don #8217;t worry about getting in trouble for things like being late, forgetting homework or incomplete homework - these things happen to literally every student and it will not be a big deal, it will be fine. Especially in year 7. The teachers are understanding :) If you have a real tie practice tying your tie. You #8217;ll need to be able to do it fast when getting changed after PE. See if you can take it off and put it back on without undoing it. Have pens and a little ruler or protractor (something with a straight edge to use to underline titles) in your blazer pocket. You #8217;ll also need a highlighter. And hair bands for PE or they ask you to use elastic bands lol When you write the date in a lesson, you needn #8217;t write the year every time, just write it on the front of your book. Also you don #8217;t have to say the day of the week because no one cares if it #8217;s a Wednesday You might want to make a group chat with your tutor group :) If you find it #8217;s a rush to get ready in the mornings you could pack your bag the night before Don #8217;t skip breakfast, it #8217;s the most important meal of the day Know that most of the rumours you #8217;re gonna hear are not going to be true. It is a school Don #8217;t spend too much time on technology/tiktok/video games!!!!!!! I spent SO much time on my phone when I was 11-15 and it just took up all my time so I hardly got any work done and my mum was always telling me to stop wasting my own time. She was completely right. It #8217;s fine to enjoy those things in moderation but don #8217;t waste all your time on entertainment when there are more important things that need to get done first. Get work done first then reward yourself with leisure time. Take notes in your books. If a teacher says something while explaining that you think really helped you understand, jot it down so you can remember it. What goes on your exercise book: Name, Subject, Teacher, Room you #8217;re in the most for that subject, class name (e.g. my drama class was called 10G). Also write Year 7, 2020 on the top or bottom of all your exercise books! Also if your unit of chemistry is called C1, write that on the front of your book so when you have loads of books you can find your work easily. And if in English you did (for example) Of Mice And Men, setting descriptions and poetry, write that on the front of your book (I used to do little doodles and make it look pretty haha) to summarise what #8217;s in the book Try and do something new, fun, kind or productive every day :) Relax and try to enjoy it. In no time at all it will seem like you #8217;ve been there forever, then it will be Christmas, then this time next year you #8217;ll be showing the new year 7s around the school. You #8217;ll settle into year 7 life and it will be totally easy and chill. Work picks up exactly where it left off in year 6. There is not some massive jump, don #8217;t worry On you computer at home, make a folder of  #8220;Homework #8221; then  #8220;Year 7 #8221; then make a folder for each subject. This will make it so much easier to find old pieces of work in a couple of years. When you work out an answer in your maths book, SHOW YOUR WORKINGS in a way that you can understand - explain it to your future self! It will really save your GCSEs when they come around and you have forgotten some maths stuff. It #8217;s just a beneficial idea but actually don #8217;t worry too much for year 7 about work haha, year 7 is supposed to be fun. The thing that is most important to me: don #8217;t be mean. It is not, and will never be, cool to be a mean person. Being mean is a waste of one #8217;s own time bringing others down, how sad is that. Please please don #8217;t be mean to people (I know you wouldn #8217;t anyway) Treat people with kindness. Be nice. To everyone. Also be accepting of people who might be a bit unique or maybe feel like the odd one out. Try and help people out and be the best version of yourself :) If you like something and people make you feel bad for getting excited about it, they #8217;re the worst type of people. Don #8217;t let people judge you or make you feel bad for liking something - it doesn #8217;t need to be interesting to anyone but yourself. Everyone should just be cool with other people liking what they like and enjoying their interest or type of music they listen to or whatever. There will probably be a fire drill in the first two weeks, just so you know Get enough sleep. Sleep is so important. Don #8217;t do what I did in year 7 which is staying up til stupid o #8217;clock in the morning to complete homework due that day. You will usually have seating plans, but if a teacher lets you sit wherever you want for the first lesson, sit with someone you like because there #8217;s a high chance they #8217;ll say  #8220;This can be the seating plan #8221; at the end of the lesson. Hold doors open for people Enjoy maths!!! One of my big regrets is not getting 100% into maths in school and then realising how cool maths is once I left school. Enjoying maths is seriously one of the best things you can do for yourself in school and it will really help you when GCSEs come around. Maths is actually pretty dope Another one of the best things you can do for yourself: try not to care too much about what other people think about you. What they think about you is none of your business  #128155; Don #8217;t block the hallways chatting in a group of people. It #8217;s annoying. Go to class CATs exams are no big deal at all. They #8217;re pretty easy and definitely easier than SATS, don #8217;t even worry If two boys (or two girls) start going out, it should be as normal as a boy and a girl going out. Have some fun messing around in lessons. Messing around in science is particularly acceptable and very normal across the country haha! Don #8217;t take it too seriously Read books!! The best readers make the best writers Try not to eat pizza every day  #128514; Don #8217;t get caught eating in class lmao Pay extra attention in lessons you like! Get your teachers to like you on your personality, not how well you do at school :) Year 7 is such a good year you #8217;re gonna love it :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I need advice for starting sixth form please</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-16 20:05:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m a 17 year old girl (my year is going into year 13) who went to sixth form then only managed the first day before getting signed off my a doctor because of my mental health. Half way through the year they said  #8220;don #8217;t worry about school, just focus on getting better #8221; (probably because I couldn #8217;t have caught up) and now I #8217;ve missed the whole year so I it #8217;s been agreed I should go into Year 12 again with the year below. How do I start thinking about going back to school this year? It makes me so anxious to think about it so I really avoid thinking about it but I #8217;ve been off for a year and a half (was supposed to go into year 12 this time last year but couldn #8217;t due to severe anxiety) and the new school year starts in 3 weeks! I don #8217;t even know what a levels I #8217;m doing and school starts in 3 weeks, this isn #8217;t even an exaggeration. I won #8217;t be forced back on the first day but I fear the longer I put off going to school once school starts the harder it will be for me to go. So I kind of want to aim to go on the first day. I haven #8217;t thought about school ALL year. And I feel so dumb because I haven #8217;t been in school for a year. I have done ZERO work all year (please don #8217;t judge). Also I have no friends so no one to meet up with once I get there. I #8217;m going to try and fix my sleep pattern and I should start my new anxiety medication so I have 3 weeks to settle into it before school. I #8217;ve really gotten used to this lifestyle of not doing any work, not leaving the house and being depressed and having no social interaction but it would be SO good for me to get used to school again!! Should I meet with the Head Of Sixth Form at my school this week? And I would really really appreciate general advice for sixth form please!! I #8217;m very anxious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know like in Hogwarts haha. My school (in the U.K.) has houses: the standard colours of green, blue, yellow and red. And then actually we have too many students so they added orange and purple. The houses are named after locations. I was in the purple house so my tie was blue with purple stripes. Everyone #8217;s tie is blue with stripes of your house colour. We do  #8220;inter-house #8221; sports events, have house assemblies every week and everything is divided into houses, and everyone knows which house everyone else is in. If you don #8217;t have houses how is your school divided? Just by year group?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Screenshots. Screenshots. Screenshots. If it #8217;s on snapchat and she doesn #8217;t want to screenshot, take a photo of the phone on another camera. Keep all evidence or nothing can be done. Make sure she does not say anything back that will look bad on her. For example if he said something like  #8220;you #8217;re ugly #8221; and she said something like  #8220;you #8217;re disgusting #8221; (this is just for the example) it cancels it out and she is as bad as he is. I know it #8217;s hard not to retaliate because I #8217;ve been there myself but make sure she knows responding/engaging in altercations doesn #8217;t help her at all. It is unlikely school will do anything because it is not taking place on school site if it #8217;s online. But still tell them. Get your parent to email school. They can help your sister feel more comfortable in school and can make sure this kid avoids your sister. Report it to CEOP (if in the U.K.) they are so good. Or report it to the police! Those death threats sound concerning. Police officers can come round your house for a chat (or not if you don #8217;t want them to!) and discuss it with you. This bullying is an offence called malicious communications. Police officers can get the kid in trouble. I don #8217;t know if anything much will happen but they can certainly go round his house and expose him to his family and teach him a thing or two. Sometimes a scare from police is enough to sort kids out. I hope things improve for your sister. You sound so supportive and lovely. I #8217;m sure this will stop soon x</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(If you know me please forget you saw this!) I #8217;m 17 and a virgin. When I masturbate I usually just insert my pointer finger. But I heard about vaginismus and wondered if I have it because I know I #8217;m  #8216;tight #8217;, so this time I inserted 2 fingers. It REALLY hurt. Like it REALLY hurt! And that #8217;s just two fingers. I definitely would not be able to take a dick, which makes me anxious about my  #8220;first time #8221;. What can I do to make it better? Do I have vaginismus?</TEXT>
