    <TITLE>Assigning a complete price file?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-03 08:42:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, We had somebody build the foundations of our b2b site but I am now taking over and hoping for some advice on the things they didn #8217;t manage to get done. Is it possible to upload a complete price file when creating a new customer? We work with a number of contracts. Each contract has multiple units that order their own stock. Each contract has a different price list. Currently we are searching for each individual product and inputting the price manually. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Posted this to another sub and was suggested to be a bed bug (unfortunately by a guy working in pest control). Posting again praying somebody tells me different - pure desperation. Found two on me - both in the living room. Once on my foot while on rug. Second crawled from my laptop on to me. We are in Paris Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apartment on ground floor (with a basement below) of a traditional, super old Parisian apartment building. We checked behind all counters, stove, fridge etc and can #8217;t find anything. Is it possible they come through the floor? The basement is crawling with mice so roaches wouldn #8217;t surprise me. It #8217;s a miracle we didn #8217;t get mice yet - we have a dog so I maybe that puts them off?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Grandfather a victim of fraud</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 06:47:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I am looking for some advice please. My grandfather is a victim of online fraud. Classic tale of meeting somebody online, investment opportunity, etc. He has  #8220;opened an account #8221; on what I believe to be a fake banking website. The account supposedly has a very large balance that was deposited by his online companion. We are struggling to get my grandfather to see the situation for what it really is and the police were a little disinterested. They said that no actual crime has taken place as he has not been asked to deposit or move the money (yet!). I have considered reporting the site to the host and domain registry. However I am worried this will just result in the site being taken down without any kind of follow up. Any advice on where to go from here would be most appreciated. Sorry for my post being a little vague. I am a little nervous to share too much publicly. Thankyou!</TEXT>
