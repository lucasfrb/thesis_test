I don #8217;t know what #8217;s happening. I can remember a few events but the past year doesn #8217;t really exist in my head, and it did a few weeks ago. I don #8217;t remember most of my hospitalizations and all the home time I was broken... I just feel like Im in the wrong place. I don #8217;t feel right I can tell something is off. Everyday I have a new episode, I feel so alone and I can #8217;t even remember why I #8217;m sad sometimes. I really need help. Right now I can tell I #8217;m rambling so please ask questions about what I left out. I #8217;m not in a good enough place to think straight</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-01 17:17:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I posted to one of my favorite subreddits (tw; self harm). Someone asked if they needed stitches, and I #8217;ve been in this situation way too many times, so I asked them to pm me a pic and I #8217;ll help them out rather than triggering everyone else. This is not against the rules as they are written, so I technically didn #8217;t do anything wrong, but thst makes me feel worse, and like the whole subreddit hates me. I got a message from the mods with my temp ban saying I #8217;m not a doctor and my help can hurt more than anything. It can #8217;t. I recommended both these people to urgent care rooms. Neither where serious enough for hospitalization and I was also super out of it. One person steri stripped theirs sh it and I helped them through it, and the other person covered theirs up well. I don #8217;t remember much of last night except for that I was really fighting the urges, and then I woke up feeling better and saw this. This is the only subreddit I belong in, and that gives me that feeling of welcomeness and makes me feel better and I fit it, and now I feel like they all fucking hate me because of my stupid ass not being good enough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to take 5x of my anxiety meds to make a difference. I used to be on 15mg of abilify but it made me sleep a little much (I think it was actaully a depressive phase and I wanted to be unstable). I #8217;m only 15M and weigh 135 lbs, so I don #8217;t know why no medications do anything. I go on them for a few weeks or months and they do nothing. I want my physiatrist to prescribe me a stronger anxiety med but she is very against meds. What do I do. No antidepressants work, I havnt been on enough mood stabilizers but at the moment it #8217;s not bad enough for that. Anxiety meds do nothing. Sleep meds do nothing. Simple pain meds do nothing to me. Does anyone else just not get affected?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-25 05:21:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m looking to use some as I have an abundance on my property for beginner knife scales, but I need to know how to dry this stuff and how to use it. If anyone is interested in learning about this wood this : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_gambelii is a good place to start. I #8217;ve found it grows very fast, has amazing patterns and is very hardy issues with it are how it dries, especially being in the dry parts of CO, they always crack. Any advice for drying and using this stuff?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who has used any form of bows in real life should be able to say while these bows are space magic, the draw of the different kinds of bows is very realistic and satisfying. The fact that compounds will draw slow then fast because of their mechanics, is just a great detail. Yes I am aware this post is late and no I don #8217;t care, I forgot to post a year ago.</TEXT>

I #8217;m an abuser and I don #8217;t deserve to eat or to live. I want to see myself covered in blood. No one cares. My life is agony and I have to live it to make others happy. I #8217;m so tired of being me. I want the pain to end but I #8217;m not strong enough to end it. I don #8217;t deserve the air I breath. I #8217;m getting worse and I can #8217;t remember anything. Nothing is real anyways. Why not just fucking quit before I have to endure more agony. Edit: Sorry guys I had a really horrible episode. The sh wasn #8217;t deep enough to worry and I #8217;m just lightheaded now. I #8217;m sorry for my behavior</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-08 21:13:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was diagnosed at around 7 with it and anxiety and ADD, and in the last few years depression, BPD and treatment for eating disorders. I've asked a few doctors if I could get tested to know if it was a false diagnoses, but they where in an acute care environment so I didn't see them again after about a week in inpatient. But I have the hardest time writing with my hands. It's almost like my handwriting is in between cursive and print because I can't get my hand lifted off the paper enough or move up and down on the paper enough to leave smooth clean letters. Sometimes I just lose the ability to write, and it turns into a line with a few loops out of nowhere. I do mess up my diction with a word from the next sentence getting written in out of nowhere. My handwriting is also very very messy. With the shutdown I don't know if I can get tested anywhere or if it's important. I just don't know what to do and it feels horrible whenever I see other peoples neat handwriting and perfect cursive when as hard as I try I just... can't. The lack of finger and hand motor ability also shows up, and I can very basic balisong tricks but I can't move right to open them well. I'm not sure what's wrong with me and it's very frustrating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been getting minor cutting urges, then having an anxiety attack and the urges get horrible. I #8217;m trying not to hurt myself, but it #8217;s the only thing I have to stop the attack. It makes it so I can breath and my heart slows down and my ears stop ringing and I feel normal But I met with my doctor over phone, during the tail end of an attack and I was stuttering and mumbling and rambling and it was clear is was fucked out it. She just increased my Prozac dose which hasn #8217;t helped me, then she said I can have a stimulant in a few weeks if I message her things are good. I can #8217;t get schoolwork done. I hate this. I #8217;ve tried hydroxyzine and it doesn #8217;t work and unless I #8217;m taking 150mg +, or about 3x a sleeping dose. She will not prescribe any other as needed anxiety medication, after me telling her as needed make me feel better and I am notice effects. I just got a scalpel, and I #8217;ve been trying not to use it. But I can #8217;t hold out much longer. All my freinds are ignoring me and I don #8217;t have a good reason to get up in the morning.8 #8217; so tired of life right now. What the fuck do I do</TEXT>

I #8217;ve found that 1080 is much harder under the hammer than mild steel, so how should I proceed without making my mild steel getting too thin as it #8217;s softer. I intend to try a technique I failed at before for making a push dagger, and I have my sizes and steps ready. But how do I make my San mai have a pattern and have enough mild steel in the jacket?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in need of pivot pins in sizes that are standard in America, but it seems to be pretty confusing to find the right ones, that are even on both sides, about .75 #8221; in material they can hold, will look good for a stop pin and construction pins. I #8217;m planning on pairing it with lacewood scales, 1080 with a brut de forge look, and most likely a dark green micarta or g10 spacer. I #8217;m not planning on using washers. This will most likely have about 2 inch blade Finding a good pivot pin in the size of a 1/4 inch wide and 3/4 inch long as been a pain, preferably in brass. Does anyone have any links to one that #8217;s straightforward in sizes, and should work for my application?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Atm I #8217;m in the bog next to moth home. I think it #8217;s time for me to move, but I #8217;m not sure where. I don #8217;t like the divide, find the bog to be very specific, and want to have a good location. I also don #8217;t like whitesprings, and I would prefer to be on a biome border. Any ideas for my next build and location?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to deal with separation anxiety (more or less)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-12 22:47:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>How do I deal with being away from my FP. I #8217;ve switched on her before but I just shoved aside that and forced her back into every space of my head. I was recently out of town, and due to circumstances we can #8217;t see each other in person anyways, or even call. My mental health deteriorated because I was away from her. It got better in about a day after I got back. Recently at a 4th of july party, she broke her phone. She said she #8217;d text me that week when it #8217;s fixed. It #8217;s been over a week now and nothing. I havnt been SH clean, I #8217;m going to shit and I really need her. I can #8217;t stop thinking about her. It hurts, my head hurts, my heart aches, and I #8217;m losing it. I need to talk to her to have a connection but it #8217;s all gone, I don #8217;t know when I #8217;ll see her or even hear from her again and I #8217;m frustrated she doesn #8217;t use a freind or coworkers phone to at least keep me updated. I feel unloved and like she #8217;s not real and neither am I. It #8217;s only been a week, but my SH issues have come back pretty bad, my ED is coming back, my anxiety is through the roof, and I #8217;ve felt numb 80% of the day. I feel trapped and I don #8217;t know what to do</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They left me so many times. Then blame me. Then come back. I feel like I hurt her so I try my best to be submissive. Then she breaks her phone or so she says, and texts me back two weeks later, saying she needs a break becasue she needs a life and she can #8217;t keep only worrying about me. Tbh this is kinda the last straw in my heart. 2 solid years of pain, almost a year of waiting for her. Dozens of suicide attempts, I #8217;ve ruined my body all for her, and according to her all I ever do is hurt her. I #8217;m so damn tired and I #8217;m very much in a crisis situation but I don #8217;t want help. I just got betrayed again by my sole reason to live, I can #8217;t take anymore of this. I #8217;m ready to let go. I #8217;m not sure how but I feel like I most likely will. Edit: She just said I #8217;ll text you when I #8217;m ready. Because she knows I #8217;ll come back so she can hurt me again and again. I can never do anything right.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-20 20:13:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I guess I destroyed my life to be with her for nothing. She didn #8217;t even say she loved me. Just came by to tell me she needs space and I was an asshole. Then she comments on the other time she did the exact same thing and 8 months killed me emotionally and wrecked my mental health then she sorta mocks me and says I did it once I can do it again and acts like she had no part in that. I had to choose between going to a school with my freinds, or one I may see her, I chose to see her. She #8217;s destroyed me over and over again and acts like I #8217;m selfish and I try to hurt her. This was my last lifeline now it #8217;s been a yeetapalooza for the past few days and I said I needed her and she barely even acknowledged that. Just a reminder no matter how hard I try I #8217;m always gonna be a freak and unloved. I #8217;m pretty pissed, and I #8217;m considering big yeet but my family can #8217;t afford the psych ward bill if I fail, so I #8217;m like trapped here in tons of emotional pain with no way to relieve it because I #8217;m out of skin room to destroy. She even got mad at me for bringing up all the past times she said horrible things and expected me to come back. This is such toxic behavior, I #8217;m really debating if I should let her destroy me again, it #8217;s like I can #8217;t trust the person I trust most. I know she #8217;s on here so maybe she #8217;ll see it, idk, I hope not because then she #8217;ll just be mad at me again. Just needed to vent and all posts in the normal sh sub and BPD never get attention so ifg I #8217;ll just say it here. Can #8217;t beleive I beleive hollow lines like I #8217;ll always be there for you. I never learn</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Won #8217;t work with stainless since stainless is different from high carbon. So imagine your steel as soup on the inside, when it #8217;s sorta mixed around and not in a pattern it #8217;s weak. Between the carbon and the iron it #8217;s not as strong due to the fact that it #8217;s sctruture is kinda loose. But, if you got everything really mixed around then froze it rapidly, the strong particles get trapped by the other particles and creates a stronger internal structure, changing the properties of the steel as a whole when all that #8217;s changed is the orientation of the structure. Sorry if that #8217;s a bad way of explaining it. Once a blade reaches austenite and that structure isn #8217;t magnetic, but it has its carbon in a desirable place, so it #8217;s then cooled before it can return to ferrite and becomes martensite, a harder material full of carbides and different properties.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a really beautiful push dagger getting to be finished and then put up for sale... but something is bugging me about selling this kind of blade. It is, inherently a weapon and designed to kill. Selling something like this feels... wrong. I know any knife can be used to kill and it #8217;s a fact of the craft. I don #8217;t think any of use would like our creations to hurt another living thing. I #8217;m in CO, US. I #8217;m pretty sure selling this would be legal but not carry. It #8217;s a 2 #8221; dagger blade. I know there is art to it but it #8217;s also dangerous. Can anyone give me insight into the morality of a blade like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in for major SH related stuff, and no one usually had worse  #8220;ones #8221; so my brain kinda started comparing myself to the Ana girls, and I went from eating perfect to Ana/buli conbo for a few months from 5 days, then was back in for 10 days later that year. After that I recovered a lot as they shoved food down your throat and it worked. An ED therapist got me good till my teacher cut open all the old wounds. What ticked me off about inpatient was that all doctors thought it was ADHD as I #8217;m a guy... not BPd and Ana esc stuff like I #8217;ve figured out now. Being a guy with an ED is a pain in the ass as we can #8217;t get our bodies to be shaped like females no matter how skinny we are, and no one ever expects it or believes it.

    <TEXT>Be warned, that #8217;s gray territory if not the  #8220;black market #8221; of trading. It can get you banned from the game (it violates TOS) and banned here. I advise you not too, (they will also most like be overpriced) but that #8217;s your risk to take. But we don #8217;t do that here so I #8217;d recommend deleting your post so you can still use this market as an asset for trades</TEXT>
