    <TITLE>[REVISITED] Top 50 NBA Players  amp; the Next 10</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-04 04:34:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rao-1-fkVjc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGQXKpdPxTc ORIGINAL OPEN COURT LIST: McAdoo, Wilkins, AI, Kobe, Duncan, LeBron, KG, Dirk, Webber and Durant. For those may not have had the chance to watch the NBA Open Court episode on this topic, links are above. I would like to start this debate/discussion over this topic which seems to me have many people split and torn apart. Personally, my next top 10 would be: Duncan, Kobe, LeBron, Garnett, Wilkins, Wade, Allen Iverson, Dirk, McAdoo, and Jason Kidd for his longevity and cerebral play. I feel like most of the guys (Barkley, Webb and Shaq) disrespected Wade and what he has achieved in his career. The best shot blocking guard in NBA history, future Hall of Famer and top 3 SG of all time. In my opinion Chris Webb didn't even belong in that list, only really added for the fact that he was present in the discussion and that they were biased towards him because they worked with him. I get that he had impacted the game of basketball through his days with the Fab Five in Michigan but we are talking about the Greatest NBA Players of all time. His credentials and statistics are not even on par with guys like Dwyane Wade, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton and Paul Pierece to name a few of the players who were left out the list of 10 players. Heck I would even take Reggie Miller, the man who humbly left himself out of the list, over Chris Webber. They eventually concluded with Kevin Durant as the tenth man for the list as seen on an article on NBA.com http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2014/10/06/after-50-greatest-the-next-10/ . Debatable, although I agree that he definitely has the potential to crack the list, its too soon to add him. Wade deserved it more as he is near the twilight of his career and is proven while Durant still has time to cement his place (i.e. win a ring etc.) I'm really keen to hear your thoughts and thanks for reading #blessup</TEXT>

    <TITLE>UBC-V or UBC-O? Help!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-07 01:36:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I am currently a grade 12 student in Alberta. My university of preference would obviously be the U of A because of its proximity to home but I have chosen UBC as my second option. I learned that UBC actually had two campuses and do realize that the campus does not matter so much in that you will still get a UBC degree either way. I just wanted to hear different perspectives from students who have studied or are currently studying at UBC. What are the pros and cons, advantage and disadvantages with opting to go with one campus instead of the other? I'm referring more towards the student life, things to do outside of school, UBC experience etc. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, I'm currently in my first year of university and have been looking for a portable and long lasting laptop for a while now for daily use. I waited a while for the release of the new MBPr but the price is honestly just too much for my budget. I am not very tech savvy hence I don't completely understand all the new spec changes. What difference would there be b/w a 13. in 2015 MBPr and a 13 in. 2016 model? The most important things for me are graphics, screen resolution and speed (less lag and delay). Thanks!</TEXT>

Just as a pure cosmetic concern, are there any ways to repair a dented aluminum exterior? I bought my laptop in a Microsoft store however I did not opt to buy the warranty they offered.

I am aware of the deadline date for dropping classes without paying/penalty but I'm asking more about HOW the money comes back to me after student loans already came in. In short, how do I receive the money for that 5th class I dropped? Thanks!</TEXT>

He came to each meeting armed with a list -- compiled with his assistant coaches -- of what each player was doing well and how they could improve.  gt;  gt;Among the tweaks Boylen has already made, he moved [Jabari Parker](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3056600/jabari-parker) out of the starting lineup. Parker will now come off the bench behind Markkanen at forward. Under Hoiberg, the Bulls experimented with Parker at small forward briefly, but he struggled. [Justin Holiday](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2284101/justin-holiday) will continue to start at small forward.  #8203; Interesting quote coming from the new Bulls head coach. Seems to answer all of the talks and questions that everyone had about Jabari's position with Lauri's return. This will most likely affect his ROS outlook.

    <TEXT>[In reference to an earlier post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/a7gg4w/larry_nance_starting_against_pacers/) u/S2Trugo, Larry Drew FINALLY gave LNJ the start we've all been waiting for and LNJ delivers. Filled the stat sheet tonight like it was a whole buffet with a healthy 15/16/6/3/1 on 50% shooting. Maybe this will help Larry Drew to see the light and keep Nance in the starting lineup while TT is out. Rejoice brothers!

    <TITLE>2,844 days ago, Ty Lawson becomes the first NBA player to hit 10 straight 3-pointers in a Nuggets 130-106 win</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-22 06:21:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ty Lawson scored a career 37 points along with 7 rebounds and 6 assists on April 9, 2011 while also hitting 10 straight 3's *(and finishing the game 10/11 from deep)* in a win over the Timberwolves. Yes we get that Klay is amazing and that he is a shooter of the highest caliber but lets not forget and disrespect older players who have achieved the same feat. Ty Lawson is NOWHERE near the shooter that Klay is, which makes him setting the record even much more remarkable. I am only creating this post because of the recency bias and because of everyone falsely claiming that Klay is the first to do it. No doubt in my mind that Klay may as well break this record one day before he hangs it up for good.  #8203; Edit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rankc8FgUVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rankc8FgUVk) to watch the man go bonkers from 3</TEXT>

    <TITLE>2/8 Post-Game Impressions from Notable Recently Traded  amp; Injured Players</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-09 05:37:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tonight is arguably one of the biggest nights for a lot of fantasy owners as we finally get to see how bigger name players who recently got traded perform. A couple of anticipated returns were also made tonight from injured players who many have stashed for an extended period of time. Here are my impressions from a one-game sample from tonight's slate.  #8203; **Recently Traded** *Dennis Smith Jr. (DAL to NYK)* DSJ had a BIG night for New York in a losing effort against the Pistons. He put up 31/2/8/2 on relatively efficient 9/15 shooting from the field and 11/19 from the line. In what is arguably the messiest rotation in the league, its clear that DSJ might be the lone constant to gain 30 mins. or more per night. He had the green light from Fiz to shoot at will and it was impressive to see him get to the line the way he did tonight. Will this type of statline be sustainable moving forward? Most likely not. But I do see him averaging around 18 ppg  amp; 7 asts for the ROS. Should remain hot with high usage as Mudiay and Frank remain out with injuries. *Jabari Parker (CHI to WSH)* If there was a "Surprise of the Night Award" for these things, Jabari would take it. Parker almost put up a triple-double in only 23 minutes, finishing with a statline of 7/11/9/3/1 on 3/6 shooting and 1/3 from deep. He played with a tremendous amount of energy off the bench as he continued to play well with his running man Portis. The stocks were surprising and so were the assists but they are most likely unsustainable in the long run. The Wizards may be on to something here if they can implement Jabari as a point forward off the bench. He could be a great per-minute producer for the ROS with a great playoff schedule. Worth to note how he seemingly took usage away from guys like Ariza, Green, and even Satoransky. *Bobby Portis (CHI to WSH)* Bobby gonna Portis. Bobby looked like he didn't skip a beat since getting traded from Chicago, continuing his awesome run of high scoring games. He led the Wiz in scoring, finishing with 30/6/2/1 on an efficient 12/18 shooting and 4/6 from 3. It seems that Portis will most likely be leading the Wizards bench for the ROS and playing practically the same role that he had in Chicago. The string of 30 point games is almost guaranteed to be unsustainable but its not crazy to think that he could average upwards of 16 ppg. He most likely won't offer you anything outside of scoring, rebounding, and shooting %. *Tobias Harris (LAC to PHI)* A big win for the 76ers against the 2nd best team from the Western conference. Tobias was instrumental in the 76ers win as he provided much needed spacing. He put up 14/8/3 on 6/12 shooting and 2/3 from deep. Tobias is evidently the 4th option on this team, losing his 1st option role from the Clippers. Redick was red hot tonight but I wouldn't expect Tobias' situation and expected statline to change too much ROS. His scoring will certainly dip and I see him averaging around 14 ppg and 5 rebs on this 76ers squad. This is certainly a case of the player being better irl than fantasy-wise. *Otto Porter Jr. (WSH to CHI)* One word: **E F F I C I E N C Y**. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to describe OPJ as an efficient player. He finished with 18/4/1 on 7/9 shooting and 4/5 from deep. This was an impressive win for a struggling Bulls team and they may have just found their Big 3 in Lauri, Lavine, and OPJ for the ROS. He took the 4th most attempts for the team behind Lavine, Lauri, and Dunn and I expect these shot attempt numbers to vary throughout the season. OPJ could be looking at averaging around 17 ppg, 6 rpg, and 1.5 stls for the ROS. I also expect his stock numbers to increase as he had an uncharacteristic 0 stls and 0 blks for the night. *Tim Hardaway Jr. (NKY to DAL)* He's the clear 2nd option on this team behind Luka, and it showed tonight. He took the 2nd most FGA for the Mavs as he put up 12/2/2 on 41.6% shooting. Expect his season average of 19 ppg to come down to about 16 ppg while maintaining his fantasy assets of 3's, pts with the occasional stock here and there. *Harrison Barned (DAL to SAC)* He played 37 mins. tonight and has assumed Shumpert's role. He has solidified himself at the 3/4 spot and will most likely be rolling out in Sacramento's main lineup of Fox/Hield/BogBog/Barnes/Stein. This is a case of too many mouths in a team to feed. Expect Barnes to pop off and have a good game every now and then but I don't see him averaging more than 15 ppg for the ROS especially with Fox and Hield playing well. Bjelica and Bagley are the immediate losers as Barnes plays the 4 spot down the stretch even tho he starts at SF.  #8203; **Injury Comebacks** *Caris LeVert (BKN)* A very very impressive and encouraging night for LeVert tonight. In just 15 minutes, he put up 11/2/4 with a whopping **5 steals**. Considering how bad his injury looked earlier in the season, Caris looked very good in his return tonight. The Nets will obviously be very cautious with bringing LeVert back into the rotation but post-ASB, I expect him to return to game-shape and have a tremendous outlook as the Nets continue to hunt for a playoff spot. Especially with Dinwiddie out for a while, Caris should revert back to his pre-injury averages of 18 ppg with a healthy dose of stls. *Kevin Love (CLE)* Contrary to the panic caused earlier, KLove didn't get re-injured on his comeback. The Cavs wanted to see how Love was doing and they tested him out on the floor in the first quarter. He put up 4/1/1 on 6 minutes, but his 5 FGA and 2 FTs should be encouraging. Hold in IR for now until he returns to consistent playing time. *Anthony Davis (NOP)* Not shut down! AD owners rejoice. Seeing tonight, AD is just gonna AD. Put up a monster 32/9/2 with 3 blks in just **25 minutes**. Safe to assume the Pels will be playing AD for around 25 mins. per game ROS. AD will still be a fantasy beast with the limited minutes, just won't be fully unleashed. But any minute given is better than no minute so kudos to all the AD owners who stuck thru and held on to him. Note: AD was taken out late in the 3rd quarter and sat out the entire 4th. The Pels still managed to get the impressive win over Minnesota.  #8203; Please comment down below what your own thought/opinions are on these players and lets have a healthy discussion! Hope you guys enjoyed this, signing out. Have a good night r/fantasybball :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Prescription Lens Question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-06 06:55:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey yall. I got a pair of Targetlines from my local Oakley store and was told to get my prescription lenses from Lenscrafters. Went today and boy was it rough. A Prizm polarized lens ran me \~$700 to be made from Lenscrafters. WITHOUT the frame. Is that pricing normal? There was about a $60-100 difference for just a regular Iridium polarized lens. Is Lenscrafters my only option of getting Prizm polarized lenses? Or can I look elsewhere for much cheaper options? Because paying more than 3x the price of the frame for lenses is absurd. Otherwise I'll sadly have to return them :( Any help would be appreciated thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate to be that guy, but has anyone received any Health Science updates recently on their application? The last email update we got was way back in May 30 and it stated  gt;We hope to make final decisions within the next **3-4 weeks** and will communicate admissions decisions to applicants directly through your myNAIT portal It has already been 5, going on 6 weeks since we last received any sort of official update from NAIT.. I understand that they are facing lots of delays due to COVID but another form of update would be very much appreciated, especially if we have been waitlisted/rejected already.</TEXT>
