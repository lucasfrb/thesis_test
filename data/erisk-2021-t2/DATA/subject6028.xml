    <TITLE>First trip to the mirr</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 18:03:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Following the wastelander update I decide to give this game another go, played casual when it first came out and go carried through the game by high level friend so would consider myself a newbie despite being around a first release. I decided to do it solo this time, experience the country roads at my own speed, take it slow, see what there is to see. Fast forward to the mire. I remember the mire. Terrifyingly beautiful. I knew soloing the game would be tough so safe to say I was nervous but I have done the main quest up to the free state and decided to do side quests and events to prepare. I was not prepared for this. I set off near the mega rocket station, thinking I could handle this if I play smart. First house I got to was packed with ferals, easy. Start picking them off and then get the misc quest 'kill a wendigo wearing a clown outfit' HELL NO. Those things have freaked me out ever since getting lock in a elevator and it trying do nasty things to me. So I keep moving. Finally enter the mire. Nerves high. Heart pounding. I got this tho because I am playing smart and was smart to avoid the wendigo. I saw a legendary. I got greed. Legendary mirelurk on it's own. Weird but I wasnt complaining, easy kill, get rewards, trashy hatchet. Was not worth it when I turn to see the mirelurk hunters, the razor claws and the goddamn queen creeping up behind me. Play smart, phantom device, high tail it out of there. Turns out there was a pack of scorched and feral dogs kicking about to and my device set them off. Absolute mayhem. Snarling and screeching is all I could hear as I high tail i towards abbies bunker. That was the boarded of the mire. I decide that I still got this. Just gotta play safe. Head down the highway to the next bunker with my head held high that I didn't bail. It is worth mentioning that I hadn't played any of the other dlcs nor looked into them much. Radstags. I know what you're thinking. Dinner. Massive group of them on the road, I'll get some dinner while I'm still alive. Mistake. Sheepsquatch are a thing apparently. What a horrendous horrific creature. Came storming into the middle of the stag herd and went ballistic. Radstags running everywhere including towards me. My character has low luck so obviously it would chase the stag coming straight at me. Radstags gone, belly empty, me still terrified of the mire. Oh and I'm dead. I'll try again tomorrow...</TEXT>

First encounter was walking down the mire highway slightly south of abbies bunker, saw some radstags running towards me and then monstrosity following not far behind. Didnt end well Second time was outside lucky hole mine; on my way to farm lead ore. Fast traveled there, heard a weird noise behind me. Turns out the noise was a brahim getting torn apart by a legendary mutated Shaun the sheep. I hid in a hut and hoped the cultist would help. They didn't. Slow pick away at it from the safety of my wooden shack and then went about my mining</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can have as many as you want, I would suggest you look into them and pick the mutations that suit your build. As far as managing them goes: you cannot cure selectied mutations. It all RNG. I had 6 and wanted to get rid of one because it is bugged and it was the last one to go... Easiest way to get them is to buy serums as you are granted to get the ones you want and not waste time with the ones you dont. To ensure you keep them when using rad away I would highly suggest max rank starched genes perk. You'll never lose them or gain new ones from radiation</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would suggest bringing a friend a long. Can go solo and it is still great but there somethings that you'll prefer to with other players, like events, and I usually end up running it alone. Still got bugs but it has come far since its release. The community of players is what has kept it going and you'll end up meeting some decent people. If you do take it up I would suggest going slow to start with, dont rush into the main quests.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>1h melee build help</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-25 23:17:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wanna create a new toon and try a melee build as never done that before. I found this build and would like to know if it is any good as I haven't a clue what's is best. I know I wanna go 1h melee and probably use knives for the speed rather than 2h heavy hitting https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1 amp;s=f38478b amp;d=s50si0sj0sf2sg2se2ss2pe2e52ej4c72i11i44a04au2l22lu2lt2l71 amp;n=Melee%201-handed I dont really want to run junkie or bloodied as I dont want to have to rely on being drugged up or have to rely on eating a lot of food or certain foods. Or should I just run shotgun build instead... I'm at a lost and would love some help  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as rifles go I was gonna pick up each of the rifleman parks as I went so can switch to that when I need too. What would you suggest instead if vaccinated? I was thinking adamantium limbs or life giver? Is getting crippled a regular thing for melee builds?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ngl, I would love to see more customisation. More colour options More character options The ability to pick all colours for bases rather than being stuck with just the set combinations The ability to change the ship colours Change the multitool colours If we doing those little bits, maybe push it big and let us be able to assemble our own ship from recycled parts that effects the stats of the ship Let us build our own multitool that also effect the stats In a universe where everything could be anything, I would love to see that the same for everything else</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Never got it but did get the bit where I could preview it and just needed to gather the parts. If you just do all the event quests, low rank to master rank then it should unlock. I have played the monster hunter for quite a few months but if I remember correctly I never got it because you need to hunt tempered elder dragons in the guided land.</TEXT>
