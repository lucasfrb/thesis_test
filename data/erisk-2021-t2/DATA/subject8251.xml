    <TEXT>Like the name! Just a thought: a picture/art drawing of someone lighting their bed on fire on the front side of the shirt and the back can say a quote like  #8220;Forever woke #8221; with a pic of tape stuck on eye lids to keep them from shutting on the bottom of the quote? I attached a link to the pic of the eyes in the back for some reference. God bless fam.. hope that kinda sparks something! https://mlodicho.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/93.jpg</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah this isn #8217;t the actual quality, just a screenshot. Initially the picture/art placement was supposed to be on the bottom of the shirt and gradually fade into the color of the shirt. However, I can #8217;t find a t shirt company that doesn #8217;t have a bounding box for image placement as of rn. Is the font itself off? Or just the placement? Thanks for the feedback though!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Initially that was exactly what the tee was supposed to be..I wanted the art to start from the bottom of the shirt and up, however the screen printing company I created with had bounding lines that prevented that. Hence I felt like the shirt was not enough so I just added those things. Appreciate the feedback!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely feel where you #8217;re coming from! I #8217;m brown as well..it #8217;s always great to see things from others perspectives. I was trying to say love specifically doesn #8217;t discriminate against colors, hence it simply can #8217;t see colors. When I said love I meant the emotion itself, not people (who can see colors). Like I said, it #8217;s always great to see things from other people #8217;s views, I #8217;m glad you shared yours! Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s pretty tough to make a shirt to battle against racism/discrimination being truthful. I feel like there will always be controversy around every single piece someone creates about this war.. in this case, I was referring to love alone as being colorblind (I posted the back of the shirt as well in this thread). When we love someone we generally don #8217;t solely take into account just how they look..we love someone for what they hold inside of themselves. Our brain is naturally predisposed towards stereotyping (according to studies).. following this, we all make implicit stereotypes which is basically us making judgments about people unconsciously (based off appearance). In specific, colors play a big part in this.. no way am I saying our skin complexion doesn #8217;t matter, I #8217;m saying as humans we shouldn #8217;t see/view others just based off of color (which we do/some may try to deny it but we all have at one point). Some people ignore these unconscious thoughts while some abide to them (being prejudice).. my intentions were to spread love and try to unite viewers with this piece. When we meet people at first we tend to be very observant of their appearance.. in contrast, with time (the more we get to know the person) their appearance starts to become more transparent. Eventually, we start to see their inner character become more prevalent than their presentation. Thank you for your feedback as well! In the end we all have different interpretations and understandings, at times we may miscommunicate and see things as being opposite when they were really the same. I apologize if you had seen this the wrong way, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can lifting reduce Gynecomastia?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hi all. I have a condition called Gynecomastia, for those not familiar it #8217;s basically a swelling of breast tissues. I thought losing some weight would do the trick (since I was a tad bit from being overweight) however, after losing a good 40 pounds (still actively running) and being skinner than ever in my life not much has changed in my breast tissue inflammation. I #8217;ve had this condition all my life and really wanted some advice.. anything would be greatly appreciated!! Also, would taking creatine make this condition worst?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, I had a point where I was going through major depression.. talking about just calling it a quits type of depression. I couldn #8217;t seem to grasp a sense of happiness nor was I able to even envision all things were going to be alright.. I had my final straw until I called out to God.. I wasn #8217;t ever really heavily religious however, as soon as I formed a relationship with God I never felt that type of depression before.. I started to see things from different views and with that my life had changed.. more income/much better performance when I was back in school. God bless, just know what you #8217;re facing right now will surely pass! One very major key to fighting depression is cancelling negative thoughts. The way to do that is force your mind to reside in peace and happiness. I did that by finding God. You #8217;ll be happy, keep your head high! We all have dark days</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not trying to argue but have you heard of vandythepink, Dapper Dan, Cocane slim, etc all of these people had made their very own custom LV/Gucci which lots of celebrities rock today. We #8217;re taking about Forbes list celebs who can buy any designer piece they want. I was inspired by these people to  #8220;make something cool and new that can #8217;t be found anywhere else #8221; as you stated. I kind of understand where you #8217;re coming from and respect criticism since I take it as improving ones skills even more. However, coming at a person and just saying their stuff is trash or garbage without even stating what parts of the design they lack in is plain hating. I conditioned myself to fully ignore the nonsense but I #8217;ve seen countless times people just like you comment trash/ugly on people #8217;s designs on this group without even telling them why. That can bring others peoples hopes down if they let things get to them. It is my fault to post this on here though since this is a group dedicated to personal brands only and I just realized this. I just wanted some feedback. God bless/be more positive</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well one thing in life I #8217;ve learned is we can #8217;t satisfy everyone.. what you think is garbage or lazy might be a grail and masterpiece to someone else. I love the brand LV since some of their designs are so different/unique. I didn #8217;t copy or mimic any LV or any other brand design style off these shorts at all..  #8220;replica #8221; is literally a term used when taking a design and re doing it. I thought this out before doing it. In the end some will love it some will hate it, it is what it is. Like I said, I don #8217;t ever try to feed into arguments so we #8217;ll leave it at that. God bless, take care. (I do appreciate your feedback tho and saying you respect the work #128175;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He does have a good highlight tape I came across in the past (I think it #8217;s still on YouTube). Of course though, every player has either missed some shots, gotten blocked, dunked on, you name it. He can ball if you look up his highlight tapes.. I mean people don #8217;t take into consideration his height so only option he really has is to use a variety of handles. The bigger the player is the easier it is for them to do a simple cross and get to the rim/finish. In Julians case, even if he does a simple cross and blows by the defender may recover and just swat his shot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe the company (ripndip) transfers over the image on the pocket side of the t shirt and later sews the pocket on. To do it yourself you can precisely cut off the pocket of a T-shirt and make note of where the pocket starts/ends and add the image on (or paint it). This way you can adjust what you want to be visible above the pocket and hidden inside the pocket. Subsequently, once the image is dried you can stitch the pocket back on. Hope that helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you can #8217;t dribble at home get a ball and go around your head/body with it (switching hands) as fast as you can. Also, while you #8217;re laying down somewhere practice your shots by shooting up to your ceiling (not hitting it). If you can dribble try to do stationary v dribbles, figure 8s, and stationary crosses... all of these will tremendously help if you do it not daily but two/three times a day.. stay safe!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Connections connections! Use social media as your friend.. reach out to various coaches/agencies! Best thing would be is forming a highlight tape (if you haven #8217;t already) and sending that out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keep shooting/ doing those drills. The more you condition yourself into memorizing muscle memory for when shots go in the more you #8217;ll keep improving! Sounds cliche but Curry did the same thing.. he may not hit every shot *every game* but when he does in some games he can #8217;t miss. Plus, don #8217;t forget we can #8217;t really compare NBA shooting to high school shooting just yet.. much further 3 point line and much taller players to contest your shot.. so don #8217;t be discouraged. My advice would be when practicing in game situation shots do something trae young/ cp3 do to not get blocked when shooting. The key is to dribble in a very low stance, such as doing a size up and stay low to the ground and subsequently jabbing with your front foot and pulling up. Practice these types of shots in practice and shooting with pressured defense in game situations will become second nature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have a mindset that no matter whenever you are playing basketball whether it #8217;s a game/practice you put in work to get there.. let that serve as motivation.. if you really want something you have to put in countless hours and your work will start to show.. you #8217;re still young and can improve tremendously since there #8217;s always room for improvement. Go play your heart out each and every game, if you turned the ball over or missed a shot so what? Get redemption on defense.. coaches love that. Be very active on defense and in turn when you get the ball during an offensive possession you #8217;ll surely have more confidence. Don #8217;t beat yourself up, God has us all destined for something and all we have to do is put that work in. At times coaches in many schools can have favorites.. don #8217;t let this discourage you. If you feel like you have really put in the work talk to the coach (or email them) and tell them how you feel like you would fit into the team. Go out there and play hard... no ones gonna remember a silly turnover off of your leg after the next quarter/half.. Just ball out and you #8217;ll get where you wanna go</TEXT>
