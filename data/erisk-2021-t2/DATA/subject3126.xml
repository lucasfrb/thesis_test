    <TITLE>F1 2019 should have classic tracks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-25 13:04:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Considering that the 2018 and 2019 f1 calendars are the same (other than USA and Mexico swapping places) Codemasters should try and get some classic tracks in the game. I was thinking they could add the likes of Imola, Jerez Magny Cours etc. If they don't want to do that, they should bring classic versions of modern tracks back. For example old Silverstone and old Hockinenheim, because who wouldn't want that? EDIT: I was also thinking, how cool would it be if you could use classic points in custom championships? When I do a classic championship on F1 2018 I find it annoying that you can only have the current 25 point system. It would add a little bit more detail if you could have the old 9 point system</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That list is pretty much Queens Square, Broadmead (And Cabot Circus, Thanks Martyn!) the one way road Hat Films got stuck down near the aquarium and the little park near the old office (Opposite St Paul's church). You've also got the Arnolfini and the legend that is 'Just Chips' and all the other weird roads Hat Films have gone down (Mainly near Park Street for some reason) Actually, speaking of Park Street, there is a brilliant little Italian place about half way up called Vincenzos. Highly recommended to anyone visiting the city. Don't forget to also sample some of the atmosphere at a Bristol Rovers match (Fuck City!) and go shopping at The Gallerys, Cabot Circus and (if you've got a car) Cribbs Causeway! You can also go and visit The M-Shed, We The Curious and The SS Great Britain. If you're in need of expensive booze and slightly dodgy food, might I recommend The Tobacco Factory, which is across the road from a brilliant chippy when you need to eat **something** to fix the hang over</TEXT>

I was just pointing out that the last three Americans to race F1 all performed very badly, and I don't want to see Colton befall the same fate, because he's a very talented young driver, who will do better in Indycar, simply because he's more likely to get a good drive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to agree with all the complaints. The racing sucks at the moment. Mercedes win every race, and Hamilton makes it boring, but I still maintain it's the best form of motorsport in the world. The cars are technically and aerodynamically superior to all other championships, and the drivers are the best in the world. Call me a 'snotty' fan, but every football fan believe their team is the best in the world, so why would it be different for forms of motorsport?</TEXT>

He wasn't in a crap car, as it took 5 wins, 9 podiums and 1 pole position, however Michael really struggled. After the Italian Grand Prix (the last race Andretti drove before getting the sack) Micahel had 7 points while team mate Ayrton Senna had 53. Same car, same engine, different leagues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the Base level we're all very similar, but there are some differences. For example Wales, Scotland and Ireland have there own languages (Welsh, Scottish Gaelic/Scots and Irish) Even in other parts of the country there are different languages. For example, people in Cornwall (South of England) speak Cornish and there are loads of other regional dialects. Moving away from Language, and sport is an important thing for all the home nations. Of course Football is played all over the country, as is Rugby, but cricket is something only really played in England, while Scotland has the Highland games (Google Caber Toss) and of course Wales and Ireland have traditional sports. Music is another thing that separates the nation's. Each country has produced iconic bands such as The Beatles (England) The Proclaimers (Scotland) Stereophonics (Wales) and U2 (Ireland) as well as loads of traditional music and dance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not me, but my best friend (counts, right) Anyway, and old girlfriend of his from his old home town moves to his current town, and starts attending the same high school as him. Unsurprisingly they get together fairly quickly, but she dumps him at the start of the summer holidays to be with one of our other friends (who didn't really like her, but sorta had no choice). After that all falls apart, she gets back together with my best friend, and they stay together until the Halloween half-term. When we all come back to school after a week off, we find that she has accused my best friend of RAPE, and has spent the last week making his life hell. The police got involved, and a load of people started making him out to be a monster or something. This whole s*** show lasts about two weeks until she admits she lied. She then tried to get back with him again, but by this point, our whole friendship group started, and there is no nice way of putting this, bullying the shit outta here. We ruined her whole reputation at School. By the end of our time there she had no friends, but still tried to pretend like she'd done nothing wrong!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A British view on money in elections</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-29 17:03:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>As an English viewer, I am constantly confused by American terms, and American issues (KB does a good job of giving the basics) but the PAC thing is super, super alien to me. As you're not doubt aware, we've just had a general election in the UK, and while we won't know for a while how much the election cost, the previous election in 2017 cost around  #163;140 million (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-41258026) We have very, very strict rules when it comes to what can and cannot be done in an election over here, and money is something we police. Parties and candidates have limits to how much they spend, and includes such gems as a  #163;30,000 spending limit per constituency (if a party ran in all 650 seats then the maximum would be  #163;19.5 million) as well declarations on everything, including adverts, leaflets, manifestos and even meetings. Another lovely law we have is that parties aren't allowed adverts on TV. They each get given an equal amount of time by the BBC and ITV for 'Party Election Broadcasts'. To donate to a party, you have to be on the electoral register or be a UK registered company. Every donation over  #163;7,500 must be declared by the party, with the names of the donaters etc. Between April 2019 and June 2019, 16 Parties (Brexit Express, the Communist Party, Conservative Party, Co-operative Party, Green Party, Lib Dems, Labour, Plaid Cymru, Renew, Scottish Greens, SNP, Brexit Party, Independent Group, the Radical Party, UKIP, and the Women's Equality Party) declared donations of about  #163;14 million (https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/latest-figures-published-political-party-donations-and-loans-great-britain-q2-2019) No country has it perfect when it comes to election spending, but I thought it was important for people to see how another country has different rules for the same thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Killdozer Marvin Heemeyer was a welder living in Granby, Colorado who was upset by the local council. They had blocked his request to build a road to his muffler repair shop to go around a new factory that was being built on top of the existing road. They then fined him for not being connected to the sewage line, because a workman building the factory had cut the connection. He then bought and modified a bulldozer, giving it 1 foot (30cm) thick armour plating, three gun ports (.50 caliber rifle, .308 semi-automatic rifle and a .22LR rile) as well as several video cameras to all him to see out of it. He then went on a rampage, damaging or knocking down 13 buildings and causing over $7 million in damage. Amazingly, only Heemeyer died, after he shot himself when his vehicle became stuck  #8203; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin\_Heemeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Heemeyer)</TEXT>

If anyone knows a fix, that'd be great, as I pre-ordered, but don't want to play for fear of doing damage</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think there's a few reason. First, I don't think he is very comfortable driving the car. It seems to be very unpredictable, which really doesn't match his driving style. Second, I think he's lost motivation. We was never going to be in a position to fight for the title, and the fact he was sacked before the season even started probably convinced him just to get through the year and go to Aston. I suppose we shouldn't discount the fact that Leclerc is really good. He's young, hungry and now comfortable in the team, and he now knows he's the lead driver for the next 5 years, which has given him a big confidence boost.</TEXT>
