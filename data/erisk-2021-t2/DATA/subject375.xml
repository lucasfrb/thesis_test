    <TITLE>Market Hero - auto responder platform</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-24 00:35:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I run an expansion of an accounting business. As you can imagine, this is our busiest time of the year, but my firm has not had a decent email marketing apparatus in place. I have been looking for a way to use sales funnels to market our services, and came across Market Hero on a few YouTube videos and posts. Online reviews seem to be split - and I can't tell who is an affiliate marketer with obvious bias in what they say about the product, and who is just sour grapes (from the detractors) because they either don't really understand how to use the platform or affiliate market for a competitors product. I was hoping someone here had experience with Market Hero and could tell me what they thought.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, but is it still rhetoric if it's actually happening? It stands to reason if you have an influx of unskilled labor willing to aggressively undercut local population in unskilled roles, those people will take the positions. Cost of labor goes down. If one laborer is the same as any other, why would you not hire the cheaper option? I mean, call it rhetoric all you want, but a fact is a fact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Take the most financially-depressed neighborhood with significant numbers of children in America and promise each and every child under the age of 10 a full-ride scholarship to the school of their choosing if they agree to never smoke, drink, do drugs, join a gang, and hold a B average until they graduate high school. Then, whenever someone breaks the pledge and gets kicked out of the program, call a secret meeting and say they can get back in the group if they can convince (NOT force) one of the ones that are still in it to break the pledge. Then, on the last day of their senior year, throw a huge pep rally to honor everyone that is still in the pledge, but set up a "Greatest Hits" reel of all the people that agreed to mess up the other peoples' futures. Then tell everyone that's still left that it was all just a joke and there never was a scholarship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think an important consideration to take into account is that to your average voter in these areas they drive around on roads that are some of the worst in the country. People vote in their self-interest mostly. When I compare fixing roads I drive on versus paying for more public transit I don't use, I want the damn roads fixed so I don't have to pay for constant realignments, new tires, etc. Even if those costs aren't actually interchangeable - to the voter they are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely. The ONLY sidequest SW movie I wanted to see was Boba Fett. But if they are going to take Fett and jam him into the current horrible writing culture they have over at Disney / Lucasfilms right now, I #8217;d rather it not get made. Boba Fett should run the finest of lines to an R-Rated SW movie. Use that and a great marketing budget and release in July or Christmas. Make the story dark and the screens bright. Give us an absolute merciless character - someone BAD - but make us root for him anyway like Breaking Bad. Do that, and you have the next Billion dollar Star Wars movie. It doesn #8217;t need to be a prequel. It can cover what happens to him after he escapes the Sarlaac pit.</TEXT>

Doing a solid speed around 2 am - no one on the road - and a barefoot lady is walking in circles in the street and as I drive past she lunges at the side of my car. Her eyes were like rolled back and face was just blank but she was sweating a ton. I assumed crack.

    <TEXT>Honestly, in retrospect that bugged me the most about this whole thing. On this stage, you cannot afford to NOT be picking each other up. I have been ragging on JR to everyone and their mom since this happened - and Lebron is justifiably upset - but the game was not over. It was not a loss. The same situation as if JR has gone right back up with it and got swatted by KD. If Korver is the only dude on the team trying to pick everyone up, that is a major problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>JR could be traded to a newly-minted farm team that plays exclusively outdoors ball in Siberia and it wouldn't be enough to keep Lebron in Cleveland now. I thought he had damn near no chance after the ECF win and the half-hearted handshake with the Cavs over - but JR's incident seals Bron looking for real estate anywhere outside the Midwest.</TEXT>

A big thing people talk about on here, in a bi-partisan manner, is that mega media corporations own all the news companies.

    <TEXT>Little bit of both - leaving my own business in an oversaturated industry and going into sales in a completely unrelated field. The Perdomo was fantastic! The ash stayed through virtually the whole smoke. Full, good tasting. For an $8.00 smoke, I was very surprised. I usually go for a V-cut but my guy at the shop had me try a bullet cut - definitely my new go to. Paired it with a Better Life Choices IPA from Atwater Brewery. Overall a solid evening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Legit question - have any of these proven to be legit or do the ones we hear of get blown up specifically because they were faked and therefore poised to do so? I liken it to genetically modified plants - the ones we hear about are the ones that were designed to be heard about and are fake. On the other hand, I can #8217;t recall hearing of one that was legit and withstood the test of time. So maybe the majority of these are mini-false flags so people cash in on sympathy donations and outrage culture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's nothing adult about this. Two people took advantage of this guy's extreme self-esteem issues and people want to act like this is a good result. That his 'friends' are somehow mature, generous, good people. That crying himself to sleep while listening through the wall to his ex-girlfriend have sex with someone he flat-out states he believes is an "upgraded" version of himself is not severely troubling. He needs a therapist and some male role models, not empty congratulations and positive reinforcement of behavior that's going to lead to a miserable life. Candy tastes good but you shouldn't eat it in place of vegetables - that's what your praise is; empty of value but it tastes good. There's a real person on the other end of this story - if that were your brother, would you tell him the same? This guy needs to wake the fuck up, and this is the perfect time to do it. This horrible experience needs to be felt enough so he will KNOW he needs to change. Softening this blow is doing a disservice to him, the next woman he dates, and the family he may some day have. You can have your buzzword insults and discount my viewpoint because of my beliefs all you want, doesn't bug me. But this guy needs to hear that there are other ways out there. No one is a downgraded version of themselves. That was heartbreaking and sickening to read.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. Not what I said. I think in the wild that's a totally rational and valid way of handling this, but we are not there. Laws, society, etc. (If it wasn't for those, then you're on the money. If it wasn't for our social contract / experiment, he should absolutely beat his ex-roommate to within an inch of his life so no one else catches on to how easy he is to use and how willing he is to let stuff get taken from him. If he didn't, he'd be easy prey.) But, and here's YOUR leeway, hopefully he does have a job and a future. His image - let's be real - that's not worth protecting, because it's weak. And he's choosing to keep to that image because it's easier than changing. The problem with your method here is that even when they did "talk" he couldn't stand up for himself. He lacks the fundamental basic self-respect to set a boundary and enforce it. You have a guy who values his own wants, needs, and health so poorly that he was willing to lie about them so he wouldn't rock the boat. He's repressing very real and very valid negative feelings to his own detriment. In fact, we KNOW he was lying because he cried himself to sleep. Does that sound like open and honest communication to you? Or is it someone trying play off how 'mature' and 'understanding' they are? So he doesn't have to admit how angry he is, how sad he is, and how hurt he is, bringing his shame out into the open. That crying fit was caused by shame. And he SHOULD feel shame. Because that shame was the one little part of himself that he's pushing way down that's saying he is not okay with this and wants to change. Shame, like all pain, is stimulus for action. Do not praise this guy - you are taking away a very real chance for him to fix himself. By praising him you are denying someone a REAL opportunity to mature into a healthy adult.</TEXT>

In what market has the sudden nationalization or redistribution of property given confidence to outside investment? I mean, the government was offering 10% of market rate for a buyout...or nothing. So if you invest in any minority-owned agricultural business in South Africa you can expect to lose 90% of your investment's value or, alternatively, 100%, by this benchmark. And it's not like anyone expects the seizures to stop at agriculture once this goes through. Volatile isn't the right word. Cryptocurrency startups are volatile.

    <TEXT>Okay, I hear you. But let's be real - there's not much worse than being beaten to death, haha  #8203; Not knowing how another person feels or what's going to happen is just part of the way we are. No curse, no flame, that's just what it is. At the end of the day, how you handle that laying in bed defines a lot of how you are as a person and a man. In fact, rejection does not make you less of a man, if anything, it makes you more of one. What is more of a universal experience of becoming a man than facing down rejection? Not everyone goes to war, not everyone starts a business, raises a family, or undergoes some adulthood recognition ceremony.

    <TEXT>No it #8217;s not. The FBI is executive branch. They only do background checks in this scenario. For the White House. Not the Senate. That #8217;s partially why the Senate has hearings. Feinstein should have brought this up during the hearings - she purposely waited until after them in order to delay this. She #8217;s had that letter since July. This is a political move pure and simple. And it #8217;s going to have lasting effects for decades of SC appointments. I mean did we learn nothing through Obama #8217;s use of the Executive order?! No one gave a shit during those 8 years but Trump utilizes EOs and all of a sudden all hell breaks loose. That #8217;s the problem with the political parties in America - the other side is always seen to be acting evilly and partisan but when our side does it, the means are necessary because we agree with the ends.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I said in my reply. If we forget about building the wall and increasing border patrol, and instead reduce paperwork (not really sure this is a barrier so much as it is taking up time) and move to a merit-based system, then you just add an entire class of people who are incentivized to cross illegally - the people for whom the merit requirements wouldn #8217;t be met. But since the southern border is weak, they can just cross illegally there. It makes more sense to have a strong border and then go merit based.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Realistically that would be so unpopular it wouldn #8217;t happen or - alternatively - it may start to happen and it #8217;ll either spur a civil war or, at the very least, hundreds of armed standoffs, conflicts, and armed demonstrations. If the hypothetical Democrat president in question wants 100s of Kent States then, sure, declare that emergency. People do not realize how deeply ingrained and closely held 2nd amendment rights are taken in this country. No one is giving up their guns. That #8217;s why the left hopes to legislate it away over the course of decades and not all at once - they want to use the boiling frog approach to avoid an actual civil war or open revolt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>One of the more troubling things I #8217;ve witnessed in my lifetime was the virtual disappearance of right leaning voices from American college campuses. At my undergrad, the college republicans were dwarfed by the other side easily 1:10. Granted, this was a small, affluent liberal arts college - but it was in the south. Professors routinely taught liberal ideology and opinion as fact, denigrated opposing viewpoints in class, and generally gave little attention to anything that came from a conservative source. Outside of Econ classes and a few political science classes- that was my experience. What can be done in the coming years to bring balance to the American undergraduate experience?</TEXT>

Once I got what I felt was stronger, I alternated weighted ones - first a belt clip with normal gym weights, later a weight vest - with unweighted also in pyramid. Granted at the same time I was rock climbing but the change up was enough for me to break through and I hit 25 not overly long after that. Another thing I #8217;ve seen people do is practice muscle-ups, it seems to develop muscles a bit differently than a standard pull-up but the muscles then help in standard pull-ups.

    <TEXT>Not exactly what I was referring to, but I #8217;ll respond. That level of scrutiny or safety is unrealistic. It is impossible to guarantee zero deaths as a result of road accidents for truckers. They are the population that most uses the roads. You are asking for unilateral blame in a situation that is inherently collective. For example - Truckers are required to maintain something like 1000 feet between them and cars in front of them (don #8217;t have exact figure or regulation). In traffic, your average moron sees 1000 feet in front of the truck as open space they can weave in and out of. Hell, half the time the non commercial driver merges into a trucker #8217;s lane and hits the brakes- because massive moving vehicles pulling ridiculous weights are known for stopping on a dime and maneuverability. Just two examples of  #8220;truckers killing people #8221; that do not warrant continual government harassment, unless you want the literal lifeblood of the economy to come to a screeching halt. I #8217;m referring more to the government #8217;s policies not in line with industry realities. They focus on punishing the driver when the shipper that employs them is often the instigator of non compliant behavior.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The movie itself was okay. Honestly the action was good from a visual perspective, the dialogue was meh, and while I thought the character was fairly badass as far as superheroines go, her character #8217;s background lacked true depth to really connect. I mean there was supposed to be this hardship she faced but really it wasn #8217;t all that dramatic or even beyond what your average person deals with in the course of their life: people telling you you can #8217;t do something or you can #8217;t cut it. Literally anyone that is successful hoes through that. Granted, the film portrays this as a result of being a tomboyish girl, but it #8217;s kinda like - big deal. My little sister faced way worse on her rise through sports and overcame way worse. I admire her much more than captain marvel. I also think they drastically overpowered the character as some sort of statement. She flies through entire battleships and tears them apart like butter. At no point did I ever think she wasn #8217;t going to win. It #8217;s really the same gripe I have with Superman, except Superman #8217;s backstory and archetype actually give him a depth of character. Overall, it was like Rey from star wars except with less of a connecting backstory. Not saying I hated it, I can separate idiotic things actors and actresses say from their characters, and I #8217;m not going to be brainwashed by a poorly told story, but I #8217;m not saying it was the worst thing I #8217;ve ever seen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, raise your prices. If you are still swamped in a couple months, hire a part time employee. Get swamped again? Raise prices. Still? Another employee. Get to three employees and three price raises. At that point, evaluate your employees - is there one that #8217;s a natural leader? Do they have the qualities you want and can you trust them? Let them know you want to watch them closely for the next month or something like that - if they are who you hope they are, congrats, that #8217;s your new  #8220;foreman #8221; / your replacement. You don #8217;t go out anymore. Now your job is to manage their jobs and work on your marketing. Get really into your finances and customer service. Work on making the jobs more efficient. Monitor their performance closely. When you can, get additional trucks / employees. When you begin to tap out or plateau, look for possible additional services or pivots. Expand. Your previous aspects of your job - financials, efficiency management, marketing, customer service? Look to outsource those as well. Keep the stuff you genuinely like to do. Have weekly and monthly meetings with your people so you dont lose touch. From there, shit I don #8217;t know. I #8217;ve only ever grown businesses to that point. This is just a loose summary and sounds loads easier than it actually is, but it IS a gameplan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just read. The inefficiency inherent in this system is staggering. Were any country to implement this they would be blown off the world economic stage so quickly they wouldn #8217;t even have time to starve to death or be arrested for wrongthink. They #8217;d be gutted immediately. I mean - jobs are compensated, among other criteria, according to how  #8220;difficult or dangerous they are #8221;. You know what already does that? The market. And much better than a self-assigned difficulty level or a  #8220;workers council #8221; whatever the hell that is. I mean it takes a shit on office work as not difficult or dangerous, but miners will automatically be paid higher because they work a more dangerous job? Dangerous to them sure. But right now I #8217;m sitting in front of 4 computer screens that show corporate ledgers and budgets in excess of 100m and if me and my team fuck up our super simple and safe office job there #8217;s about 6000 people in the US and Mexico that are going to lose their jobs when their factory closes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. Extrapolate. Our globalized economy is cutthroat and is - by necessity - a macro free market. If inefficiency in timing or allocation exists it is exploited to the inefficiency holder #8217;s detriment, either through outside state groups or through more competitive economies removing that inefficiency. Example is say is the US cannot offer the best price or best product on something needed in say Nigeria. The Nigerians will then field other offers for the same and then China, or Singapore fills that need. The US economy then takes a hit while the void filler sees an uptick. Repeat ad nauseum and your country goes broke. Edit: plus we can #8217;t crunch actuals here unless there is a state utilizing this economic model. Are there?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice on short term career strategy</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-01 15:50:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! Looking for advice and thoughts here. I have a legal background and picked up some finance chops along the way. After a business I started ended up failing (thankfully not due to my own faults but industry-wide issues and a poor partner relationship) I interviewed for and got a job as a Financial Analyst at a very large company - Tier 1 supplier. Originally I interviewed as an account financial manager, and was offered the role. HR then came in and screwed me over a bit, but used my lack of financial history in my resume to ding me down to the FA level. I took the job because it #8217;s a huge opportunity to pivot careers and grow a skill set, not to mention I #8217;m working under extremely knowledgeable people - all of whom I respect and get along well with. I have been utterly killing it. Started projects that have ended up becoming standardized on a company wide level and my work ends up in front of the CFO monthly now. I even took on the account financial manager role for accounts that were left without one after people left. Now I #8217;m looking at short to medium term career advancement strategy. I have been told I will most likely get the promotion to what I was originally brought in for, but the salary won #8217;t fall within what I was promised before HR interfered. Also, the company appears to be stagnating and pulling in purse strings - people aren #8217;t getting raises or promotions they deserve. My dilemma: I want to get above the 110k compensation level as quickly as possible. It #8217;s a large jump from where I #8217;m at now. Am I better off taking a promotion in title and a 10% pay bump and biding my time / looking to jump to another company or am I better off asking for a title promotion up two grades, settling for the ~7% I think I #8217;m likely to get and then in another year using that title to leverage a much higher compensation level at another company - possibly getting to my 110K goal? There #8217;s a lot more, but I think this is a good basic level of info. Any thoughts are welcome and appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If consulting is your goal then it #8217;s worth it. Self-investment is always a great get in terms of ROI - but you need to consider opportunity cost. If you own a business, if you have other investments you can make, etc. That might be a bit vague by way of summary, but that #8217;s the way I look at it. I #8217;m not going into consulting but if I want to reach higher levels within my industry then I need an MBA for when HR evaluates my resume / pedigree.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(Keep in mind I #8217;m speaking specifically from my industry) while a check the box MBA might provide some benefit and it would meet that Hr requirement, it #8217;s only going to get me so far. A check the box would get me put into a leadership position on a cross-functional team. Good money, good responsibility. But if I ever want to see C-Suite before I #8217;m in my late 50s, I have to get a more prestigious program on my CV. For me, that #8217;s most likely Ross or Booth. Of all the MBAs I work with, those with check the box are solid middle to upper middle management levels. Those that went to Ross, HBS, MIT, and the one guy that got his from Yale - they #8217;re all department heads, VPs, or C-Suite. I don #8217;t know if their reach was due to natural skill or the network they had access to or what- but I #8217;d be willing to say that the organization puts a premium on those MBAs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Additional sad part - kid moved to Detroit from Berkeley (nice Detroit metro suburb) because he believed in the city and wanted to be part of its improvement. He worked late nights in that area and was getting off work when he got in a minor fender bender. Dudes beat him to death within view of bystanders and everyone just left him there. His family is like a friend of a friend of my uncle #8217;s family. They are devastated. There is a GoFundMe for the funeral, dunno if it #8217;s against rules to link but may want to look it up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also would like to know this! I have two years to learn Mandarin adequately, but since I #8217;ll be proposing by then (and I #8217;m not super confident I #8217;ll be able to speak better than a baby by then) I #8217;d like to be able to ask my girlfriend #8217;s father not having to rely on shoddy words, WeChat translator, or google.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not to be a dick, and I seriously don #8217;t mean it this way, but what you #8217;re missing is a lot of reading, studying, analysis, networking, and follow through. REI is among the most competitive markets / avenues for investment in the world. It can vary between oddly simple and insanely complex.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The biggest travesties are that they totally mis-titled the show and Amazon just pissed away their marketing on other shows. I can #8217;t even remember what shows they had come out at the same time as this one, but clearly it sapped their marketing budget. If Patriot had half the marketing push that Jack Ryan did, Patriot would have a following 3-4x as much as it does at least. Everyone I #8217;ve ever introduced to the show fell in love with it by episode 3.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>203k, house hacking, and business case analysis</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-26 13:21:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve worked with a wholesaler for a little while but own none of my own properties. As I have a great shot at an FHA I began looking at properties around my market - Detroit metro area. Having recently learned about the 203K and Michigan #8217;s MSHDA - (https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/0,4641,7-141-45866_45868-370762--,00.html)I #8217;ve become very interested in buying, rehabbing, and renting / house hacking a property as opposed to just setting up a deal. Problem is I am having difficulty putting together a decently thorough business case analysis for a 203k property or a 203k property with the MSHDA. Does anyone have any advice, considerations, details, or even a business case analysis they #8217;d be able to share?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By metro I mean outlying cities- places like Ferndale, Royal Oak, Plymouth, Northville, Birmingham. So not exactly downtown Detroit. Places I #8217;m looking to invest aren #8217;t in downtown area either- more like B and C neighborhoods.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Without a doubt. I hadn #8217;t searched for this at all, but earlier this week I went golfing with my buddy - phones on and sits right in the cart. Told him I would be proposing to my girlfriend in the next year or so. Now I #8217;ve had a bunch of targeted ads for engagement rings. Creepy.</TEXT>
