    <TITLE>Laptop for Mechatronics</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:57:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, I'm new here :) I am wondering wether i need a good laptop or not for me to study mechatronics. I am planning to study Mechatronics in Germany (rn im still at Studienkolleg) most likely next year. I am planning to buy a laptop to get me through the whole 4 years or so studying mechatronics. What are the minimum and recommended specs? So yeah would appreciate if someone can answer this question.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! I actually play some Dota and CSGO :) But can you elaborate about the specs required so CAD programs can run smoothly. I would say that i dont have that much budget, so high-end laptops are out of the question. If the gaming Laptops are the best choice for the price then I'll go for it, but if non gaming Laptops can provide just as good work for my study then I will probably go for the non gaming one. Well depends on which one is more worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the reply! Is the NVIDIA MX Series good enough? Or what kind of GPU are good for the work (i dont have that much money, so i dont think i can afford the 'best' GPUs') while being not so expensive :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for replying! So i still can do most of my work from home while using something like i5 10th gen with 8gb RAM and NVidia MX series GPU or should i go for another thing like maybe ryzen stuffs? I m kinda on a budget, the furthest i can go is probably mid range laptop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As long as it can run it fine, i think its okay. I will be studying abroad so i dont think i can build a PC. My PC at home is severely outdated :) I can probably go for this year's HP Pavilion Gaming or Lenovo Ideapad Gaming and from your description, i think it would run the program fine, albeit not very very smoothly. I might have the budget to go for HP Omen 15. Oh can ryzen laptops do the job well? (Ryzen CPU and Nvidia GTX like Lenovo legion 5)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, will do! From the other comments i would say that the 2020 mid/ even entry seems to be more than fine to run most of the program, and the super heavy program should just be done in the lab. Thank you very much for your time! Wishing you a good year :)</TEXT>
