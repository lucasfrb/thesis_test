    <TEXT>Yo guys, I #8216;ve been trying to make vibey drill melodies like the one from  #8222;i dunno #8220; or  #8222;burning #8220; from dutch and also i #8216;ve been trying to make melodies like 808 Melo for Pop smoke but it just doesn #8217;t seem to work for me. My melodies for some reason always end up sounding  #8222;sad #8220;, if you know what I mean. I want the vibe of my melodies to be fresh and melodic like quincy does all the time or really epic like 808 melo does it. Do you guys have any tips for scales or instruments so that I can make some vibey and epic melodies? Btw. I don #8217;t want to do piano Drill Beats like everybody else #128514; Sorry if my English isn #8217;t perfect, I #8217;m not from England</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-05 14:13:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yo guys what #8217;s up. I have played this game over a year ago or so I think and was actually pretty good at it (diamond). Since than I haven #8217;t played this game at all and now im starting to play again. I needed to start with a new account because I have deleted my Facebook account and I #8217;m pretty clueless as to how arcana works right now. I think I have a lot of  #8222;arcana points #8220; or however you may call them (I play in german so I don #8217;t know the translation) but I don #8217;t know what to do with them. Should I just upgrade all my arcana? Or do I wait until I get good arcana to upgrade Those? Which arcana are even good? Lol. Any help is appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys. I just finished the newest episodes of seven deadly sins and wanted to start a new anime. I have only watched Naruto+shippuden+Bortuto, Attack on Titan, (half of) Tokyo ghoul, Seven deadly sins and (half of) death note. Everyone seems to be loving death note but I #8217;m gonna be honest it was kinda boring to me. I missed watching stuff like seven deadly sins and Aot where there are fight scenes and action. Can you recommend anime #8217;s to me that are like Naruto, seven deadly sins, Aot?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>808 #8216;s Off?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:34:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys I #8216;ve Heard from other producers that some of my 808 #8216;s are off so I wanted to ask how? I always put the 808 #8216;s on the Root Note of my melody. When I vary the 808 #8216;s I always take other notes that are within my melody at that point so how can they be off? I really don #8217;t know much about music theory so maybe I #8217;m missing something here. And ideas? Also I #8217;ve heard that some notes within the scale sometimes still don #8217;t sound good, so are there any general rules?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for you answer bro. But I don #8217;t get the whole 808 tuning concept to be honest. The guy in the video just starts telling you how to do it but not what it is. What exactly does tuning your 808s do? I didn #8217;t understand that</TEXT>
