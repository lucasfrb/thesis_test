    <TEXT>I'm not entirely sure. Being less introverted might help me find a girl but idk. Thinking about being in a relationship led me to thinking that I'd probably constantly think I'm not good enough for whoever I'm with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is probably going to sound pathetic but I don't really care at this point. Pretty much everything that happens nowadays reminds me of how I'll always be alone and deserve nothing but suffering. It started raining today and all I thought was how is never have someone to stay inside out of the rain with and just hang out with all day and spend time together. I don't know how but my screwed up mind led me to then thinking that even if I do by some miracle find a girl, I'd deserve for her to abuse me. The second I thought that, I knew that it was true. If I ever find someone, I deserve for them to abuse me, emotionally, physically, whatever. Between how lonely I am and how much I don't deserve happiness, I'm fine with that. At least someone would get some enjoyment from my suffering rather than nobody get anything from it. I'm sorry for my sick mentality but oh well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've had voices like this in my head for a long time. Telling me to hurt myself, kill myself, that I'm not worthy of anyone, that I deserve to suffer. Sometimes they win and I cave into self harm or just berating myself. Only advice I have is to try and tune out the voices. Keep trying to ignore them because for me they keep coming back to wear me down. Hopefully for you they'll eventually stop but just don't let them win. Try to focus on something good</TEXT>

It may seem like nobody cares about your depression but I'm sure people care for you. I like to think I'll maybe find someone one day and that helps but I know that's not likely to happen. Anyway I hope you can feel better soon</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't worry about it. Most of the time people ask questions to the professor in my classes, I learn something from their answer anyway. Or sometimes I had the exact same question as the person who asked it. Anyway a lot of questions just means you have an inquisitive mind and probably think more than the people around you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know what you mean. I've never talked about any of my problems to anyone I know because I don't want them to pity me or even concern themselves with my problems. I've always thought it best to just pretend to be alright. This is just what I do though because I don't really trust anyone enough to even tell them I'm struggling. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't talk to people I know about my issues, but that doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. Maybe for you, you need to talk to someone to get better. Personally I'm not sure that would help me so I've never tried it. I hope you can figure out how to feel better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, my depression is just a repeated beat down of myself in my mind, followed by self harm, not eating, barely sleeping, and what used to be suicidal thoughts every once in a while turned into every day. I still care about what happens to other people and stuff but couldn't care any less about what happens to me. I've been laying awake at night hoping that the next day I'd die in some accident or even just get murdered. Then after I think of how unlikely that is, I debate how I should kill myself. I still have energy to do stuff, just no motivation. Idk I guess that's a glance at what my depression is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Please don't go through with your plans. I know it seems like what you've done will follow you forever but you said you're in high school right? And given your 4.6 gpa I'm assuming you're going to college. I'm in college right now and believe me, nobody cares about anything that happened in high school once you've moved on to college or getting a job or whatever. Everyone's too busy to care about that anymore so please don't give up. Also if you plan to go to college, if it's not in your town, it's fairly unlikely you'll see people from high school. I hope you can get through this and live.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well if it comes up during your background check, maybe you can explain what happened. I know you said it's pretty much an immediate deterrent, but can you really know for 100% certainty until you apply? Maybe they won't find out about it or maybe they'll give you a chance to give your side of the story</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand. In my opinion, I'd say it's worth the effort. You're clearly very smart so it's not worth it to give up now. Don't let your talent go to waste. Regardless of your political views, people can't deny your intelligence with a 4.6 gpa. I'm sure you can easily get into a ton of colleges if you can't get into the naval academy. As for going to school, I'd say talk with a teacher or principal in regards to your safety. I know you think they might not care to help because of what you did, but they're not doing their jobs if they're not protecting all students. If going to school really isn't a viable option, can you do your work online?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might be best to do it online just to be safe then. As for being alone, just try talking to a few new people on here or something, eventually you'll click with someone and can talk with them a lot more. I guess for your best friend just try to get a feel for when you can talk to her. Like don't pressure her to talk or anything just kinda ease into a conversation if shes up to it</TEXT>
