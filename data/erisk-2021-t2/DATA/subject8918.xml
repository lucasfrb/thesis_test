    <TEXT>Hey /u/SancziImreLajos. Thanks for your submission in /r/MemeEconomy! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):  gt; * Rule 2: **Create Original Content**. Most of our successful memes have been home-grown original content picked off the internet by our users. We expect you to follow these very standards that other successful brokers have defined. Moderators are able to remove low-effort memes subject to their discretion, including overdone formats, which have been oversaturated and their market value is next to nothing. Based on the consensus of the community, overdone formats **are** one type of low-effort memes. For a full list of our rules, please review the [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/sidebar) or our [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/rules).

    <TEXT>Thank you ChronosPlayz for your submission, *Yeah probably*! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s): --- # Posts with low effort truth statements are not allowed. Your submission is considered "low effort." This doesn't inherently mean that it was *irrelevant* to r/technicallythetruth, but instead it was removed because it fit one or more of these criteria: * Short, minimal-effort text posts like "a water bottle without water is an air bottle". Most, if not all text posts can and will be removed. * Asking for upvotes, or saying things like "sort by new", "let's get to the front page", or anything related to cake days or karma. * [Meta memes](https://imgur.com/qgkCskm), or any other post that tries to be clever by mentioning r/technicallythetruth. * [Images that are hard to look at](https://imgur.com/yuMwr8a) because they are poorly made, deep-fried, or poorly cropped. **Your submission could have also been removed because it is overdone:** * Statements that say something like "at least twelve": [example 1](https://imgur.com/K1ZwEAv) | [example 2](https://imgur.com/dIkwEpU) * Common statements that begin with "on average...": *the average amount of hands a person has is less than two* | *each person has, on average, one testicle and one boob* * Low effort misunderstandings of everyday phrases: *How high are you -- gt; "I'm 5 foot 9"* * Common insults that are meant literally as opposed to being insulting: *"homosexuals are gay"* | *"gay people are f-ing assholes"* **PLEASE NOTE that we will exercise our own discretion when using this rule. If we do not find a post fitting for this subreddit, it will be removed.** For more on our rules, please check out our [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/technicallythetruth/about/sidebar).

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):  gt; * Rule 2: **Create Original Content**. Most of our successful memes have been home-grown original content picked off the internet by our users. We expect you to follow these very standards that other successful brokers have defined. Moderators are able to remove low-effort memes subject to their discretion, including overdone formats, which have been oversaturated and their market value is next to nothing. Based on the consensus of the community, overdone formats **are** one type of low-effort memes. For a full list of our rules, please review the [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/sidebar) or our [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/rules).

    <TEXT>It's not bullshit and the script is not broken. People were already complaining about the subreddit's quality when I joined the mod team (at about 100 000 subscribers). I mod a bunch of subs, and on every single one of these subs, users complain about low-quality content. I could start removing every single post that isn't of extremely high quality. But people would keep complaining. And eventually, the sub would die. I've seen it happen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello u/purplefictionista , thank you for submitting to r/agedlikemilk. Unfortunately, your submission ["i have to laugh"](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/gpcx8c/-/) has been removed because it violates the following rules: Rule I. Limit low effort content No matter what you think of him, a lot of what Trump says ages like milk. Also anything featuring Bill Cosby (cereal boxes, commericals, etc) isn't going to stand the test of time anymore. Overused subjects are becoming very low effort as a result and due to this, only exceptional gaffs or historical contradictions will be accepted for low effort subjects. Read the sidebar rules and guidelines, and if you still feel this was done in error, please [Contact the mods here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fagedlikemilk).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*Are you well versed in the rules of /r/PS4? Please include a link to the rules along with this answer.* Yeah, I understand the 10 rules of your sub. They're all pretty simple and straightforward. Here's a link to the rules page: https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4/about/rules *How long have you been an /r/PS4 subscriber?* I've been a subscriber for a few years across 2 different accounts. I bought a PS4 back in 2014 and subscribed to the subreddit shortly after that. *What is your comment/link karma for /r/PS4? Overall?* I don't have karma on /r/PS4. I use this account exclusively for mod-related stuff to prevent harassment on my other acc. *Why do you want to do this?* Well, I've been lurking the sub for quite a while now. I'd like to give back to the community by filtering out bad content. I spend a lot of time on my PS4, mostly on Warzone and BO4, which is why I'd like to help mod the sub. I'm already a mod on COD gaming subs like /r/CODwarzone and I'm appreciating it so far so I'd like to give it a go here. *Would you keep doing this for year(s) down the road, even when the PS4 has become a last-gen console? Why?* Definitely. I still love my PS3 (even though it's old as hell now, bought it about 11 years ago) so I'm not giving up my PS4 anytime soon. Moderation is a long-term commitment. *Do you play a lot of different games? What games don't you like?* Yeah, I play a lot of different games. My favorite games are F13: the game, BO4, MW, Formula 1, and Minecraft. I'm not a huge fan of RPGs in general (although a few of them are enjoyable). *How much time a week could you volunteer to this? In which time zone of the world are you located?* My current timezone is UTC-5. I'm located in NA. I spend about 30 hours on moderation every week across the different subs I mod, so I could spend a portion of that on /r/PS4. *What's a modqueue?* A modqueue is the page where you can see a subreddit's reported content. You can also find filtered content and posts that are stuck in the spam filter. *Are you prepared to be called an overzealos Nazi / absentee good-for-nothing by 3,2 million people everytime you leave a comment?* Yep. As I said above, I mod a few gaming subs which are toxic to say the least. Being called a nazi is bound to happen when you moderate a gaming sub. Just gotta make sure that you don't take these insults personally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you fenrir290 for your submission, *Dew it*! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s): --- # Posts with low effort truth statements are not allowed. Your submission is considered "low effort." This doesn't inherently mean that it was *irrelevant* to r/technicallythetruth, but instead it was removed because it fit one or more of these criteria: * Short, minimal-effort text posts like "a water bottle without water is an air bottle". Most, if not all text posts can and will be removed. * Asking for upvotes, or saying things like "sort by new", "let's get to the front page", or anything related to cake days or karma. * [Meta memes](https://imgur.com/qgkCskm), or any other post that tries to be clever by mentioning r/technicallythetruth. * [Images that are hard to look at](https://imgur.com/yuMwr8a) because they are poorly made, deep-fried, or poorly cropped. **Your submission could have also been removed because it is overdone:** * Statements that say something like "at least twelve": [example 1](https://imgur.com/K1ZwEAv) | [example 2](https://imgur.com/dIkwEpU) * Common statements that begin with "on average...": *the average amount of hands a person has is less than two* | *each person has, on average, one testicle and one boob* * Low effort misunderstandings of everyday phrases: *How high are you -- gt; "I'm 5 foot 9"* * Common insults that are meant literally as opposed to being insulting: *"homosexuals are gay"* | *"gay people are f-ing assholes"* **PLEASE NOTE that we will exercise our own discretion when using this rule. If we do not find a post fitting for this subreddit, it will be removed.** For more on our rules, please check out our [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/technicallythetruth/about/sidebar).

    <TEXT>Download rEFInd from sourceforge and install it. The installation instructions are simple, especially on linux: https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html After installing rEFInd, you can customize the OS icon and the background by messing with the refind.conf file, which can be found in the /boot/efi/EFI/refind folder (or somewhere around there). I personally used the configuration from the rEFInd-minimal theme (https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal) and tweaked a few other stuff like the 'timeout' delay and the files to scan. The rEFInd-minimal icons were too small for my screen, and so was the background (I have a 4k display) so I had to replace the icons/background with images from the web. Let me know if you have questions. It's a pretty simple process considering that rEFInd automatically detects your OS'.</TEXT>
