    <TEXT>I have the same issue, were you able to fix anything as I'm a days late here? After some testing here is where I'm at: 1) playing the game is 100% fine no noticeable sound issues this is only a recording issue 2) if I play back the Quest recording either in headset of drag it over to my PC the results are the same MASSIVE static noise over the video only in game if I flip to oculus home it stops but flip back to game and it starts up 3) if i turn the music off in the game the static goes but some little scratching can be heard 4) if I turn off SFX i think the little scratching goes 5) turning off voice sound appears to do nothing 6) now restarting the game with music off still gives static so I'm all out of ideas</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well for me personally since I bought my Quest on release I've used my Vive maybe 2-3 times and now that I've been using the Oculus link the Vive is permanently packed away. My only urge to bring it out again was if my friend comes over for multiplayer. The comfort for longer play is a big one though but I just made the frankenQuest mod with my Vive DAS that I already had so I'm very happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Vive and Quest owner I'd 100% say Quest at this stage. So many positives! I take it to parties and love the Oculus link. The only thing that stinks about the Quest is long term comfort but because I had the Vive deluxe Audio strap I did the FrankenQuest mod and it is very comfortable now. But yeah, Quest with link works flawlessly with my lower spec PC I've been playing Boneworks with an i5 4590, 1060 6gb and 16gb RAM. Also alot of quest/rift games are cross buy for tethered or on the go fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Key things. - Fan: helps with orientation and feelings of motion also a hot head will really escalate sickness - Breaks: feeling sick? STOP my wife associates VR with "sick" now so its hard to get her back in unless its a really mellow game, dont let that be you - Water: often forgotten about, you get really dehydrated in VR not just from the movement but your eyes too - Tip: Alot of people have trouble with rotation I'd suggest body rotation only rather than using the stick to turn Oooooor.... you could be an idiot like me... when I first got my Vive years back I spent many hours on the couch sick. I just kept pushing and pushing. My tipping point was convincing my brain into thinking I was on a skateboard sliding around. It was like a switch flipped in my mind and from then on I could play any game without sickness. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seems like you have tried alot sorry if this isnt helpful but.. something to check and why people would tell you to tick the PTC (or not) would be to make sure your Quest and PC are on the same update. I know I had this issue when update 12 rolled out (it was killing me) Go into your Quest and setting to force update (if it will let you) On your PC I would not sign in to the PTC Then test. If no then tick the PTC then test. I feel your frustration as I had the same thing Good luck, let me know how it went maybe we can talk through it more if it didnt help</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes please! Unfortunately game is way too easy atm. They should make special items that help you in storms. Like for example Glacio has frost storms that you need a heated suit item or you get iced up, get slow and lose visibility. Or in Calidor you get all hot and bothered and start dropping items unless you have a cooler. I dunno just some dumb ideas</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Oculus Link Stormland stutter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 12:10:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, just wondering if anyone has had this issue or fixed it (also sorry I'm not a real PC nerd I've got alot to learn) Other games seem fine (so far) but Stormland frames drop quite a bit if I encounter enemies or go to a new area. I've not played long because this issue is frankly nauseating. I feel like I'm doing something wrong I've tweaked the settings up and down. The mirror image on my desktop is butter smooth but headset is janky at times. Any tips or programs that might help me trouble shoot? is this a common issue with Stormland or oculus link? My PC specs are on the lower side but while playing my CPU usage and GPU usage don't go above 80% (CPU occasionally goes to 90% its my weakest link seemingly) Intel Core i5 4590 @ 3.30GHz GeForce RTX 2060 16GB RAM game is running off the SSD Thanks so much I love this community! \[\]-) P.S. I am using the a good Link cable (5gbps) that I didn't have issues with other games (I also own an official link cable but didn't realise its a usbC both ends and my Mother board doesn't have usbC -.-' \*\*\*also tried a 3.0 C to A adapter, not working so went back to my previous cable that works fine)</TEXT>

Also you could be running different updates on your quest and PC that will kill the link also Once I changed to the official cable all my troubles went away.

    <TEXT>Respect to all these comments they are good. I have over 300 hour in ED all in VR my one tip is ease yourself in, rotation is the real killer maybe modify your flying style, fly your ship more like an aeroplane with less yaw then slowly incorporate some more manoeuvres. Its totally up to you though. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can get cheaper ones. Long story short Official cable uses fibre optics and other cheaper cables are copper but performance is pretty much the same as the Quest chipset can only decode the information at a slower rate. I find that my offical cable setup is more stable though (less dropouts) See this great video for more info including links to cheaper options :) https://youtu.be/CU32-wgGeYw Oh and I just let my cable run on the floor (but I would love a pulley system, I'm lazy) I'm just used to the loose cable, it becomes second nature avoiding it after a while.</TEXT>

I saw we had a tonne of these clips around and one of them was longer. I spray painted the clip and glued the attachments on (it comes with extra so I can reverse this if I want) clips on nicely and easy to pack away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh you mean it takes a 1 tungsten Carbide and 2 iron to make a shredder take the individual components instead to save room? To be honest that seems like a pain for setting up a base quickly. In this way I can land on a planet and get what I need fast E.g. I need scrap I take off the large rover the rtg the scrapper and the seat then can just use a few packagers to clean up and put it all back on the ship. Or If I need a gas pop out the Atmospheric Condenser and done. It would be a pain to have to build everything every time I land and then what do I do once i'm ready to go again, leave it behind?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If all hope is lost just make a quick base. Take your rover to a landmark like a gateway (so you can recover it if you are very far from home.) Make all 3 printers, a furnace and a few generators Dig down grab 3x Laterite turn into Aluminum and go to the edge of a forrest area and get 1 ammonium. Build a shuttle + thruster and get into orbit. From there you will see your base location! And hopefully make your way back to your Rover alternatively you could also make a landing pad at your rover for recovery. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; https://reddit.com/link/eukt0r/video/st9vnyi4y9d41/player Satisfying making 6 Large solar arrays at once So I set myself a challenge to play the game with 100% renewable energy. That means no small or medium generators and no RTGs. Even on vehicles and backpack. It can get a little tricky when using drill mods and my vehicles have run out of power while underground -.-' but its loads of fun! I do use Hydrazine for the shuttle though :P</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After one Tamriel everything got alot easier. It seemed to be the trade off to have lower level players have fun with high levels. The battle leveling for lowbies was pretty funny I made a level 10 DK that was doing 24k whips and was a pvp beast (until he hit level 11 and all his gear stats dropped). I would like to see a general raise in overland difficulty but it would be wise to only make it in certain zones and/or areas not to make the game inaccessible to some inexperienced players or players like my wife that have little combat prowess but love the stories. I do find that if someone researches a build and learns to play just a little bit the overland game gets VERY easy very fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As some have said absolutely join a guild. It might be hard to find the right fit for you but you will have a much better time. I'm always happy to take lower level guildies on VET runs if they really want to go, but I wouldn't necessarily take someone random because it could be a waste of everyones time (I dont care if i have to carry but others might get annoyed). Doing the daily pledges on normal can also be annoying for newer players because experienced players in your group can run through them and instantly kill the enemies, then you learn nothing about mechanics. My advise would be get some friends that are about the same level as you and do normal dungeons or have some higher CP players teach you a few things. Good news is CP45 to 160 is super fast. once you are 160 vet dungeons wont be so hard to get into</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thankyou :) some times I play the game in this way especially when questing. Much like life with MMOs you often forget how much just slowing down and looking around can be as enjoyable as getting that new item or clicking through quest dialog. They have done great things with this game so much so that my wife and I have played through all the zones. It's like having an interactive movie night.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the reason people get upset is for many its fun to know your role, stick to it and play it well. It's less fun to be good at the game and Carry a whole group unless it's friends or drunk guild mates. I actually agree with what you said I frequently solo many Vet dungeons and when I'm in groups that have a weak tank or healer I just quietly fill the weak role while doing mine. For some players (im thinking of my wife and niece/nephews) the game can be difficult. For many long time player who understand the mechanic and have strong builds the game is very easy. ZOS is running the line between easy and hard to not lose the player base.</TEXT>

Some seasonal thing or event. In some ways its nice that it's not cluttered but I feel some dumb things like food stalls or event games could be here and it would look perfect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8203; [Ever since I have been wearing this outfit I've been enjoying questing a lot more strangely XD](https://reddit.com/link/gc21p2/video/81w1o4cqtaw41/player) My wife and I have quested through almost the whole of known Tamriel. As a long time player I have many characters with lots of min/max build but for this guy I like to play more of a Roleplay style, forget about the numbers, minimise the UI and just enjoy the ambience (he is my crafter and quester). It's a really fun and refreshing way to play almost like I am playing a new and totally different game to my trials/vet dungeons/pvp characters. I mainly posted this to encourage players that focus on end game and min/maxing to slow it down every now and then. Enjoy the small touches that make this game great. Has anyone else had this kind of experience I'd love to know so I can spread the love for this side of the game</TEXT>

(Due to the gear cap of cp160, it's worth waiting) Just run the dungeons in normal mode until you understand the mechanics and you will still get good rewards. Once you're higher level and want a challenge do the veteran dungeons for better loot :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An mmo term where you will crunch the numbers to get the most out of your character stats. Like using the best in slot gear for the role you intend to fill. For example you might have a dps player that has all epic gear but some of the traits are say..reinforced. Sure his build might work fine but if he had a divines trait with the right mundus stone he could lose very little but gain some more damage. Min maxing is taking ALL these factors into account and balancing them out to get the best result. Mathematically the best Legendary gear with legendary enchants, the best food buff, mundus stone, CP optimisation and skill rotation. Pushing max stats and spell/weapon damage as high as you can making sure you have the correct amount of penetration without going over. The best part of eso is that BiS (Best in Slot) for you might not necessarily be BiS for someone else because they like to play the game differently. I mean technically yes there is a BiS and a better way to play but at least eso is more flexible than other games Someone with the best gear could easily be out played by someone in less optimized gear.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No im not. You can literally walk into any dungeon as if its a delve and solo it taking your time with the story. I'm not defending bad behavior of group members being impatient (I generally ask if someone is questing and slow things down for them) What point did I miss? There is a solo story mode just walk in solo and you have it. If its too difficult then it will just take longer and more practice or crafting a better build.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, most normals can be done solo. For some it will just take time and an appropriate build. I often help first timers slowly go through a dungeon but solo story mode IS an option already if thats what you want. For those that say its too hard I'm sorry but you are incorrect, with basic knowledge of how the game works and some practice alot of things become possible. I'm no elitist, have some courage put the effort in and feel the rewards of your labor.</TEXT>

I only found out about this set a few weeks ago and its dumb broken in duels but balanced in pve due to the single target of the blind. On a bad player its just annoying on a good player its broken which is why most duelers will avoid it in a serious duel, total carry set.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thankyou for the reply. Hmm but I live alone with friends coming over occasionally... so I need a "fake" account with its own game library for player 2? that's a shame and against TOS right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live alone but will soon be the owner of 2 quests (1 amp;2) I want to have friends over on occasion for some 2 player fun. How will this work? I have been told I'll need 2 accounts one for each device with their own game libraries. Thats fine but I am one man and 2 accounts are against the TOS right? This is super annoying if I can technically be banned and lose 100's of dollars in software in a second device. *sorry if this question has been answered in another post i could not find it*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty sure they said they had to massively reduce the performance of the XR2 chip due to heating trouble. So it would seem they are on to this already and maybe software updates would be more likely than recalls but yeah I feel you man I still have my Quest1 at least.</TEXT>
