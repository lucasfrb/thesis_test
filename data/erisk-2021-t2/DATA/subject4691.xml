    <TEXT>So as we all know Rohan was an islander a lot of us wanted to couple up with but I just realized they literally could have made him one and here's how the could have done it. Also this is on a non Talia route.  #8226;On day 10 miles/Jasper and Lucy enter the villa.  #8226;Instead of mc going last she goes second to last so she can pick Rohan, Mason, or Levi  #8226;You pick Rohan and then the girls help Lucy choose between Mason or Levi the decision comes down to Mc because of she's the main character and whoever Mc says to pick Lucy picks that person and the other is dumped.  #8226;Lucy is also Rohan's ex and she will flirt with him.  #8226;Jake would not confess because him and Rohan are friends and Jake could not do that to a friend  #8226; At the final recoupling Rohan picks Mc again and they end the game as the winners  #8226; Also at the final dumping instead of Lucy and Rohan as options to dump it's Mason/Levi and Lucy So yeah Rohan could have been a love intrest but they did not make him one for some reason.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1- total drama island is probably my fav season gotta disagree there and Heather's plot armor never bothered me though 2- I like Lindsay but there were definitely faults as you mentioned and her most consistent writing was in wt 3- I agree but Gwen got was more flack for it than Duncan but in my opinion Duncan was more in the wrong than Gwen. Also I think his treatment of Harold was a little extreme not in action but in island he was just awful to Harold for no valid reason. 4- I like Heather but I like her most in action since she still felt like this mean girl character so I disagree kinda 5- I like Ella she was just a little too much of a gimmick and definitely Sugar hating on her helped the viewers like he character more</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226; honestly don't know  #8226; she's definitely strong but I'm glad she didn't get that much screentime cause it would've hurt Jo's character  #8226;agree  #128175; Bridgette, Geoff, and Leshawna all were eliminated for being popular but not the big lovable dude that everyone likes.  #8226; It would have been interesting but since him and Gwen our friends it would feel a little bit like a friendship finale.  #8226; I think so too just so Dj gets another good season for his Character.  #8226; as Courtney was the main villian have to disagree but yeah this could've been Leshawna's season  #8226; maybe she surpassed her enemy Heather and actually had a main story line but I think island was good too  #8226;agree also since Beth won Lindsay won too technically so I support Beth's win  #8226; she has her bad moments but we really got to see her character evolve from the dumb blonde follower of mean girl  #8226;disagree with Courtney since she was the Villian  #8226;honestly I guess it makes sense but instead of giving cryptic clues that Alejandro's evil I wish he would have just said it.  #8226;agree  #8226; that would be very hard to do since team Amazon only had one legitimate elimination ceremony, but maybe he could quit the show cause he couldn't stand Sierra anymore  #8226;agree  #8226;good concept but just turned out bad glad they did it better in revenge Dakota should have stayed up until her second elimination as Dakotazoid in my opinion  #8226; they did their job well with Staci in my opinion but I don't think she has much potential  #8226; I like him and would like to see him come back but to each their own I guess  #8226;I like Dawn but I think she should be nothing more than final 5 at best  #8226; I liked them here but not in all stars  #8226;idk what you mean do you think it was executed well or were you happy to see her leave  #8226; I think a second season for the Gen 2 cast should have replaced pahkitew island  #8226;well would you want 2 seasons with new casts after another or want a filler season  #8226;agree  #8226; I prefer island Courtney but this is my second favorite version of Courtney  #8226; yes Sam is not even really an all star but if he was going to come back he should have gotten some kind of redemption or development  #8226;I would say Brick and Leshawna would have been the best pick to replace Sierra and Sam  #8226;depends on how they are written  #8226;disagree  #8226;i don't know Gwen was not great this season  #8226; the ultimate problem with Zoey is that the boy she has dated for a year she can't tell he is evil. And when she finds out instead of OMG yay, it's more like finally now we can move on.  #8226;uh no both would need major development  #8226; true but they all turned out horribly  #8226; idk I have to maybe rewatch and see for myself  #8226;I think him and Jasmine should have gotten together or Amy uses him to get farther in the game just to drop him  #8226; I would have preferred neither I would simply just have Scarlett betray Max in a race or something.  #8226;if you don't find him funny you won't like him Again what I would have preferred is to have her betray Max on Scarlett fever and the get to the final 3 Disagree Agree I wish they stayed longer They are the most undeserved finalists Agree but they gave the ice dancers the satisfaction of even being on the podium That would be interesting Agreed they feel like they were made for the show I am neutral to both but the vegans were a little annoying I just wish Samey could have had her Kelly moment Mixed about</TEXT>

If with AJ/Yasmin either two guys couple up or get dumped.  #8226;You choose the 4th couple in the finale with you So yeah those are just some of my predictions for this season</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The problem with Nicky and Elladine.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-29 14:26:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>So as we know Nicky and Elladine are supposed to be this cute power couple but it just does not feel realistic. Lets compare them to Tim and Jen you could actually tell they liked eachother they had cute and nice interactions but also faced struggles and were not super scott free. Or even Noah and Hope at the beginning we got to see them interact all the time and you could genuinely tell they were into each other at least at the beginning. But Elladine and Nicky fail in all catergories they barely interact with eachother or do coupley things together. But the game tries to convince us that they are so good together and the things they do together like massaging eachothers feet we have to hear from Seb. And their speeches for eachother are literally not heartfelt at all and just feel plain and not like a actual power couple. And theese tewo still have not faced any struggles with each other. All I am saying is that they don't feel real but what do you guys think about Nicky snd Elladine?</TEXT>

Bill: honestly no idea he was just there it was nice seeing the Jake from State farm memes though. Camillo: was expecting him to be more posh and very athletic. Iona: I was so ready to hate her and I really thought she was going to start some drama. Elladine: I felt like she was going to be the female li and super fierce. AJ: very energetic and fun. Genevieve: was expecting her to be very peaceful and be our MC's bff. Seb: was expecting maybe some kind of bad boy trope but didn't really know. Nicky: I had this feeling he was going to be the love interest that got the most fans and would be this seasons jokester. I mostly made this post because I miss the good old days of us saying Lottie's mom, Jake from State farm, and Hailee Steinfeld. But what were your predictions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I personally like Izzy but I could see why someone could dislike her after 3 seasons of her having the exact same character. 2. I agree he lost the cooking challenge for his team but it goes unoticed also I am not huge on fart jokes. 3. I feel like he already got his time in island so I would have preferred if he didn't return. 4. Her plot armor was pretty bad as by episode 4 she was yelling about her alliance and on episode 5 read Gwen's diary so they knew she was trouble early on but voted out people like Cody, Beth, and Geoff instead. 5. I don't really know 6. Well I am more neutral to him because of world tour but in island he was funny to some people and was apart of the guys alliance. I do think he got far because the writers forgot about him so he just kind of floated but at the end of the the day he is a nice funny character. 7. Agree Duncan was just bullying Harold over a girl so I really just did not think he should get a win but Beth was not great either but I prefer her ending. 8. Agree 9. She was great and spiced up the aftermath I would have preferred her to not be a competitor but I agree for the most part. 10. Don't know I am more or less mixed about Cody and would need an explanation about why you hate him. 11. Honestly that would have been an interesting villian concept. 12. well comedy is subjective but I would have loved if they saved all stars Scott for Rodney character. 13. Well I would have preferred a kiss from Zoey so Mike wakes up and defeats Mal but I don't know there is really nothing else they could do besides take Mike to the doctor lol. 14. I don't know 15. Agree 100%</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just came up with this idea so I give a catergory and you pick 2 islanders from any season that you think fits that catergory best. You also can repeat islanders. 1. Favorite li's 2. The most funny 3. Cutest couples 4. Best dressed 5. Mc's Best friends 6. Most annoying 7. Drama king/queen 8. Best dream couples(islanders that didnt get together but should have) 9. Most attractive(don't have to answer if not comfortable) 10. Worst couples 11. Best all around So yeah just pick 2 islanders from any season that fits that catergory best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I agree with Eva never thought about Justin but yeah he would be cool to see to balance out the gender order. 2. Maybe not sure what they would do exactly. 3. Yes if dodgeball does not change anything. Even though I think Sadie is better because she was entertaining during episode 7. 4. Yeah I still don't even know why they broke up 5. I like all all the oft og couples so I prefer Gwen with Trent but action kind of ruined both relationships. In Trent becoming a clingy boyfriend and Courtney becoming controlling and toxic. 6. Ok this is an opinion I am mixed about I like Geoff personally but you are right he is kind of bland. 7. Yeah everyone hates Amy because she is mean but without her being mean Sammy wouldn't even have a plot. The only time I had a problem with this was with Sugar because it felt so weird and random but I agree for the most part. 8. Yes. Amy has potential to be a great antagonist and build of of her her mean personality. Sammy could return but they would need to build her up big time. 9. I actually think Scott is the best villian we have had along with the ice dancers since Alejandro had zero struggle and all his plans worked all the time 10. Yeah it would make more sense Alejandro hates Owen so get rid of him especially after 2 seasons of merging. 11. Agree it was nice to have an episode where both teams interact and our not seperated. 12. Yeah again I liked the ice dancers and Scott the most since they were entertaining, funny and did not always succeed. 13. I think you could have worded that better as 4 teams with actual storylines but I don't really care for most rr team's Wow we have some similar opinions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A pattern with female li's</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 04:26:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So In the past 2 seasons there has been a pattern that I have noticed with the female Li's. 1. First off the main female li is always in friendship couples if not with mc as both Talia and Marisol were in friendship couples and AJ and Yasmin are following suit as if you are not with them they are both in friendship couples. 2. The female li disappears if not with them as both Talia and Marisol just kind of disappears if not with them by the end and I hope AJ and Yasmin don't follow the same route but I can already see signs of that for Yasmin as she has been progressivelly less featured. 3. Both find love in the end as both Marisol and Talia if not on their route find love by the very end of the game with Graham and Miles/Jasper now we don't really know if Yasmin and AJ will find love by the end but maybe they will end up together idk. Just noticed these patterns and wanted to share it do you think AJ and Yasmin will get their happy ending if not with them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just some random opinions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 05:06:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. The ice dancers and Scott were the best villians as I felt like they were the most well rounded with not always succeeding and being funny. Heather and Alejandro are fine but Heather's plot armor and Alejandro barley facing any struggles turns me off of them. 2. World tour is a little overated (prepares for hate) I just think it was not as good as everyone says it is as I found myself losing interest int the later episodes. I don't hate it I just don't see the hype. 3. The Pahkitew cast should have been saved for some fan vs favorites season with half of the Pahkitew cast I would pick Topher, Ella, Shawn, Jasmine, Dave, Scarlett, and Max as I feel as those characters would add the most to a season. 4. All stars was Courtney's best season after island mostly due to Scott but he helped round her out I know Sundae muddy Sundae was bad but besides that Courtney was decent. 5. I think in ridonculous race the the haters should have went sixth and then just get back together in the end of the episode, the best friends have the same elimination at 5th, and the ice dancers go 4th, and the sisters, cadets, and surfer dudes all have alternate endings where they win. It would have been different and I really just want the sisters to get a win. 6. This is not really an opinion but why do people dislike Carrie I mean yeah she is bland but I never minded her. 7. Amy's mole fits her skin complexion better which makes her look better then Sammy or maybe it is just all of Amy's face expressions. 8. I think all 24 Gen 1 campers should have been in dramarama they don't all need voice actors but the main characters can have them. So characters like Justin, Eva, Katie, Sadie, Katie, Tyler, and Ezekiel don't need voice actors but can just follow the group and stay in the background. Ok that's all I have</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I don't really think you need development to be a good winner but I agree that Gwen is a more deserved winner. I also would have replaced Owen with Geoff as a winner since Geoff has more friendships and a girlfriend. 2. Yeah if they gave them different personalities and develop Sadie when she is not with Katie like have Sadie interact with Courtney, Bridgette, and Harold Sadie could have been good. 3. I mean yeah Katie showed more skill in dodgeball but idek 4. Agree it was very unnecessary since he got his time in island already. 5. Agree, I would have preferred Lindsay but Beth was fine and actually showed as a pretty valuable team mate in some episodes and had a good social game. 6. I would have had Bridgette make merge and swap to team Chris and really bring back island Bridgette and also a friendship with Heather would be nice to see also 7. Mixed, I don't have a problem with Blainley I honestly enjoy her but she did not deserve it. But would you want them to get the same placement as Blainley or have them go farther. 8. Agree, my favorite first boot actually. besides Lindsay, Geoff and Bridgette. 9. Agree, you said all of it 10. I think the season is near perfect so I would not add any episodes maybe a second season though for extra fleshing out. 11. Disagree, Anne Maria needed to be on the maggots for the love triangle and Dawn had some good interactions with Scott and B while she really only interacted with Zoey from the maggots. 12. I mean everyone is untitled to their own opinion and people might like Dawn less because of all the love she hats because when they watch the season they don't see the hype. But Dawn's cool to me. 13. Maybe the teams were honestly fine in my opinion though besides Courtney being a hero and Gwen a villian. I think the clash of personality helped make both teams better and feel different. 14. Yeah the first episodes were suprisingly entertaining. 15. Well I think Sky and Dave should have ended up as friends in the end but in my fans vs favorites season where Sky is not included I think Ella and Dave could have been interesting together if Dave looked past her weirdness 16. I think she should have just stuck with comedic relief and either not hate Ella or have Ella snap back. And Amy take main antagonist role. 17. Yeah some changes I would make to their arc is have Amy be rude to everyone and and have a rivalry with Jasmine for team captain. And have Sammy just rig the votes to send Amy home so Sammy can be Sammy and build on her character. 18. Yeah she was honestly pretty normal and we had never seen anyone like her before as she seemed like a genius more than a geek like Harold and Cameron . 19. Agree he should have gone in the monkey episode. 20. No opinion 21. Well for one of 2 reasons looks or because Ellody actually talked more than Mary. 22. I would have made it Dj as I feel like Ryan and Stephanie might be a little to similar to Bridgette and Geoff. And Dj needs some much needed redemption after world tour. 23. Yeah I agree also Noah would have gotten his share at the money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mixed I think this drama is great but this late in the season. How are we supposed to know if we can trust them I think they should have done it so that your li does not know if they can trust you because in the secret challenge you get exposed for cheating. This is good but the our li should have remembered our name and reassured us because tommorow might be the final recoupling. Also it really sucks for people who switched partners in day 8 since you already can't trust them.</TEXT>

It does make sense in some scenarios though. I think a another theory that fits everyone's playthrough is Lily is the Li's ex and wants them back and told Rafi to flirt with mc so MC's head gets turned and Lily can be with your li and vice versa for Rafi</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-13 22:30:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>If with a female li just swap Lily and rafi's name's Day 10 1. Lily will continue to flirt with your li. 2. We play spin the bottle where your li is forced to kiss Lily. Where Mc will have the option to freak out about it. 3. Your li will say they want you to pick them on the final recoupling and so does Rafi. 4. Mc picks first like always and has to choose who she wants to end love island with if you pick your li Lily and Rafi couple up. If you pick Rafi your original love interest ends up with Lily. If you pick a new one entirely then still your of li and Lily couple up Day 11 1. We either are going on final dates or building sand castles which would not be suprising. 2. The public votes for best couple and the couple with the least votes are Lily and Rafi or your og li and Lily depending on who you picked to couple up with. Day 12 1. Yeah it's just the prom from season 2 but more highschool all over again. 2. 2 couples get dumped depending on MC's choice and Seb and Gen, Elladine and Nicky, mc and her li, and whichever couple you chose to save. Day 13. 1. Couple you chose to save gets 4th, Gen and Seb 3rd, Nicky and Elladine 2nd, and mc and her li win. 2nd. Li gets the money and shares it cause sharing is caring. Harry probably has some bs speech like "aT fIrSt I Was goiNg to StEAl the moneY but ThEn I MeT you" 3rd. And you can break up with your li at the end and they will be super supportive and be like friendship is magic after all. 4th. Oh and Lily is going to be all salty like Blake that you win Anyways those our my predictions what are your guys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have started to dislike Bobby and Chelsea more. They have become more annoying. And I dislike when the islanders baby Bobby and when Chelsea wants your li then drops them and gossips. I don't hate them but I don't like them as much. -Elijah is so underrated he is not pushy and cares for mc. And villa Elijah is really good and like Arjun does not have a lot of character change unlike Carl and Kassam. -I can count on one hand all of the season 3 islanders I like AJ, Seb, Genevive, Cieran, and maybe Tai. They all are really good and deserve a better season for their characters. And I feel like they all have somewhat of a personality and Genevive and Seb have already interacted more than Elladine and Nicky. The rest of the islanders are unlikable or just plain boring and are not getting enough development to build of them being boring. And if your a Harry, Camillo, or Bill stan be one that is fine but in my opinion theese are the only decent characters. Hope did nothing wrong like we all attack Lily/Lucy/Rafi when they try to flirt but when Hope attacks mc for flirting with Noah she gets attacked. And honestly I feel bad for her she had to deal with Noah's indecisiveness, gets cheated on before the final, and gets broken up with after already losing. And she also apologised already for her actions. I do think she had her bad moments but if you are nice to her she is fine. Lottie and Kassam and Priya and Felix should have ended up together now hear me out. Lottie and Kassam could have been such a great pairing Kassam would be fiercely loyal and Lottie would like that. And now with Priya and Felix, I know Felix is not the most popular but Priya gains more confidence with him and Felix was the first guy that showed intrest in Priya besides Ibrahim who gets his head turned everytime some new girl comes in. Okay those are my unpopular opinions or popular opinions what do you think about them and feel free to say some of yours</TEXT>

Lindsay - would be a little weird to see a dumb 4 year old but I think they could make it work. 6Teen - they are fine but I felt like Jude was only included so they could have Chris potenza on the show. Katie and Sadie - I think they are just to reliant on each other. Geoff - I like him but he is too much like Jude with his Chill attitude So I think Lindsay, 6Teen member, and Geoff if he was written properly would be the best options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>17/16. Bridgette and Geoff for the same reason Bottom 2: Justin v Lindsay v Izzy: Izzy: for same reason. Bottom 2: Trent v Owen: 14th Owen: Trent is able to convince his team to not vote him out and he will stop throwing challenges so they vote Owen who has been pretty useless. And now there is tension between Trent and Gwen. Bottom 2: Gwen v Heather: 13th. Heather: well everyone hates Heather so they get rid of her. Izzy returns DJ quits Bottom 2 Izzy v Justin: 11th. Justin: so now we lost our main villian but I guess thats where Courtney comes in. Courtney debuts Bottom 2: Courtney v Trent: 10th. Courtney: well now she's gone for obvious reasons. Bottom 2: Gwen v Leshawna: 9th. Leshawna: she is out for lying to the ream and because they like Gwen Leshawna is out. Bottom 2: Gwen v Duncan: 8th: Duncan: since Courtney is no longer there Duncan has no one to protect him so Leshawna, Beth, Harold, and Lindsay vote him out. the Princess chosen is Beth since Lindsays foot can't fit. Bottom 2: Gwen v Izzy: 7th: Gwen: well since she got far last season rhe campers vote her out. Courtney returns by her lawyers Bottom 2: Lindsay v Izzy : 6th. Izzy since she is crazy also maybe Courtney convinces the other competitors. Bottom 2: Harold v Trent: 5th: Trent Bottom 2: Harold v Courtney: 4th. Courtney: after she is exposed to be a traitor. Now here is where it gets confusing since chris can not just get rid of these campers unlike he did for Owen so we are going to have to come up with someone to be eliminated so Beth i guess. 1/2.

    <TEXT>Hope: I think she could find some of herself in Allegra so she would like her. She would also like Jake since he is kind of her type. Lottie: Mc, she would like how she would not take anything from anyone and her snarky comments. Hannah: Sammi, I think Hannah would love Sammi's Fashion and creativity Marisol: Talia, Marisol would like Talia because of her confidence and chill attitude. And how open Talia is to mention her sexuality. Priya: When she first watched it she loved Rohan with his outgoing personality but when she watched it a second time after season 2 happened she would relate to Erikah and Cherry a lot especially Cherry with coming in late and being in some of the biggest drama in the villa. Gary: I would say he likes the rap crew the most since he could find some of himself in all of them. Noah: he would relate to Jake and Levi as he could find himself in both. Rocco: Would like all the girls on the show but Mc because she would put him in his place. Ibrahim: Levi, because they both are a little quiet and sometimes screw up big time Bobby: Tim and Jake, he would love how hilarious he was and would also love how Jake could cook. Henrik: Rohan, would like his unique skills and fun personality Lucas: Jen, Erikah and Mc, he would be most atreacted to them. Jakub: all the girls, Mason, and Reese Chelsea: I think she would love all of them she would only not like Lucy for obvious reasons. Elisa: Jen and Talia, she would admire thier fashion and confidence. Jo and Blake: Lucy because trash people love other trash people. Ok those are mine would you change anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. Yeah I agree someone needed to go first I do think he maybe had potential but I don't see anyone else going first. 2. Well I think they have potential for RR to grow as characters but from what we have right now yeah they are not that good. 3. I don't really know who I would replace him with so yeah he is fine I guess. 4. Ok disagree Gwen was the main protagonist of the season so I feel like she deserved it Heather would be weird and I am not a fan of villians winning. Leshawna maybe. 5. It has flaws definitely but I don't hate the episode nor dislike it. 6. Disagree, she could have been great in world tour had a rivalry with Tyler and friendships with Izzy and Noah not winning or anything but like final 6. 7. Agree, Justin is not the best villian but he was dang sure entertaining. 8. Izzy was not unfunny but I don't think she should have merged. 9. I never minded the idea of Beth winning but I would take Lindsay, Harold, or Duncan over her any day. 10. No opinion 11. From what I remember of it I think it was a fine episode. 12. Beginning Courtney was fine but love triangle Courtney I have to disagree with. 13. The deal with Izzy is she is supposed to be a funny character that is filler so I disagree her placement was fine. 14. Agreed I loved her this season. 15. I think world tour actually could have been his redemption season where he dominates but you know I respect your opinion. 16. I disliked it a lot I would rather DJ just get voted off earlier rather than characters like Lindsay or Harold. 17. I can see it if he starts to open up to people or just has multiple comedic, smart, and fun moments he could make it to the final 4. 18. Agree 19. Yes this season was great for Zoey I would have loved to see Zoey make it to the final against Lightning. 20. Agree 21. Ok look I love Jo but she was not really winner material this season yes she fought hard but she was a side antagonist. Now do I think Jo should get far again yes heck out of all the roti mergers she is the only one I would choose to merge again but I don't see her as a winner. 22. This season yes they were honestly fine as was where it got bad. 23. Yeah I agree 24. Yep she is not a good villian but I don't really like her either so. 25. Yeah he is very zany maybe too zany to be in total drama but I think he could be great in Rama. 26. No opinion 27. Yeah he was great I saw this idea someone on the sub had to make him an intern so there's even more of reason for him not to interact with the campers. 28. If they didn't return then yeah sure. 29. Yep 30. No opinion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I only like DJ, Bridgette, Gwen, Duncan, Courtney, Heather, and Owen in like 1 or 2 seasons. Being bland does not equal bad. You need those normal characters to balance out all the other huge stereotypes. Mike and Zoey are a little overhated now they do have fans yes but also a lot of haters but I rewatched revenge of the island and they are both pretty fine there I know all stars was bad but I don't hate them at all. DramaRama is decent for what it's aimed for. I think Courtney and Brick would have been a great all stars finale. I don't see Dawn or Jo as winners. I just can't imagine it the farthest I see them going is Dawn to the final 5 and Jo to the final 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well let me tell you how they all are before you go in. Mason - he is pretty egotistical but he just takes pride in himself and is a little underrated in the fandom. He is loud and hates taking sides but at the end he is not the most popular but a pretty good one if you can look past his faults. Levi- he is a lot more quieter but still comes off as a leader and is thoughtful and will defend what he believes is right. He makes mistakes but at the end of the day will still love mc. Talia - if you are looking for someone chill and confident here she is she always has Mc's back and is a little mysterious just make sure you flirt and say you are into girls. Jake - I don't want to spoil to much but he is great and is a great friends to lovers route it will feel painful but once you get to that moment he is great. He is basically Noah and Bobby mixed into one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rating season 3 islanders</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 03:14:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bill: he is ok I don't really care for him though 5/10 Camillo: I also have not done his route and he seems to not have much to him really so 6/10 bonus points for knowing how to cook but loses points for wearing basketball shorts to love island. Iona: she is ok I wish she was a best friend option but who knows maybe she will confess her feelings for mc at the end of the game so 6/10 Elladine: I was really expecting her to be super fierce and confident but she is so bland and barely has personality besides being posh. She also seems a little uptight like when the new islanders came she got mad about it, like you have been in a couple since day 1 sit down and be humble 4/10. AJ: i like her she is a cool li and a good friend but she seems a little to much like Bobby with her boops and magic hands. But i don't hate her and the islanders were wrong for not giving her a birthday party 8/10 Genevieve: i like her she seems nice and friendly. Also bonus points for being Nigerian but loses points for scoffing so much 7/10. Seb: yeah he is the best he has got personality and back story he only loses pounts for not being with mc 9/10 Nicky: maybe him and Elladine are made for eachother since they both are so bland like apparently he is a jokester and always stopping issues in the villa and im like where is that 4/10. Miki: Who 3/10 Harry: I liked him at first but he is just gotten worse from maybe just being here for the money to becoming kind of rude so 5/10 sorry Harry stans. Cieran: as Lottie once said "who I don't know anyone by that name probably shedding his skin" since he forgot mc's name I hope we can do the next Roccogate. Jk just being petty he is actually a sweetheart and him being a prick is so not in character. 7/10. Tai: Never saw the hype especially since the waterfall bits did nada but I mean I guess he is cool 6.5/10 Yasmin: she legit disappeared I'm honesty worried for her 6/10 Rafi: well he stood up for mc's mistratmeant in mine. but for the Aj and Yasmin stans 4/10 extra points for actualy wearing swimming trunks. Lily: oh do not get me staeted on Jo 3.0 stop being so flirty towards mc's love intrest like keep your hands to yourself justin beiber wannabe. I am so sorry scarjo because Lily is getting a 2/10 like she is not even original she is litterally just Lucy from s1</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to make Graham a li</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-31 17:57:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i did this with Rohan and even though Graham is not as popular he is getting one too. 1.In casa you can flirt but he still only had eyes for Marisol. 2.At the stick or switch recoupling mc goes first and picks Graham this makes Marisol furious and She gives you a cloud of frowny faces. 3.Marisol goes second and she picks who mc was with at casa and Chelsea does not pick Elijah. 4.He will still have his rivalry with Gary and things like that but have generic dialogue because he is a casa boy. 5.Because Marisol is mad at you for stealing the first person she had a connection with she really pushes it in your face about your casa li and her flirting so like bragging about bits and how into her he is. 6.Marisol and your casa li get dumped the day Marisol and Graham got dumped. 7.Graham is non jealous and wants kids. 8.Also if you pick Graham it turns off Marisol's route. So does are Graham it's weird to think that with some extra coding he could have been a li but anyway would you couple up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well let me go into more detail about the theories. 1. Genevieve insisted she thinks Harry might be too immature and shows interest in Seb but scoffs if you flirt with him. 2. For this one if AJ was your li when she is arguing with the new islander about you when they ask I thought you like Seb AJ kind of fumbles and gets nervous unlike the other Li's who just say their not Mc. 3. This one is smaller but still stands, Seb keeps making jokes that the new boys aren't his types. And Nicky said he got the vibe that AJ was bi. This one is not as big with evidence but I still asked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With Gwen and Trent It made sense but had to ruin Trent's character in the process. I would say the best idea to break them up would be from Tomas t said have Gwen feel like Trent cares about the band and Trent think that Gwen likes Duncan so they break up off screen. It was weird but it was not really confirmed they broke up so I am just going to headcannons they got back together. Yes this one was weird Gwen was jealous Duncan still likes Courtney but I mean of course he still likes her he wouldn't have dated her if he didn't. And Gwen treated him like dirt for no reason. How I would have done it is Courtney say's she won't be Gwen's friend unless she breaks up with Duncan. And Gwen doesn't want to do it but knows she has to. They seemed pretty fine in the finale so maybe open relationship. Yes this one was just stupid and childish.

Girl who gets blindsided by their friend: S1 Mc - Hope Guy who girl is going after: MC's li - Noah The Mastermind: Erikah - Priya The pawn: Cherry - S2 mc If you see it in this way it makes Priya seem way worse and Cherry seem way better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Samey, I know she had Jasmine but Jasmine didn't even care when she was eliminated and just moved on and didn't even say goodbye. Her team treated her like garbage for no reason like it's fine if you like her sister more but the most she did to effect them was tell Amy off. I also think Dave is a canadate he only really had one friend in Shawn but they ended up fighting in the finale and him being left on the island was just the cherry on top.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-06 13:52:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Now this might be an unpopular opinion but I wish there was less li's especially for this seaaon and season 2. I would pick like 5/6 this way you really can have li's with different personality and fusebox could really focus on each li which means.  #8226; No shared dialouge  #8226; Mostly different lines and personalities  #8226; Still a good amount of replay  #8226; having guys who are friends and not having every guy like Mc There are downsides like replay value but tons of people just replay Bobby's route. For season 3 I would pick Seb, Nicky , AJ, Tai, Ciaran, Rafi/Lily.( I only included Nicky because he has a lot of fans) So what do you guys think how many li's would you like? And who would you pick from season 3 to be one of the 6?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>13 days is not bad it just was not executed properly. Season 1 had good storyline, islanders, and still had room for just having fun filler. Also I am still salty that none of the girls and some guys got extra final outfits from season 1 except Talia and Mc for the girls and Tim, Reece, Mason, Jake, and Levi for the guys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue with Season 3 is it is a base template for a good season I mean think about it this could have been perfect drama wise with the drama starting on day 6 with the love triangle and then having Lily and Rafi added into the mix. It has potential to be the best season ever but it became a blank slate. I am hoping I can post a post about how to fix this season though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest whenever I see someone say Bobby is the best I am kind of just like ok sure. Now I feel like with Bobby they were trying to go into a way where Mc would not see him as a li because if he's not a li sure he still has those one liners that are mediocre jokes at best but he is less annoying and shows less flaws. With Bobby he is also the rebound guy of the the season so if you are with him everybody is happy because no one wants him so he always tries to get with Mc because well he is kind of made for her. Season 3 suprisingly did this better with having Harry be the rebound guy but he does not constantly flirt and graft on Mc even though Harry is the rebound guy of the season. With operation nope totally agree sure maybe telling everyone was not the best but then having literally no one being upset with Bobby is infuriating. They are all just like oh that's Bobby for you. The only reason I see him picking Hope is because he wanted to show Hope he is still her friend after the operation. Because Bobby is kind of a people pleaser. Again every season there roles the Islanders have so it felt like they were trying to do Tim as a li but just made him feel weird. In my opinion he should have brought back the Emily girl and she replaces Blake on his route. This causes drama and we don't get some rude Armadillo taking form as Blake. I liked him but I just don't anymore ever since all of the love he gets I have just liked him less and less and feel that everyone only really likes Bobby because he was the only li who if with everyone is happy and still find love no friendship couples. Obviously he would still have fans no doubt but definitely not as much and the only reason I actually did his route first Anyways I'm going to give my fingers a break.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok but still it makes no sense if Mc has only shown intrest in Gary, Rahim, or Lurik. If anything this makes Bobby and Noah look like people who can't take a hint because he still saves Hope if Mc is cruel to him. I do get where you are coming from but if the mc is rejecting you everytime and is clearly into someone else there is no reason to try and take Noah away from her if she doesn't like you or Noah.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep but what threw all of the liking towards Bobby away was when Fusebox started milking him like why in the world is Bobby on the cover photo you could say there just trying to show off all the seasons but wouldn't the put a season 1 islander on there too like Talia or Jake. I can tell they were trying their best to make him not look like a Tim wannabe by having Bobby not be able to cook and stuff but you could obviously tell. But Tim will always superior. And even though Tim was not with Mc he still defended her. And did not pull a whole unfunny judge bit to make the villa calm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do think it could have been improved in many ways by more distinct personalities, more focus on drama they passed over, and making the villa feel like an actual family by the end and not just some adults on an island just sitting there. But I do appreciate it for what it is and even though I am dissatisfied with what we got I'm happy we even got a new season in this hard time and that just means more content for the fandom. So even though season 3 might have been friendship and toes let's accept that and build of it. So thank you season 3 for being so garbage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. No comment honestly 2. I just find Leonard so annoying and he is not funny to me at all but everyone has a different sense of humor. 3. I like Justin but a final 2 spot is a no for me I do think he would have been a good option for 3rd place through. 4. He is not bad and I actually like him but I do feel like there are other all star material contestants that could have easily taken his place. 5. Yeah I actually enjoy her and kind of feel bad for her she was very entertaining to me. 6. I like them both and I would want every character in dramarama from gen 1 but I do think that there roles are kind of filled but I don't agree with Sugar I dont see her doing anything more interesting than Lindsay or Heather. 7. Yees, I dont hate it but when I saw everyone loved it I was very confused sure the songs were bops and had good development but also the love triangle which hurt the three character's involved, team victory had so many good characters that had potential to do stuff, and some other issues I have with it. I don't hate the season but I would put it 4th on my list on best seasons. 8. It did have its moments but I do not hate it I would change somethings but for the most part the the first half of the season was solid. 9. Well I am mixed about this issue if we are getting just a new season with others coming out after then yeah totally sure gen 2 and gen 3 development all the way but if we are talking a final last season then gen 1 and maybe some gen 2 need to come back and finish their plots. 10. Same but who knows they can do a complete 180 with his character in a new season to make him a winner. 11. Mostly agree I think every character can have fans and I can see why everyone likes certain characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Marisol is such a character at the end of the day it's like she can't decide what her personality is sometimes she's rude and uptight sometimes kind and supportive. Marisol is definitely the worst if you are on a Gary to Rocco to Lurik route as she always wants who you are with. But I didn't really like any of the season 2 girls besides maybe Sahnnon so maybe I am not the best judge for Marisol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok. I get what you are saying and he does have an f boy attitude to him but honestly does flaws are what makes Levi Levi. Yes he did screw up but he owned up to it and his brainn was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also I do think you need to look at the positives as if you only look on the negatives then yes he is a bad character but so are all the characters if you use that logic. First off I think it was mature to admit he cheated and not hide it and he does have a sweet,caring, and compassionate side to him which you will see if instead of focusing on Cherrygate actually take the time to see him as a person. He makes mistakes and sure his route is messy bur also that is what makes the ending so feel good after all of that you 2 still stuck together and win love island. Btw I also think he was heavily inspired by actual love island males as some of them do have that f boy attitude to them at least from the seasons I have watched.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So let me defend Jen real quick. Yes she was embarrassed but not because she thought Tim was a disgrace or anything no she just was worried her friends would not like him because he is so different and she has to grow from that. Also I do not really think she treated him like crap she just wanted to take care of him and was worried when he got mad and listened to where he was coming from. Also they were dating for a year I doubt that if she was treating Tim like Crap he would still stick with her. Though I do see where you are coming from they have tons of nice moments and are definitely one of my favorite couples.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems fun Tdi 9th: Owen: this one is pretty hard to do but lets say instead of Lindsay going home Owen is out for being wipwd out. 8th: Dj: for the same reason as canon he gets scared by Heather so he is out. 7th: Izzy: Izzy for shooting Heather 6th: Geoff: it would go about the same with Heather getting annoyed by Lindsay so Lindsay then curses out Heather and now they are no longer friends. 5th: Lesahwna: same as canon 4th: the teams would have to be different I would say Lindsay and Heather v Gwen and Duncan. Gwen and Duncan win and they obviously pick Lindsay over Heather. 3rd: Gwen: I could see Gwen and Duncan teaming up in the challenge but Lindsay fights hard and Gwen does not do her dare. 1rst/2nd: Lindsay and Duncan win with Tyler and Courtney being the helpers. Tda 9th: Leshawna: the gaffers don't forgive what Leshawna did with lying and Hqrold instantly regrets it Leshawna is fine though. 8th: Lindsay: this one is hard but Lindsay would probably be out because Courtney, Heather, Duncan, and Justin would probably would not mind doing it. 7th: Justin: same as canon Owen returns 6th: Beth: because at this point she didn't have much allies besides Harold so they would vore her off. 5th: Harold: for the same reason 4th/3rd: everyone votes Owen out for being a traitor. And Duncan quits so he doesn't have to be around Courtney anymore. 1rst/2nd: Heather and Courtney. Tdwt 9th: Courtney: Cody does not vote Sierra and Courtney is voted out. 8th: Owen: Same reason with Duncan and Gwen teaming up this time 7th/6th: Blainley and Duncan: no one likes Blainley and everyone is still salty with Gwen so they tie but Duncan quits for Gwen. 5th: Alejandro: no one likes him really so he is out. 4th: Heather: Sierra never explodes the plane and Cody convinces Sierra to not vote Gwen so Heather is out. 3rd: Cody: Sierra wins immunity and it is Gwen vs Cody and Cody loses for Gwen. 1rst/2nd: Gwen and Sierra Tdroti 9th:Jo: Brick and Lighting agree to vote out Jo so Jo is out. 8th: Anne Maria still quits. 7th: Dakota for the same reason as canon. 6th: Mike same as canon 5th: Lightning: Scott wins immunity and and Lightning is out because no one really likes him 4th: Zoey: Scott wins immunity and convinces Beick to vote with him and Brick wins the tiebreaker aginst Zoey 3rd: Scott wins and chooses Brick for finale. 1rst/2nd: Brick and Scott. Ok I am done for now I have a life to live.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Duncan vs Harold this is too perfect two rival likable in island. Courtney vs Gwen: it does kind of make sense when you think about it not a huge fan though. Sierra vs Izzy: two crazy girls but not a fan neither of them give me winner fuel. Dakota vs Scott: not bad maybe for another season but not revenge. Lightning vs Gwen: no theese two are just on two different levels that it would feel odd. Jasmine vs Leonard: I like Jasmine and maybe with righ development I could like Leonard but no for pahkitew.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Love this idea. Honestly I would end it at the all stars season with the best characters who have competed in a 26 episode season with about 20 canpers. But if I could not do that I would do something like reunion but bring in characters like Anne Maria,Brick,Dawn,B, and Dakota for second chances I would maybe add Dave,Jasmine, and Sky in there for their storylines. And extra gen 1 contestants would be Dj,Harold and Beth. The location would just be an island it's the final season and we need to wrap up storylines there is not enough room for a huge island that is different but maybe boney island. Finale would be Revived Trent vs Jasmine or Leshawna</TEXT>

Or because they are focusing on dramarama it is either going to get replaced with dramarama or they only want dramarama to get attention on cartoon Network. Edit: or they are doing total drama re runs on cartoon Network or adult swim and they want people to watch for more money and stuff and if on Netflix no one will watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Her and Dave would be a slow burn relationship not happening until the end of the game. I think Emily would get eliminated like 7th in merge and would make good frriends with Samey,Ella,Beardo and others. Emily would not get along Amy in td universe and same with Sky even though Sky doesn't really mind. She would do decent in challenges and would always have Jasmine and Shawn for moral support on getting Dave to love her one day. I say she gets eliminated by a heroric saving of Dave by voting for herself or quitting to keep Dave in the game and this is when Dave realizes he loves her. Dave and Emily reunite at the finale and are pretty happy and thats the story of Emily x Dave</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She is great at makeup and it is one of her biggest passions. She is cool with half the cast mostly close to Leshawna and they talk every week. Also really good friends with Zoey,Mike,and Cameron. She has a weird relationship with her brother one day they hate eachother the next they love eachother. Her mom and Dad divorced when she was little one of the reasons she turned goth. She has a YouTube channel where she says being on the show was horrifying but also gave her many opportunities. But she mostly just does random stuff on there. She regrets the love triangle and says she would never do something like that ever again. Gwen is more focused on her career as an artist and is single. She says she is not into Trent but blushes a little when she thinks about him. She throws the best Halloween parties it's what she looks forward to every year.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Headcanons about Td characters part 3: Heather</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-10 13:13:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Heather is not that close to most to the cast she only really talks to Sierra and Cody She now owns a talkshow in la where she interviews famous people and has gotten old td contestants like Izzy,Owen and Noah to share gossip. Heather is the youngest in her family and has always been spoiled by her mom who is a pushover and her dad just does not care for her behavior. She was the popular girl of her school obviously and didnt think she was doing anything wrong with being rude but when she came back home for action she realised the world hated her which led to major cyber bullying she had to go through. After the show Heather only had one boyfriend who was using her so she is off boys now. She despises both Chris and Ezekiel for taking her money and putting her through torture. Even though she did not show it she liked being friends with Beth and Lindsay because they were just nice people not like the mean girls she hung out with all the time. She is very competitive and it started with Ballet one of her biggest passions in life. She is not as rude anymore but still has moments where she can be self centered. Her and Alejandro sometimes talk but not much after they both lived too far from one another. Had temper tantrums when she was little which led to shock therapy. She finally says that she hated the show but without she would not be where she is today even though she still hates Chris.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. True he would have been eliminated but I don't hate the idea of finalist Owen 2. Probably it got a lot of development and I loved it to bad cartoon network had to ruin it all by breaking them up. 3. Agree she is a good mean girl but not a great villian with her plot armor. 3. Izzy is usually filler as wherever you place her its hard to ruin her as a character. I like her as a character though 4. I mean i guess Courtney is usually only rude when she wants to win. 5. Yes it was really stupid they were even good in action so why when Heather does the challenge you feel the need to beat her up. 6. Agree I never was on the Beth hate train and I would say Beth deserved it. 7. True but she did get friends in Sierra and Cody so that's something. 8. I ship it but I don't want it in revenge maybe in like a second gen 2 season 9. Sammy is a better character as a whole but Amy has more potential and is more entertaining 10. If your talking about the ship no, if talking about hem as a pair eh, and if talking about them as individuals then maybe Max but not really. 11. Agree 12. I like both Scotts but I will say as Scott could have been replaced with any other pain magnet. 13.search and do not destroy does make me angry with the whole Trent thing I only kind of like the ending. 14. I like rr I just think it is sometimes is forgettable. 15. I love the ice dancers so much so hard disagree. 16. I mean it was realistic but when youre going to derail characters i would pass on the love triangle. 17. I think Mal is a fine villian idea concept but was not done properly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically a fact Bridgette should have stayed longer in action imo. I am fine with team victory going home early but the way they eliminated them and kept animal curse DJ really iritated me. Never thought about it but her voice does fit. Same #justicefordramaramabeth Scarlett was a bad villian very popular Dave and Sky are not my favorite but they are cool. It was a year after action for Gwen if she could not get over Trent she seems clingy. And if Duncan did not want to be with Courtney he shouldn't have kissed her on the bus and then hug her when he came back and pretend he was saying all those nice things to her. Cody is ok but needs more to him Yeah Izzy is great Both Noahs are fine RR Noah was just different from what Noahs orginal character. Yes Courtney had every right to be mad she loved Duncan and liked Gwen she was backstabbed. Agree Amy is more interesting but Sammy can be too if the writers write her right Yeah Harold is pretty Rad I mean sure other characters have messed up but cheating is another level Duncan also bullies people and has went far every season so there are reasons he gets hate. Agree honestly Leshawna was bad all of world tour Never paid attention to Gwens confessionals but if we are talking about her complaining about being noce than no. Agree the friendship trio derserved better</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get what you are saying almost everyone says this too but let me defend season 1 real quick. By that time no choices game has ever been made like love island and in most of those choose your story/choices games you really only get like 2 to 3 options for lis from what I have played so they probably thought this would work since almost all the other games at the time did not have 13 li's like season 2 had. Now I might be wrong as I am not a huge love story type gamer besides the popular ones and love island but this is going by what I have played. Also at least try to be into Mason and Levi I know it might seem hard when you have Jake sitting right there but if you never try to get into their characters youre never going to get positives.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Headcanons about Td characters 4: Duncan</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-11 16:05:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Duncans parents never approved of his deliquent ways and were super strict which id why he became a delinquent. He got arrested for shoplifting with his friends which before that he had already done more crimes before that. His weakness are girls and he has gotten with all the girls at his school as he would call them too easy. Which is why he was interested in Courtney who was not all for him. He is good with most of the cast like DJ,Geoff, Owen and Bridgette being the ones who he keeps in contact with most. He still likes Courtney and Gwen but he thinks him and Gwen are better as friends and they have talked and they are on ok terms. He has a hate for the so called pretty boys and he usually bullies them or is rude to them. He never actually thought him and Heather would be a couple he was only physically attracted to her. Duncan semi regrets his bullying but for the most part he thinks he helped Harold become less of a dimwit. He actually likes gen 2 a lot he doesn't really keep in contact with them but he liked Jo,Scott,and Zoey as people and wishes he could have gotten more time to know them. Duncan has been bailed out of jail from his parents who are police officers and now lives a chill life with a podcast where he invites some friends which is doing pretty well and continues to travel the world on that motorcycle.</TEXT>

Edit: also Erikah needs justice I know she snaked us but she was a really fine person outside if Cherrygate and had to be the writers pet so Cherrygate would not be all Mason/Levi's fault. And if you still are going ro hate her give that same energy to Chelsea who tried to steal mc's li but could not even tell mc to her face or Priya who snaked Hope who stood up for her since day 1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So from using this my predictions are Sky she still has unfinished business with Dave that needs to be resolved,Gwen I feel like if everyone from the love square is in there she needs to be in, Izzy you have a lot of star power and Izzy is an easy early boot. For the guys maybe B or DJ are in there.</TEXT>

Mixed, I disagree for the most part Don seemed to be like any regular show host but also Don had one season while Chris had 5 it is kind of hard to measure them by whos a better person. Agree, when they were together it really hirt both of their characters I still think they should be a couple but executed better. Disagree, I don't like either Duncan ships I only like Island duncney Agree, Sky gets a lot of hate that she does not deserve and early Sky was really good a kind person who was a natural leader No opinion, Agree with the daters disagree with goths Maybe in action but not all stars</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Headcanons about td characters 5: Leshawna</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 14:46:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Talks to most of the cast especially Gwen,Bridgette,Lindsay, Trent and DJ She is with Harold and they are married now her family and friends make fun of her for it but she is happy and that is all that matters to her. She grew up in a big family with tons of siblings for her to count in a big city. Her and Tyler had a reunion where they competed in season 2 of RR they got 5th place and are now closer than ever. Her favorite contestant from another gen is Jasmine as she likes her leadership and sees her as someone she would be friends with in real life. Leshawna is great at cheering people up and does not care what she has to do to do it. Leshawnas biggest pet peeves are rude people ranging from bullies to stuck up. She won the award fom the public that she was the best camper of the season for island. She regrets trusting AleJandro and envys him now. Her and Heather have talked after the show on one of Heather's talk show episodes where they seemed to have resolved everything. Now Leshawna lives in a regular home with Harold as a top fitness instructor who likes to distance herself from total drama and is happy with where she is in her life and no one is going to bring her down. Extra headcanon: She has seen Leshawna ball and she calls it dumb and does not care for it.</TEXT>

Geoff is closest with DJ from the og guys and they are still best buddies. He has stayed away from Hollywood and fame as he says it turned him into a toxic person. Brody and Geoff have known eachother since middle school and bonded over there chill attitudes. He was present at every wedding that gen 1 has had and actually created the theme for Harold and Leshawnas wedding where he picked hip hop. He proposed to Bridgette when they were surfing with a bunch of family,friends, and strangers celebrating with them. One of his favorite things to do is traveling and has been to 4 continents. He was on Duncans podcast where they caught up about everything and share their experience. The show did not show it but him and Tyler were actually fast friends while Tyler was on the show. Everyone has said he is the nicest guy ever even Heather. Now Geoff is a pro surfer living a normal life with Bridgette and his kid named Sabrina always looking on the upside of life and can not wait for his next journey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably I cannot imagine Owen or Izzy not with eachother. Yeah Dave and Sky really do like eachother but it was the wrong place total drama was not a good place for their relationship but if it happened on the outside then maybe it could have been more successful. Agree, I always liked Kitty more than Emma No opinion Disagree, I think the ice dancers and Scott take the cake on this one but maybe they are close to the top. Agree, the friendship was great until all stars Cameron had buisness merging and I do not hate the idea of Mal but it was executed poorly and Mike needed more development for us to like him. And Zoey just got old after a while because every episode it was just im nice and hm Mike's kinda sus. Disagree, Courtney has already been a villian so I would not enjoy her just being action Courtney( my least favorite version of Courtney) again True Gwuncan strived off of Courtney being angry and petty about the whole thing and once she wasn't you could see it showing. Agree, Eva deserved to be on team chris reunite team e scope and get development we have seen how good she has been in the aftermath and I think if they focused on her she could do wonders. Agree, he really does need it Both are great seasons but Roti will stay my fav Probably, Duncan still liked Courtney you could see it in all stars he just angry. Mixed, Leshawna never came to my mind as a strategical person but I do get what you are saying Agree Agree, Sierra really just needed Cody and without Cody she should have made friends and not be Cody obsessed you can see in the reunion episode before she was just a Cody stalker she was just an obsessed fan who was determined and that what she needed to show in all stars. Disagree, was never a fan of bald Heather even though I did like red wig. Maybe but honestly I think pahkitew kind of ruined the chances of development for those two. Maybe I would not watch it though Agree, Gwen was not great in all stars she should have been voted earlier than merge I only liked her in the 100th episode episode. True but honestly I think it is totally fine if Duncan did not want to deal with Courtney anymore she changed from her island self which Duncan fell in love with and Courtney was not like that again really until all stars maybe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sierra is eliminated Next at the jamaican me sweat episode since team victory is still a thing I think Alejandro would still try to sabatoge team vicrory leading to team victory losing and a tiebreaker challenge which would probably be on the obstacle course and DJ would win with Dumb luck so Lindsay is out. Now I think DJ would get moved to team amazon In i see london Cody would never get caught and leave the group I think it would go about the same Noah is out for calling Alejandro an eel. Again I do not see a huge change in the area 51 episode Tyler would still be out. Now that Sierra is gone we don't have anybody to be on Courtneys side and DJ is close with Gwen so I see 3 votes Courtney meaning Courtney is out. They would never build Gwens face For the wedding episode Cody and DJ would probably have to be a pairing but I think Owen is still out. Now this is where it gets weird we know Blainley is most likely getting all the votes but now we have to think who would Blainley vote and my guess is Heather so Heather is gone Final 5: Gwen Duncan AleJandro Cody DJ Gwen and Duncan would team up with AleJandro peobably getting Cody and DJ on his side and I think AleJandro would be out next as I feel like Gwen and Duncan would vote AleJandro and Cody and Alejandro for Duncan but I think DJ would vote AleJandro out of all of them. Next would be Cody he's just not as close to the other 3 Next it could go anyway but I think the finale would be Gwen and Duncan if they kept teaming. Final 2: Gwen and Duncan</TEXT>

Maybe I feel like Action has either the most haters or lovers Not always but when it happens every other episode it just feels like what was the point. Looks at RR even though I do love the season</TEXT>

Lindsay has the biggest following out of every Gen 1 contestant having 25 million followers on Instagram. Lindsay has grown some more knowledge now as she has grown up but is still not the smartest. Kitty and Lindsay are friends I'm real life and Kitty has photographed some of Lindsay's best photos. She won the award for best camper on total drama action. Lindsay dropped out of high school to pursue her career as a fashion designer. Lindsay and Tyler are married but don't have babies and will not have babies as neither of them are ready for that. Her fav contestant not from Gen 1 are Dakota and Kitty. Lindsay still calls Leshawna Laquisha to this day. Now Lindsay is a fashion designer/social media influencer who is living her best life in California having a Jock husband and a dog named Owen who she named of course after Owen</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok here we go Tdi - I mean I guess I think Harold could have eliminated either one but I do think it was Courtneys time to go in the competition. Tda - I agree Heather's role made sense it honestly might be my fav version of Heather. Tdwt - I agree he should not have kissed Courtney on the bus and should not have hugged Courtney and said all that nice stuff. There is no excuse for Duncans cheating. Tdroti - I agree she is still more of a villian then a hero but she stood up for Brick when Jo was bullying him made friends with Cameron. And even though she went after Mike Zoey did not own him she did not know Mike had mpd she thought Mike was Vito. Tdas - I so agree and I still do not get that storyline to this day or why it happened for some reason Gwen was mad about it and it was just a huge mess and he legit sexually harrased her like why did that storyline even happen the writers wanted to see Courtney have the highest kiss count. Tdpi - I do not hate Scarlett turning evil but I wish it was something more like Heather in revenge still a teen girl not going to kill anyone just wants some money. RR - I dont know Kitty just seems way to immature for Noah.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Harold and Courtney are obvious options I also think Trent could be interesting. Leshawna and Duncan would be very entertaining And Gwen and Duncan have history but I would not want to see it in any season besides island though</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh not exactly her island gameplay was super risky she could have been out episode 5 and got tons of plot armor and dumb luck so she would not be voted out. Ina action she was nicer but still rude and stuck up and because everyone saw her true colors she didn't have anybody on her side really. Yes in world tour she deserved itbut she could have been out in that tribal episode if Chris did not save her from elimination and if the love triangle never happened you can bet Heather would be out instead of Gwen. Maybe all stars she played her game better being more of a team leader rather than a rude person nobody wants to be around but she was too focused on AleJandro. I agree that Heather is probably one of the best players but I would not call her the best because her strategy almost gets her eliminated multiple times and she has to rely on some plot air to get to her end goal which I would not say she has the best gameplay.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Head canons about total drama characters 10/11: Bridgette and Trent 2 in 1</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 13:23:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bridgette Bridgette found her love for surfing at a ver young age as her mom and dad were also surfers back in the day and taught her how to surf she her very own surfboard when 8. Many guys considered her the cool chick and she had many boyfriends before the show they all ended up breaking up though for her seeing them more as friends than boyfriends. Bridgette had a little bit of a falling out with Courtney and Gwen but has since reunited with them and she is still and was always close to Leshawna. After the show Bridgette got a record deal for her singing she had album that was successful but she atopped aince it was not her passion Her and Geoff got married and had a lid pretty quickly when they were 20 they got married and at 24 they had a kid. Bridgette is a pro surfer like Geoff but is mostly a stay at home mother with her daughter Sabrina it saddens her sometimes that she can not do her passion but she loves Sabrina and is happy that she has what she has and is thankful for everything she has in life. Trent He has been mostly distanced himself from total drama he has not been able to be super close to most of the cast after action only really talking with the drama bros and Leshawna and Owen. He had dated many girls before and after the show but has stayed single as he has said none of those girls were really deep enough for him so he has remained single. He made a drama bros reunion where they all got together and made one last album together. He still follows Gwen on social media they have not interacted too much but if Rrent ever got to see Gwen again he qould do it in a heartbeat. On a lighter note Trent is now touring the world with singles after singles with tons of fangirls and twitter followers Trent is touring the world with his guitar in hand</TEXT>
