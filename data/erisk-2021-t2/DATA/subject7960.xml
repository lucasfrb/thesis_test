    <TEXT>Shoggoths are creatures from Lovecraftian mythology that can take any shape and killed all of the elder gods. The appearances of these two beings are strikingly similar, as seen in the image. The Shoggoths are extremely malleable, explaining the theoretically infinite size of the wall of flesh. This also explains how the wall is able to shrink down into a 3 block tall tunnel. The fact that they killed the elder gods may go to show that the Terrarian killed the wall of flesh just in time. It could have devoured the world.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ug-Qualthoth, and the Ancient Civilization That Worshipped him, Were the Numidium and the Dwemer. (The Elder Scrolls, Fallout)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 20:00:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Part I: The Facts** So, first I'll lay out the basic information. A major piece of Elder Scrolls lore is the disappearance of the Dwemer (the dwarves). Their technological marvels were greater than anything ever seen after in elder scrolls lore. The Dwemer are theorized to have disappeared due to either use of tonal magic (a form of magic using sound) or a godlike machine known as the Numidium created by a dwemer named Kagrenac. An important location is the dwemer ruin of Kagrenzel. The name translates to city of music or city of Kagrenac. You enter by interacting with a strange orb at the center of a room. The dragonborn is then encased in a cage and "studied" by the orb. It seems to approve of you. The ground beneath you flips and you tumble down the longest possible fall in the game to reach the actual ruin of the "city of music". The funny thing about this place is that there is no city. There is a lake with a chest at the bottom and some Falmer ruins at the other side of the lake. In dwemer ruins, we often see faces lining the walls. I'll get back to that later. On the Fallout side, a major mystery is Ug-Qualthoth. First mentioned in Fallout 3, the god seemed to be a fairy tale whispered by the Swampfolk. In the Fallout universe, there is a company known as Dunwich Borers LLC. This company created a building in Fallout 3 known as The Dunwich Building. This building is involved in a quest known as "The Dark Heart of Blackhall" in which the player is instructed to touch a book known as the Krivbeknih to an ancient obelisk buried deep within the building. So, we already have a relation from the Dunwich company to the supernatural. But, more importantly, in Fallout 4, we find a building known as the Dunwich Borers. This place is your average raider base. Strangely, on a terminal, we see that they were trying to dig "it" up. As the sole survivor descends further into this horrific mining building, they begin to hear rumbling. Like footsteps. They venture deeper and deeper, killing the raiders along the way. They read the diaries of the thieves, how they have gone mad and are slowly disappearing. They reach the bottom of the mine, and see a flashback of sacrifices performed in honor of some dark god. As the flashback ends, the ground opens up to an underwater area. They swim down to find a marble area that seems to be an altar. On it are 2 mini-nukes (yay!) and a sacrificial blade known as Kremvh's tooth. But, at the bottom of the area, we can see an eye. Staring at us. Another piece to this puzzle is Lorenzo. A character from Fallout 4 who wears a helm of near-godlike power. He is also 400 years old through the helm. He was formerly an archaeologist in the 19th century who went on a dig in the Rub Al-Khali desert in southern Arabia. There, he discovered the ruins of an ancient city buried under the sand. The settlement predated humanity. Lorenzo discovered the helm and placed it on his head. He changed instantly. he was unable to remove it and it told him to rebury the place he found and to keep it hidden. He began to develop telepathy, telekinesis, and near omnipotent intelligence. He was also driven mad. Across all of the wasteland of Fallout 4, we can see faces of stone. Also, in Fallout Shelter online, a china exclusive version of Fallout Shelter, we can collect cards of different characters. On Lorenzo's card, he stands with the helm on in front of a metal head. In Fallout 76, we can go to a place called Lucky Hole mine. We find terminals from a man named Jonathan Lane. He describes hearing a message from inside the mine. At the bottom, we find a disgusting creature with the legs of a man and a top half made of tentacles. The final thing I have to mention is dwemer lexicons. They are boxes that hold the knowledge of long-dead dwemer. That's it. I just had to introduce that. **Part II: The Speculation and Theorizing** Okay. Now comes the speculation. When the dwemer disappeared, it was during when Kagrenac had finished the numidium. The numidium was intended as a synthetic god. So, Kagrenac tries to activate the numidium. What happens? The dwemer disappear. Now, we don't know where they went. But what if them and the numidium were transported to a time before man, to the Rub Al-Khali desert in the Fallout universe? The first major piece of evidence is that Kagrenzel is known as a city, yet it is only a lake. What if the city was transported alongside the dwemer and the numidium? This would explain the city Lorenzo discovered the helm at. The dwemer were transported to a new and harsh world, where they were wiped away, only a remnant of their technology found by Lorenzo. Speaking of the helm, besides possibly being Dwemer technology, what is its importance, I hear you ask? Well, it has long been stated that the dwemer had the ability of telepathy, but it is not stated as an inherently natural ability. What if every dwemer was outfitted with one of these helms, and this somehow enabled the entire race to be transported not just the city of Kagrenzel. The helm could have also been a form of lexicon, that contained the knowledge of all of the dwemer. This is what could have caused their downfall, as the harsh climate and overpopulation overtook them. Okay, so now we have where the dwemer went. What about the numidium itself. Well, I think it abandoned its creators. Why would it stay with its near-godhood? It abandoned the dwemer to die on a prehistoric earth. I believe that it met the creature from Lucky Hole mine. I believe this creature is Hermaeus Mora. He is the god of knowledge and appears squidlike. I believe Mora helped with the construction of the Numdium. He was also pulled to the Fallout universe. Somehow, him and the Numidium met at Lucky Hole mine and did battle, and the Numidium won. It decimated Mora, and he was left to heal. He later managed to return to tamriel. From its injuries, the numidium collapsed where the Dunwich Borers mine would later be built, and was buried by time. It was trapped by its mortal form, but its godlike reach was able to change the minds of people like the men who led the Dunwich company to dig there. It wanted to be freed. But, the numidium's message was discovered by religious fanatics who named it Ug-Qualthoth and worshipped it with sacrifices. This also means that the eye at the bottom of the Dunwich Borer building is the actual eye of the numidium. It is nearly free. The thing about this is that this eye is the exact eye of metallic heads hanging across the world of Fallout 4. This could mean the image of the numidium was in the minds of many, and was possibly part of its message to people to release it. Its face permeated pre-war culture. Now, I've tied everything together but the "footsteps". What could that be? Well, it's very simple. It's the numidium's gears turning and twisting in eternal torment, trapped since before man. **Part III: Going Further** If you feel that there are holes or you would like to add something to this theory, please post it in the comments below. **Thanks for Reading!**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A unit concept that I think you'll like: Buu Saga Final Battle Vegeta</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-03 18:25:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, this is a unit that I think would be very good and would make for a fun play. The following are his stats: Color: Red Fighting style: Ranged Held cards: 2 ranged cards Melee attack style: A generic series of punches ending with a kick to the head, 20 ki Blast attack style: The style of blast used by characters such as green imperfect cell, 20 ki Green card: He powers up and increases his blast attack and draws a blast card, Special move: That attack where he charges a ki ball between his hands and hurls it at the opponent., 50 ki. Main ability 1: He is tossed a potara earring, but crushes it. He transforms into super saiyan 2 and restores 40 ki and draws a blast card. Available after 15 seconds. Main ability 2: "I'll buy you that minute!" Restores 50 ki and draws the upgraded form of his special move. Available after 15 seconds. Upgraded special move: The same attack as before, but he fires a massive barrage of ki blasts at the opponent. Switch mechanic: When switched in in the middle of a combo, he would fire a blast that eliminates the attack and sends the enemy back. He also draws a blast card. Transformation: The transformation lasts for 45 seconds and when completed, he returns to his normal form without a halo. A quick cutscene of dragon balls flying into the sky at namek. Z ability: Boosts blast attack 25% when fighting against regeneration characters. Tags: Vegeta family, Super Saiyan 2, and Saiyan Episode: Majin Buu Saga (Z) Unique Ability: Hold the line: +50% blast damage when faced with the character kid buu. Tldr: Vegeta at the end of z, cool abilities that change the flow of combat in the player's favor. I hope you liked it, and suggestions would be loved!</TEXT>

I have forgotten the light of the sun and the feeling of the wind in my face as I bask in the sun comfortable in the knowledge that Erik has worn shorts. But now, in this land of twilight, I am forced to accept that the happiness shall never return, and that it will only remain as a faint memory that keeps me from true insanity. But I begin to forget. And if all is forgotten, there is truly no hope for this world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um... what? Allow me to dismantle your argument simply and quickly. The reason kids are recruited so young is because the force is so hard to learn. They can't be recruited at an older age because then they wouldn't be able to learn it as effectively. If a jedi was a pedophile and had desires like that, we can assume that that would be sensed and they would at least be kept away from younglings, or even expelled from the order for having those desires. Yes, the taking of children is wrong, but it is obvious that they are not taken to be molested. Please refrain from believing in this nonsense.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I write emotional arcs as a person who isn't particularly empathic?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-11 19:03:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I read fiction and stories, I find myself unable to 'connect with the characters', and I don't get how people get attached to characters. To me, they are and always will be characters in fiction. So, how does one, aka me, write emotional arcs? I understand how character arcs work, where they improve upon themselves, like learning to trust others more, etc. Are emotional arcs different from character arcs? I understand if this is a question that's been asked a lot and everyone's tired of it, sorry.</TEXT>

I did this to appeal to the kids nowadays. They seem to like morally grey characters, so I decided to make my characters a very dark shade of morally gray. Pretty much black. The story ends with all the bad people getting what they want at the expense of all others. I wanted to have an ending that would make people think. How is it? Is it perfect, or should I make one of the characters like cats? For depth?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>In-Game Impostor Chat</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 21:49:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think there should be a chat for impostors that could be accessed at any time. Most games I play are 2 or 3 impostors, and they're very disorganized. People causing emergencies while another impostor is trying to set up a plan is annoying. Having the chat would make the impostors more formidable and improve the experience for the impostors. Having this would make it so that the impostors would devise strategies and take out players more effectively. How do you feel about this idea? I think it would be a good addition. It would make impostor a more fun role to play.</TEXT>
