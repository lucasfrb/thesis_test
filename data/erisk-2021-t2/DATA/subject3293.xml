    <TITLE>Some facts about the 2019 New England Revolution under Brad Friedel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-09 02:16:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>The Revs are in last place in the eastern conference Their 0.67 PPG is second worst in MLS Their -19 goal differential is the worst in MLS (Rapids are -13 and Cincy -9, both fired their coaches) They have allowed 18 goals in their last four games, 11 over their last two. It's been just over one month since Revs coach Brad Friedel complained that the players ["don't have fans waiting by their cars, they don't have people beating them up."](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/b6oakx/brad_friedel_on_the_revs_struggles_theres_not/) It's been a rough week for the Revs, some highlights: Four days ago: [Revs lose 6-1](https://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2019-05-04-philadelphia-union-vs-new-england-revolution/recap) Two days ago, Friedel: [ #8220;I normally don #8217;t speak to the team postgame  #8212; win, lose or draw after games  #8212; because in my experiences, I think that #8217;s when emotions are running at the highest beat. #8221;](https://old.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/bl4h5k/setterlund_nerevs_coach_brad_friedel_i_normally/) Yesterday: It was reported that although his team accepted a  #8364;4m offer, [Paul-Jos #233; M'Poku refuses to join the Revs](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/blu4gb/rtl_sport_french_standard_accepts_a_4m_offer_for/). liked by Lee Nguyen: https://i.imgur.com/17Gvlo2.png Earlier today, Revs president Brian Bilello: ["I absolutely get the frustration and all of us are upset at where we are."](https://old.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/bm8qtj/brian_bilello_i_absolutely_get_the_frustration/) A comment from that thread:  gt; Went to a career fair with Revs once. Biello gave a speech about how you don #8217;t have to like or know soccer to work there. It shows. Earlier tonight: [Brad Friedel offers his thoughts as the Revs go into halftime 2-0](https://twitter.com/NERevolution/status/1126291381457235970)  gt; Q:  #8220;How do you get this message over to your players? #8221;  gt; BF:  #8220;We gotta keep telling em. #8221; Tonight after Revs lose 5-0: [Fire pile on as Revs routed again](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/05/08/chicago-fire-5-new-england-revolution-0-2019-mls-match-recap)  gt; New England are now winless in their last four, and have lost by five goals in consecutive matches. [New England Revolution set new record with defensive fragility](https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/05/08/new-england-revolution-set-new-record-defensive-fragility)  gt; After starting the season 2-5-1, the Revs have dropped three of their last four matches and have set a new league record by conceding 15 goals in their last three matches. The 18 goals they have conceded in their four matches are tied for the most in league history with Minnesota United FC, who conceded 18 in their first four MLS matches. Wow they're "Expansion Minnesota United with Jermaine Taylor and Vadim Demidov" bad! https://twitter.com/RobStoneONFOX/status/1126309744501596160 -x-x-x-x-x- Brad Friedel was hired by Revs GM Mike Burns in 2017, despite having zero professional coaching experience, because they were roommates. https://twitter.com/ronwaxman/status/894027749802872832  gt; MNUFC  amp; NERevs will not succeed while Manny Lagos  amp; Michael Burns, respectively, are in positions of power at the clubs. -x-x-x-x-x- **UPDATE:** Wow the Revs actually fired Brad Friedel!

His capacious definition of sucker includes those who lose their lives in service to their country, as well as those who are taken prisoner, or are wounded in battle.  #8220;He has a lot of fear, #8221; one officer with firsthand knowledge of Trump #8217;s views said.  #8220;He doesn #8217;t see the heroism in fighting. #8221; **Several observers told me that Trump is deeply anxious about dying or being disfigured, and this worry manifests itself as disgust for those who have suffered.**</TEXT>

Only reason you entertain what he says is because he does your monkey dance and sings "Orange man bad" He was part of the reason the phony Steele dossier bullshit got pushed. There's a reason Trump hated him. Michael Cohen is so bad, why did Trump use him as his personal lawyer (most wealthy people don #8217;t depend on graduates of Cooley Law which people in the profession refer to as the  #8220;worst law school in America #8221;) for well over a decade, and only stopped doing so after the feds busted into Cohen #8217;s home and law offices with search warrants?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump #8217;s feelings on black people extended beyond the first black President... [Trump Thought Black People Were  #8216;Too Stupid #8217; to Vote for Him](https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-cohens-tell-all-book-arrives-trump-thought-black-people-were-too-stupid-to-vote-for-him)  gt; Cohen #8217;s Disloyal: A Memoir describes how Trump also said he #8217;d  #8220;never get the Hispanic vote #8221; because  #8220;like the Blacks, they #8217;re too stupid to vote for Trump. #8221; Trump #8217;s  #8220;low opinion of all Black folks #8221; focused most viciously on former President Barack Obama, according to Cohen, the president #8217;s former personal lawyer who is serving a three-year prison sentence for campaign finance violations.  gt; The Commander in Chief reportedly attributed Obama #8217;s admission to Columbia University and Harvard Law School to nothing more than  #8220;f--king affirmative action. #8221;  gt; Of Obama #8217;s presidency, he was quoted as saying,  #8220;Tell me one country run by a black person that isn #8217;t a sh--hole. They are all complete f--king toilets. #8221;  gt; Cohen claims Trump went so far as to hire an Obama impersonator to appear in a video where Trump  #8220;ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him, #8221; according to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/05/politics/michael-cohen-book-trump-white-house/index.html), which published a photo from Cohen #8217;s book that shows Trump seated behind a desk with a book in front of him that appears to show Obama #8217;s name, and a Black man in front of the desk wearing a black suit and American flag pin. The Obama affirmative action part is just more projection from [the guy who hired someone to take his SATs according to his own sister](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/maryanne-trump-barry-secret-recordings/2020/08/22/30d457f4-e334-11ea-ade1-28daf1a5e919_story.html)...  gt; In one tape, Barry said she did her brother #8217;s homework for him and that  #8220;I drove him around New York City to try to get him into college. #8221; She said Trump  #8220;went to Fordham for one year [actually two years] and then he got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams. #8221;</TEXT>

They pretend it #8217;s Susan Collins (to be taken over by Lisa Murkowski if Collins loses) whose real role is that of the white supposedly moderate Republican woman who finds all the right wing insanity  #8220;very concerning #8221; thus creating the permission structure for pro-choice suburban women to vote GOP... but Lindsay Graham is truly the conscience of the modern Republican Party.

    <TEXT>He doesn #8217;t even mention the inconvenient little detail that HE is the one who spread the misinformation that you kindly refer to as  #8220;his statement #8221;... instead he uses the passive voice. The news video on this story actually covers that he #8217;s the one who spread the false rumor. But his statement makes it seem like some random person did it. Also his  #8220;retraction #8221; is not connected to the tweets where he spread the false information (not in the same thread of tweets), I cut and pasted them together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>California can #8217;t get much more blue than it already is after the 2018 blue wave... we have more Dems in Congress than if the Congressional districts had been gerrymandered by the Dem controlled state legislature! That may sound wrong but in a gerrymander you protect as many diacritics as you can by ensuring the margins won #8217;t be too close, and the non-partisan districts meant a bunch of elections in purple districts were won by just a few percentage points. So for example a gerrymander would have carved out a few deep red districts in coastal SoCal so the rest would be safer blue, but in reality the Republicans were pretty much wiped out. https://i.imgur.com/nlcbm6W.jpg Of course we do need to win back CA-25!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The NYT is protecting their sources, genius. How is it any different from the Washington Post not releasing the identity of Deep Throat during Watergate? Does that mean Woodward and Bernstein fabricated the whole thing? Except we now know who their anonymous source was, decades later, so turns out they didn #8217;t make the whole thing up for the lulz. Releasing the tax documents would mean burning their source, who could be traced from the documents, see what happened to Reality Winner who is currently in prison for sending intelligence documents about Russian interference in the US election to the press. If they did that, no one would send them sensitive documents ever again, meaning people in positions of power would be protected from the press as they could punish those who go against them. If you don #8217;t think Trump is vindictive enough to do this, maybe take a look at his entire adult life, most recently Alexander Vindman being led out of the White House after flagging Trump #8217;s Ukraine quid pro quo phone call that got him impeached. The NYT is not breaking any laws, they have a first amendment protection here, see the part about a  #8220;free press #8221;... Let the Trump administration try to sue, this has been covered a dozens times in the courts, eg the Pentagon Papers. People will just have to make up their own minds on who to believe, respected journalists who have a ridiculous amount of detailed information that they #8217;re laying out over multiple lengthy news articles, or a pathological liar who has told tens of thousands of documented lies just in the last four years. Or you know Trump could put the whole thing to rest by **actually releasing his tax returns** as every Presidential candidate (22 years worth from Biden as of today) for the last 40 years has done!</TEXT>

How do you reconcile your  #8220;only if there was an illegal action #8221; and  #8220;actually a free press doesn #8217;t allow for them to publish #8221; points with the Pentagon Papers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post_(film)  gt; The Post and Times jointly appear before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment constitutional rights. Meanwhile, other major newspapers start publishing on the secret war study in solidarity with the once isolated Post and Times.

If she wasn #8217;t wearing a mask on the plane where it was mandatory that would certainly be infuriating... got any photos of that? The Pelosi thing is an total joke... the hair salon told her it was fine and then tried to turn it into some gotcha moment with their video footage. The only two people who were inside were her and the person cutting her hair, no one else. Fox News and the Republicans pretending to be outraged when the former constantly calls for business to fully open (certainly not just one person inside at a time) and the latter supports a president who almost never wears a mask is beyond pathetic.</TEXT>

We heard  #8220;Obama #8217;s gonna take away our guns #8221; a thousand times over the 8 years of the Obama administration... so either it #8217;s a fake threat or it #8217;s irrelevant because all our guns already got taken away from 2008-2016. What makes the threat more real under Biden, who was Obama #8217;s VP for those 8 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; This is about making her face the courts for the vast number of crimes she perpetrated against America, Americans, and the World. Trump as been leading his supporters in chants of  #8220;Lock her up #8221; at rallies since the middle of 2016.... After the 2016 election Trump became US President, arguably the most powerful office in the world. He appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Then he replaced him with current Attorney General Bill Barr. FBI director Wray is another Trump appointee. It #8217;s now October 2020, more than four years since the  #8220;Lock her up #8221; chants first began. We #8217;re now just a few weeks away from the 2020 Presidential election. So when is Hillary Clinton going to get arrested by Trump #8217;s Justice Department? When will she  #8220;face the courts #8221;, where Trump has appointed hundreds of the judges? What #8217;s taking so long?? If she has committed so many crimes why can #8217;t they arrest her right now, or at any point in the last 3.5 years? Or is that not going to happen until a SECOND Trump term, even though the chants were now four years ago? Maybe they need to go check the basement of that DC pizza shop again?? Also can you give us some specifics on Hillary Clinton #8217;s  #8220;vast crimes #8221;? I still have my Criminal Law books from law school around here somewhere and would love to look up these crimes if you can give me the relevant codes... thanks in advance!  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some truth to what? Eric Trump didn #8217;t say Biden bought the pictured house for 185k, if he had mentioned the actual purchase price no one would have thought twice about it. Instead he posted a picture of a big expensive looking house and said  #8220;this is Joe Biden #8217;s house #8221;, implying it was his *current* house when really Biden sold it 24 years ago. Also listing the annual salary for US Senators is disingenuous at best. Biden hasn #8217;t been a Senator for 12 years! Might be worth mentioning that Biden spent 8 years post-Senate as VICE PRESIDENT. After that he wrote a book that made him a bunch of money, and also made lots of money from speaking fees... both totally normal revenue streams for former Presidents and VPs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I mean if it #8217;s 185k and the salary was below that. **The house was over a year #8217;s wage**. So trumpet jr might be talking out of his ass but **there #8217;s no way he could have afforded it**. Do you think people buy houses that only cost one year #8217;s salary?? Where is this magical land you live in where houses are that cheap? I bought a few years ago in the SF Bay Area, where the average home price is probably around a million dollars if not more. Do you think every homeowner around here makes a million dollars per year? One more question, how old are you? Because based on this comment I #8217;m guessing 15.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Most people in Cali lease their houses due to the high cost, Biden bought his (maybe with a mortgage maybe not) he sold the the house so he still wasn #8217;t paying off that mortgage. What... I specifically said home owners, as in those who buy their homes, who by definition do not  #8220;lease their houses #8221;! What are you even saying here? What evidence do you have that Biden didn #8217;t have a mortgage? Even if he didn #8217;t have a mortgage, what makes you think Biden and his wife, both with good paying jobs, being able to buy a $185k house is in any way suspicious as Eric Trump suggests? How does Biden selling his house mean  #8220;he still wasn #8217;t paying off that mortgage #8221;? Even if that made any sense, how do you square it with your  #8220;maybe mortgage maybe not #8221; from literally earlier in that same sentence?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So Trump was a fascist three years ago when Fox News which is practically state media tweeted this, but Trump is not a fascist in 2020 when he #8217;s sabotaging the USPS, doing just about everything in his power to suppress voters, and publicly musing about not accepting the election results? Ok</TEXT>
