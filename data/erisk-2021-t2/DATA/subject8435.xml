    <TITLE>How Mortis should be buffed (Idea)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-21 20:57:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>As you all know, Mortis is a very weak brawler in the game right now. So here is an idea how Supercell should buff him: STARPOWER(If there are 3rd starpowers coming or to replace one of them) Power of the Night. Every time Mortis hits an enemy with his dash, he gains a 35/40% shield for 2.5 seconds. Effect does not stack. Why this is good: 1. Mortis is a close range brawler, and he needs to get up close to deal damage, and most of the time he doesn #8217;t deal enough damage to quickly kill a brawler(except the squishies, which are sometimes even hard to kill.) The shield will protect him from at least some damage the enemy brawler deals, so he stands some kind of chance against the not squishy brawlers. 2. Long reload speed. You mostly use 1/2 dashes to get close to a brawler that you want to kill, but then you need 3 ammo to take him/her out. So with this shield Mortis doesn #8217;t get wiped out by the brawler before he recharges his ammo, and the shield duration is as long as an ammo takes to reload, so he will be protected until he has his ammo back. 3. No ability to check bushes. If Mortis walks accidentally into a bushcamper, he can quickly hit the shelly/bull/primo/darryl/rosa and get that shield so he will be able to run away, and not die instantly before even able to escape. 4. Brawl Ball. The shield will not activate when he dashes without hitting anyone, so he won #8217;t be half-invincible when he tries to score.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Showdown Modifier Swap</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-05 17:16:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>As you all know, showdown modifiers (angry robo, energy drink, meteors and healing mushrooms) only appear on a set map. It would be fun to change this up, so modifiers would rotate around all showdown maps. For example angry robo on cavern churn. This is a small feature that I guess isn #8217;t that hard to add to the game. What are your thoughts on this? This would also maybe make showdown more fun (not always energy drink pipers on Double Trouble)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rosa is the boring version of El Primo</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-18 18:52:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I lately started noticing that rosa is pretty op (and better than Primo). So I wanted to share my toughts on this. I am an almost maxed player, I play since day 1 of global. I only need to max out jessie (lvl 8), penny (lvl 7) and tick (lvl 7). All of my other brawlers are level 9/10. However, my rosa is still level 3. Now here #8217;s the point: At first when rosa came out (OP!) I immediately pushed her to rank 20. But my opinion is that rosa is the lower skillcap and boring version of Primo. I love playing Primo, he is so much fun with his super! But rosa, she has a very autoaim friendly and almost unmissable attack. Also her super is just a shield. A SHIELD! Come on supercell, is that the best thing you could invent? Primo #8217;s super in that case is very original. So basically: Rosa is too boring to push, and she #8217;ll be my last brawler to max out. How do you think about this? Do you prefer Primo or Rosa?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The current state of SOLO Showdown.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-23 16:39:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>As an experienced solo sd player (2k solo wins), I wanted to discuss the current state of solo showdown, and I wanted to share my feelings about solo showdown, and ONLY solo showdown. I #8217;m not gonna talk about duo showdown as that is a completely different story. Over the past couple month #8217;s (since around brawloween update) I have noticed that solo sd is becoming more and more boring, and less played. This is mostly because the community maps are really boring and not special at all. Almost every sd map is just a boring mix of some walls, bushes, water and equally spread boxes. This makes showdown in general already less fun. The second thing that makes SOLO showdown, and not duo showdown boring is camping. I #8217;ve noticed a big increase of campers since the og (double trouble, feast or famine, etc.) supercell maps got removed. This is mainly because all the community maps are have a lot of good camping spots. And one extra thing bad about the community maps: In almost every current sd map, the bush areas are too big. You can #8217;t safely check a bush. It is basically too big because when you try to check one part of the bush, it is very easy for the camper to move to the other part of it, and when you are done checking that part he can go back to that one and avoid all of your checking shots. Then you #8217;ll think there is no one in the bush and the camper will easily kill you if you don #8217;t have a super that can give you an opportunity to escape. On the old og supercell maps almost every bush was not too big because you could check it safely (except the big cavern churn bush, but that makes the map original). Another thing that comes into play is teaming. At around 750-800 trophies people start to team, as it is a cheap way to get higher placement in the match. Most of the teamers aren #8217;t even skilled enough to be on that rank with that brawler (take for example the teaming 8bits), but because of teaming they can push even higher. And the meteor modifier doesn #8217;t even fix that. The best modifiers for solving teaming is in my opinion energy drink. It is also the best overall modifier in my opinion. Now here are my ideas to improve solo showdown, feel free to share your opinion! - Bring back the og showdown maps. They are more fun to play and there will be less camping. - Rework all the community maps to make the bushes smaller so they are safe to check. This will solve the camper problem partially. - As you know how higher in trophies on one brawler you get, the less trophies you earn per placement in sd. Make it so you get 1 trophy per kill, this will encourage players to fight and not to team. Don #8217;t spam r/engrish because English isn #8217;t my native language.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-07 17:32:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Lately i #8217;ve been tryingto push my mortis in bounty as that is his best mode. However I keep facing Ticks who are invincible and outrange my teammates. And even when I try to go in on a Tick he #8217;ll spam mines on top of him and his teammates will even help him. I #8217;ve thought about pushing him myself but I just hate tick. He is so boring to play, I hate control based brawlers like him. He needs a rework. He is a thrower that outranges even piper and brock! Here is my idea: - Instead of the big circle make 3 smaller ones appear for each mine when you aim your attack. This makes his attack less rng. - Reduce main attack range by 4 tiles. (HE IS A FREAKIN THROWER WHO HAS A SUPER LONG RANGE!) - Buff super health to 3000 and nerf damage to 2000 at max lvl. His super is easy to destroy for a decent player, so this will make his super more useful at long distances and not when someone is near him. - Nerf reload speed from 2.2 sec to 2.7 sec. Becuz his attacks already stay on the ground for nearly 2 seconds. Feel free to share your opinion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Forsaken Falls isn #8217;t supposed to be a sd map! Remove it!!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-10 13:19:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Forsaken Falls is a map made by the pro player and youtuber Ash, who was once number one global. He made the map for lonestar, as it had spawns close to eachother so you could kill others easier. But which dumbass at supercell HQ had the stupid idea to put a lonestar map into showdown! Showdown is completely different than lonestar, where it is about surviving and not killing. Now don #8217;t get me wrong, I like the idea of no boxes which makes it more skill dependant. But there are 3 main problems: 1: The spawns are way to close to eachother and there is a big chance you will get 2v1 or cornered by 2 others. 2: Meteors ruin almost every showdown map, and FF is one of those. Why make a map if the meteors destroy everything, just put a blank map into the game and remove the meteors. And they don #8217;t even solve teaming, they even target non-teaming players. I #8217;ve experienced it today. I spawned next to a pam that was afk, so I thought it was a free kill so I came close to her (I was playing leon). Meteors almost immediately started chasing me, so I hadn #8217;t enough time to kill the pam, and in the time that I tried to avoid the meteor the pam started playing (not a bot). I was low hp cuz she immediately spammed shots on me, who was close to her, and a crow came and finished me off. 3: THE STUPID WATER IN THE MIDDLE!!! Every match, in the endgame people get stuck behind the water and can #8217;t fairly fight. This stupid water makes it even easier to get hit by a meteor, while you need to watch out to not step on the yeet-pad and yeet yourself in the gas. The water gets you simply stuck in one of the corners, and you #8217;ll get killed cuz you can #8217;t dodge shots. Forsaken Falls needs to be removed. Please, or at least rework it. The no cubes idea is ok but the map is trash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, coiled snake should be a basic thing of mortis. Just like bibi #8217;s homerun bar. No one basically uses creepy harvest because it is hard to kill someone with mortis that isn #8217;t a 3 tap or 4 tap. And when using creepy harvest you need to waste attacks to come close to the enemy. They should make coiled snake a basic thing, and the new starpower replacing coiled would be some kind of shield so when mortis hits an enemy he gains a temporary 30% shield, so he doesn #8217;t die so fast. The problem is also that supercell keeps buffing health of different brawlers, like frank, pam, poco. That makes mortis his matchups even worse.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-28 11:50:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everything is wrong with this map. The main problems of this shitty map are: - Unfair Spawnpoints, so it is easy to get 2v1 #8217;ed or you don #8217;t get any spawn powercubes. - The freaking bush highway. This makes the map just super trash. I like the idea of a big bush like in cavern churn, but please remove it on this map because it is too easy to get spawn trapped by a shelly. On cavern churn you can choose if you want to go in the big bush, but here you are forced early game to pass through it hoping a shelly isn #8217;t waiting for you. - Meteors. Worst. Modifier. Ever. (Does not solve teaming). - The annoying water placement in the middle. It makes it hard late game to 1v1 the last player cuz you need to manouver around the stupid water AND also watch out for meteors. Please remove or rework this map. It is not a fun map like cavern churn.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to fix the Mortis in Brawl Ball problem.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-01 14:18:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>We all hate to get a Mortis on our team in bb. I have an idea why so many players do it and how to solve this problem. Why: People don #8217;t play Mortis in bb to grind trophies. They just want to have fun, and games are made for having fun. No one wants to always play competitively and win or lose trophies. So here is my idea. Casual Mode. Every mode will have a competitive (trophies) and a casual mode. How will this work: Every mode and map that is in the current rotation will have 2 modes: casual and competitive. Competitive mode is for players that want to grind trophies on their brawlers, and casual is for players that just want to have fun. When you tap an event it will show 2 bars, just like it is when you tap on showdown you get the choice to play either solo or duo. Then you choose if you want to play competitive or casual. Basic rules of casual mode: - You play for fun, so if you win or lose no one loses or gains trophies. - You will still get the same trophy-based matchmaking like in competitive mode, so you don #8217;t get noobs on your/the enemy team. - Every mode that is in the current rotation will have the option for casual mode, but you can #8217;t choose maps or events that aren #8217;t in the current rotation. - You can still get starplayer, but you gain no exp or tokens for playing casual mode. - Casual mode is not a second startoken to every event. - Duplicate brawlers are allowed, that makes it even more fun! You can also use 3 of the same brawlers, because in the end this mode is about having fun! - Everyone gets max level brawlers + gadgets to make it fair and you can try out starpowers or gadgets. - You can use look for team feature or make a team with friends. Why this is a good idea: - Players that want to do trickshots or just have fun will not ruin competitive matchmaking, like the mortises in bb. - It is (kind of) end game content for tryhard/maxed players, they can now have fun in casual mode and not get bored of just pushing over and over. - It is an important feature, because games are made for having fun!

    <TITLE>Too much tank friendly Bounty maps</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-03 08:56:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve noticed that there has been a major increase in tank friendly bounty maps. I hate it. Bounty is a mode where your aiming skill is tested, for example with brock or piper. Bounty is not about bushcamping and autoaiming with fucking shellies. Please add back the wide open maps and remove the bushy maps. We already had snake prairie, and now there are around 5 tank friendly bounty maps. This will also be an indirect buff to Mortis, which is the worst brawler in my opinion. Bounty is one of his best modes, and now there are tanks in bounty. You can #8217;t push mortis anymore in bounty without a bush/wall breaking teammate. Please remove the current maps and bring back the old ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have experienced this too. This is a AI pathfinding bug. The troops target the closest building they see upon landing, ignoring that empty space in front of that building. They walk past the other buildings taking heavy damage only going for that one building they saw. Good reaction from you of using a flare to correct your troops. This can be used as an exploit in your own defense building so make us of it if you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Only a gadget buff for Mortis!?!? Even sith that damage he will still die too fast and be counter by more than half of the brawlers. I #8217;d suggest making coiled snake permanent at level one, and replacing 2nd sp with a shield that when he hits someone he takes less damage, or if he dashes without hitting anyone he reloads that dash 50% faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And then there #8217;s Mortis! The last time he got somewhat buffed was around October/November I think, and they only buffed CH which is still worse than CS. Creepy Harvest is useless cuz you either kill a squishy before they can deal any damage, or you die to a shelly/tank/nita/etc. without killing them, so you do not get the healing. I really hope they give Mortis some attention in the next balance changes, as he has been falling down the tier list more and more. Especially gadgets were a huge impact/nerf to him. Brawlers that he counters, like barley/tick/crow/piper/AND ESPECIALLY EMZ, all got a gadget to defend themselves from Mortis. And let #8217;s not talk about the brawlers that already countered him, like nita/shelly/tanks/etc. Mortis isn #8217;t good in any mode anymore besides bounty, cuz in GG he get #8217;s wrecked by tanks+poco or even nita/tara. And still, there are a lot of better picks in bounty, which outclass Mortis.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A guide on how to properly defend in Brawl Ball.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 13:03:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>First some backstory information: I have 4k 3v3 wins, and 3500 of them are in brawl ball. I don #8217;t want to flex, just wanna say that I am an decent brawl ball player. I made this guide because I noticed that a lot of players don #8217;t know how to properly defend in bb. This guide is for you randoms out there that need to get better at defending in bb. I #8217;ll explain everything about defending, from team comps to map positioning. Lets start off with what to do before the match starts. Analyze your team. Let #8217;s say you are a shelly, and you have a mortis and gene teammate. The person that defends, is the one that can deal big damage in a few shots, and even more important, the person that has a stun/knockback. Stun/knockback brawlers are: -Shelly -Primo (with gadget) -Nita (with gadget but in most situations you don #8217;t have your bear.) -Bibi -Bull -Darryl -Tara -Gene -Brock (with gadget) -Dyna -Tick -Penny (with gadget but same situation as with nita, you don #8217;t have your super often.) -Emz (with gadget) -Jacky -Frank -Bo (traps) -Piper (bombs) Who will be the defender: Let #8217;s go back to your team. You: Shelly + Mortis and Gene teammate. You now know you have the stun/knockback, and the Gene teammate aswell. The Mortis doesn #8217;t have a stun. So you, are the main defender of the match. The gene can help out too but you get your super way faster than he does. Positioning: You know you are the main defender. There are 2 things you should never do as the main defender. - Get lured out of your position. - Get killed. Now about your position. You should always play mid as a defender, or stay near the goal. The defender should not die often because than it is easy for the enemy to score. You are the one to stop a goal attempt. If a tank tries to walk the ball in, you can easily kill him as a shelly. The knockback/stun is very useful becuz when you used all your ammo, and the enemy is still walking to the goal, you should use your super/gadget to stun/knockback them, so they lose the ball out of their hands, and you can then pick it up and shoot it away. If you get lured out of the mid/back, there will be a hole in the defense, making it easy for a mortis or a tank to quickly score. So remember, stay near the goal, and don #8217;t die. One extra thing to note when defending is that you should always stay in front of the enemy brawler that is trying to score. If you stand behind them they will have a free kick opportunity. Team comp: When making a team for a tournament or just to push, always remember to have a stun/knockback brawler in your team. This is one of the most important aspects of bb. NOTE: Never let a Mortis defend on himself. Your in big trouble if you do so and the enemy team will know they can score. I think this is everything about defending in brawl ball. If you have something to point out feel free to comment. -u/subject8435</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mortis is incredibly bad. He is by far the worst compared to the other bottom tier brawlers. This is why.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-22 12:46:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Mods: I #8217;m not begging for a Mortis buff, I #8217;m just trying to expain why he is so bad. Plz don #8217;t remove this... If you don #8217;t think mortis needs a buff you should really read this. Besides this, there was also a poll on this sub, and from the results you can see that mortis is the worst brawler compared to the other bottom tier brawlers. I am a mortis main, pb 920. I play mortis 90% of my games, as he is very fun to play and can make some cool turnaround situations with one play. But since the addition of gadgets he became far more worse than he already was. There are 3 main problems with mortis, that make him shitty and should be fixed/reworked. One: He has one of the slowest unload speeds in the game. Unload speed isn #8217;t the same as reload speed. Unload speed is how much time it takes for mortis to use all 3 his attacks, his super, and gadget. Not to mention that he has to stand still to use his gadget, which is also a big flaw in his kit. Mortis can deal around 6000 damage with all attacks, super and gadget. That is much, you might say. But due to his slow unload speed, he already dies before he can deal all the damage. Mortis his main strength is speed, and a slow unload speed does not belong in his kit. Two: Creepy Harvest is mostly useless against a lot of brawlers. Now don #8217;t get me wrong, CH can really work well in some situations. But those situations don #8217;t happen often. If you have CH, and you go up against a brawler there can be 2 outcomes: one, you kill the brawler before they can deal any damage (mostly squishies), or two, you die to the brawler because they have too much health/too much damage. In the first situation CH is nearly useless, as you don #8217;t get damaged. In the second situation CH is useless aswell, because you didn #8217;t kill the brawler, so you didn #8217; get the healing that you needed. The problem with CH is that mortis doesn #8217;t need healing after killing someone, but he needs it while battling, as he struggles against most brawlers. Three: Mortis is the only melee brawler in the game, and doesn #8217;t have much health. I get it that he is an assassin, but he can #8217;t really stand his ground, and can #8217;t control his lane. EVERY brawler in the game has range. Even primo and rosa. They may have a very short range, but they do have it. Mortis however, he needs to be directly on top of someone to deal damage. The dash (and coiled snake) aren #8217;t a range. Range means how far a brawler can reach without standing on top of an enemy. Let me explain this with a situation: There is an angry robo. He got somehow stuck and can only hit someone that is on top of him. Let me say one thing: Mortis will be the last brawler to take down that robo. Even rosa or primo can take it out without taking damage, while having the shortest range in the game. Mortis has no range, so he will need to dash onto the robo taking big damage while trying to kill him. This is his main vulnerability in 1v1 situations. He needs to get on top of someone to deal some damage, and charge his super. This will mostly result in him dying, and giving the enemy team an advantage. And then you should look at his health. Let #8217;s compare him to frank, who has the longest range for a tank. He has around 5k more health than than mortis if he has sponge. While mortis is the only melee brawler and has only 5320 hp. I understand that he has healing abilities like his super and creepy harvest. But creepy harvest is mostly useless, read the second point. He doesn #8217;t get his super very often, and to get it, he needs to suicide and feed the enemy supers most of the time. All these things make Mortis barely useful in competitive play, or just in 3v3 in general. He isn #8217;t good in Solo/Duo either, as he has a ton of counters. He is only decent against throwers, and they are rarely used. Mortis can #8217;t be a counter to only thrower for his whole life.

    <TITLE>Mortis isn #8217;t viable in gem grab at all at 800+</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-17 15:12:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>Look, I am a Mortis main, and I pushed him to 920 in solo showdown (yes believe me). Recently I said fuck you to solo cuz of the cancerous 8bits and pams, and started playing mortis in gem grab, cuz bounty isn #8217;t in rotation every day. But almost every match I play, randoms or in a team, there is almost no good matchup for me. I face rosa or jacky 8/10 games, and if those 2 don #8217;t appear there is always more than one mortis counter. Nita, emz (yes with the gadget she counters mortis I can say that from experience), poco (too much healing) and the list goes on. Not to mention crow with his stupid gadget. The only situation where mortis is somewhat viable is when there is a thrower, but most (8/10 matches) times there is none. And no, sprout isn #8217;t a thrower. The problem here is that almost everything counters mortis, even some squishies like crow and bea. I was really dissappointed that supercell didn #8217;t buff him this update, cuz a lot of players already ranted about him before the update. Now he is still terrible, the gadget modification didn #8217;t do shit. There are always better picks in gem grab than mortis, and those counter him aswell. I even switched to bounty and what did I face? Rosa jacky and poco. Fking assholes. Poor mortis...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t hate on me, but mortis can be better in heist than in brawl ball. You do need 2 high damage teammates. You can make throwers completely useless, and just be annoying to the other brawlers and if you can keep on killing 1 of them they won #8217;t be able to push up. I tried this strategy at 800and won most of my matches just becuz the enemy throwers were useless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I played bounty/gem until 800 with randoms, just play aggro with creepy harvest. Then from 800 to 1k I pushed on cavern churn, it is by far the best mortis map. At high trophies there are rico #8217;s and throwers, which mortis counters. The tanks always die last to the bo #8217;s in the middle. Try to spin with the bo #8217;s so they clean up the tanks for you. Always try to steal cubes and boxes, because boxes are very important to be succe with mortis. At the end, just backstab the bo #8217;s cuz they don #8217;t have that much health. Top 4 guaranteed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why overtime should not happen in random matchmaking.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-12 10:53:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>As you all know, when the game ends in a tie you go into overtime, where all the obstacles break and you get an additional minute of playing. But sometimes I think that overtime should not happen when playing with randoms, because it is too high stakes. Why should overtime not happen in random matchmaking: First off, overtime makes the mode way more risky to play. See it from my point: I, (for example Colt) am (slightly) carrying my randoms. They keep dying on and on but I manage to keep killing the enemies so no one scores. But then, the game goes into overtime. Dying in overtime is way worse than dying in the normal match. Because in overtime the enemy doesn #8217;t have to walk and shoot around walls and can score way easier. Now back to the situation. When the game goes into overtime my teammates still keep dying, and I need to hold the whole team off on myself. But now that all the cover is gone, I just die cuz of 3v1 and I have nowhere to hide and heal up. If I end up dying it #8217;s basically a guaranteed goal for them, cuz my teammates don #8217;t know how to block the goal. Second: The goal is way too open to be defended by one person. If I #8217;m the only one defending the goal it is a guaranteed goal if the enemy isn #8217;t braindead. And most non experienced randoms don #8217;t know the popular goal shots that we do (corner shot, walking left scoring right, etc.). I just don #8217;t trust my randoms with defending a goal in overtime. I #8217;d rather draw a game than lose to a 3v1. I also don #8217;t think I #8217;m the only one who feels like this. This is why I suggest to make overtime not apply in random matchmaking, and especially when an underdog is on your/enemy team. Once again: I rather draw than lose. Feel free to criticize my post and suggest a better idea! -u/subject8435</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There should be a QUIT GAME button in PvE modes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-05 12:49:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>PvE Modes are really boring to play. Especially the new shitty city rampage. If I #8217;m trying to get triple bo there but assholes play a level 5 gene than I should be able to immediately quit that game and not waste 5 minutes on trying to convince my randoms to just suicide aswell. This is so obvious yet it isn #8217;t there. I #8217;m not saying it should happen in big game, which is a PvP and not PvE mode. But in modes like boss fight, robo rumble and shitty rampage you should have a quit button. Why? There is nothing to lose! You don #8217;t waste any tickets and don #8217;t lose or win trophies. You can play the mode as much as you want and never lose anything. If you don #8217;t want to play the mode anymore there should be a quit button. I hope someone understands me and my idea cuz I #8217;m tired of seeing mortises and genes in robo rumble. Or AFK randoms. They are even worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a Mortis main who plays a lot of brawl ball (and no I #8217;m not that random mortis that goes for the ball right away), I am sick of teammates passing me the ball and me wasting my long dash. I know mortis is a goal scorer but I don #8217;t want to get the ball all the time. After kicking it away I need to wait for freaking 3,5 seconds just to charge my long dash. I hate this. Just like bea #8217;s supercharged shot doesn #8217;t go away when she kicks the ball, the same should happen with mortis. But not with bibi #8217;s knockback. Becuz that would be too op. But mortis is already so weak rn, and this would be a great small buff for him. Waiting 3,5 seconds after kicking the ball is just too much, and especially in the fast paced mode brawlball. I don #8217;t think I #8217;m the only one who hates this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to (somewhat) stop teaming. (Idea)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-10 12:28:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a solo main with 2,3k solo wins I have faced a lot of teamers in my brawl career. I managed to push some brawlers to 1k in solos though. I also team quite often, because at high trophies there is no choice: team, or be teamed on. But I #8217;m slowly getting sick of this. So here are my ideas on how to somewhat stop it. Tell me which one is the best. 1: Remove extra life starpower. 8-bit is by far the best solo brawler, and that is for one reason. A stupid starpower that lets him respawn. Ever since it came out I hated it. It just shouldn #8217;t be possible to respawn in a mode where you have one life, and the point of the mode is to not die. Also 8-bit isn #8217;t really good in the meta rn, becuz if he gets buffed, he will be SSS tier in solo. If extra life gets removed, he will be less used in solo showdown, and can be buffed in other ways to be better in 3v3. Also 8-bits are the most known for mass teaming solo, so no extra life = no 8-bit in solo = less teaming. 2: Storm Surge (like in Fortnite). Storm Surge is a modifier that would be active on certain maps, or be completely active at higher trophies. What this does is that you need to deal a certain amount of damage to enemies, otherwise the game will just kill you. I know this isn #8217;t how solo is supposed to be played, but I #8217;m not saying it should be active 24/7. But I can hear you say: the teamers will hit eachother to deal damage but won #8217;t kill eachother! Yes I have a solution for this. I #8217;d like to make it so if storm surge is active, you need to KILL at least one brawler in a certain amount of time. This will make matches go a lot faster and will make players not want to team. It could also potentially solve camping, which is also hated. 3: Auto Fire. This is a very simple concept. Auto fire is if you are close to an enemy for more than 30 sec without attacking them, your brawler will automatically attack that person you #8217;re teaming with. You can #8217;t stop it in any way, but you could keep your distance from the person you #8217;re teaming with. If you shoot them normally auto fire won #8217;t activate. But even if you keep your distance from your teaming ally, the gas will eventually push you near him, making auto fire activate. 4: Solo Showdown Overhaul. This is a pretty big thing to do, so don #8217;t expect supercell to do this. Solo Showdown gets removed. Duo Showdown not, becuz there are no problems with it. Solo SD becomes Brawl Arena. The concept of Brawl Arena: It is basically a 1v1 Arena, where you battle it out with the identical brawlers, to prove your skills with that brawler. How it works is you click the mode, then you select your brawler that you want to 1v1 with, and based on your Arena Points (you gain Arena Points by winning 1v1s but also lose Arena Points if you lose 1v1s.) So everyone starts from scratch. You can see Arena Point as a special kind of trophies. It will also show on your profile screen how many Arena Points you have. There are also Arena Ranks, just like normal ranks. These will show on your brawler, just like the normal rank. You gain them by earning Arena Points. Now here is how it is played. You get thrown into a small Solo SD map, based on the current map rotation. You and the enemy both have 3 lives. If you kill the enemy 3 times you win, and vice versa. The higher in Arena Points you get, the less you win but the more you lose. Just like with normal trophies. I #8217;d like to see this added because there is no real way of proving your skills with a brawler in 1v1s. We will finally be able to settle who the best Mortis or Dyna or whatever is. If you find a spelling mistake don #8217;t get mad at me, English isn #8217;t my first language. u/subject8435.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quick explanation on how to do this: First, get the gems with brock (btw you need gadget). Then aim your super as far as you can into the corner. Only fire one rocket by immediately using your gadget to cancel your super. Then use another gadget to jump into the hole.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good job. Here are some tips: Try to use panes instead of blocks to make windows look better. Try to add depth into your walls, by putting the corner pillars one block to the front and making some details with slabs and stairs. Also for the roof: try to not make it flat. Try using a mix of slabs, stairs and full blocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All I want is just a Surge and Gale Nerf. They #8217;re is way too op and being p2w brawlers is making it even worse. Surge: Damage: Decreased to at least 1260 (same as mortis), because the split on the max stage does extra damage. Super: Hits required: for 1st upgrade 3 hits, 2nd 4 hits, and 3rd 5 hits. This will make it harder to get to the op stage, but easier for the other ones. Super change: Super doesn #8217;t knock back and deal damage anymore. It is a passive ability like a poco super. Super doesn #8217;t get charged if at maxed stage. This will prevent him from infinite jumping that made him invincible for a second. Gadget: Surge can now only tp to open areas, he can #8217;t go through walls. Use amount stays the same. Gale: Damage decreased by 20%. Idk how to calculate this. Reload speed increased by 0,2 sec. Gadget: The jumppad has a lifetime of 15 sec, just like in clash royale buildings have a certain lifetime. Uses from 2- gt;3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. No. No. So if a mortis or tank, or any close range brawler finally catches up to him, he can just stand there, and attack while getting less damaged. Horrible idea and it doesn #8217;t belong in sandy #8217;s kit. A weaker version of the crow gadget but with infinite uses. No thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You know clan games just ended, and I already had a book of everything from the goldpass.

But when I want to finish my king it only shows the book of heroes icon, while I don #8217;t want to use that one cuz I don #8217;t have a 2nd one. Is there some way to use the book of everything on my king if I have the book of heroes?

    <TEXT>As a solo main with two 1k #8217;s in solo I can say that it #8217;s not at 650. You can push to 750 with barely any problems facing teaming, but above 800 is where it starts. There also are 2 types of teaming: the noob teaming, where just 2 ppl team up and just spin for fun and maybe kill one person. The second one is the competitive teaming. People team in the middle as soon as they see eachother and focus on killing off non teamers. Also they charge eachothers supers and have no mercy in backstabbing when needed.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-30 17:57:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Curveball is the most horrible starpower in the game. The design of the starpower is just completely not fitting the game. These starpowers that take away aiming skill are the worst, and should not be in the game. It is unpredictable and almost impossible to dodge. Can we please have it removed because it is an unfair advantage for the opponent to use an aim-compensating starpower. Same goes for overgrowth, but that isn #8217;t so hard to dodge and not every shot has the larger radius. Spike #8217;s curveball however compensates every shot for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1k Mortis here. Mortis thrives on maps with lots of walls, because of throwers, and sometimes on maps with bushes (but not too much cuz then there will be tanks). Here are some good bounty and gem grab (mortis his best modes) maps: Gem grab: Hard Rock Mine, Merch Fort, Undermine, cuz you have the sides where you can sneak up on the opponent, as the element of surprise is one Mortis is strengths. And Snake Shop cuz of the mass thrower use. Bounty: Excel  amp; Layer Cake are probably the best, cuz of the throwers that are used, but all the other maps besides Snake Prairie are decent for Mortis. And do not play siege unless you know that there will be more than 1 thrower on the enemy team. Mortis can #8217;t defend robots. I #8217;m not gonna talk about bb cuz idk how skilled you are at dribbling and that kind of stuff. You can also play solo sd on cavern churn or skull creek, cuz there are lots of throwers there. Also stormy plains is good for Mortis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is this even a suggestion at this point? I feel like this is more of a requirement. Why can #8217;t we see if someone has a gadget or not? I #8217;d like to know if a crow has the stupid invincibility shield before I approach him. Just like with starpowers you have that skull-star under your hitbox, gadgets should also have something like that. For example the 4 half circles that pop up when a gadget is used, that could become permanent so we can know if someone has a gadget or not. I #8217;m not gonna commit suicide just to find out that the crow had the stupid shield gadget. This is especially important in solo showdown, where if you mess up you will straight up lose. With starpowered enemies you can almost always expect a gadget, but when an enemy doesn #8217;t have a maxed brawler you would think they don #8217;t have the gadget aswell. And I #8217;m not gonna learn all the level 7 health amounts to know if someone has a gadget or not, that is just a waste of time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I played solos for the biggest part. Unfortunately, yes I teamed quite often. But bibi is really good in end game in solos (the moment when everyone starts to backstab eachother) cuz you can knock people away from yourself and into the gas. Also I really advice you to have the gadget and shield starpower, mainly the gadget is very important in end game situations cuz you can juggernaut some health while staying in the gas for a bit. Also the shield is useful when you are in the endgame cuz it protects you for 30% so the gas only deals 700 damage per second, paired with a gadget it is only 100 damage for 4 seconds, which can be crucial to secure a top 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pam isn #8217;t that bad to max out though, and back in the day when robo rumble was the best ticketed event for progression, she was even better. I maxed out pam first, because she was and probably still is the best brawler for ticketed events (except big game). Robo rumble was really important for f2p players back in the day cuz it gave 6 boxes per 20 tickets so I maxed her out. Helped me out a lot. Don #8217;t know if she is still that imporant though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I understand you. I #8217;m just saying that i #8217;d recommend keeping either pam/8bit/jessie at least lvl 8 so you can use them in ticketed events properly as they are the top 3. However now this isn #8217;t important anymore cuz the modes are free so you can try all you want.</TEXT>
