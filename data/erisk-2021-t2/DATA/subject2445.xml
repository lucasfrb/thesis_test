    <TEXT>First off, I have been with windows phone since 2010 and continue to promote the UI to all my friends and family and like having Cortana as a search engine with Bing, but good night I had to adjust the search settings real high. I can see why people like Bing for porn searches. Just searching "girl waving" resulted in several hard core porn images. Can't have people searching for images of pizza and have god knows what come back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm in my second week of Max 30 and I really dig it. I've done two rounds of Insanity about 2 years ago and have bounced around with various BB programs (P90x, X2, Body Beast). I've completed several OCRs and love doing them, including 2 tough mudders. Recently I've been doing the daily workouts sent by Spartan Race. I've loved them because they were usually random and pushes my limits, but lately its been the same thing over and over. So I thought id try Max 30...just because. I love the pacing and the variety but what I love best is the body weight movements. Insanity was really missing that for me and now I have it. I love working out each day again. Boom!!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a long time WP user. The Focus was my first smartphone and I've only used WP and love them. I'm currently on a 635 and it's meh. I see the 640 is at WalMart for less than $100 but I really don't like spending money. I got a 920 at release but really considered an 820. Really at this point I just need a front facing camera. Should I spend the extra money and get the 640, or $40 and get a 820 off eBay? Thanks. Edit: I went to WalMart and they had 10! I bought one and I can't wait to get my hands on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, and iOS as well. It's not the huge apps, it's the little ones that we can't get. I'm talking about restaurant/store apps that seem trivial but annoying that I can't get. I really want the McDonald's app just because it's cool to have. I have kids and even though I don't like fast food, they sure do. I can't always haven't wife as a smart phone chaperone (iOS) and the possibility of getting these"white noise" apps is big for me. Dunno, just my $.02 Edit: For me it's about opening doors where they haven't even existed before. I use a behavior management app in my classroom. It is a start up and they have an Android and iOS app. When asked why no WP app i was told no plans would be made due to market size. They won't comment on uni apps either. So, if I can side load this thing to have on my phone I would jump on that in a heartbeat. I love WP but if the companies won't make the app for whatever reason, what is the harm of getting my hands on it in other means?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, this might be skeevy. If so, call me out for it. I really don't want to pay $15 to park for an event I'm already paying $100 to do. If you purchased a parking pass for a recent event, could you throw a pic of the parking pass up here so I can print it off and attempt to skirt around the cost? I'll own up if they call me out for it, but I just really don't want to pay that much. I know I'm cheap, and I can sleep tonight knowing that. Thanks.</TEXT>

I went back to 8.1 and while I totally miss 10 I think I'll hold off for rtm on this phone. I still have the preview on my 635. Has anyone else had this issue?

    <TEXT>Hey all! We all know how easily the screens on v1 and the sides peel, and to combat this I have seen many different protectors online for sale. I happen to be very, very cheap and don't want to pay that if I can do something better myself. I have a roll of clear gorilla tape I used for an older phone of mine and thought id give it try on this thing. I used a single piece and wrapped around the whole band, cutting out slots for the buttons and the charging plate underneath. I used an exact knife for clean cuts (to prevent chafing). Been on for about a month now and it looks great. The tape is scuffed but still 100% usable and there is zero ill effect on the touch feel and charging plate. http://i.imgur.com/K92WX4i.jpg</TEXT>

I thought I read that the bands are a regular 26mm width and that some people were swapping out with typical bands. I ask because I want a blaze but I've gotten really odd rashes from fitness bands in the past and wondered if I could just slap my own band on it. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have completed in 3 TM over the past three years, and even got my 60+ year old dad to do them with me. I love them but this year they decided to move our location to 4.5 hours away with nothing else closer. I'm saddened that I can't go that far for an event, and upset that TM made this decision to leave the entire St. Louis area high and dry. I can't justify driving 4 hours one way, running in the event, then driving back. And staying somewhere doesn't work with the expense of the event plus gas and food already figured in. I have been getting a bunch of "$50 off" emails from TM and I can't decide if it's because they just want my money or if they are truly having trouble selling the even out, something that didn't happen in STL the past 4 years. What say you all? Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question: Why is President Trump looking for a pass here?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-07 12:28:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Words matter, as they should but Mr. Trump is attempting to skate this responsibility with the travel ban. As adults we learn early on that HOW we say things means as much or more than WHAT we say. Take in reference the travel ban: the White house initially called it a Muslim ban, which immediately registers as a religious ban to almost any reasonable person listening to not only his words but how they were delivered. Some people rejoiced while others were in dismay. It seems only after the initial blowback did the WH attempt to walk back the comments and say thst it was not a Muslim ban but a travel ban from specific countries. They are now attempting to vilify those arguing against them on this as being overly sensitive. Why should the most powerful person in the world get a free pass at communication mistakes? Why at this point should not only the US but the world accept the "he's an outsider, he isn't so good with the words" excuse any longer? Shouldn't the president be held to a higher standard than a 5 years old? Why shouldn't the WH take care hit on this travel ban ares a learning lesson? By the way, watching Meet THE Press this weekend made me realize that people on both sides is the aisle agree with some of these Executive orders, but can't stand the way they are being communicated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, new here been lurking for a while. I just started LG about three weeks ago after hearing a local fitness raidio host talk for weeks about IF being good for people with hypothyroidism, which I am one of. I've tried several diets and exercise regimens over the past ten years but my body still looks about the same. I'm pretty active and have completed several 10k mud runs. Anyway, I looked into IF and loved the idea. I saw that Tery Crews foes it and watched a video of him talking about it and using cocunut oil when fasting if he's just starving. I've been putting about a tbsp in my coffee during this time and just today read the label: each tbsp has 130 calories...oops. Guess I'll he stopping that! I also do Body Beast in the mornings, any thoughts with that? I stick to about 1700 calories a day as well.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any raspberry Pi ideas for an old Asus tablets?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-15 18:40:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>Please forgive me if this is against the rules, but I don't know how else to approach this issue... As the title suggests, I have 3 Asus tablets (https://www.asus.com/us/Tablets/ASUS_MeMO_Pad/) that I got for my classroom a few years ago. These are locked with jellybean and I haven't even used them at all this year. I have gotten into the Raspberry Pi culture the last few months and have built a Retropie and a Magic Mirror. I don't have much other experience in coding and electronics but the simplicity of the Raspberries has sparked my interest in this field. I drove to the closest Microcenter just to buy a Zero and a Zero W but I'm looking forward to working with them as well. So, in your opinion, what projects are possible to use with these old tablets? Maybe just the screens or the cases...maybe a wireless camera with the tablet as a dedicated monitor?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a special education teacher in Illinois and I am requesting laptops for my students. I am attaching a link to my DonorsChoose project page. As I type this I am still in need of about $350 to get the remaining funds covered. I am only requesting these laptops because my students honestly need them. I teach students with an Autism Spectrum disorder and I have them use computers as tools as well as for entertainment. I currently have 7 laptops that I have salvaged that they use. These computers need constant care and crash most every day. On two I them I have installed Inbuntu just to have a working computer station, and even then they crash often. Any amount helps, even $1. I have asked for help from my family and friends as well as the students parents. My district doesn't have the funding to get my students these laptops so that is why i'm reaching out here. Thank you for your consideration. https://www.donorschoose.org/project/chromebooks-for-autism-awareness/2744631/?rf=link-siteshare-2017-08-teacher-teacher_2117186 amp;challengeid=340369</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, I got a desktop given to me with a bad os on it so I clean installed Ubuntu from an install disk I got a few years ago. Turns out the version is 16.10 (yakkety yak) and it appears that due to being at eol I can't download and install programs properly anymore. I have tried upgrading using the upgrade tool and command lines but I just can't upgrade it... I have tried making USB drives in both windows using the Rufus tool and on my Ubuntu computer using the install disk tool. I set the computer to boot from the USB but I steady get "no os found on drive" or it just loads the OS on the computer. I never get the option to install. This is driving me bonkers because I've installed Ubuntu on other machines though I still consider myself a Linux novice. Can anyone helpe out here? Should I just make an install disk instead of a USB? The computer is a lenovo think center made in 2015. Thanks. And I'll answer any question y'all have about this. I just want this stupid thing to work.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-03-09 15:48:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Imgur share: https://imgur.com/a/Cw3Nr I am creating a walk-in shower in our master bath, having removed a fiberglass insert. I used 1/2" hardibacker and as you can see have butted it up against the pre-existing drywall which has been previously plastered. There is a height difference between the two of about 1/8" and a contracting buddy suggested I use joint compound to feather out the difference until it's no longer noticeable. As you can see I applied a first coat but the difference is still highly noticeable and I'm worried that going this route would use an incredible amount of joint compound. Am I going the right way with this and should just keep adding joint compound out until it's gone, or is there a completely different angle that I should take? I have completed most of the work for the shower but will hire a tiler to complete this part of the job. We are going to be using long tile on the wall from the shower to the end of the wall and I want to ensure that the tiler has a good substrate to work with. I've seen a number of suggestions online and I'm just unsure of what to do here. The gap in the ceiling was where a partition was used and we have thus removed. I will be filling in the gap this weekend with the hardiboard that I have remaining.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello all, I am a middle school teacher of a cross-cat/autism classroom. I have been in this position for 8 years now and I've always considered myself successful for these kids. Admin from all the districts I serve (I work for a co-op who houses students the districts cannot serve) have heaped praise on my teaching style and ability but this year I've felt lost...kinda like I am just spinning my wheels and it's mostly over academics.  #8203; My class is basically designed as a reset for the students who have been unsuccessful in their home districts. I provide a strict, structured environment designed for their success. Managing behavior is the main key of the classroom but I also strive for a first-class academic life for them as well. I've tried to align my subjects to state standards, and while I feel I've done a good job I am also worried that I could get pulled in front of a review board and decimated. Why this comes to mind I don't know, but it is...  #8203; My coop does not provide actual curriculum for us; we are expected to kinda piece it together ourselves which is really what these kids need; they aren't all ready for basal readers and worksheets daily. But I feel there can be a middle ground somewhere. Have any of you found guidance on how to prepare academics for high functioning autistic kids? This year is basically done but I want to look towards next year. Thanks in advance.  #8203; Bigdaddy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a grumpy guy overall and people say I have RBF, so that may sway my opinion here. I've never had a good relationship with the admin at my job. I've been here for 10 years and there has always been friction. To be fair I've seen them take any issue or problem and turn it into a big affair. I've come to them in earnest and have had that turned against me over the years. I am now a union rep and I see them actively trying to both undermine what I'm doing with my members as well as harass me in my current position. I know they have moles because any time I tell my teachers something Amin are coming back within a few days to confront me over the statements. I see people comment they laugh and have a good time with admin and are friends outside of school. I just cant see it and it confuses me. Also, I've seen teachers in my org become admin and they fold right into the mold, so I dont trust them either. So, am I nuts, can you really get along with admin? I teach in IL and we have a super strong union presence, if that helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in a rural area and we get mice indoors when it gets cold, as it is now. Never in the car until this year. I stopped at work and heard skittering above my head, literally like a horror film where there is a noise above the hero and he is tracing it with his head. This thing is in my headliner and I get to drop it tonight to release him. I need to get it out because I'm worried he will start nibbling wires and then I'm a fucked duck. Also, I need to use traps in the garage now I guess.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Covid-19 and lodge work</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-13 11:29:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, In December I joined this group to announce I was about to become the wm of my lodge. I've loved doing it but now I feel like I'm being tested with this virus. I am in illinois and right now the virus is spreading like wild fire and I'm seeing state and local groups respond by limiting gatherings of people. This virus spreads by human contact and in lodge we touch all kinds of surfaces and shaking hands is almost required. I'm also a teacher and the state is requiring all teachers to prep for a potential shut down to prevent the spread any further. My lodge is made of men considerably older than I am, and most have health issues, and almost enough are all smokers. I'm worried about their potential health if they should get the virus. My own father is the secy of the lodge and is almost 70 himself. I know that if I get dispensation to close lodge the old guys will riot becasue they are so stubborn, and let's face it, our president and conservative news is telling them it's no big deal. I fully plan to call our GL today and inquire of any other lodges down south have requested this and how to go about setting it in motion. If the schools are canceled I'm 100% calling any lodge activity off. I would love to deep clean the lodge prior to our next stated but it would be just me and as soon as the rods, gavels, chairs and any hard surface are touched ots contaminated. What are any of your thoughts on this? Thank God it's been taken out of my hands. The GL has declared all lodges must cease any activities, official or special until May 1. Whew</TEXT>

Our state board has already stated that e learning or distant learning will be required but how do we enforce that? There is currently no infrastructure set up for this. My take: we shjt it all down, take the grades from quarter 3 and make them final grades for the year. Everyone gets a pass. No standardized testing for the next 2 years because these kids are going to be behind. I'm a K-8 teacher so I'm speaking in those terms. Nor sure about high school.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've done P90x several times over the past 10 years. So much so I downloaded the audio tracks so I could do it at the gym a few years ago. I started another round thos past december after doing strong lifts for about a year. I'm iny final phase now and I recently discovered P90x3 thanks to a friend letting us use their BOD account. I gotta say I love MMX to replace Kenpo, it's a much better workout imo. I tried the yoga but I didnt like it as much as the fountain of youth yoga he put on YouTube some years ago. I'm glad I found it on BOD because its perfect. Anyway, short post but I wanted to share my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the big difference is the time commitment. Over 90 mins for yoga is extreme. I think 60 mins is right on point, since the yoga studios I've attended are structured for hour long sessions. I think the pacing is slightly better as well. Tony seems to rely on vinyasa routines for the entirety of x yoga. You know, this solely my opinion and I'm no yoga expert so take that for a grain of salt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel that Tony really wanted to prove he could do yoga in p90x and made it overly tough to do so. I dont like almost any of the x2 DVDs (there's my age showing) except the yoga. X3 yoga is like x1 where its tough for the sale of being tough. Still my favorite is the fountain of youth yoga that was a YouTube exclusive, which is now on BOD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have found that pacing is important for some of the DVDs but not all. The resistence days (chest/back, biceps, shoulder) dont require watching However the speed days like plyo, kenpo and I'd even say CST you should follow because the pacing can be important. That said I ripped the audio years ago so i wouldn't be constrained to a room with a TV.</TEXT>

Then she lies about it almost leading her son to become a hit man over it. Wendy is a shitty person plain and simple.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I've seen is that Tony gets new buzzwords and makes a whole new workout around them. Think about how goofy P90x2 was with the balance balls, and the thing about elongate in x3 is just as weird. I mean I dont take it serious and as long as I don't get hurt at least I'm moving. Still, P90x is a fuckong awesome workout and stands the test of time so far. No wacky terms, no craziness just working out. Liift4 is like that for me. Jist picking up heavy things and putting them back down. Don't get me wrong, I get that exercise people have to evolve or their shit gets stale. But I would love to see Tony remake P90x now that hes a little older and see how he does. I also love the 1 on 1 workouts but I cant keep up...yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm a teacher and have been waking up at 430 to workout for thepast 4 years. Once this covid-19 hit and the schools closed I found it next to impossible to walw up esel6 because I knee I didnt have to get dressed in a certain time. So I spent the first month of the shutdown rolling around my bed until 730 or so. But I never stopped setting my alarm. Every morning my watch vibrates me awake at 530, if I choose to roll around so be it bit I always set the alarm. Well, I can feel my body getting used to this routine again becasue I'm starting to wake up on time again. So, never give up and keep setting that alarm. This is just my anecdotal evidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So this will be buried,but if it isnt a fake video you have John Roberts, a Fox News reporter commenting on a study that appears to be downplaying the outbreaks which tracks with Fox News' opinions on the virus. Everyone can say that they heard a study say x, it doesn't make it true or not. Sources are important and it seems that most of you either dont care or dont know who is talking in this video. But I agree with another poster here that the video is probably fake because I haven't seen this exact footage anywhere but this guy's screen. Be doubtful if you cant replicate the results.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a '77 caprice and god damn i loved that car. Had a 350 in it and I had a 350 tranny put in as well. It was a piece of shit but I learned how to work really work on cars with that thing and how to install radios amd subwoofers. Going to the junk yards for parts was the best; there was always parts available and I could just be a kid in candy store. Back in 1996 when I first got my license gas was $.96/gal but even then I knew the car was a guzzler. I calculated via odometer that the car got between 9-11 mpg. I literally couldn't drive it now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I listened to a podcast today ask the same question. Their theory is that while in the park the hosts were programmed to fall and die when shot by a guest. You can't have zombie hosts chasing after guests. Once in the real world they no longer have that programmed in so can do whatever. I still think they are in Futureworld and none of this matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so I've avoided asking for help because...reasons. But ive been skunked for about a year now, no matter what I throw they wont bite. I had some honey holes I knew bass like to hang around but those dried up last year. I've lived on this semi private lake in Illinois for about 4 years now and 2019-20 have been really bad for me. Pretty much only myself and a neighbor fish it. I'm not giving up because I know I know how to fish but catching nothing really saps my confidence here. Neighbor kids catch bluegill, I've caught a shit ton of cat using noodles but bass for me have just evaporated and it doesn't make sense. I have a fish finder but I need to buy a transducer for it, but how much would that help? Any advice here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We think we have a good proposal that the management board will accept as well as our members. I've been at my coop for many years now and have been co president for the past two. This was my first contact negotiation and I loved it. In feb we were in a very strong position due to finances finally being in order on my state, for the first time since like 2014. We were set to make management pay. But then the virus came and blew up budgets left and right and we had to come back down to earth a bit. We did virtual negotiation meetings which was weird amd all on we had about 10 hours in. I dont feel great but we worked hard and the only other option would be to picket and I dont think our members have it in them right now. Maybe in a few years... we got them to give us some extra sick time as well which is good for the members.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need help with replacing rear wheel</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-14 00:45:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Short time lurker, first time poster here. I have an older 10 speed bike, an AMF that I really like. I'm a casual rider so this bike does me well. Last year I broke a few spokes and the rear wheel bent pretty badly. I decided to buy a new wheel but now I'm really lost. I found my old wheel hub is a uniglide hub and my new wheel does not appear to be so. It looks like one in the link here: [https://www.modernbike.com/product-2126251122](https://www.modernbike.com/product-2126251122) I'm not opposed to buying a new cassette/freewheel but I have no idea what to get. When I look at the hubs online they don't look like they will fit right on without an additional tool. Will this freewheel bolt right on or do I need something else? [https://www.modernbike.com/product-2126184000](https://www.modernbike.com/product-2126184000) Also, could a ruub like me transfer over the old hub to the new wheel without ruining both wheels? Thanks. All I want to do is ride my bike again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did the program and honestly didnt enjoy it. I never felt that I could keep up with Sagi and the goons on screen. And that caused me to push harder eventually hurting myself. I shortly thereafter found the 5x5 lifting program and then Wendlers lifting programs. I excelled with those two over the span of two years. Actual lifting programs designed to get you functionally stronger are far superior, in my opinion. BB seems designed to help competitors get a good tone before a contest but not to help dad BOD guys get really strong. If you stick it out find a way to do some real cardio, you will need it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I didnt get hired my first year either. I didnt let it get me down and I subbed the entire year. I dedicated myself to making as many connections as possible and subbed in over 40 districts across 2 counties. I made business cards and left notes and a card at every room I subbed in. I found spec ed to be amazing and ended up subbing in a lot of those rooms. I got a long term sub position at the end year and found a college that I could earn my sped endorsement over the summer. I've been teaching in sped since then (10 years) and I've never looked back. Yes I didn't make any money that year but I stayed busy and made friends along the way. The beginning of the year was slow but by the 2nd quarter I was working 4 days a week any by Thanksgiving I was scheduing weeks out with teachers. If i didnt sub that year I wouldn't have found sped and wouldn't have started my career at all. Dont give up.</TEXT>

We had a friend neighbor come over and play as well so that helped the fun level. I know I made a ton of errors as DM but it didnt matter because when we were all done they all asked to play again. Winning! The campaign lasted just over 2 hours and I only had them battle a handful of times. I'm still really nervous about battling but it sidnt matter in the long run. I'm loving this game already.</TEXT>

I built my daughter a gymnastics bar so I bought a 2x6 for this project. I have engineered I beams so I needed to bolster the support using 2x6 on the back sides and 1x4 boards behind the main board. I used my trusty standard bar for the pull up bar and I gotta tell ya its working great! I am a bigger guy (230+ lbs) so pullups do not come easy for me but I knocked out more today than I have recently using the door bar. I guess I can use that as a push up bar now!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So a few weeks ago I shared my journey about my bike. I paid $30 for this 10 speed about 4 years ago and worked great up to this year. The rear wheel lost spokes and became bent. I then began learning about gears the hard way. I bought the wheel and decided on a single speed because it looks cleaner and I like the idea of pedaling harder. I took it on a 5 mile ride yesterday and it worked great. I actually had a chain left over from a childs mountain bike so I didn't even have to modify the chain, save from breaking to install on my bike. This conversion cost me less than $75, putting the cost of this bike to just over $100. I'm an ultra casual rider and dont need anything close to extravagant, just something to spend some time with the kids on.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-02 23:14:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all, I posted recently about not having much (any) luck fishing my semi-private lake. It's a 30 acre lake with a vibrant ecology. I've lived here for 3 years now with prior success, pulling out 3-5 pounders on the regular. I never got skunked once the weather warmed up.... Which leads me to this year. I've caught not one bass, not even a nibble. The catfish are super active as are the carp but zero bass. What I have noticed for the first time is a TON of shad in the lake, to the point where they are jumping out constantly. My fishfinder shows large schools with the occasional bass underneath but they won't bite anything thrown at them. My theory is that this past winter was different than I've experienced here: we didnt have a deep freeze this year. Could this have helped the shad shleter better and cause the population to explode? Also we didnt have a flick of pelican come in the early spring this year. They are usually here for about a month and eat a shit ton of shad. They skipped our area this year which is a bummer cuzz they are hoot to watch hunt. Im running out of ideas here. I've spent more on lures this year than in my entire life. I have learned multiple techniques and use the finder on the regular. The</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meh, I'd recommend finding a support group on social media before signing up with a "coach". With the forum/group connection you get a whole community who have been there before and can provide feeback/give support if you need it. With a "coach" you are getting someone who, while could be motivated by altruistic means is guided by the goal of getting you to continue using them after your trial period or to purchase BB supplies. A handful of years ago I was involved in a bb support group on facebook and it was amazing. Wed check in daily and let the group know how we were doing. It wasn't always exercise related, either. I grew to know these people as friends and it never cost me a dime.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>St. Louis Opens today</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-22 17:21:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this week is for members and season pass holders only. I fall into the latter category (we've never found a way to justify buying memberships). I found the reservation system to be super easy to use. When we first got to the park we had to show the reservation made at the parking lot which wss cool. Then at the security check we had to show our masks then walk through a cooled tent where our temps were taken seamlessly then we were in the park. The experience has been good so far. Every car is cleaned between rides and they every other row is empty as well. With the social distancing being what it is there are very few people here ak wait times are minimal. I do feel as safe as possible considering the pandemic is still in swing but I applaud SF for their protocols. Everyone is wearing masks and nobody is making a fool of themselves. Now, we will see next week when ots open to daily ticket holders. There are tons of employees running around ensuring compliance so I'm sure itll be ok. I do have my 3 kids with me and feel ok with them here. Oh yea, if you have a meal pass order on the app. It's super easy and you dknt have to wait in line. They also have a shit ton of sanitizer around the park, so that's great as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure of the SF policy in Texas, where apparently the gov has decided "eff it, figure it out on your own", but in MO at SFSL there is limited capacity total for the park. This limits the amount of people allowed in the park, thus shortening ride lines. I will say that the cleaning procedures for the rides mean that you still have to wait for the employees to clean, so there's that. But overall I wouldn't worry about ride times due to not having many people in the park at one time. Reserve the very first spot you can.</TEXT>

You also need a bench that can reposition for different moves as well as a pull up bar or bands. I just gave up and about a year later we had a gym membership amd I tried it again. I could actually keep up with a full barrage of weights at my disposal. That said, I wouldn't recommend BB because it isnt really a strength program, more of a body building competition prep program. There isnt enough progression to get strong and keep it. That's just my .02 If you have basic weights you can do the 5x5 or wendler programs to get real functional strength</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, so I've posted here multiple about my park and overall it's always good. I went the day they opened this year and I applaud the company's efforts to keep us safe while in the park. The employees are underpaid and I'm sure underappreciated but are doing their best. I like the park as it's only about 40 away from where I have lived my whole life and it just feels like home to me. So when we went opening week it was for members and season pass homers only. We are season pass holders and thus went. I went twice that week and it was amazing. Everyone wearing masks and being respectful. I had a feeling it was going to change once daily ticket holders could come and I felt that was probably due to having money sunken in already and just wanting to be there vs buying a ticket once and bring done. We didn't go the past several weeks because we've been busy but I did take the kids today and I can tell you I feel vindicated in my assumption. Most were still wearing masks but overall there was a large amount of people refusing or not wearing them correctly. Social distancing was limited but I kept the kids close to me. The employees seemed more stressed and thus I dont feel they were cleaning the rides as well as they once were. I made the decision to not take the kids back again this year because it's obvious now safety has taken a backseat at my park. This sucks and I am awaiting the survey I've been getting after each trip.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same experience in st louis. During the first week it was pass holders only and the experience was amazing. Very few people and rides were wiped down after every use. Wbeetone wore masks and didnt see anyone refusing. I actually felt safe. We went back twice that week. Fast forward to a few weeks ago when it was open season. Jesus H it was a huge mess. Guests everywhere not wearing masks, and I didn't see a single ride being cleaned between uses. I complained to management and was told I must have seen something different because every ride was cleaned. It was bananas. I dont think I'll go back this season or until a vaccine is in place. Closely SF doesnt truly care about their customers or staff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bro, even this show is whitewashing just how horrible it was to be a black person in Jim Crow time. Find some comfort in your ignorance but understand it is indeed ignorance. Black people literally put lives on the line just by living their lives after 1954. And they still are to this day. You think cops just started indiscriminately shooting black people? That shit is super engrained in their psyches due to decades and decades of systemic racism. This shitbis just pulling back the covers and giving young people permission to be appalled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom is one. She has pushed away all of her kids (I'm 39) over trump. She depends him like he is god and we are all godless because we wont do the same. I'm a staunch lib who shebwont forgive for marching in a BLM protest and my poor sister has the worst case for daring to love another woman. Its truly awful what these people will do for a guy who hates them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My wife was thinking it would benefit trump because the never trumpers can now shift their vote to protect them lives. I think it'll embolden the same and dem voters by making sure we can pack the courts if they cramp in another crazy right judge. Just another example of the right playing the long game over the last 50 years. We need to do the same now</TEXT>
