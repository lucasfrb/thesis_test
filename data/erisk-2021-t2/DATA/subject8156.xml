    <TEXT>In my opinion, I find items like Leo and Thunder Thighs run ruining  #8212; only if I have flight, though. I just find the a huge advantage of flight is being able to use rocks and the like as cover from enemies + projectiles, but with the two aforementioned items, you pull a Space Invaders and destroy your own cover.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to assume that in this scenario, the roles are flipped, to a sense. The DR1 cast have become the remnants of despair and the surviving SDR2 cast members join the Future Foundation. In this scenario, Nanami is a human and not an AI. **Kibougamine Academy:** **First case:** Monokuma shows the SDR2 cast videos of their families and friends. Hinata is shocked by the images he sees, but not so enough to commit murder. Komaeda is unaffected. Tanaka is unsettled by what he sees, but hides behind his persona. Nidai is confused by the images. Kuzuryuu acts tough but is in actuality very disturbed. Souda is just a little bitch as usual and denies the whole thing. Hanamura hysterically breaks down. Twogami likely is shown nothing, as nothing about him as known, he puts on a Togami-esque facade and says things Togami would say. Nanami is saddened but quickly overcomes this. Sonia is in disbelief. Owari is confused, like Nidai. Tsumiki breaks down into tears, but deep down doesn't truly care. Mioda is surprised. Saionji at first is shown images for her grandparents, to which she merely laughs at, but when shown pictures of her father, she runs away and locks herself in her room. Koizumi is taken aback and tries her best to remain strong, but is affected strongly by the images of her mother. Pekoyama is unaffected, as she only cares for Kuzuryuu. *Murder scenario one:* This is the most likely scenario. **Hanamura** goes crazy seeing what happened to his family's diner and attempts to murder someone to try and save his beloved momma. He lures someone gullible enough to meet him in privacy, and kills them. I would say either Mioda, Owari, Souda or Sonia are all likely victims. The most likely is **Owari**, in my opinion. *Murder scenario two:* Kuzuryuu is shown what he was shown in the second trial in SDR2. He consults **Pekoyama** and she acts upon this and attacks whoever is unlucky enough to be nearby. **Second case:** Monokuma threatens to reveal the cast's secrets to the world. Hinata's secret is that he does not possess a talent. He tells everyone and Komaeda loses it. Komaeda, again, is unaffected by the motive. Tanaka is ashamed of his secret. Nidai laughs at his old memories. Kuzuryuu and Pekoyama share a secret, Kuzuryuu does not want his secret known. Souda acts like the little bitch he is, and runs away crying. Twogami does not know how to deal with the fact his identity might be compromised, and hides until the trial begins. Nanami is unaffected. Sonia is embarrassed. Tsumiki wishes to willingly share her secret, provided no one hates her for it. Mioda accidentally reveals her secret then and there. Saionji is terrified that people will work out her secret, that would likely crush her bully persona. Koizumi tries to get everyone to reveal their secrets, but ultimately fails. Pekoyama is confused and does not know what to do. None of the SDR2 cast have an overly shameful secret that would be revealed that early on in the game, but I think something along the lines of **Souda** (because he's a little bitch) killing **Koizumi**, because he was scared she would find out his secret somehow and reveal it to everyone. **Third case:** $10 million. I'm sure someone's willing to murder for that. Hinata is the tough MC who don't need no motive blah blah. Komaeda is already rich enough from his dead parents and his lotto tickets and the like. Tanaka laughs at the thought of "Mortal currency." Nidai does not care for the money. Kuzuryuu is rich enough as part of the Yakuza. Twogami sees this motive as the perfect opportunity to act upon. Nanami is tempted, as she can buy as many games as she wants, but not tempted enough to commit murder. Sonia is rich enough. Tsumiki thinks bullies would steal it from her, anyway. Mioda is unaffected. Saionji is uninterested. Pekoyama, like Kuzuryuu, has enough money from the Yakuza. I would say **Twogami** is the murderer here. He sees this as the perfect opportunity to expand upon his imposter lifestyle, and seeing as people believe him to be the heir of the multi-billion Togami family, why would he need money as a motive to murder? Twogami asks someone strong  #8212; **Nidai** to help him in ensuring people won't be corrupted by money, and then betrays him. **Fourth case:** Nanami is the presumed traitor in this game too. She kills someone weak, perhaps **Saionji** as there is no other motive. So far, the survivors are Hinata, Komaeda, Kuzuryuu, Tanaka, Pekoyama, Mioda, Tsumiki and Sonia. I'm going to make up my own motive for the next case, because I can. Weeks go by without a murder, the mastermind, goes crazy and eventually tries to corrupt Komaeda with despair, knowing his love for hope will shine bright. The mastermind tells him the truth about Kamukurza Izuru and Komaeda falls in love with Hinata again. Komaeda begs Hinata to kill him in the name of hope, but Hinata refuses. Eventually, **Komaeda** goes crazy and kills none other than #8230; **Hinata**, himself. From then on, you play as Komaeda, thwart everyone's investigation attempts with your batshit craziness and make people think Kuzuryuu or someone killed him. Congratulations! You killed everyone but Komaeda, way to go. **The first game's survivors are: Komaeda and no one else.**</TEXT>

The one who removed their eye and replaced it with Junko's is obviously Kuzuryuu, as they had the same hair type and colour and Kuzuryuu lost his eye in the simulation too. The one who killed their parents may have been Sonia, as there is a scene where she says she remembered an awful nightmare and wants to go home, as well as the fact they had blonde hair and the mother resembled Sonia. The one who killed people had a hat that looked like Souda's, no other reasoning. So that only leaves Hinata, and why not save the MC's deed for last?")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My own personal theory is that Moody Blues is the manifestation of Abbachio's depression -- just look at the name. It's power is to 'go back in time' (so to speak) as Abbachio so desperately would want to do, (in order to save his partner) but due to the heavy theme of 'fate' in Part 5, Moody Blues only shows you what happened -- 'Fate' doesn't let you change the path it's chosen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, in Japan, all cartoons are considered 'anime', as the Japanese word for cartoon is literally 'animation' (anim #275;shon). However, in the West, I'd personally classify anime as something that is created by a Japanese producer (IE Studio Ghibli), is originally in Japanese (the language) and originally aired on Japanese television/other medium. If it was produced outside of Japan but still meets those three conditions I'd still consider it anime, but I don't know of any produced outside of Japan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I enjoyed it. Got to see some of my beloved characters back in action. One qualm I have is that I feel like they reused a bit too many jokes from the game like Nidai's obsession with shitting and Tsumiki's constant 'accidents.' But being the first episode, I'm perfectly okay with that but I hope more original gags originate before shit hits the fan. The start of the episode leads me to believe that Yukizome is the mastermind after all, and if they're revealing things about each arc that's a really cool idea. The fact that Yukizome mentioned "the last three" while collecting everyone means that the writers were telling us that they're the important ones, and I assumed they would be Hinata, Komaeda and Nanami but it turned out it was Komaeda, Nanami and the SHSL Impostor, which is leading me to think that he's going to play an important role, just like he did in the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Naegi has obviously been framed by the traitor, so the other two in the room aren't going to trust him, unless one of them is the traitor -- and I don't really trust Gekkogahara. [Danganronpa 2](/s "However, the fact she worked on the New World Program, has Monomi on her laptop, we've not heard her voice, looks like Nanami and the fact Nanami isn't just an AI makes me believe that she is the Nanami from Zetsubou-hen") Edit: Actually, after rewatching the OP, I have a bit of a tinfoily theory regarding the deaths shown: [Asahina](http://puu.sh/q5TU9/c8dbddaa33.jpg) and [Yukizume](http://puu.sh/q5TWV/5f3887bbed.jpg), who were both (presumably) killed by the traitor are bleeding with the traditional Danganronpa pink blood. The only two other characters with pink blood in the OP are [Ryouta](http://puu.sh/q5U07/429780b062.jpg) and [Naegi](http://puu.sh/q5U1Y/3156e3665a.jpg) himself. What if in a shocking turn of events, Naegi *is* the (sleeper) traitor and to get out of that situation he is killed by the traitor, or to say, he heeds Munakata's advice and kills himself? It's pretty unlikely, but you never know with Danganronpa...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The word for friend in Farsi is "dost", which isn't used similar to mate/pal. What's often more used is "lala-jaan", meaning something similar to "my dear brother", or "kaka-jaan", "my dear uncle"  #8212; I think the term "my friend" is used because it reflects a similar sense of intimate familiarity to the above phrases, while (to an extent) being more appropriate in Western Society</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did what you're thinking of, the first Sanderson book I read was TFE, and then from there, I moved on to Stormlight. While SA is incredible, I'd honestly recommend completing Mistborn Era 1 first, there are Cosmere intricacies and just the mindblowing Sanderson avalanches that are amazing stand-alones, and not only that, will really enhance SA when you catch little tidbits here and there. If you can hold out, I'd really recommend reading Elantris and Warbreaker too, for the fully phenomenal experience that is the Cosmere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely agree, after reading several reviews on Goodreads and, admittedly, quite literally judging it by its cover (hey, isn't it the job of a cover to attract an audience?) I was excited to read something grimdark; gritty and depressing. The prose is absolutely awful, characters shallow and bland  #8212; they just feel like walking tropes that don't develop; they're unlikable  #8212; the "twists" were without any buildup at all, gratuitous references to rape and violence for seemingly no reason other than for shock or to say "these people are the bad guys" and worst of all, there being no resolution; no closure, but a cliffhanger ending that wraps nothing up. To me, the entire book felt like the author read A Song of Ice and Fire and thought "now it's my turn," which I find rather uninspired.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I fear that you've internalised a lot of bad habits. I'd advise practicing again, because unfortunately a lot of your post-practice is illegible or straight incorrect. *  #12354; the first stroke is too bendy and the third should be overlapping in the top-right corner *  #12356; the first stroke is too angular and is too low *  #12358; the first stroke is a bit too steep *  #12360; the tail/flick on the final stroke is too long *  #12363; the first stroke is too jagged, it should resemble more so a box *  #12365; the third stroke should have a slight hook *  #12367; is a bit lopsided *  #12369; looks good, but I'd advise shortening the first stroke and rounding it off a bit more *  #12373; like  #12365;, give the second stroke a hook *  #12379; make the second stroke a bit longer *  #12383; bring the third and fourth stroke towards the top-right a bit more *  #12388; the bottom should be shorter than the top *  #12390; the top is too long, it should just protrude a bit more than the round bit *  #12395; the hook on the first stroke is too long *  #12396; I'm not sure how to describe this properly, but the right side needs to ascend a bit more before coming down like that *  #12397; with the second stroke, when you begin with the first line then jut down to the next, you should do that on the left side of the first stroke, and the pointy bit should be longer than the start *  #12398; the top shouldn't poke through *  #12399; first stroke's tail is too long, and it should bend outwards a bit more *  #12402; the end should bend down more *  #12411; same as  #12399; *  #12414; the first stroke should be longer than the second *  #12416; the curving bit of the second stroke should happen near the bottom, not the middle, and it should end in an upwards flick *  #12417; the first stroke is a bit too long. make your  #12396; look more like this one *  #12425; the bending bit of the second stroke needs to bend upwards, not downwards *  #12427; the more triangular bit of  #12427; needs to be longer than the curling bit, and make it a bit wider *  #12428; same as  #12397; *  #12429; make it a bit wider *  #12420; looks far too much like  #12379;, look at the stroke order *  #12431; same as  #12397; *  #12435; doesn't need to be so separated, connect the lines a bit more and make the middle bit more rounded</TEXT>
