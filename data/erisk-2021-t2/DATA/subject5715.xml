    <DATE>2019-05-16 06:46:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/ty95irZ Most of us have read about this in books and watched it on Nat geo or discovery TV. Even I had observed couple of times that my saplings always change their direction whenever I flip their pod 180 #176; and make them face opposite to sunlight. So today I decided to record this thing on my old phone just to measure how fast it happens. And it turned out way better than I anticipated. The video clip is SD 480p, 30fps with time lapse interval of 900x(30 second-interval). Phone is Redmi 3s. I started recording at 9:35 AM and stopped at 12:05 so it went on for about 2 hours and 30 mins and I got a 9 sec time-lapse out of it.  #128578;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/HP7RY9X Imgur has a 30 second upload cap so couldn't put up the whole thing and reddit uploader is crap. ** Not a Neem seed but Two The video clip is SD 480p, 30fps with time lapse interval of 1800x(60 second-interval). Phone is Redmi 3s. I started recording at 7:30 AM and stopped at 1:30 AM so it went on for about 19 hours and I got a 36 sec time-lapse out of it. You will observe sudden change in position and a jump cut type thing once in middle that was not an edit. I was just moving the pod around a little bit for a better angle and also the lighting setup was not really professional grade. Took way longer than I anticipated but yeah I am happy with the results  #128522; PS : My previous attempt https://imgur.com/a/ty95irZ This one was trying to capture plants seeking sunlight in the morning</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You don't need to cuss! And this is why asked about title in my previous comment.  gt; **Submission Title** - All links (articles, images or infographics) should contain its original title. You may decide to add the subtitle to the original title. - An original title (and/or subtitle) is the one given by the content creator. - All re-hosted content with a different title would be considered to be a non-original title. For example, if someone clipped a part of an original YouTube video with title X and hosted a new video with title X1 - we consider the new title X1 as a non-original title. - If a submission which has no title, you should make a self post with an accurate description of the content. - No clickbait titles. - It is important to understand that the 'Original Title' rules have been implemented to prevent misinterpretations and distortions of the original content. https://www.reddit.com/r/India/wiki/rules</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The way these people are celebrating open horse trading is revolting and vomit inducing. A party which can't listen to its own party workers and keep its shit together for 5 years is not Horse trading. Scindia's dissent has been public for a while now. Even after that if CM of state and Party high command is busy meditating can't really blame anyone else in this case. Scindia is not just some party worker relatively big name just like Rahul kaam toh dono ka okish he hai.... And the 17 that flew away are different from those who resigned last night. Most probably more new Scindia boys getting cabinet sears</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Last I heard India was a democracy where people voted their leaders. Yaha toh kuch aur chutiyapa chal raha hain! This was bound to happen bhai didn't yoh see the election results of MP (114-109). The margin is so close that BJP only needs few disgruntled MLAs to turn the table no need to even pay them. Kamal nath should have know better this majority is not even that big he really needs to be proactive sorting out difference in party. And the 17 that flew away are different from those who resigned last night. Most probably more new Scindia boys getting cabinet seats I hope Kamal nath proves his worth as "3rd son of Indira" in administration and not just in rioting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Respectfully. I disagree. It is horse-trading. It's backstabbing the people who voted. If you want to defect. Resign and run for elections again. I can understand man! Same can be said for Maharashtra betraying people who voted based on a pre poll alliance. But i am not complaining the game has always been this way. Only end goal is to form government for them. From their pov our work is only till voting we are the last thing they care about. **"apna kaam banta, bhaad me jae janta"** Scindia lost state election. If he plays right BJP might offer his 1 Rajya sabha entry to tease state Congress. They are not even offering him RS seat this Is what people are talking here. Full on political drama</TEXT>

You think without their jobs they will be able to feed themselves in expensive cities like Pune. Blame your state government for not helping them with food and shelter like Delhi and Kerela. Its easy to say in reddit when we have the luxury to stock dry food at our homes. They are not going on holidays they are running back to their villages because they can ensure some food supply with support of family and local community. If Maharashtra govt is thinks shutting down Pune without any food relief camps for such people was a good idea then god help you guys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not saying they are not the richest. Was surprised to learn they declared first without securing funds for the programme Its just that amount they asking for loan is exactly same to which they declared as relief. https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/covid-19-kerala-asks-nabard-loan-rs-2000-crore-120726 They could have spent some from pocket to kick start scheme to help folks with immediate cash needs and have some spare time in hand to negotiate intrest rate with Nabard not the other way around declare first apply later. Maybe they did maybe they didn't, but can't expect centre to fund everything asap......when the [state disaster relief fund](https://www.ndmindia.nic.in/response-fund) already gets a 70% majority contribution from centre https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-declares-coronavirus-a-notified-disaster-lists-compensation-2194915  gt;In a brief two-page release this evening the government said money from each state's Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) would be used for temporary accommodation and supply of food, water and medical care for patients and people in quarantine camps.  gt;SDRF funds will also be used, the government said, to pay for additional testing centres and the cost of protective equipment for police, healthcare and municipal authorities, as well as that of thermal scanners and other necessary equipment for government hospitals. Like you said it is the richest state so if a "poorer" state like Delhi can start the scheme. I am sure Kerela shouldn't have any problems</TEXT>

At the time of emergency we have to look at he stuff which is absolutely necessary specially for the lower economic rung of our population. BPL folks need grain, sugar, salt, oil to survive. Dry grains and supplies will last longer if they stretch lockdown Personally if i don't get meat, milk for a 2-3 month I think I can very well thrive on a vegetarian diet.</TEXT>

My state Rajasthan consider water and electricity as essential services. And both the department folks are going to work daily.  gt; If you make every citizen of the country reliant of government supplied grains it will crumble the system. Did you read my comment before that or event the previous one where I said PDS system specially or did you just kept on beating you keyboard. Ration shops are open  gt; one in India through my parents. Exactly !! And I am actually here witnessing what is happening in India first hand and not trying to call you stupid or ignorant  gt;On the other hand in India, grocery stores and even medical stores are closed.

People who trusted the government and didnot panic buy like idiots. We have no such problem petrol pumps work 7-7, vegetable vendors work from 10-2, grocery alternate days in my city.

    <TEXT> gt;I just assumed that they will be shut down/ working with a very small amount of staff given section 144 imposed in my city. So if any major fault occurs they will be forced to shut down. My father works for agriculture dept of the state. They are non essential memeber because farming is not core activity right now so his office was running on rotation basis before full lockdown. Before this very few employees used to keep office open, rest of them have been asked to volunteer and augment capacity of police, only like of going around in jeeps announcing on speakers for people to stay inside. Rest all of them are working hard.  gt;Regarding wants and needs, I hope once we reach the peak of the infection curve, normalcy is brought back. I do hope so food grain wise we don't havs any scarcity we have one of the biggest dry stockpiles. Green vegetables might get affected a little but they are trying to help them keep up the supply atleast at my place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; More developed countries are struggling because of the same. And Italy had the "world best medical facility"....  gt;If it was so easy any Tom , dick and harry had a ventilator in the garage. Just because you don't know about them doesn't make them a fake company. This was their [first tweet](https://twitter.com/diwakarvaish/status/1241627957640040449?s=20) https://www.agvahealthcare.com/ But they already have 500 up and running and these were paid orders. This doesn't seem like a sham company offering at an unrealistic price point. Their base model starts at 1.5 lakh and is portable. You can search about them more... https://twitter.com/diwakarvaish?s=20 Or you can ask more questions to the guy who founded this health startup. Maybe we all can get some clarity on these claims.  gt;Remember my last tweet ? I #8217;m glad to inform all the shipments are now moving with light speed.

Migrants wanted to go back home for legitimate reason of hunger and they will reach closer to it but in quarantine first. I hope admin can pacify them with food, clean place to stay and help them understand the problem. It might not be there intention to spread it but they might unknowingly infect their villages.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They don't really have any option. Everyone on social media wants the government to help the migrants but how exactly ?!! At this point of time Delhi is offering facility of food and shelter but the reality is they don't want to stay because they anticipate this lockdown will last longer and it is better to stay with family back home. So now either government uses forces to make them stay in Delhi and other states or transport them back and quarantine. The thing is even I am not sure what is the right thing to do? 10s of 1000s have assembled on border and their is no way you can just send them back into Delhi without using police force. But they are already suffering no food and fear but we also don't want them to travel back to villages  #129335; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039; Feels like a lost battle.....</TEXT>

Meanwhile, the traditional ventilator costs somewhere between Rs 4-5 lakh, therefore, our device costs nearly one-fifth of the existing ventilators in the hospitals, #8221; he said. https://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/covid-19-ventilators-hospitals-agva-healthcare-coronavirus/articleshow/74840459.cms Official website : https://www.agvahealthcare.com/ Twitter profile of founder : https://twitter.com/diwakarvaish?s=20 He keeps sharing production challenges and other updates [Product Demo video](https://youtu.be/lm79Q3H4Rp8)</TEXT>

And there has to be a reason for it maybe our timely response or lord is on our side. Whatever floats your boat I am not sure about the whole " we are not testing enough" rhetoric now. The earliest such report shared here is now 1 month old https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjetfo/data_indias_coronavirus_testing_rates_are_among The virus takes 14 days to incubate hell take another 14 days from me it is still only 28 days + 2-3 days change. If that article was true on any level we might be seeing flood of people rushing in choking our hospital system with pneumonia like symptoms and scores of dead bodies. But for reasons unknown it hasn't happened yet. So now we can't ignore the reality and keep on chanting the same thing.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your red zone concern is legit But also their is no need to conduct exam on same day or a week. Indian railways successfully conducted computer based exams for jobs that ran for about 50-60 days slot after slot. If they want to they will spread it out thin don't test them :p On a lighter note If you are a student banking on corona to save you from exams then I would suggest to utilise this time for good. Exam will happen one way or another you cannot avoid it. Because the only other way left which I can think of, is using board exam percentage to amke merit list like DU to give direct entry to students into college which a good chunk of aspirants won't agree too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As far as usefulness of such posts go the premise was to speculate, that's all anyone will do. They all will guess just like you and me on what will happen. You might have taken a gap year which is nothing bad but after that point all the other students are in same boat as you. Nothing is in your or anyone's control. All you can do is keep studying till things calm down. Don't worry and don't get distracted keep studying just assume the gap year got little longer. Things wil improve life keeps on going maybe with some changes but it keeps on going.... And I still think they will conduct exams in August and if that doesn't happen be ready for DU style merit list which I hated because I never scored enough percentage in my days to even waste money on such college forms :p</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No packed milk in India is also pausturized just like you guys. But boiling it after pouring into a vessel is more like a force of habit. Indian diary industry is the most fragmented of them all, [Check why big wigs fail here in the milk business](https://youtu.be/4mBiFEspcIM). So we have a majority of vendor who own few cows and supply fresh milk to your locality one or twice a day depending on your consumption. So when get milk from them we have to boil is because it is non pausturized. But then bag packed milk came into equation so people continued the old habit. Even though I am aware of the fact it is pausturized I personally find is very wierd to use it without boiling the milk. Something I don't want to change</TEXT>

They are using the death of an elephant to spew venom and push their narrative of "Muslims = Evil" Share tweets please. Are these local politicians of that area or at nation level !? I mostly came across this outrage on instagram where majority was sharing toons and screenshot of the incident asking for justice and expressing their disgust. And I am aware the OG tweet by forest forest department had a tone that even they are not sure if it was crackers but they are suspecting it to be the case  gt; gt;There's no conclusive evidence that injury to lower jaw was caused by pineapple stuffed wd cracker. However this may be a possibility. Dept. has booked offence against unknown offenders, whose identity is being established. https://twitter.com/ForestKerala/status/1268078889030598656?s=20</TEXT>

We turned "how can she slap" into a meme for a reason even in that case lady was the one who slapped first and everyone around them saw it, guys responds with a slap and gets beaten up. I know it was a TV reality show but this one thing actually happens in real life. So yeah if you ever are in a similar situation with any woman then just take the L and try to move away from the scene. In no scenario will the bystanders will take your side.

    <TEXT>Okay for 1k pack is a little less than 5% of your initial purchase. Check few things before you buy it  #176; do they cover battery degradation, screen damage, hinge and keyboard damages ? And accidental damages. Don't ask but read the terms of service yourself otherwise they might dupe you just to sell a service pack Personally these are the most frequent problems my laptops have faced over the years and non of these replacements cost below 1k in any brand which I am 100% sure. So if they do cover them and you can afford to spare another 1k. Then do get 2 year pack. PS: check if they honour warranty of stuff purchased online otherwise you won't be able to register for OG warranty let alone get an extension.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Keyboard, mouse, motherboard...... Well this looks like a deal breaker to me your battery backup will tank in 3 year for sure and if they covered it you could've got a new one for free rest all the above peripherals are not that weak  gt; And, they don't cover accidental damage in the extended warranty period, but they don't cover that in base warranty, too. And this part clears it further it is just paying 1k for the vanilla warranty every product already has. I was under impression it was something on the line of what Dell offers. You have to choose now....they are not covering accidents so you breaking screen, keyboard and getting them replaced for free is out of questions. Might as well save that 1k for when things actually go bad ...what do you think ?</TEXT>

The COVID-19 protocol had necessitated some wards of the General Hospital to be converted into isolation facilities. Hence, this hall which otherwise was normally used as a Training Audio Video Hall was converted into a ward ever since the hospital was also designated as COVID treatment hospital. The injured braves have been kept there since their arrival from Galwan to ensure quarantine from COVID areas. The Chief of Army Staff General M M Naravane and the Army Commander have also visited the injured braves in the same location. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bruh! I am not sure if you are having problems with reading or something. First comment missed the article completely because I think you just didn't read But next I did shared a quote which you read that and came to this conclusion?  gt;If those folks are isolated due to covid-19 or the probability of it. Like how ?  gt; gt;The **COVID-19 protocol had necessitated some wards of the General Hospital to be converted into isolation facilities**. Hence, this hall which otherwise was normally used as a Training Audio Video **Hall was converted into a ward ever since the hospital was also designated as COVID treatment hospital**.  gt; gt;**The injured braves have been kept there since their arrival from Galwan to ensure quarantine from COVID areas**. Read again slowly These guys are not covid suspects but are kept away in a new room saperate from the covid designated facility, because the hospital has been converted into one. Not believing army press brief is definately ok we have to ask to questions to make sure of their intent. But reading one thing and making kanda bhajiya out of it is a different problem all together</TEXT>

Then he was given this token position And now news in local circles is that he wants to make a Jat state Congress taking that position from Sachin and making 2 more deputy CM, going so far to dilute his power if he actually had any.

    <TEXT>No saying high court might not be doing this deliberately. But in general this is how courts work, they take a hell lot of time. They use stupid excuses to postponed hearing even when it means they are being unfair to one side be it accused or accuser. Public memory is short, most of you might not remember the Delhi bike guy who was charged with a fake molestation case against him and was also handed a swift social media justice. That girl literally skipped 14 back to back hearing and the guy kept on doing round of court.  gt;Kaur on the other hand skipped 14 trial hearings claiming that she was unable to be present due to 'academic commitments' in Canada. https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/oct/26/jasleen-kaur-case-sarvjeet-acquitted-after-four-years-netizens-demand-apology-from-kejriwal-arnab-2053322.html So the guy's career was put in cold storage for good 4 years before he got acquitted. While Jasleen just went on with her life got another degree and maybe a better job. So yeah court system sucks. There is a reason people are willing to pay in cash outside even though they are not guilty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The rich will find a way past this. Even if state governments like Delhi and Haryana implement Hindi-medium across-the-board, the affluent will try and move their children to international schools, such as the British and American schools in Delhi. At worst, they will ship their kids abroad. Yet, the very possibility of having to learn and speak in Hindi will have an impact on internal rankings within the elite. Many who carried a chip on their shoulder for not speaking idiomatic English, will assert their 'Indianness' in social situations. It will be a linguistic flexing of muscles to establish who holds the reins of power in the Modi Raj.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Always double check the actual area(carpet area) of house not built up/super built up. Whenever you visit a site keep a close look on these numbers. Most builders will use super built up area or some other new term to make house seem bigger than it is. Take a measuring tape and cross check one room/balcony dimensions with provided print floor plan at random. As much as society facilities like wide corridor, lifts, library etc matter. At the end of the day you will be living with your family inside walls of your own place and not in the " meditation room". so yeah make sure to choose a place with biggest carpet area i.e stuff you get inside your 4 walls.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man I feel for you. My mom suffers from the same condition it gets worse in winters. For the last 15 years the thing keeps going on despite surgery. surgery did help with the sensation part and continuous pain but one big negative is now both of her hand have lost ability to exert any kind of force be it lifting stuff (anything more than 2 kg) or twisting (opening bottle caps, jam jars etc), they never recovered completely. We were aware of this before surgery but I just had a false hope in my mind because of seeing her in pain for so long. A part of me just wanted her to be like completely healthy for a year or two and experience good sleep . Its a shitty condition</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;In either case, you guys should know, China's rule of engagement always has a strict no-first-shot policy, so when the Chinese military make an official statement in the middle of the night that says India fired the first shot, it either means "so we were justified for shooting", or "we plan on shooting in the future" Bruh no first shot is not China's policy but something both countries practice on that side of our border. There is a reason whenever any small fight takes place folks in it resort to hand to hand combat, heckling or stone pelting. Taking China's word as it is and adding your gyan to it because they are known for telling only truth and being so transparent. Just share the updates as it is no need to add your own half cooked masala on top. Our army statement says the exact opposite it was their troops who fired in air while approaching our forward post in a bid to intimidate our troops. But they stood their grounds  gt;https://twitter.com/ShivAroor/status/1303201112653066240</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty comprehensive A+ for the effort bhai. Personally I order my electronics from AliExpress even the basic stuff like bundle of wire or some solder flux. They are cheaper and have plathora of pre made modules for literally everything in all form factor. You want a li-ion 5v micro charge board they have it for  #8377;100, you want a bluetooth module they have it  #8377;70-80. So unless and untill I have some urgency I don't even look at my local market. Plan ahead to compensate for long shipping time and order from China.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My theory the next delimitation commision will be setup and won't get freezed+postpone on 1970s level. Our population has increased many folds since then. We need 1 MP for about 10 lakh people but we only have a total of 550. If delimitation happens without any tweaks size of parliament will go beyond 1500+ MPs and they will need a new place to operate because current structure is at it limit can't even support existing 550 with ease I am assuming this us why TATA has been given a strict deadline of 1 year because Modi will want to do this delimitation excercise before next parliamentary elections. And will use this project as one of his grand gestures EDIT : This comment has some Conspiracy theory in it regarding delimitation exercise take it with a spoon of salt. I believe it because whether we like it or not modi kuch bhi kar sakta hai. Also I am not an expert in topic I have hunger for karma.</TEXT>

Too me post delimitation (without any tweaks I.e no special clause to reduce North india weightage) it will be borderline impossible for any party to make majority government without have a strong footing in northern states,. Rajasthan, UP, Bihar, MP all of them will get a huge chunk of new seats, if and when that happens. Even today without UP it is difficult to get your candidate become president of india.

    <TEXT> gt;But currently it can't be touched till 2026 Maybe or maybe not that 2026 census Clause was put in by a constitutional amendment. Doesn't mean clause can't be nuked before time I mean this is BJP we are talking about they managed to dissolve article 370 which other parties didn't even dare to touch... Also keep in mind modi is pushing for all election at the same time. So they are anyways going to amend election related articles might as well slip this one in like always.  gt;Also do we know for sure current Parliament can't accommodate 1500 members in lower house or something?  gt;The way benches and seats are constructed I don't see who it would be an issue. It would also be cheaper than making a new Parliament and the accompanying infra that it would need. Yes it can't. The matter is not just that you have to cram more people on the floor of house by rearranging furniture. When house is not in session these guys need offices space, cabins to sit in. And then their support needs space as well. Also they want to bring all minstry office in one giant campus no more visiting south block, north block and places far apart with huge convoys. They are planning to build tunnels in this new campus to move swifty.  gt;The idea is to move government offices that are located across the city to one place. This will not only save time in commuting from one office to another but also resources, #8221; the official added.  gt;The government currently shells out Rs 1,000 crore on rent every year.  gt;All the new offices are to be connected by an underground metro rail.  #8220;There will be a shuttle service between all the offices. We are in talks with DMRC to work out the details, #8221; said a second housing ministry official. https://theprint.in/india/governance/new-home-for-pm-a-triangular-parliament-modi-govt-readies-delhi-power-corridor-makeover/342758/ Overall they are projecting it as an excercise to increase capacity, efficiency and save money</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Delimitation is a constitutional obligation that cannot happen before 2031 ("first census after 2026" - 84th CAA, 2001). So Modi cannot just "do" delimitation because any Delimitation Act passed by the Parliament before 2031 (or in any case, before 2026) will not just be illegal but also ultra vires. Call it conspiracy theory at this point but they still have an option to amend the act and resolve this hurdle. This 2026 freeze itself was result of an amendment. And for some reason I strongly believe they will do this when modi move the one nation one election bill. People even thought no one could touch article 370 and look where are we now. They have a very strong team of legal experts determined to find a way for anything EDIT : I might as well add a conspiracy theory disclaimer to og comment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The think tank recommended incentives of $4.6 billion by 2030 for companies manufacturing advanced batteries, starting with cash and infrastructure incentives of 9 billion rupees ($122 million) in the next financial year which would then be ratcheted up annually.  gt; gt;"Currently, the battery energy storage industry is at a very nascent stage in India with investors being a little apprehensive to invest in a sunrise industry," the proposal said.  gt; gt;India plans to retain its import tax rate of 5% for certain types of batteries, including batteries for electric vehicles, until 2022, but will increase it to 15% thereafter to promote local manufacturing, the document said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It's late Maybe but it's not like most can still afford it in 2020 let alone starting in 2000s. The bulk production cost of existing tech li-ion battery is still around +$150/kWh. At this cost it is difficult to make a sub 10 lakh car with good range. I don't see this price going down any further just by making them locally specifically when India has a miniscule source of lithium deposit so majority will be imported adding to cost. The whole tech needs a revamp prices are not going down faster. Projections show market will achieve sub $100/kWh only till 2023. Let's see how things will turn out in future maybe a better cheaper substitute.</TEXT>

Imported ore or metal has a middle man premium to it and we will pay for it unfortunately, adding to price tag  gt;I hope, our industries start to invest money where there is a decent income.

But govt in dire need of money and add to that a bunch of false hope that someone will pay more cash than TATA for an airline with $3 Billion of debt on sheet, they extended the bidding process by another 3 months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They can effectively chop off the duty they pay for importing circuits and screen assemblies. But it is Apple so all depends on them if they really want to pass of the gains The whole plan in this PLI scheme is not just to make electronics for local demand but also to export a bunch. To unlock these cash incentives, 16 firms which got permission have to hit production targets (set by department) every year for next 5 years.  gt; gt;for the first year, the total incentive to be given has been capped at Rs 5,334 crore, while for the second and third year it has been kept at Rs 8,064 and Rs 8,425 crore, respectively. In the fourth year, the incentive will be hiked substantially to Rs 11,488 crore, while in the fifth and final year, the incentive to be distributed has been capped at Rs 7,640 crore. **The total incentives over five years has thus been kept at Rs 40,951 crore** You can read more detail about this program here [Explained: What is the production linked incentive scheme for electronics manufacturers?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/national-policy-on-electronics-production-linked-incentive-scheme-explained-6530777/)</TEXT>
