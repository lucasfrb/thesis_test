    <TITLE>The math we learn in high school is useful. It offers a better understanding of the world around us and gives students the opportunity to go further into science or engineering in college.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-09 08:57:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the school systems vary all around the world but in Switzerland, math is compulsory until the end of high school (with various levels available) and most people think it is useless. After going further in studying science, I realised that what we learned is actually useful and can help us understand statistics better. I think math #8217;s usefulness is underrated. I also know that some people struggle with math and that doesn #8217;t mean they won #8217;t be able to achieve stuff in their lives but it #8217;s no reason to minimise math #8217;s presence in the world around us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally, I don #8217;t smoke weed not because of its illegality but simply because it #8217;s bad for my health. And being in a country where it #8217;s legal to smoke doesn #8217;t make weed any healthier. I don #8217;t smoke weed for the same reason I don #8217;t smoke cigarettes: it #8217;s unhealthy.

I #8217;m talking about the fact that people still smoke it at parties even when it #8217;s illegal and if you don #8217;t smoke there and then you do in Amsterdam for example, its illegality is the only thing stopping you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The rabbi was an avid golfer and played at every opportunity.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-17 07:58:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Context: Yom Kippur is the holiest Jewish holiday during which you #8217;re supposed to deprivate yourself from food, drinking and anything that brings you joy and during which you #8217;re also supposed to pray the whole day. Joke: The rabbi was an avid golfer and played at every opportunity. He was so addicted to the game that if he didn't play he would get withdrawal symptoms. One Yom Kippur the rabbi thought to himself, "What's it going to hurt if I go out during the recess and play a few rounds. Nobody will be the wiser, and I'll be back in time for services." Sure enough, at the conclusion of the morning service, the rabbi snuck out of the synagogue and headed straight for the golf course. Looking down upon the scene were Moses and God. Moses said, "Look how terrible #8212;a Jew on Yom Kippur. And a rabbi besides!" God replied, "Watch. I'm going to teach him a lesson." Out on the course, the rabbi stepped up to the first tee. When he hit the ball, it careened off a tree, struck a rock, skipped across a pond and landed in the hole for a HOLE IN ONE! Seeing all this, Moses protested: "God, this is how you're going to teach him a lesson? He got a hole in one!" "Sure," said God, "but who's he going to tell?"</TEXT>

Of course Israel has done some bad shit but you can #8217;t summarise the conflict into  #8220;poor Palestinians getting invaded by cruel zionists #8221;.

    <TEXT>The area was called Palestine but if you actually look into it there were Jews living there (mostly arabs but still a few Jews) but the problem is that the records aren #8217;t accurate because it wasn #8217;t frequent to register precisely a demographic at that time, so it #8217;s difficult to have an idea of how many. Also, I #8217;m not talking about the 19th or 20th century, I #8217;m talking about a people who was exiled from this land and fought wars on it, conquered it and lived a few generations there, then were invaded by romans and many others. That #8217;s what I #8217;m talking about. And the Jews from all over the world started moving to so called Palestine before Israel was declared a state and they lived peacefully with the Palestinians who lived there. You said that it was marked Palestine in the maps but it #8217;s because the region was called so, but it wasn #8217;t an official country.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I hate most about anti maskers is that some people actually have health problems which prevent them from wearing a mask but because of anti maskers, it makes it probably very difficult for them to explain their situation. All of that in the name of their fucking freedom. Oh and also getting people killed by COVID isn #8217;t that great either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For people breathing using an oxygen tank it #8217;s quite complicated to wear a mask at the same time. Also, some mask may cause over heating and a sensation of confinement which for people with really severe claustrophobia may cause panic attacks. Those cases are really really rare though and there #8217;s no excuse as to so many people not wearing masks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A right wing Swiss political party wanted to promote an initiative against immigration in Switzerland. One of their arguments is that it promotes the  #8220;betonization #8221; of the country. They found a picture to illustrate, quite a big fuck up. The picture has been since removed.</TITLE>

It didn #8217;t work as planned as before people knew at least the first sentence and now no one knows a word of it. And most people don #8217;t even know the lyrics changed.

I know no one who could take me for a ride or give tips so I was hoping to get some advices here. Thanks to everyone who #8217;ll take the time to help me out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where I live I have to pass the test even if I take lessons and I have to take the 12 hours compulsory class (just driving lessons, not even preparation for the exam), so I wasn #8217;t sure the beginner lesson was really worth it but as I don #8217;t have any gear yet it would probably be a good idea I guess... Even tho it #8217;s quite expensive I think... But safety doesn #8217;t have a price I guess</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Palestinians have the right to study, vote and form political parties. There surely is a better way than sending bombs to Israel. Just to say that I don #8217;t support every Israeli action but stop always putting Palestinians as the victims. Settlements were established in gaza and Jews were then removed by force from there, leaving the land to the Palestinians. And what #8217;s happening now? Rockets are sent almost daily to Israel. Of course that doesn #8217;t justify in any way Israel #8217;s behaviour towards some citizens but that also makes more understandable their unwillingness to remove by force people from the West Bank.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-15 07:28:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>We had organised a board games night with some friends. I knew less than half of the people who were there but it was a chill mood, we all got something to eat and drink. After the meal, we started playing a game in which trading is a very important part (the game is called Catan). As we were too many to play we made teams of 2 and my team was made of the only females present that day (me and a friend). We start playing and the entitled guy #8217;s team is really slow to play, which annoys everyone. We start putting timers so they don #8217;t spend than 7 min playing their turn but they just ignore when the time is up. I start telling them to hurry and that it makes the game no fun but of course they don #8217;t listen (I still think it annoyed them a bit). We keep playing like that until my team starts being ahead and starts winning the game. Then comes the trading part of the EG #8217;s team and the two other teams start trading. I then say that I #8217;ll accept the trade (which the other team didn #8217;t want to and the EG #8217;s team was trying to convince the other team) and he then tells me to shut up because  #8220;the man are talking #8221;. He then used this sentence every time I was trying to trade as he saw that I found it really disrespectful. He then proceeded to lose the game and I proceeded to win it.</TEXT>
