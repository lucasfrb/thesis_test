    <TEXT>Is it considered rape if your motive was to fuck someone at first but then when you went down to it you changed your mind and kindly asked them to stop and they kept going? Not that I care but I'd like to know how to prevent this from happenning next time because it's really hard for me to be mean to someone or even stand up for myself at times. It left me with a sense of shame I can't explain so I'm kind of confused.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just like there have been many cases where attractive men were confronted of acting creepily against women there have also been cases where women kept dismissing the 'red flags' in an attractive man's behaviour because whether we like it or not sometimes outer appearance can be an alibi to someone's behaviour or actions. As I mentioned, this doesn't apply to all cases as it all depends on the situation, however my opinion comes mainly from my experience, so I understand why there might be some level of confirmation bias.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excluding some accents like Scouse, Cockney and Jordie (no offense), I'd say that most british accents sound way sexier than any spanish accent. I never understood the whole spanish sex appeal in the first place and never will. Update: Another, rather unpopular opinion as well amongst Brits, the Brummie accent is definitely hot.</TEXT>

Just as those actions would be considered disrespectful if they came from a student they're just as disrespectful deriving from a teacher.

    <TEXT>Whenever someone says "no offense but ___" before saying something that they think might appear offensive to others is not as rude as carelessly saying their opinion because that shows that they establish that their intention is not to offend anyone but simply say their opinion.

    <TEXT>I feel like Covid-19 is lately more about government control rather than it being an actual virus. Seeing that the mortality rate was proven to be extremely low, the restrictions keep getting stricter and stricter, where I'm from at least. My country is in the Middle East and had 21 deaths in total. Lately, there was a slight rise in cases (95% asymptomatic, from random testing) and testing has become essential in airports (+ it is ridiculously expensive). Also, you're not allowed to dance in bars, or else there's an  #8364;8000 fine, you're not allowed to go anywhere publicly (except bars/restaurants) without a mask or else there's a  #8364;300 fine and bars cannot be open after 3 AM. I don't know, there's something off about this whole situation. I feel like the government has taken advantage of the situation and doesn't treat it like a virus anymore but a way to profit from it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you want to hunt on your free time, fine. You're trying too hard to prove to others and probably yourself that it's ethical and that you're also doing the animals a favour, it's pathetic and obviously a cope mechanism to feel better about yourself. If you're careless enough that you're killing innocent animals in their natural habitat you should also be careless enough to accept that it's completely unethical because all animals deserve to live. 1. That doesn't justify it in ANY way, murder is unethical whether it's a slow or quick death. You're not a predator and this is not your natural habitat. I'd accept the fact that hunters are predators if they could kill the prey with their own hands and eat it right there and then, they can't. 2. It's really hard to distinguish a female from a male prey within a shooting distance, if you get too close they'll probably get scared and run off. But still, murder is murder. Again you're trying too hard to prove that you're considerate of the prey, you're not. 3. Humans are not part of the same ecosystem as animals, so if humans stopped eating animals, the circle of life within the ecosystem of the animals wouldn't collapse in any way. You can provide food for yourself and your family from your local supermarket. In regards to animals and animal products, yes they're pumped up with hormones, anti-biotics and recycled vitamins/proteins, so you can just alrernatively try and thrive a plant-based balanced diet.</TEXT>

You can instantly tell that their mood is lightened and it feels nice to know that you've made someone's day better. Of course, the approach matters. We live in a rather introverted society where some people are more reserved than others. When the approach is appropriate and it's not a catcalling scenario then anyone would appreciate a compliment as sometimes it can mean a lot. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a rather unhealthy perception you have towards people. But I don't blame you, I blame society for raising us to believe that people who are being nice to us want something in return. Some people are just nice and enjoy making other people feel nice about themselves, but I see your point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see where you're coming from. As a teenager, I was very insecure as I was being bullied mainly for being skinny and my taste in music so whenever someone was being nice to me or a boy talked to me I thought the bullies made them to so they could make fun of me (which happenned several times). Sometimes I just wish being nice to strangers because you don't know what they're going through was more common in our society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people are too insecure that they question the compliments they receive and question whether people actually mean it, hence her reaction. I'm sure that girl, when she thought about that compliment later she smiled :) (I'm assuming so because I was the same as a teengager, whenever I received a compliment I was extremely uncomfortable but then thinking about them the thought that someone went out of their way to compliment me made me feel nice)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry but you're just a rude person. I understand not wanting to interact with people in public spaces but at your job??? Your job is literally engaging with customers all day. Being nice to your customers costs you nothing, it's not about caring, it's just basic manners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe people were quick to claim it was a sexist remark partly because he's Trump. I don't think the comment itself was sexist at all. But you're right, if people had more trust in each other instead of being suspicious of anyone that is being nice to them society would be way better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to work in retail and I agree that some people are just rude to you regardless of how you treat them as customers. However, I've noticed that simply being nice (not forcing chit chat) to customers decreases the likeliness of them being rude to you. I don't know where you're from, but in Europe it's expected of retail workers to be nice to their customers regardless of the customers' attitude.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Infants shouldn't be baptised (if their family is Christian) and/or should grow up in a religion-neutral environment. Why force a child that has just been brought into this world into the religion you're following? I believe that children should grow up and decide for themselves when they've got a full understanding of the concept of religion and acknowledgment of the other religions out there besides the one in their family. I'm personally against Creationism but if someone is all for that and wants to have faith in somewhere then fair enough, as long as they have the right to choose.</TEXT>
