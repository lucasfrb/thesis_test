    <TITLE>Spoiler: So did the eye actually called the nomai?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-26 15:05:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>The eye is still a very big mistery to me (even after finishing the game). What I think I understood is that being the center of the universe, it is where the universe starts every time (when it is said to be older than the universe, it is older than the universe that the nomai lived, but they didn't know that there were universes before them). But with that said, why did the eye emmited the signal? I feel like it has consciousness, but if the signal was emmited on purpose, why exactly did he wanted the nomai to find it? Could the nomai have stopped the end of their universe? Was the eye trying to help their specie? One theory that I have is that the eye has consciousness and is both responsible for the start and the end of every universe. When the eye felt the universe dying, he emmited the signal so that some conscious being could find him, and by finding it, ending the universe. I don't think that the fact that we found the eye exactly when the universe ended was a coincidence, I think that finding it caused the end of the universe, which is exactly what the eye wanted when he emmited the signal, so that he could start over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very good explanation. Something that I noticed though is that the universe was already "ending" on the sense of dying (all stars were dying and therefore all life). I believe that the universe was dying, but to officially end it and start a new one the eye needed someone to visit him. That is why I believe that the signal was emmited on purpose, because what would have happened if all life was eradicated before someone visited the eye? The universe would never be able to restart, and life would never exist again once the stars were all dead. To prevent that the eye called the nomai hoping that they would find him, but in the end, we did</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It can't be cosmic coincidence because the reason behind the loops is that the nomai were called to the solar system. If they hadn't been called, a conscious been wouldn't find the eye before the death of all stars (after that, there would be no life, therefore no conscious been). It can't be a coincidence because arriving 200k years before the stars started to die is a very short period considering the age of the universe. Your were right, the game is not about stopping the super nova, but about enabling the eye to reset the universe so that more lives can came after you (at least based on what I understood about the eye)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am new to nofap and have been watching a few videos to better understand what this practice does to our bodies. What I ended up understanding is that this movement seems to be aimed for people at a lower point in relation to porn and masturbation (meaning porn addicts or people that are used to relapse 3-4 times a day). I don't really relate to those characteristics, I wouldn't say I am a porn addict and I was used to masturbate once a day (some days I skipped, but I hardly ever did it more than once). Considering my situation, I feel like trying to reboot my brain is a pointless, since it is not that "corrupted". Should I keep going (I've been clean for a week) or am still on a healthy/acceptable relation with porn and masturbation? Will this reboot have any affect in me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My favorite way of killing wolf spiders is (maybe not the cheapest, but effectice): When she is at those branches that she can't leave, shoot 4 gas arrows. You can shoot all at the same time, they will add up. They will leave her at like 1/5 of life, you can finish with normal arrows or just kill with any weapon</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can't place any structure since last uptade</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 10:13:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since the game uptaded a few days ago, whenever I try to place any structure, the game crashes. I play on xbox one and I don't think the problem is in the console. I've tried everything I could think of, like deleting some games to get extra space and destroying all structures I had built but nothing seem to work. I hadn't been playing for long before the update so I had a super small house (like 3x2, two floors), so it's definetly not because I have too many structures. Any hints?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am not so against masturbation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 13:48:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am completely and utterly against porn, partly because of the disgusting industry but mainly because of the consequences to your brain. I think that being addicted to porn is way more common and dangerous than masturbation itself. I am not so much against masturbation (even though there is a healthy limit), because there are a shit tone of benefits if practiced with responsibility (decrease stress, better sleep, lower prostate cancer risk, higher numbers of white cells, improved sperm quality, improve sexual performance etc.) I am trying to quit porn (which leads to basically no masturbating since it's the hell of a trigger), but if I can quit porn and continue to masturbate (like 3-4 times a week), I will be pretty satisfied. Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been trying to read some horror books and I've been enjoying a bunch, and I am now looking for another one. I was going to check other Stephen King books but most of the better ones were adapted to movies which I've seen, and I am not a big fan of reading books of movies I watched already. So... Yeah horror books... Just recommend me something or wathever I don't know how this sub works</TEXT>
