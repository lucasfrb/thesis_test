    <TITLE>2 year old helix piercing started hurting</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-08 08:50:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've had my helix done for 2 years now with no problems, it healed lovely obviously it hurt a bit during the healing process to lie on etc. Had it done with a needle. I've had it over two years now and the last couple weeks it's been hurting when I lie down or touch it. I had a hoop put in when I had it done because the piercer offered (I know now that wasnt the best idea but I didnt know any better then) but I've literally had no problems with it untill now. No swelling or anything besides the pain. Does anyone know why??</TEXT>

I had him from the spider shop in a mystery box I usually would not keep W.C otherwise from what I can tell hes reached full size for his species and I'm wondering if hes possibly reaching the end of his life span?</TEXT>

So leave him alone for a day or two before attempting feed and then 2 days after. Make sure temps are correct they also wont eat if tank temps are off. If it's a glass tank cover the back and sides with cardboard or something to darken the tank, I can't see if you have in those photos. Contact the seller to find out exactly what he was eating. Dont feed mice. Rat chuffs it looks like he'll be on. Make sure the food is heated I use hot water to thaw mine (not boiling you dont want to cook the rat). Could try scenting the rat, worst comes to worst try braining the rat.</TEXT>
