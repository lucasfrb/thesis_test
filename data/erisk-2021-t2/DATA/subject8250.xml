    <TEXT>SC4 had this amazing thing where one could build a HUGE city covering a massive region. this gave months and months of gameplay. one could build each city tile with an end goal in mind. why oh why can't they implement contiguous city blocks, at the very least? that way we could see a city, and not just weird squares filled with development. i know we'd be going through that server-induced hell of painful load times more often than ever as we switched between cities, but at least one feel that one was building something that was actually part of the same thing!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>N7HQ broken challenge. Any ideas on how to fix this?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-05-20 11:13:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>i was just playing a gold PUG and on wave 6 the host quit (seemed like a ragequit to me). as the wave restarted, i received the little pop-up notification that i had completed 100 first aid medals (which was the eighth accomplishment for me in squad elite) and also a pop-up stating that i had completed squad elite. all well so far. about ten seconds later, my game crashed (annoying, but it happens). when i went onto [my N7HQ page](http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/home/challenges/?name=subject8250ZA amp;platform=pc) to see my new achievement, i was met by something strange: the active challenge has operator (squad elite) unlocked, but on the challenge page, squad elite is now showing 8/8 challenges - it has not reset to 0. also, i did not receive my 200 challenge points. also, i am now no longer able to do all the squad elite accomplishments a second time around. as an aside: i am VERY far from being able to extract 25 times on platinum, so unlocking another accomplishment in squad elite is not really an option... i tried resyncing my account, but no luck. any ideas on how to fix this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>my 1000th game</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-06-15 18:08:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>i have just played my 1000th game. i came into MECoOP in march as a n00b of note. i thought the avenger was pretty awesome, i couldn't aim to save my life (literally), i stood still a lot (normally immediately prior to lying on the ground), i wondered why when i punched something i would die but when others punched something it would go flying off the map. players magically teleported across the map, pulled out giant hammers, went invisible, got shot without dying, and killed whole groups of monsters with a single shot! how did these players do these magical things? well, since then i have discovered that vanguards can charge magically, that there are annoying things called krogan warlords, that there are super-stealthy infiltrators, not all classes are squishy, and most dramatically, the cobra missile (what does this thing do? WOW!!!). i discovered some new guns, learnt to run around a lot (being revived all the time is a little embarrassing!), punched a few people so hard they died. i still can't really aim, but at least i can save my life occasionally :) i learnt to hate banshees. i learnt to hate phantoms even more. now i hate with the most passion those annoying little bombers. but i loved playing against dragoons, would break into a grin at the sight of a brute, and would bounce excitedly in my chair whenever i saw a nemesis. i am notoriously chatty on the mic, and have met some wonderful people (Blue_sienna, MPApr2012, Nar-Laien, Nate159WG, among many others) who thought i was worth helping along. good friends now, they all are. they carried me through many, many games. my first taste of platinum left me wide-eyed and in shock - my N7 17 character spent most of the game dying, being revived, apologising, taking a step, and dying again. i spent a LOT of time watching mind-blowingly brilliant players from spectator mode, as they got me through yet another wave. i learnt a lot from watching them. they learnt a lot about me as i answered phone calls, forgetting my mic on. i fell in love with the krysae (sadly i never saw it pre-nerf), the novaguard, and jade. i caught myself smiling every time i heard a krogan proclaim , "they're dead!". i loved it when people would actually chat to each other instead of mindlessly zoning in to their own private little universe. the discovery of this reddit opened up a whole new world of joy to me. my notorious south african lag could not dampen my fun. i got used to being banshee-grabbed from the other side of the map, to mashing "1" ten times before the shield-recharging bliss of the biotic charge would kick in; i learnt to shoot despite my screen not being able to decide which of two rooms i was currently in, i ALWAYS was second to arrive to revive anyone (took me forever to get my 100 first aid medals). lag-free games were all the sweeter for it. i also finished the single player campaign today and will now have to play 1 and 2. and 3 again. so now, [here](http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/home/overview/?name=subject8250ZA amp;platform=pc) i am. a new player, who by means of unemployment had a little too much time on his hands. i have an ever-growing e-peen and a love for newbies. i have the harrier, can refrain from embarrassing myself too badly even on platinum, am only a few challenges from BotB, and i understand how to be a good team mate (i hope). thank you, MECoOP community, for giving me such great times. forgive my outbursts of song that occur occasionally. put up with my desire to play a krysae on a novaguard. embrace my warm greetings. and enjoy the game with me :D</TEXT>

    <TITLE>why doesn't niantic use network location to combat spoofing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-09-17 10:58:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>i came across [an article](http://www.tatango.com/blog/top-10-most-commonly-asked-location-based-mobile-marketing-questions/) today and read this:  gt; #8 Can we create an SMS geofence based on a city, state or a zip code?  gt; Yes. The best use case here is for online gambling where location data is a key requirement for any wage-taking gaming app, or mobile lottery. Obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies and gaming testing labs require that a users physical location within a state or territory with legalized online gambling be verified to allow bets to be placed. GPS location can be easily spoofed, and wifi or geoIP are insufficient to provide validated location beyond country level. Network location accuracy, reach and un-spoofability make it a requirement for authenticated, verified location compliance. my question is: surely niantic can use networks to locate the broad area (say within a few hundred metres) of the scanner, and if it doesn't match the reported GPS location of the phone, trigger a spoofing alarm of some sort?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>agents bring attacked to 0XM</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-02 20:55:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>as things currently stand, an agent's XM can not be reduced below 0. this makes force amps (and to a lesser extent, turrets) somewhat easy to work around with the recycle-three-R7 trick and makes those mods far less potent than they should be. sure, the multi-recycle route is a trifle time-consuming, but it does nerf the attack mods fairly substantially. i propose that for every 1000XM (or part thereof) one's XM would be reduced below 0 in an attack, there is an additional cooldown period of one second before the scanner becomes active again. obviously, the exact duration is debateable, but the idealist solid. this way, when attacking portals (or groups of portals) that have strong attacks, the agent is seriously inconvenienced (or needs to use bigger cubes). thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Join Niantic Labs' +Hsiu Wang for a Cross-Faction meetup at Cafe Manhattan (74 Waterkant St) in Cape Town. Share your Ingress Scanner feedback and suggestions, and meet local Agents face-to-face-to-face. ) meeting starts in just over two ours at !8:00 SAST (GMT +2). EDIT: thanks for all your input. sorry i couldn't get through all your suggestions. here is the FEEDBACK. a whole list of suggestions were made. hsiu was super excited to hear feedback and receive suggestions for ingress: we were able to write them down and discuss them with her. suggestions made (minus the ones that slip my mind now): * INTEL MAP: layers for portals never visited and portals never captured * unload all on capsule screen * sort keys by distance in capsule * name capsules * recharge from inside a capsule * implement keyrings (although if the above capsule functionality changes, keyrings would not be necessary) * use cube from recharge screen * remove recruiter badge * have separate buttons for "key hack" and "no key hack" to replace the current drop or encapsulate mechanic * i forgot to write down "glyph for no equipment" * i forgot to write down turn notifications on/off per portal other things (some inferred from the conversation, some more solid replies): * recharger was brought in to make up for the trickiness of the guardian badge * engineers have limited time available. it is split between ingress and field trip. the ingress dev time is split between intel and app. they are continually in the process of trying to decide what improvements are a priority. they had a lot more time for ingress towards the end of last year (which can be seen by the many changes in the past few months). * the devs are hired because of their passion for the project, how well they fit into culture, and coding ability. * they like to encourage building over destroying. we are unlikely to see more badges for destroying things than the ones that already exist. * they are likely to balance the AP rewards for glyphing. * major changes in game mechanics (like changing how guardian works) are not lightly undertaken. they take spoofing very seriously and a lot of what they do has anti-spoofing as a major component. * they obfuscate the code to make spoofing harder. * they have put thought into guardian, including having save points or cumulative vs consecutive (with threshold values). major changes are not lightly undertaken, though, because people complain (amongst other things). they know it is a bit of a luck badge. * seer badge is a major headache for them. the original values for the badge were based on player stats from back in the day (hence 5000 for black). they realise that this is a ridiculous number. they are really trying to come up with a better way to approve portal subs. my take on the seer badge is that it submissions are unlikely to be unfrozen before a solution is found. they have limited resource to hire monkeys. monkeys have to research each submission. if they can't find info on the submission easily and quickly, they reject and move on. huge number of awful submissions has slowed this process down, because they have to start on the basis that the submission is bad, prove that it's good. once again, they are loathe to change badge values that have been entrenched for ages. * more badges were brought out the encourage certain modes of gameplay (like fielding and glyphing), and to make up for the fact that badges were a major hurdle in reaching higher levels. i brought up the fact that now L16 is pretty much an AP slog because of all the new badges (the reason the badges were first introduced was to prevent it being a straight AP slog). there was no hint of talk about more levels (i did not get a chance to ask directly, though). * niantic seem to be very enamoured of glyphing (hence badge and AP for glyphing). it is anti-spoofing, lore-relevant, and makes hacking more immersive. i pointed out that it is bad for social interaction at group farms. * not all game actions are tracked. certain badges that start at zero, start at zero because they have not stracked those stats. they are also keenly aware of player privacy and don't track user movements. * IITC is something that hurts/embarasses them. the devs are keenly aware that IITC is way better, and they would love to fix intel map. however, time is an issue. they have made improvements, but i did point out that IITC is still way better. hsiu did point out that they do keep track of whoever uses IITC and that it is better not to use it. i got the feeling that at some time in the future they might change their stance on ignoring IITC users (probably only when intel is good enough). IITC is a problem because they can't control the functionality of IITC. things like player tracker are not what they want in the game, as an example.</TEXT>

[this](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart) seems to be the best chart i have come up with, and i think this is gen IV, but am not sure. ideally, i would love a site that allows me to select a pok #233;mon and it will list the strongest attackers to beat it. something like that. thanks for the help.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>some thoughts on getting a good team dynamic going in solo draft / solo queue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-17 09:10:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>i was prompted to write this by a recent post about getting stuck in lower levels of ranked play, and the frustration it can cause when one feels one is playing well. for me this boils down to one simple concept. your rank is not an indication of how good you are as a player as an individual; it is an indication of how good you are in a team. if you can get the team to play better, you will win more games. it's people management and leadership skills as much as (if not more than) anything else. in higher level leagues, this (leader) role does not have to be yours, but to progress well at lower levels, you need to find a way to get people to believe in you and follow you. and first rule of leadership - a leader serves their followers. focus on team dynamics. communication and unity are your friends. if people like you, they are likely to play well with you. my experience is that a few simple strategy sentences in draft go a long way to being on the same page. sylvanas drafted on your team? chat about strategy with her. let her push in the beginning, but let her know how much you value her wailing arrow in the team fights from level 10 on, and that "OMG your so OP at 16 with cold embrace you will win our team fights 4 us". if she feels she can bring more value to team fights than by trying to push a tower, she will join the team fights. there are similar things that can be said to the other heroes. we all know the problems with various (infamous) heroes; encourage the good activities of those heroes. to use sylvanas again: "looking forward to your epic waveclear in early game. maybe rotate between top and mid lanes? we can pressure two lanes that way and maybe take a tower or two. from level 10 on, we can team up to become a 5-man rolling snowball of death with you helping us push forward together. it's always nice seeing a sylvannas with good hero damage and not just seige damage." notice how you can encourage the "fun" behaviour a beginner likes about the hero, while at the same time letting them know how to be awesome! and if they play well (for their ability), vote for them after the game ;) from mid-game onwards, identify the weakest player on your team (or the player on your team most likely to YOLO solo) and follow them around, supporting them. encourage the others to join you. if you can't get the weak player to join the rest of the team, take the team to them. if you are playing well, the other good player(s) will naturally congregate around you. take them to the solo player. having a weak player with the group hides a lot of their inability, and they will synergise to a degree (even if only accidentally) with the rest of the group. a ping coupled to a hotkeyed "four enemies dead, let's steal boss quick" goes a lot further than just a ping. at low levels, some well thought out simple sentences hotkeyed for quick execution go a long way. if the poor player, who generally has little idea what to do beyond "hey, this seems a good idea right now", sees a suggestion *that seems like an excellent idea*, they will be there for the suggestion, especially if they are close to it on the map. other good scripted chatlines are "careful top lane, gank squad coming your way", "great takedown there, [heroename]", and "[heroename], we need your ulti at the next objective - you're gonna kick some butt". i am sure you get the idea. build people up, sound reasonable, and people will follow more often than not. just my two cents. i would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this. edit: a word</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i live in south africa and my closest server is in europe (about 9000km away). high ping is my normal - i have never experienced low ping in heroes (and this is pretty much the only online multiplayer game i play/have played). my ping is generally in the 200-300ms range. on a good day, maybe as low as 150ms, on a bad day... on a bad day, it's AI only - more than about 500ms and the screen jerks around all the time. i hear people mention ping as a factor in playing, and am genuinely curious to know how much it affects winrate. as i mentioned, it's my normal - i can't complain about it as i have never known any better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>who populates the lower leagues then? everyone should be entitled to play ranked (once they have the minimum number of heroes available needed to fill a draft in all its permutations. i don't even mind the low hurdle of level 5 required). just because they are learning, does not trivialise their enjoyment and pleasure from playing! i spent quite some time in bronze, getting better. i played against people who sucked as much as i did (and i still do - only silver now), but mostly *we all had fun!* sure, we make mistakes that sometimes cost our team the game. sure, we sometimes get berserk and end up feeding. sure, we sometimes make really bad calls and someone with poor self control on our team ends up tilting. sure, sometimes someone else on our team decides not join our teamfight because I TAEK FORT NOW SYLV SO OP!!!!11!! sure, sometimes there is that moment of frustration when lucio is on speed boost instead of healing mode while the rest of the team are all losing health in the teamfight. sure, i sometimes sigh in frustration when my teammate lastpicks a second specialist instead of a much-needed support. *but we generally have fun anyway!* the condescending argument that ranked should be for people of sufficient skill only is sort of like saying that nobody should be allowed to play football (or cricket, or netball, or any team sport) until they are good enough. so no sunday leagues of amateur cricketers who enjoy the game should ever be tolerated. no children should be allowed to play sport at school (because let's face it - children are generally nowhere near perfect at their chosen sport). it must be remembered that ranked is an *amateur* league (i.e., non-professioonal and not for pay) where people play *for fun*. sure, at the higher leagues, the play has higher quality, but does it have higher enjoyment? please don't trivialise the sheer joy that us lower-ranked players gain from playing in our lower leagues as we slowly learn all the skills (and yes, learn those roles we pretty much suck at) that are needed to reach higher ranks. sport isn't about winning as much as it's about competing. and this is, after all, a game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>to balance for low ranks or higher ranks; or, where do the majority of the players fall?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-16 09:51:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>TLDR; does it matter that certain heroes are useless (or OP) at certain ranks? and which ranks should get the lion's share of the balancing efforts? i am a bronze/silver player (slowly climbing over time) and i rather enjoy this sub. it has helped me improve my play immensely and made the game far richer for me. however, it does seem rather skewed towards players in the higher ranks. not all that surprising, really. i have this to say, though: i see many discussions about heroes and how they should be balanced or changed or added, and what mechanics are awesome and which ones suck, and endless meta, and how some synergies are awesome or awful - you get the idea. nearly all these discussions seem to be from the perspective of high-ranked players; people who moan about being grouped with platinum players, people who intimately discuss how to execute mindbogglingly complex combos, people who expect a teammate to draft tassadar to support the already-picked tracer... but what percentage of the player base (in terms of raw player numbers, and perhaps also in terms of player hours or even money spend) are represented at various tiers? there is obviously an esports element which needs to be considered when balancing and creating content for the game - this is important to raise the profile of the game. but surely many of the decisions are based on the bulk of the player base? where is the money spend sitting? and is this bulk of players sitting in lower tiers? many of the discussions around "broken" heroes leave me astounded. they are perfectly balanced where i play. many "useless" heroes cause havoc in bronze and silver (and even when i play with gold friends). with little in-depth game knowledge at my level, a tassadar pick from a teammate results in the rest of the team sighing and rolling their eyes (because he just doesn't deliver at my our level), even though he a common first ban or pick in HGC. surely the game can have heroes that will be seriously played at certain ranks only? is it a bad thing if pros can never really pick the butcher when for so very many players he brings a lot of joy, fear, consternation, and satisfaction? i personally don't mind that much if some of the very, very many heroes don't really show up at all ranks all that often. as long as none of the heroes destroy all comers at a particular rank and break play at said rank. should all heroes (and mechanics) be viable at all levels? if the game is to be balanced for all ranks, which ranks should lose out most in the balancing? thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>good sites for builds?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-04 12:28:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>until recently i have been using [grubby's site](http://www.robogrub.com/builds), but lately the layout has changed for the worse and the links are often broken (links to heroesfire come up with no talents selected). i loved the old layout because it allowed quick switching between builds. i use [icy veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/) as well, but it is cumbersome to navigate (to see what other options on a given level are) and seems to have a bad rep with the reddit community (although i think most of the builds work for me). [heroes heart](https://heroeshearth.com/builds/), like [heroesfire](https://www.heroesfire.com/hots/guides), is not curated and it is hard to know which of the many builds submitted by different users are good and which are bad. ideally for me, a build site should * be quick and easy to navigate (no needless clicks, no multiple pages etc.) * have a way to see the other (non-selected) talents alongside the recommended talent pick (so i can compare for myself and make decisions based on situation) * have several (in most cases, two to three) builds for each hero - with easy navigation between builds (or even having them all on one visible page) * have good builds that work - be chosen by people who know a thing or two ;) * have a short paragraph or two highlighting playstyle of the build (and possible variations) * have a good, quick way to say what talents do (for when i'm watching pro games and have no idea what a talent does) * be up to date with the latest patches and reworks can you guys recommend me some sites please? they really do help me to learn a new hero, and expanding my hero pool is a big goal for me right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>three is not enough. especially if one wants to pair a skin with a reasonably matching mount, banner, spray etc. and we all know it is impossible to win in QM without the team having matching skins. and having to redo an entire loadout takes time. give us something like "add another loadout" so we can add as many as we wish. or at least a (most likely) quick and simple solution like more slots (maybe 10?). heck, even just moving the three slots from the hero to the skin would be an improvement (so each skin has three loadouts).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>4 Sisters Took Same Picture For 40 Years, Seeing Them Change Overtime Is Breathtaking | list in post, 39 clicks saved</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-28 12:44:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>[original article](https://web.archive.org/web/20180328124006/https://womens24x7.com/4-sisters-took-same-picture-for-40-years-seeing-them-change-overtime-is-breathtaking/) [album link](https://imgur.com/a/iIccp) What you are about to see below is a stunning example to see how time can transform people. In 1975, Nick Nixon, professor of photography at the Massachusetts College of Art, took a picture of his wife Bebe and her three sisters. They ranged from ages 15 to 25. Nixon and his subjects decided to recreate the family photograph every year. The sisters promised that even if they ended up in different parts of the world, they would meet to take the annual family photograph. Over the years, lifestyles, fashion and passions changed but they kept coming together to make the annual picture. There are two rules for the series: First, all four sisters would pose in the same order, Laurie, Heather, Bebe and Mimi, the youngest to the oldest. Second, Nixon would only pick one image to print per year. Nixon shared in 2011 his incredible work with the world. The project entitled  #8216;The Brown Sisters #8216; went on display in galleries around the world. Check out the 40 images below #8230; their transformations are incredible to see. At the time of their first picture together the sisters were 15, 21, 23 and 25 from left to right.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>some shower thoughts about how to help the player base learn the game more easily (and keep improving)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-09 11:17:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>maybe they XP can be made a bigger deal visually. when an enemy minion dies outside of XP range, have a visual splash on each player's screen saying something like *enemy minion died outside soak range, 70 XP missed*. when you die, have a splash showing the other team getting the XP value for your death. make the level-ups have a splash showing *RED TEAM LEVEL UP! +4% damage, +4% HP*. make the XP bars more prominent. have an option to turn all of these off, but have them on for new players by default. this idea can be taken further: maybe have coaching splash lines like *nobody soaking top lane!*. or in draft *no tank selected!*. have the current text line warning of enemy team talent advantages be bigger, and appear periodically instead of just once. when you die, give a summary of the death context: *2 allied team vs 4 enemy team. 45% health 56% mana at start of engagement. CCd for 2.3s in lead-up to death*. just some ideas, and they obviously need polishing/fleshing out, but i certainly would have learnt the game WAY quicker if i had feedback like this in my early days. heck, i'd still be learning way quicker. edit: just saw this [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8asoyy/not_knowing_how_to_soak_is_not_a_player_problem/) by /u/redditmademeregister</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-10-11 08:05:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>[bell curve thingy](https://imgur.com/a/exujIKS) i used the data from this [blizzard post](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/82p1h5/ranked_player_distribution/dvbzypz/). EDIT: /u/dcgregorya1 made a [pie chart ](https://imgur.com/a/DkL3Yit) of the same data. /EDIT in your discussions on this sub, try to remember that the vast majority (77%) of players are gold and lower, almost all (92%) are plat or lower, and almost none (1%) are masters or higher. the people that sustain the game's existence are mostly NOT masters or higher. there are many good reasons to balance the game for pro players and for the really, really good players in diamond+, but the game also has to serve its largest base! hero balance *must* take into account the fact that the majority need to be kept happy, as well as keeping the top (and most visible) level happy. this is not always easy to do and certain heroes are just going to end up not being viable at the majority level while others will not be viable at the top level. the lived experience of the vast majority of players does not revolve around "OMG! i got a person on my team who is in the same 1% bracket as i am and i think they SUCK!" (typical GM MM rant post). i am sure that the perceived skill difference is bigger between low masters and GM (1% difference in player base) than the perceived skill difference between silver 3 with 200 points and silver 3 with 340 points (crude calculation of 1% player base in silver), but funny things happen at the edge of bell curves and when you become so good at a game that *almost nobody else is at your skill level*, MM is bound to become less reliable. this is not an excuse for MM to be bad, but MM at lower levels (read: for nearly everyone playing the game) is pretty good (anecdotal evidence from my reams of bronze, silver, gold friends). we generally enjoy balanced clown fiesta games that often run 20 minutes or longer with forts falling on both sides and normally a chance to use STORM TALENTS! QM, UD, HL all seem to be pretty balanced in terms of matchmaking to me, but i do admit that there are significant problems in AI, as at all AI levels the games are pretty much a stomp nearly every time. TL;DR the game isn't perfectly balanced, matchmaking isn't perfect (especially at masters+), but it's in a pretty good space - especially for the vast masses that are on gold (plat) and lower (the ones who sustain the game).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>swearing in the show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-16 06:07:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>my wife and i have just started watching season one (two episodes so far) and are quite impressed with its quality. however, we are gentle folk, and the insane levels of swearing (particularly the f- and s- words) are such a distraction that the excellent storytelling, in-jokes, social commentary, and emotional connection is somewhat spoiled for us. we can handle "asshole" and the insults that are thrown around but every f-bomb makes us cringe. does the level of swearing get less as the show progreses? we are both keen to invest time into watching it, but if the swearing is this heavy throughout, we might switch to something else :( NOTE: this is not criticising swearing; people should have that choice. we just prefer not to be around it (and in we experience almost zero swearing outside of TV, so when it happens in a show, it is slien to our everyday lives).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>now that it is even easier to get skins, can we please have more loadout slots (preferably with improved functionality, too)?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-13 09:19:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>there are many of us who shudder at the thought of using a skin with a mismatched or colour-clashing mount, or a lore-inapproriate banner, or the default emojis, or without a synergising announcer, or... the list goes on (insert your own obsessive condition). setting up a loadout can take a minute or two. or three or four if it means having to purchase a new tint of a mount or the carbot spray or whatever. i have certain heroes who have more than three AWESOME skins (not even counting the tints), and i end up only really using three of the skins because setting up a new loadout takes time and creative energy. my horror nightmare is when my premade in QM wants skinergy and i have to hurriedly change a tint and the queue then pops *before i can match the mount*! and then i can hear the snickering when i get MVP and i have a pink banner with my red skin once the game ends. even worse, i can have a really great loadout set up that i then re-use for a different skin, and then when i want to use the first skin again *i can't remember the amazing loadout i had set up for it*! for me, THIS HAS A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN MAKING NEW SKINS! getting a new skin but then having to throw out using another awesome skin i already love because my loadout would suck - that is not cool. wishlist: * the ability to add more loadout slots would be great. or maybe tie the loadouts *to the skin and not the hero* so that each skin can have a few loadouts. * allow us to set the loadout choice to *random* (ie shoose randomly from our existing loadouts). * have a *random* option in each category (eg be able to choose a random announcer in a loadout). * add portraits to the loadout (with a default option to stay with the global portrait). * allow us to tag items and search by those tags when setting up a loadout.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-04-05 18:21:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>setting up a loadout takes time. matching the mount to the skin, getting a good banner to go with that, selecting a spray, deciding which announcer to put with it. when i have three awesome skins already owned for a hero, i feel no inclination to purchase a fourth, *because i would have to wipe over an existing loadout slot*. why are we limted to three only? surely it could work like just about any other list in the known computer universe - with an *add another loadout* button or something similar? at the very least, make each skin its own loadout. at least that way we could easily set each owned skin with matching mounts etc. although that still means having only one loadout for each skin. why isn't there an option in each section (skin, mount etc) for *random*? i want a random announcer with my loadout. as it is, each time i select a loadout, i have to open up the announcer tab and incrementthe announcer alongby one. painful, and not truly random. i would like to hear all the announcers i own, without having to manually advance them. why is there no option to assign a random loadout from the list of created loadouts? that way i get a changing loadout with each game on the same hero. if i set my hero choice to random in QM, why doesn't it pick one of my loadouts for the hero that gets randomly assigned? skins, mounts, sprays, banners - these things are awesome. but i end up never using so many of my skins etc, because i can't set up loadouts for them. i'm sitting on 20k shards, 260k gold, and 2k gems - but i can't bring myself to spend any of that on cosmetics, *because i would have to sacrifice some other awesome cosmetics to use them*. when events come, i get sad, because even thought the new cosmetics are usually amazing (cyberpunk chromie!), i just can't bring myself to spend mopney on them, because of the loadout issue. TL;DR give us more loadouts so we can buy more skins, mounts and other cosmetics and actually use them in a visually complementatry fashion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>instead of accomplishing nothing other than ruining 9 other people's game each time you play, why don't you take me up on this challenge: **find a bronze player and COACH them to GM level. you're allowed to duo/team with them in QM/UD, but they have to play ranked without you.** on stream you babysit the player while in-game with them and give constructive, non-toxic feedback which they can use to improve their ranked play. do some replay analysis with them. show them exercises to do in try mode. anaylse their playstyle and make hero recommendations. discuss talent builds for various scenarios. i'm sure you could come up with many more things. make it a season-long challenge. heck, get some of your GM buddies all to pick a bronzeling (find a good set of criteria for picking legit bronzelings) and compete to see who can get their ward to the highest rank by season's end. at least that way you would raise the standard of play in HotS, and you can then show that it *is* possible to climb no matter who one is *if one improves one's play*. i'd watch that all day long: i get to see your awesome skills, and i get to see how you think, and i get to learn from you so much more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>not in my experience. i feel like the vast majority of my games go to 20 for both teams. my average game length this season in SL (77 games) is 19:28 (only 5 fewer than 15:00) - a fairly even mix of solo and group (2 to 5); my last 100 QM games this season have averaged 20:39 with only 6 shorter than 15:00. my friends and i frequently find ourselves commenting on how good a game has been, win or lose, due to the back-and-forth and general competitiveness of our games. it is rare indeed for me to play with a random, look up their winrate this season, and see that their winrate is more than  #177;2% from 50%. even games where my team has a wide range of ranks (we're friends even if we're wildly divergent in our skill levels) have a roughly 50% winrate and only the occasional stomp. my games feature players from bronze average to plat/diamond average (the latter are naturally quite hard for us to win as my silver rank doesn't factor into the matchmaking but they are still fun and compelling enough for us to play them! * roughly 50% winrate in all formats - check * games that aren't 10 minute stomps - check * back-and-forth ebbs and flows in compelling tussles - check i know Cris is Cris, but even his games seem not to be stomps, despite his ludicrous winrates. level 20 happens in a large number of his games. sure, the odd stomp happens but i find watching his stream compelling viewing, with structures (often keeps) falling on both teams.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TL;DR **can we have more loadouts so that we can buy more of your awesome skins and easily use them?** the artists create so many amazing skins, mounts, sprays and even banners. there are so many amazing announcers. THANK YOU!!! however, i find myself not using most of the skins i own; and i definitely don't purchase more skins for a hero when i have more than three skins already! **we only have three loadouts per hero!!!** i find it so sad when i own three amazing skins for a hero and another one comes out for an event. i am disincentivised from buying it. it takes a fair amount of time to match a skin to a mount, to find a good banner to match, to decide on the perfect spray to complement it all. when my three loadouts are already set up for a hero, a new skin means i have to lose one of my existing loadouts :( it doesn't help that the tags on many of the sprays seem utterly random and nonsensical, either. **please** can we: * get more loadout slots (ideas - some better than others: an *add loadout* button; a loadout for every skin, the list of three being extended to [bigger number]; i'm sure there are other options, too) * get *random* as an option in each of the categories (eg one can choose to have the announcer random) * can we get an option to select a random loadout from our existing loadouts * have autoselect (and brawl) choose from our existing loadouts. it is a well-known fact that good skinergy improves winrate, and that a poorly matched skin and mount reduces winrate. make it easy for us to enjoy the amazing artwork, please! any chance of any of this happening?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-06-19 14:14:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>i am finding the contest mode for the AMA thread highly frustrating. there are currently 718 comments on the post, and they sort randonly every time i have another look at the thread. i feel that in previous AMAs, the popular questions got voted up fairly quickly and it was easy for people to see that the question they wanted to ask had already been asked. as it stands now, i have come across many, many duplicate questions. i can't help but feel that the contest mode has relegated to obscuity many worthwhile questions. how are the devs going to answer the wuestions? are they going to scroll through over 700 (possibly way more, as they comments are increasing all the time)? i have little faith that any comments are likely to get many upvotes due to the random nature of the sorting. there are already mecanisms in reddit to sort by new, rising, top, hot etc. i think this allows for most comments to be esaily seen, while allowing the more popular questions to be voted to the top. additionally, i started collapsing each thread on my home PC as i viewed it to keep track, but now i will have to *uncollapse* each once the AMA is live. additionally, collpasing does not transfer to other devices, which is super annoying and makes it not feasible for me to know whether i have seen a comment when on my phone or laptop. i *could* upvote or downvote each comment as i read them, but that would be abusing the downvote - it would also not allow a neutral "i read this" marker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it doesn't work all the time, but i have had good results with this: take ownership of the team. use superior EQ skills to resonate with the goals of your teammates. get good at saying (if you get 3 or 4 team mates into team voice, it's an easy win) or typing things like: * next objective in 35 seconds, stay alive. we set trap and destroy them as they arrive one by one. * wait for me top lane at tower - lure [enemy laner] close and we get easy gank. * careful [top]! incoming gank. [danger ping] - meet at our hard camp, i come help you get quick mercs. * guys, we're beating them. keep soaking safely. [toplane] we are coming in 30 seconds to gank [enemy laner] - hang ten. * unlucky with that death, dude. tried to get to you to peel. we'll get it right next time - just hold on a sec for me before going that deep. * it's late game now. let's make a ball of death and crush them as they run around solo. warning alone doesn't help nearly as much as warning and giving an alternative option. i find that my teammates feed because they have nothing to do other than freeze a lane and they think they need to do more (like steal that enemy camp - *seriously, they'll never suspect i'm doing that!*). i start games off with: * play safe guys. let's soak all lanes and get a good XP lead. we can crush them at talent-lead teamfights then. * wait for the tank to engage. we wait for enemy to make mistakes and then pounce. i also /w selected teammates that i can ally with: * i think [feeding teammate] is a little overeager. let's group with him and help keep him alive. we can get value that way. * just ignore [salty teammate]. i just muted him. let's prove him wrong by winning this. if there is a specific teammate that is dying a lot, i make a point of sticking with them (i play mainly tank) and asking the healer to stick with us. then lots of retreat pings and things like, "wait a sec, i flank and stun then you destroy them."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i played in the first two weeks and got there too late to make it into the third week. it was really amazing to be a part of it. thank you to notparadox for hosting it. the team discussions pre-game were rich and showed intent to win. people quickly prganised who who play what role, who would call shots, what our basic strategy would be. in-game there was usually some sort of cohesion to the strategy, and teammates listened to calls and pings. rotations happened, objectives were skipped to get value elsewhere, fights were avoided; it felt good. one strategy that ended up dominating (from my perspective) was a 5-man deathball from about level 15/16. the lost soak seemed to be more than made up through kills on the enemy team, as long as the deathball team used the advantage well after the kills. i have played with higher skill-level (all the way up to diamond and master) friends a lot, and i am confident that our play would have won games in plat on a few occasions :)</TEXT>

EDIT: i ran a quick spreadsheet (because i'm like that) winrates as tank: * 1-stack: 49.09%, 55 games * 2-stack: 28.57%, 07 games * 3-stack: 36.84%, 19 games * 4-stack: 75.00%, 16 games * 5-stack: 62.50%, 16 games turns out my perception was pretty far from the truth.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-29 12:20:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>may we *please* get more loadout slots? i know it was mentioned in the most recent AMA that this is unlikely to happen, but let me ask anyway. skins are awesome. mounts are awesome. sprays and banners are awesome. however, they can look messy and awkward when paired poorly. it can take a while to find the mount that perfectly complements a skin and even longer to find a good spray and banner. i find that once my three loadouts are full, i have a far diminished desire to get any additional skins for a hero, which is a real shame. i know that i will have to reuse an existing slot for the new skin and then i won't end up using the skin that was previously in the loadout :( **the requests (some easier to implement than others)** * at the bare minimum, could we get the number of slots increased to more than three per hero? this seems a simple #8482;, quick QoL change. other solutions to the number of loadout slots would be including an *add loadout* button, or giving a loadout slot to each skin. * could we also have a *random* option for each loadout option, so that one could have a random cosmetic (announcer, for example) picked for that loadout? * can we get an option for each loadout item where a random cosmetic is picked from a number of pre-selected (as in ticked a checkbox on it) cosmetics? * can we have an option to pick a random loadout from the ones we have set up? * can we have autoselect use one of the loadouts we have set up? thank you TL;DR skins are awesome. please give us more loadout slots so we can more easily use these awesome skins without looking like shabby children dressed in mismatched outfits by their colourblind great-uncle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>is there any chance we can get more loadout slots? is there some technical reason preventing more being added per hero? there have been a number of posts recently on the the subreddit with suggestions to improve loadout functionality, but even just increasing the slots to 5 or 10 would be welcome. there are so many awesome skins and there are many of us that take a lot of pleasure in creating good skinergy with mounts and banners and sprays.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the players who play different game modes do so because those modes satisfy what they are looking for. QM lets people play their favourite hero (which is more important to some people than a balanced game), unranked gives a draft with no performance anxiety, ranked gives a more competitive exeprience, brawl gives a teamfight fiesta... i play a lot of AI with my young nephews, and believe me, there are plenty of people who LOVE the game mode (and play on beginner through veteran). some people just aren't looking for a competitive exeprience. try joining a 1 hour AI farm: it's chill, the team is on voice and just hanging out. there is laughter and chatting and some goofing about. it's not even remotely competitive, but there are plenty who just want a semi-mindless activity that they can enjoy to wind down after a rough day.</TEXT>
