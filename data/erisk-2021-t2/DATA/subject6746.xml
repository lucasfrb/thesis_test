I belive economics should not just be about the numbers, it should be about the people's well being and a Balenced budget. I belive in a Progressive tax system where reductions in you taxes are possible of you meet certain criteria, if you have more then two children you get a small reduction and the precentage of reductions increases by how many kids you have. So if you have 4 kids The reduction is 0,5 then of you have that plus two its another reduction (you wont get anymore reductions after 10 kids) Education: Education should be free from beginning to end. And Traditonal values and important virtues should be thought to children, Sex education should be fully thought to kids age 13 and over. With the value of motherhood, the rejection of decadence, respect to others and themselves thought to girls. While fatherhood, the rejection of decadence, honor, respect and kindness to themselves and others Is thought to boys. And what i mean with "the rejection of decadence" is for girls not being a slut and actually having respect for their bodies, and not throwing themselves at everyone. While for guys its not being Toxic and a total piece of shit. Immigration: Immigration should be restricted to people of the same race and ethnicity as the people of x country. The immigrants that are already here in Europe and America who are not Europeans, they and their kids should be deported. Feminism: Women should not be allowed in the workplace, except for being sicentists, _who doesn't want robot arms?_</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-27 12:13:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Without the pod being the obvious choices of Germany winning WWI and a stronger Fascist movement in the 20's-30's One way i can think of, is if Friedrich Wilhelm IV accepted the Title of "Emperor of all Germans" And with the revolutionaries taking over Germany in Friedrich's name, which leads to a more liberal Germany allying with The UK against France and Russia, France and Russia then lose that war and become unstable, France then turns to a Ultra-Nationalist ideology like fascism but with "french characteristics". Any suggestions? Is the timeline i came up with above, Good?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>#(RANT) YouTube constantly demonetizes videos that talk about extremist Ideologies or historical events, just because they words like Strasserism, Fascism, stalinism or war in it. Even though these videos don't promote these Ideologies or wars, just discuss them. Things like this and a billion other problems is why YouTube will die as a website in the near future. #Thanks wojcicki!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Fuck Liberals" rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-19 07:16:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Serious) Fuck Liberals, Fuck Biden, Fuck everyone who voted Biden Ok, maybe I should save this for tomorrow, but I am so fucking devastated right now. Jesus fucking Christ, the fact that Biden has any chance, let alone being the predicted nominee at this point is absurd. Remember when it seemed for a while that Roy Moore was going to lose the Alabama Senate race to a democrat, because he's a fucking paedophile, but then to the surprise of all the liberals who thought Republicans still had decency, it turned out that they're completely willing to stand behind our guy. Well congrats democrats on proving yourselves no fucking better. Congrats on proving that you're willing to elect someone whose behaviour around women is comparable to that of Jimmy fucking Saville. Congrats on proving that some borderline dementia patient who stands for absolutely nothing, and probably isn't even sane enough to run for president is your choice. But y'know, every democratic darling was completely unfit for presidency. National Service Pete, aka mr "I get funding from the state department and CIA, and will likely bomb and coup any country I'm told to", Bloomberg, for whom apparently stop and frisk programs are "discriminatory towards whites" because in his vision of a world your skin colour is a crime(Who has 40 outstanding sexual harassment cases by the way, because systemic rape and misogyny is what our entire civilisation is built on). Biden was the tip of the fucking iceberg for these people. In any sane democracy, the fact that there's any chance of two sex-pests barely able to form coherent sentences running against each other would be absurd. The so called "Moderate Democrat" is a hate-driven ideological extremist who will rally behind their fashy leaders just the same as the alt-right. They try and smear us as hateful extremists and ideologues because it's sheer projection. They know full well they have no conviction, an inability to compromise, and hate for anyone who disagrees with them. It's well known that fascists have a tendency to fall in line behind their leaders right and wrong because they're driven more by hate and insecurity in their position on social hierarchy. Well congrats on proving yourselves as fascists, you liberal scumbags. You've proven that you hate us leftists so much that you will rally behind Joe Fucking Biden, who is by all metrics the most incompetent leader you could, just to spite us and to maintain your fucking starbucks lattes and wall street yuppie jobs. The far-left on the other hand splinters itself a hundred times over minor ideological differences. Do you know why?, Because we actually fucking care, we actually believe in something. We're the ones who are willing to compromise on our positions out of pragmatism, we're the ones who are willing I'm sick and fucking tired of the sheer vitriol and hate I get for being one of the few ACTUALLY moderate people out here. Because the far-left IS the moderate, yet every single time I try and compromise my position and rally behind a candidate half-way between my beliefs and the status quo, I get treated like an invader whose destroying your parties from the inside, and responsible for all your problems. I'm fucking tired of the vitriol liberals have towards leftists, to the extent that they'll back Joe Biden just to fucking spite us, blame us on their inevitable loss to Trump, claim w'ere invading THEIR party that they apparently have a god-given right to maintain as the status quo, and treating us like toxic trash to be discarded because we don't support the murder of Yemeni children, or people dying from lack of healthcare. You know whose going to win this election if it comes between Biden and Trump?, Saudi Arabia. Because our only chance of having a president who actually wants world peace will be fucking ruined. Dear Liberals, Dear Biden Voters: You may start noticing that you're being haunted by the ghosts of dead Yemeni children, bombed in the ongoing total war waged by Saudi Arabia which makes no distinction between civilians and military personnel. Any future wars in the Middle East are your fault. Our continued support of Saudi Arabia in their genocidal campaign will be your fault. The next refugee crisis will be your fault. That's what you get for not voting for peace. You get bombed children. As a pacifist, I have to say: I fucking hate all of you. All of you are as bad as George W fucking Bush. The CIA are going to keep building up unlimited, unquestioned power to terrorise American citizens with, countries you can't even point out on a map will get invaded. Enjoy the slow decline in to tyranny that the US has been facing for decades now. Hope you enjoy being spied on by the NSA. And when the time finally comes that all the war and poverty and climate disaster is too much, and the National Guard start arresting dissidents on the street, because of the unchecked power of authoritarian warmongers is what causes all that fucking shit: You could have stopped this, but instead you chose to be fascists.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Fuck Gorbachev" rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-19 07:18:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>(Serious) Fuck Reformists, Fuck Gorbachev, Fuck everyone who supported Gorbachev Ok, maybe I should save this for tomorrow, but I am so fucking devastated right now. Cyka Blyat comrades, the fact that Gorbachev has any chance, let alone being the predicted General Secretary at this point is absurd. Remember when it seemed for a while that Enrico Berlinguer was going to lose the Italian Communist race to an orthodox Marxist, because he's a fucking revisionist, but then to the surprise of all the rightists who thought the eurocoms still had decency, it turned out that they're completely willing to stand behind our guy. Well congrats reformists on proving yourselves no fucking better. Congrats on proving that you're willing to select someone whose adherence to the international communism is comparable to that of Earl fucking Browder. Congrats on proving that some nobody Komsomol cadet who stands for absolutely nothing, and probably isn't even old enough to run for General Secretary is your choice. But y'know, every CPSU darling was completely unfit for leadership. Eduard Shevardnadze aka comrade "nationalism is actually really cool and lets give farms back to fucking kulaks", Alexander Yakovlev, for whom Brezhev Doctrine interventions are "imperialist quashing of dissent" because in his vision of a world socialist solidarity is a crime(Who has a personal friendship with Pierre Trudeau by the way, because sucking up to capitalists is what our beloved Soviet Union is built on these days). Gorbachev was the tip of the fucking iceberg for these people. In any sane socialist republic, the fact that there's any chance of two chauvinists barely able to engage in coherent dialects competing against each other would be absurd. The so called "Soviet reformer" is a hate-driven ideological extremist who will rally behind their fashy leaders just the same as the capitalists. They try and smear us as anti-soviet hardliners and ideologues because it's sheer projection. They know full well they have no conviction, an inability to adhere to orthodox Marxism, and hate for anyone who stands up for actually-existing socialism. It's well known that fascists have a tendency to fall in line behind their leaders right and wrong because they're driven more by hate and insecurity in their position on social hierarchy. Well congrats on proving yourselves as fascists, you reformist scumbags. You've proven that you hate us orthodox Marxists so much that you will rally behind Mikhail Fucking Gorbachev, who is by all metrics the most incompetent leader you could, just to spite us and to maintain your fucking East German washing machines and Moscow nomenklatura jobs. The anti-revisionist left on the other hand splinters itself a hundred times over minor ideological differences. Do you know why? Because we actually fucking care, we actually believe in something. We're the ones who are willing to compromise on our positions out of pragmatism, we're the ones who are willing I'm sick and fucking tired of the sheer vitriol and hate I get for being one of the few ACTUALLY reformist people out here. Because the anti-revisionist left IS reformist, yet every single time I try and compromise my position and rally behind an apparatchik half-way between my beliefs and the young guard, I get treated like an invader whose destroying the politburo from the inside, and responsible for all your problems. I'm fucking tired of the vitriol reformists have towards anti-revisionists, to the extent that they'll back Mikhail Gorbachev just to fucking spite us, blame us on the the Socialist Bloc's inevitable collapse to liberalisation and chauvinism, claim w'ere invading THEIR party and that they apparently have a empirical right to destroy the status quo, and treating us like toxic trash to be discarded because we don't support running away from Afghanistan, or people dying from reduced production quotas. You know whose going to win this cold war if it comes between Gorbachev and Reagan? Iran. Because our only chance of having a General Secretary who actually wants world socialism will be fucking ruined. Dear reformists, Dear revisionist traitors: You may start noticing that you're being haunted by the ghosts of dead East German children, starved in the ongoing total war waged by the capitalists on the Soviet model of socialism. Any future counter-revolutionary uprisings are your fault. Our lapsed support of Afghanistan in their struggle against the Muhjadeen will be your fault. The next Prague Spring will be your fault. That's what you get for not backing actually-existing socialism. You get counter-revolutionaries. As a true socialist, I have to say: I fucking hate all of you. All of you are as bad as Andrey fucking Vlasov. The chauvinists are going to keep building up unlimited, unquestioned power to terrorise Soviet citizens with, ASSRs you can't even point out on a map will start wanting independence. Enjoy the slow decline in to dissolution that the USSR has been facing for decades now. Hope you enjoy cleaning floors for the capitalists. And when the time finally comes that all the war and poverty and insurrection is too much, and chauvinist paramilitaries start bombing Soviet soldiers in their barracks, because of the unchecked power of anti-communist wreckers is what causes all that fucking shit: You could have stopped this, but instead you chose to be fascists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"Economics: I believe that capitalism is the best system we have right now and that communism only leads to Oppression and loss of economic freedom. But we shouldn #8217;t strive for 100% laissez faire capitalism, because that will lead to a degenerate culture of materialism. i also believe that some elements of different socialist, and other economic ideological thought should be implemented. Like giving workers representation in corporations, giving them a seat at the board of directors, which has to be at least 10%. the rest can be decided by the creator of the company, But economics in my ideology would be a openl, so that the system that best suites the people and the nation is what gets implemented, i like to call this populist economics, where like i said what best suites the people and the nation from state to state should be implemented. #160; # Welfare, Laws and Regulations: Welfare, laws and regulations should be as extensive as needed to protect the people, Welfare should exist but should actively push the people on it to pursue jobs with, measures like propaganda and benefits for workers, would be used to incentivize working, and getting a job, setting up interviews and forcing them to actually try should also be a tactic. Laws should be as extensive as needed to protect the people, the other unnecessary laws shouldn't exist, #160; basically the same thing for regulations to. # Social issues: I believe that most immigration to a country should be from ethnically and culturally similar nations and peoples, but actual real refugees should go to the nearest stable country, that offers asylum, and if they have to go to a far away nation they should be kept in designated places and get protection from the state. While economic migrants shouldn #8217;t be allowed to come here, and those that are already here should be deported, and if they have broken the law (Depending on how serious the crime is) should either be deported opr executed, an example of a non-serious crime would be taking drugs (But if you dealt or forced someone else to take drugs you should be  #8220;Dealt with #8221;), while as an example rapists should be tortured and executed. #160; Traditionalism, Nationalism and Social collectivism should be taught in every school, with Christian values, aligning with the virtues that would be important to teach to kids, while a few other values would be taught with the other virtues, #160; like, discipline, keeping to Traditional gender roles, except for jobs like being a scientist, because it would be everyone's duty to advance the nation, and keeping away from degenerate behaviours, what i mean by degenerate behaviours, i mean flaunting your private parts in someone's face, or obstructing someone's personal space. #160; # Freedom vs Security: I think everyone has a right to freedom of speech, and private property, and privacy and all that other stuff, i think that freedom of speech should only be restricted in politeness, or if it isn't the right moment to say something,but this depends on the context. #160; # Foreign policy: Foreign countries shouldn #8217;t be invaded if not to liberate a people from a degenerate force like modern progressivism, Communism or liberating a ethnically similar people, but peace should be sought in every outcome as to keep man from killing himself, and nations that align ideologically with our values should be befriended, Nations with similar values, cultures and ethnicities should form economic unions, while a A-political union like the UN should be formed to try and keep the peace in the world. #160; #160; # Administration and Government and use of Technology: #160; #160; I would want a government in the style of the US government except a little more decentralised and more parliamentary, with councils overseeing the process in each state or country (Depending on if you want a federal or confederal system) These councils should have priests, scientists, Government officials, and military officials, Technocrats, And people educated in government, business and military tactics in them. Technology should be used for the good of the people and the Nation state, as an example state owned dating websites should be used to help new stable families form, and other dating websites should be banned if they don't align with our values. While realistic video games should be invested in and should be used to teach kids, and teens, knowledge that they should know depending on the course they have chosen, so kids get introduced to these while teens get to play the ones that teach what you should know depending on the course you picked, as an example, someone that picks a military education gets taught by playing realistic strategy games (And in other ways to).

Why do Socialists support mass immigration, when it decreases the native's wages and makes the immigrants "almost-slaves" too the international Capitalist system? # 3. Why do Socialists support atheism, when atheism is entrenched in Individualist-Capitalist thought? # 4. Why don't Socialists use religions (which are usually Communal in nature opposed to the individualist thought of atheism) to their advantage? # 5. Why do Socialists adopt Socially Progressive ideas, which are based on Individualism, when Socially Conservative ideas are based on communalism (which can be easily adapted into collectivism)?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-12 21:04:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>_The coronavirus comes out as lesbian, and makes a statement, that it's disgusted by trump's recent actions. Which is the reason why it's going to go home to China, and cry it self to sleep._ _After this development, Trump's approval rating among males and teens, skyrockets too 100%, with many of these brave young men and women coming out in support of trump's actions. And a new movement is started (called #dicksouttooMAGA). DOT-MAGA then goes on too take on the nofap movement, and destroys anti fapists. With this new found support, trump goes even more too the extreme (in both directions) and declares the America first movement, a Conservative Socialist movement. After this declaration, trump declares his support for Medicare for all, weed, closed borders, deportations of all immigrants, both legals and illegals._ _After that whole thing, Ivanka comes out as gay, and starts a Conservative only fans MAGA account, with Ben Shapiro's sister (and wife). This new account then with the help of DOT-MAGA racks up 69 trillion dollars in the first 420 hours. Trump then takes this money and pays back the debt, increases the welfare state and pays off all student loans. He also uses this money too fund mass republican campaigns in every single corner of America. After this both Biden and Bernie come out as DOT-MAGA supporters, and throw their support behind Donald trump. This then Leads to several democratic politicans coming out as DOT-MAGAs, with the anti DOT-MAGA, Republicans and Democrats forming a Opposition party._ _Coming November and all other state and local elections the Neo-Republicans win everything except for the richest and most religious parts of America. Leading to trump being declared Eternal emperor of the United States of Coom. And everyone in USC lives happily ever after, with everyone having a minimum salary of 200k a year._ Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureWhatIf/comments/gigq93/fwi_what_would_happen_if_donald_trump_completely/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share Context:  gt;FWI] What would happen if Donald Trump, completely out of his own will, posts a video to twitter of him jerking his cock with a flesh light?

    <TEXT>It's the truth. After the fall of the Kaiserreich after WW1. A strong Monarchy in Germany became basically impossible. And the only way Monarchism would come back would be riding on the back of some other Nationalist movement, with the Monarchy having next to zero power. And especially when it comes to fucking Hitler, who had a obvious like-hate relationship with the Monarchy (more like cordial-hate but ehh). And even if he re-established the Monarchy, he would give it no power, and if the Kaiser killed Hitler, Hitler's bodyguards would kill him. And Hitler's followers wouldn't pledge allegiance to the Kaiser, and would start a civilwar against the Monarchists, which the largely unpopular Monarchy would lose.</TEXT>

It is not a far stretch at all to say he #8217;s ultra nationalistic. That's not at all Ultra-Nationalistic, that just makes him a "Nationalist"/Isolationist on the diplomatic spectrum. While he's only a Civic "'Nationalist"" on the cultural one. Which means he's not a Ultra-Nationalist, or a real Nationalist in general for that matter. At most he's Nationalist-lite.  gt;He is against regulation of the free market and is a business owner, he is def corporatist. And yet again another Leftist who doesn't understand what "Corporatism" fucking means. Corporatism basically is Welfare Capitalism, but more statist and class-collaborationist, with national trade unions.  gt;His speaking of the police in Portland as  #8220;doing many great things #8221; whilst using tear gas and non lethal guns and bats on peaceful protesters is very authoritarian. It's at most statist. Because of the amount of shit the protestors have burned down and destroyed. A real Totalitarian or Authoritarian would've killed them on the spot and arrested all critical journalists.  gt;He also banned travel from nations of other religions for their religion, Again Civ-"Nat" on the cultural axis. A real Ultra-Nationalist or Fascist would've at best deported all of the non white migrants. And at worst genocided them.  gt;and has increased military spending drastically, whilst doing whatever he wants with executive order after executive order. That's a little statist.  gt;He checks out on your checklist, Nope, not even fucking close.  gt;is at least a moderate prefascist, if not a fascist. He's not a Pre-Gascist or a Fascist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Immigration: Illegal aliens currently in the United States should be given amnesty temporarily to allow them to get their affairs in order so they can apply for citizenship or leave in an orderly manner. After the amnesty period, deportations for those who didn #8217;t comply will continue. Immigration should be based on productivity/ability to contribute (labor skill and education in specific) and stricter citizenship standards should be imposed to ensure assimilation into the greater culture. I will say that ICE needs a better handle and oversight on it. Children should not be separated from their parents, and living conditions in deportation centers should be vastly improved for the sake of making us look less like barbarians. Socially left-wing.  gt;Economics: see my previous posts, but a mixed economy with government guidance to meet the goals of the nation domestically and abroad. Large corporations should be taxed more heavily with less tax loopholes, and the wealthy elites should be taxed based on a parabola that increases exponentially with the more uninvested income they hoard. (Tax relief could come if the income is invested in public works or philanthropy.) Broad Economic leftism.  gt;Abortion: Should be illegal unless someone #8217;s life is in danger or the fetus won #8217;t have a viable chance at living or living without considerable difficulty. Adoption should be officially encouraged, and sex education should be improved to actually cover safe sex to prevent  #8220;unwanted #8221; pregnancy. Birth control should be widely available at health departments, and people should be educated regarding voluntary, unpaid sterilization (vasectomies and such) if they should consider that they don #8217;t want children at all. Socially Conservative.  gt;Women #8217;s rights: women should have equal rights to men in all regards, though concepts of motherhood and other traditional values should be honored in society while also respecting women in trades and service to the country (seeing as everyone should be capable of making America greater). Socially left-wing. A little closer to the center.  gt;Healthcare: covered previously, but in short, basic healthcare should be free. Life-saving surgeries and medications should be available at no cost (insulin, etc) and regular health checkups should be available from health departments nationwide under a national network. Elective procedures will not be free unless sufficient danger to one #8217;s health is noted by a physician. Those can be covered by supplementary insurance, which will still be handled by the private sector. Mental health would also be legally obligated to be covered under these plans in some way or form. Welfare Capitalism.  gt;Education: state funded through year four of college or trade certification with exceptions. Younger students should be taught basic educational skills, though more focus should be brought to national civics and values to reinforce patriotism. Secondary school should begin testing students for aptitude, either recommending them for further academic study or trade work. Academic study outside what the country  #8220;needs #8221; will be funded based on academic merit through state tuition grants as to allow the gifted but disadvantaged a chance to succeed while screening individuals out to prevent market saturation. Six months of community service will be required upon graduation with a stipend provided for living expenses (not considering universal income). Welfare Capitalism to regulated Capitalism.  gt;Welfare: see above. Existing safety nets would be continued to ensure the elderly and disabled aren #8217;t forced into a competitive job market where more capable individuals are needed. Individuals receiving long-term welfare income must relocate (with government compensation) or perform community service to public works if asked by the government as to maintain their productivity to society. Short-term unemployment would still be a stopgap but would not lead to indefinite welfare receipt. Universal income is considered as an alternative, though it would only be something someone could get by on instead of living luxuriously (based on local cost of living, of course). Food supplements would be provided, though only certain items would be allowable for purchase on this system, and it would all come on a TANF card as current. Community service to public works would still be required for a brief period, though with universal income, there would be no need for them to receive a stipend. Welfare Capitalism.  gt;Gay marriage: abolish marriage as a government institution and instead replace it with private contracts of religious and secular orientation. Religious objections would be taken into consideration as to prevent clergy from being forced to violate their morals, though secular marriages could be performed per the stipulations of the contract that bound the marriage without a minister. (I had that debate with myself when SCOTUS decided on the legality of the gay marriage ban, and I would prefer it that way to keep my religious rights from being stepped on in all cases.) Socially moderate.  gt;Trans rights: Effectively, trans individuals would have the same legal protections from discrimination that any other group or minority has. Seems vague, I know, but I prefer to view people professionally based on their merits, anyway. Medically, any surgeries or treatments relating to transition should be funded through supplementary insurance as any other elective procedure not necessary to maintain one #8217;s heartbeat voluntarily. Staunchly Socially Liberal.  gt;Foreign policy: somewhat isolationist, at least on the surface. Only keep to ourselves and close allies. Intervention should only be an option when it directly affects us. Military presence in foreign countries should be scaled back, though I do believe the United States should maintain its carrier fleet in the event it is needed. Foreign trade should be limited mainly to exports until autarky can be generally achieved. If not autarky, achieve greater integration with Canada and Mexico while fostering positive sentiments in both nations through propaganda and diplomatic influence. That being said, the United States should also act more aggressively against hostile powers and actively undermine them when direct military action is not required (action through proxies, stirring unrest and so forth). Ideally, US economic interests should also be majority-controlled by US-based investors, as well. Moderate Isolationism.  gt;BONUS! Gun rights: Every citizen should maintain their right to bear arms, though in the event of a hostile invasion, every citizen should expect to be levied to fight off foreign invaders. Automatic weapons aren #8217;t necessary if you #8217;re a good shot, but the FOPA and other acts that gouge the prices of automatic weapons should be repealed to allow citizens to properly arm instead of bloating a military-industrial complex. Citizen militias should be allowed to form, though the government should maintain the right to disband or regulate them as necessary. Also, self-defense and whatnot. Libertarian. You're too Socially moderate to be a Conservative, and too Socially Liberal too be a Liberal. And you're definitely not at all close to Fascism or most National Conservative Ideologies. So I'd say that you're a more Socially moderate Social Democrat/Neo-liberal, which basically is "third way" (not to be confused with Third positionism).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I #8217;m still going for Paternal Conservative, to be honest. Neoliberalism and it #8217;s encouragement of trickle-down nonsense got the world into the mess it #8217;s in today. Not a fan of globalism either, just on the principle that we shouldn #8217;t be bound to what other countries see fit. We have a duty to act towards our best interest, though it can be a common goal with anyone. I don #8217;t see any point to ethnonationalism in an American context, but I am still a staunch advocate of civic nationalism in the idea that our culture defines us as a people. Well you're a not a Social Conservative, as you're only Conservative on abortion. And Neo-liberalism in my view is Regulated Capitalism.  gt;And to explain my views on social rights, I would argue its pragmatism rather than progressivism. Everyone should have a nice balance of rights just to ensure all sides are politically satisfied enough to maintain the stability of the nation as a whole. I don #8217;t care for progressivism as it tends to blindly run forward in most cases when most people are a little slower to follow. Ehh, still you're too Socially Liberal to be a Conservative. So you're most likely just a anti abortion Social Democrat.</TEXT>

Can you rate them on how close they're percentage wise to your economic Ideology?: [Communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) -- [Socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) -- [Corporatism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) -- [Welfare Capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_capitalism#:~:text=Welfare%20capitalism%20is%20also%20the,in%20the%20mid%2D20th%20century.) -- [Regulated Capitalism/Economic Social Liberalism/Neo-liberalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism#:~:text=Social%20liberalism%2C%20also%20known%20as,of%20civil%20and%20political%20rights.) -- [Capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism#:~:text=Capitalism%20is%20an%20economic%20system,price%20system%20and%20competitive%20markets.) -- [Laissez-Faire Capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)  gt;The economic growth for my is not important and I'm against a uncontrolled growth. But economic growth is a good thing as it increases the wages of the workers.  gt;I'm also an isolation and I like the neutrality of Switzerland. Isolationist*  gt;As you saw the test I'm a sort of decelerazionist, the state must reduce the budget of research especially the space research. Technological decelerationism.  gt;I support a free universal healthcare. Welfare Capitalism.  gt;I support free education even the university. Welfare Capitalism.  gt;The school must teach the values of the nation and his history. It's* would you teach any particular Ideological values?  gt;All Religion can coexist with the state if they follow the rules. Secularism.  gt;Woman of course have the same right as men(*). So you wouldn't at least promote Traditional gender roles?  gt;The state must posses the monopoly of violence and guns. What?  gt;Gays can have a "state marriages". So civil unions and not religious marriages?  gt;Trans can't be recognised as a third type of gender but the can have the same rights. Would you allow them to "'"transition""?  gt;I'm totally in favour with abortion, even if the fetus is at the 8'th month, the state must guarantee the right of not giving the birth. Socially far left.  gt;I also liked a lot the Chinese policies of 1 child, and I see the importance of the reduction of population in the world. The world population is going to naturally stop at 10-11 billion. The only population problems that exist are within White western nations and some Asian countries. And those are shrinking problems, not "growth problems".  gt;I'm totally in favour of a punitive measures, if a person commits a very bad crime he must be deported in labour cam like gulag of internation camp. Authoritarian.  gt;I would give the same right to the animals, animals should have the right to live a decent life and to be respected. Pro animal rights.</TEXT>

Even if you can never understand why someone would be trans, why can't you respect them? Because they're fighting a useless fight, 'cause you can't change your sex, and your biological sex is the only thing that matters when it comes to being a man or woman. So the only viable option they have is to try to accept themselves, and if that doesn't work then they require extensive therapy.</TEXT>

Ok.  gt;3. A constitutional monarchy is probably the most practical. I'd prefer a more hands on monarch though. Semi Constitutional Monarchism.  gt;4. Vehemently against abortion Socially Conservative?  gt;after quickening. What?  gt;Generally I think women and men though equally human are suited to different things and should complement each other rather than all trying to be everything. So what women's rights do you want or are you opposed to?  gt;6. Good health is good I suppose. Health insurance is good too. Essential public healthcare is good, but sexual services and plastic surgery are not essential. This is not about vague semi philosophical stand points, but actual Ideological positions. Like if you want private healthcare or public healthcare, or Mostly public/private.  gt;7. Public education for all should be provided to secondary level. Tertiary education at university should be way more restrictive. Most jobs should NOT need a degree. Either be scholastically excellent or pay for your degree. How will you make it so that jobs _don't need a degree_.  gt;8. Limited welfare is good but people should only have it as a safety net, not as a right. Regulated Capitalism.  gt;9. Marriage cannot be redefined willy nilly. So, against?  gt;10. They have the right to live how they please. There is no right however to force people or the law to honour your new 'gender' and I personally believe affirmation is never the right treatment. Would you allow them to ""transition"" or not?  gt;11. Promote your own interests. Also I support a more powerful Commonwealth as a reformed British Empire. CANZUK is a good policy. Expansionism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;1. Quickening is when a foetus begins to move. Socially liberal lean socially moderate.  gt;2. I prefer mostly private healthcare with public support. Capitalism to regulated-capitalism.  gt;3. If degrees were made harder to obtain, then the market would naturally reduce degree requirements. This isn't a new idea #8212;it would be unthinkable that a low-level clerical job in finance, for instance, would require a degree a few decades ago. Ok.  gt;4. Yes, against same-sex marriage. Nothing against same-sex platonic relationships though. Socially conservative.  gt;5. Not legally or surgically. Socially conservative lean socially moderate. I'd say that you're a standard American Center-Rightist Conservative. But when it comes to British politics, your economic views are very unorthodox. So I'd say that you're a Reaganite Conservative, with much more Centrist views on Social issues, than Reagan had.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Ahh, I see what you mean about Trump. I #8217;m honestly not sure if he #8217;s be more left wing. One reason I think Trump was so effective this year was because of OTL Democrats largely moving away from prioritizing the interests of rural, working class Northerners. This created a sense among them that they didn #8217;t have a party to call their own and then Trump welcomes them into the Republican Party through a shift away from previous Republican candidates. In this alternate timeline, working class Northerners are overall more comfortable with the Progressives, and the conservative Democrats have a much smaller number of voters who would support government action in the economy. So while It would benefit Trump to be more left wing on the national stage, it would be much more of a liability in the Democrat primaries. I personally haven #8217;t quite gotten to that point in the timeline so I #8217;ll have to keep that question in mind. Ok.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I believe immigration should be very strict and only people that are very talented, have a good background (aren't criminals etc) and are willingly going to assimilate into the local culture  amp; contribute to society must be let in So no racial or ethnic restrictions?  gt;i support a very authoritarian (basically totalitarian) government. Totalitarianism (obviously)  gt;I believe abortion should be legal only when the woman's life is threatened or in case of rape, but otherwise if the family/woman doesn't want the child she can has to give him up for adoption. Socially Conservative. And sense you want a dictatorship shouldn't you just take the kids into the state's care and use them to make model citizens?  gt;Women should have the same rights as men, no exceptions. Socially Liberal.  gt;I support free universal healthcare for every citizen. Welfarism.  gt;I agree with trans rights and i belive they should be considered just as equal as a woman or man. Staunchly Socially Liberal.  gt;I belive in an isolationist foreign policy, i especially support autarky and think we should have trades only with allied and culturally similar nations. Isolationism. I don't see education and welfare on here, but you most likely want extensive state control of both. I'd say that you're a Left-wing Nationalist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Nope Ok.  gt;I mean kids would be eventually taught in school what to do and what to not do, but i'd rather give them a family that isn't forced to take care of them intsead. Hmm, ok.  gt;Oh well yeah, i want those of course, basic rights for all citizens. And if possible we should provide them all (or atleast most of them) an house to live in, maybe a little apartment That's on the more Socialist side or Welfare Capitalism, but it still checks out. And like I said before I'd say that you're a Left-wing Nationalist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Immigration: To protect jobs, immigrants are only to be accepted for industries lacking a domestic workforce. Immigrants are expected to assimilate into our culture and customs, but should be free to practice their culture where it is legal. Civic-Patriotism.  gt;Economics: The ideal economy would be a series of trade guilds, competing with each other in a market economy, in which the workers are mandated to keep their commission. There should be extremely tight monopoly regulations and a progressive tax system which redistributes wealth from the ultra-rich rather than the high-earning proletariat. Distributism.  gt;Government: Big government economically, small government civilly. Free speech is a human right and no state agent or guild may stop non-violent protest. The nation is equally as important as the regions to create a sense of belonging. Federalist Democracy.  gt;Abortion: Should be a last resort operation. The nuclear family is the best way to raise children, so to support the adoption system, women will by subsidised to take unwanted pregnancies to term. Socially Moderate, lean Socially Conservative.  gt;Women #8217;s Rights: Women must not be discriminated from the workplace without reason. However, we believe that gender struggle is a distraction from class struggle. Socially Liberal lean more Moderate.  gt;Healthcare: There is a single-payer system, but there are also healthcare guilds. Welfarist Distributist.  gt;Education: The only industry solely run by the state. Education is a service to better children, there is no benefit in a union. Home schooling is subsidised. Welfare Capitalism lean more economically Left-wing.  gt;Welfare: The welfare state must be strong, but it must be built for citizens who cannot work rather than those who will not work. The state will also fund programs to return citizens to work as soon as possible. Welfare Capitalism.  gt;Gay Marriage: Absolutely all for it. We support the nuclear family, and the gender of the parents doesn #8217;t matter. Socially Liberal.  gt;Trans Rights: Gender dysphoria is a mental illness. Transitioning is a last resort, but people who do so must be treated equally under the law. Socially Liberal.  gt;Foreign Policy: The country should remain neutral while maintaining a defensive force. The guild system will encourage our country to become self-reliant. Isolationism. Conservative Liberalism with Distributist characteristics.</TEXT>

On the LGB issue: I'm fine with all sexualities (except for the weird ones like beastiality and the whole "femboy" pink all over pride parade degeneracy). On the tranny issue: Trannies have no place in a Socially Conservative and Nationalistic society. Instead of them ""transitioning"" they should try therapy, and if that doesn't work, then they should be sent to mental hospitals like all the other crazies. On the gender equality issue: Women should be almost as equal as men, except for that they shouldn't have the right to vote until they're 40 and have over 2 kids (and they must be regular members of their local church).</TEXT>

My personal favourite of left-wing economic Ideologies is Syndicalism.  gt;and the main reason M-L communism failed everywhere it was tried is because U.S. foreign policy made damn well sure it failed everywhere it was attempted. That's a factor but not the biggest one. The biggest one is that planned economics doesn't really work because you can't plan for the wild rollercoaster that is the world.  gt;For someone who is to the left of most Democrats you sure do have a lot of Republican talking points.

    <TEXT> gt;Thought I already wrote too much lol. Too much idealism and too little actually policy stuff.  gt;I might even be leaning towards anarchism inspired by guys like Ted Kaczynski (thought I wouldn #8217;t go that far. I #8217;m not totally anti-tech just think an over-reliance on it has caused lots of harm). Bruh.  gt;70% Authority.  gt;I might even be leaning towards anarchism  gt;I guess I care about the smaller scale result of a more communal family oriented existence that feels like it actually has a culture not consumed by globalism. Policies themselves don #8217;t matter to me that much. Aight.  gt;Immigration: I won #8217;t say none but I don #8217;t want significant demographic changes in culture and maybe even ethnicity to a certain extent. So you're in between Cultural and Ethnic Nationalism?  gt;Economics: Mixed market I guess. Maybe even distbutinism or something like that. I would be pro welfare but I think it #8217;s bad to make people leach of the government though. I would much rather communities and families look after each other. And before you say that I #8217;m just some utopian socialist I used to be a hardcore libertarian and have studied economics in a couple classes. I just think the whole idea of economics is far too utilitarian, a mindset I am fundamentally against. Like I could not give a shit about  #8220;muh gdp #8221; or even unemployment. Maybe I #8217;m a neo-feudalist lol. So you're Welfare Capitalist with "I don't care" characteristics?  gt;Healthcare: single-payer I guess. Welfarism.  gt;Education: Free till university. I don #8217;t think we should be making university the normal thing to do. It #8217;s kinda dumb and unnesscarary (coming from a student). Unless your gonna be a doctor or have money to spare and wanna learn about philopshy or something. I don #8217;t know. Welfarism.  gt;Gay-Marriage: No idea. Personally don #8217;t give a crap about gays and bisexuals but the whole lgbt movement is dumb and going dangerous places. Tolerance I guess but I worry that #8217;s opening a pandoras box. Socially Liberal lean moderate.  gt;Trans rights: I dunno. I guess some people truly feel that way but nowadays it #8217;s becoming a trend which I am very much opposed to. So you're opposed to allowing them to ""transition""?  gt;Already talked about foreign policy. Aight.  gt;Like I said policy is kinda irrelevant to my beliefs. I #8217;m more into reactionary ideals from a cultural perspective. Again I #8217;m confused where I lean. Well if you want a specific Ideology, you're going to have to find out your opinions on policies, otherwise you're just a broad Rightist. And you forgot women's rights.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;That #8217;s quite a butchering of what it means to be conservative. Conservatism is about preserving culture and naturally formed traditions which I am totally for, as well as understanding that hierarchy is inevitable which is why I #8217;m a monarchist. It may be the case in our current retarded political climate that the definitions work like that but only if you still somehow think neoliberal democracy is a good system that you should participate in. I #8217;m also totally against blm and the whole lgbt progressive agenda but I guess that might be normal for anyone not far-left at that point. Yes, but just being a "Philosophical Conservative" doesn't mean jack shit. When it comes to the real world, policies and actions are what matters. And there are a bunch of different definitions for Conservativism, like: 1. (Governmental) Conservatism, basically just Libertarianism. Basically only exists in the US. 2. (Economic) Conservatism, basically just economic rightism. 3. (Traditional) Conservatism, vague status quo preservation, morphed into preservation of traditions. 4. (Social) Conservatism, went mainstream because of the rise of Social Liberalism in the 60's onwards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I don #8217;t know. Modernity sucks. As a history student I think their is a lot we have lost in terms of community and I do see real, tangible and direct consequences of things like the sexual revolution to be quite negative. Heres the thing though. Like I #8217;m pro conservative morality for the most part (though some ideas are just anachronistic religious practices like in regards to homosexuality). I just think making the state force it on people with no room for exceptions is cruel. True. But when you're looking at history you tend to get a romanticised view of it, especially as a Conservative.  gt;I also think politics is a lot less relevant then everyone makes it out to be and that cultural perceptions are far more important. Even if it was I really have no voice in the matter as I #8217;m very nihilistic towards my government and the future of my country (Canadian btw). Yeah but just not caring doesn't make it any better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Capitalism has lasted only 200 years and the same capitalism you claim improves lives happened under neoliberalism, which involve slave labour within sweatshops and more unbearable conditions. The same ideology you say that ppl cant even reap from their labor. Is the world nor perfect? Yes. Are some countries shitholes? Yes. This still doesn't change that since the industrial revolution, Capitalism has lifted millions of people out of poverty, the same cannot be said about Communism.  gt;Lifting people out of poverty despite more and more people being put into harsh conditions when doing so. You continue to keep avoiding that point. Oh but as long as its not me whos in the sweatshops its fine amirite? Like I said above, some countries are shitholes, but Capitalism is at the least is improving the situation and has improved the situation substantially. But there are still some things that Capitalism cannot change, because it's only a economic system. Your way of thinking is just looking at the bad and not even taking one single glance at the mountain of good that Capitalism has achieved. And you think that Capitalism is bad because it's not perfect, but news flash! Your system wouldn't be at all close to perfect or even close to being good. Even more so when your prime example is fucking North Korea!  gt;Im saying you wouldnt be saying the shit u would be saying now if u were poor. But I still wouldn't be advocating for anything close to your system. Because your system is a fucking absolute dystopia, compared to literally any other system.  gt;Still a stretch Nope. To be a large company you 100% need hierarchies, because structure and hierarchy lead to organisation, which is absolutely crucial to large companies existing. Claiming otherwise is fucking stupid. I don't even like globalism, so dieing on this hill is just fucking dumb.  gt;They need to be bowing and worshipping the state. I sort of agree, just not your fucking dystopia.</TEXT>

No. Because Communism is a fucking pipedream.  gt;Am I a communist? No. Yeah, you're fucking worse.  gt;My system would achieve closer to perfect than capitalism would. No it wouldn't, your prime example is North Korea. And North Korea's situation is 100 times worse than any other Capitalist country.  gt;Mandatory worship of the state as the state would be the holder of truth and knowledge. A common unity that all people could agree upon. That's a fucking totalitarian regime, where no one has freedom or any liberty to speak of. Just look at how fucking abysmal North Korea is.  gt;Your system is fucking abysmal. No it isn't. Some of the most happiest countries In the world are the ones closest to NY economy system. While your prime example is fucking horrendous and dystopian.  gt;Forced wealth redistribution. Radical progressivism. Just because you disagree doesn't mean it isn't best for people. It's not at all the best for the people. Because your economy would be in the fucking shitter, you would have rampant degeneracy and the complete destruction of the nuclear family, and family values in general. If you look at all "Communist" countries who have been even close to your dystopian levels of Totalitarianism, they've all been Socially Conservative, as to better keep the people down. Which is why Authoritarianism in real life almost always correlates with Social Conservatism. Hell! Even Ingsoc was Conservative!  gt;Hey muh capitalism has helped ppl out of poverty, but at the expense of other ppls livelihood, wellbeing, equality, and labor. Idc tho cuz im not one of THOSE people lol. Capitalism is 1000 times better than the utterly horrendous economy your dystopia would have. And I've fucking seen the shit that comes with Capitalism from my own eyes, but none of those problems would be even close to being fixed in your system. And full equality is a fucking pipedream, the best you can realistically achieve is giving people a "fair" chance and a help I'd they need and want it  gt;Again market socialism would be more bearable than capitalism but nah let Jeff Bezos keep putting people in sweatshops so he can hoard all the wealth lol. Yes market Socialism _might_ (keyword: might) be better than Capitalism in some ways. But it just doesn't have even a semblance of a big enough track record as Capitalism. And yes sweatshops are obviously immoral, but they have to be stopped by the countries that have them.  gt;That still doesnt disprove my point and my system is more of a utopia than dystopia. You as an auth should be agreeing with me. My system is much more of a utopia than yours could ever be. Because my economic system exists in some of the most happiest countries on the planet, while the closest one to yours is a fucking joke. Yes I'm a Authoritarian, but I still want to improve people's lives, and not Fucking destroy them like you.  gt;Yet your examples of lifting ppl out of poverty come from globalism in neoliberalism. Cant even be consistent when defending your capitalism. Even if u are right, they would be liquidated. My example of lifting people out if poverty comes from global trade and Capitalism? Yes. But Capitalism  #8800; Neo-liberalism, as for most of the time since the industrial revolution, Neo-liberalism didn't even fucking exist. And I'm not 100% against global trade, but I prefer local trade partnerships between culturally similar countries.  gt;My ideology isn't a dystopia. Your prime example is fucking North Korea. And North Korea is literally a dystopia. You would also have zero personal freedom, which is dystopian. And you praised Ingsoc, which is the most well known dystopia on earth. So your system is a fucking dystopia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's clear that we aren't getting anywhere with this argument so we should just end it here before it consumes to much of our time. (I wrote everything below before I came to the above conclusion)  gt;It has also put more people into poverty and the ones it lifted are at the expense of other people. Capitalism has lifted many more people out if poverty than it has "put into poverty". https://www.google.com/amp/s/fee.org/articles/extreme-poverty-rates-plummet-under-capitalism/amp https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.economist.com/leaders/2013/06/01/towards-the-end-of-poverty https://catalyst.independent.org/2019/06/14/capitalism-remains-the-best-way-to-combat-extreme-poverty/  gt;No I'm not. Yes your system is worse, it's literally just horrendous Authoritarian Socialism, with even less personal freedom than Socialism.  gt;North Korea isn't socially revolutionary and has hierarchy between the people. I don't even think they have complete wealth equality. They got the mandatory worship of state put down tho. Otherwise they arent as good tbf. Well it's the closest to your system currently in existence. And complete wealth equality is impossible, because what stops those party elites from Just taking all the material wealth and giving the others nothing? Nothing.  gt;My ideology isn't dystopian nor horrendous. It is the best for people. It's literally not the best for the people. Having zero personal freedom or economic freedom is dystopian.  gt;Lol, don't make me laugh. It is. Your economy like any other forceful wealth redistributing economy, would fucking tank. Because the business owners would emigrate en masse to other countries, and no one would work because they would get nothing for it.  gt;You think like the nuclear family and family values are good? Bro get with the program. Family values are essential to population growth, which is good for most developed economies.  gt;Society progresses and ideals change over time. That is what ALWAYS happens. Family values are what keeps society stable, it's shown that single parent households do much worse than two parent ones. And religious people commit less crime than non-religious ones (small margins like 2-1 percent).  gt;You trying to go back will destroy society. No it won't. Social Conservatism makes Authoritarian societies stronger, by putting Social pressure on people.  gt;Radical progressivism would be instituted through force. Which will not go well at all, which is shown by that all Totalitarian or extreme Authoritarian societies have been Socially Conservative.  gt;If the state is the holder of truth and knowledge, there would be no dissent. A hive mind. Difference in opinion is what leads to the problems we have now. Difference of opinion is healthy, and Ingsoc level power isn't reachable as eventually the fire if revolution dies down and the bureaucracy slows down and gets tired of the people's revolts and reform which leads to collapse.  gt;In hive mind collectivism, it would be achieved. Hive mind Collectivism isn't achievable in the foreseeable future, and taking away personal freedom isn't a good thing.  gt;If neoliberalism isnt corporate global capitalism that was is it? Neo-liberalism is at this point something and nothing at the same time, but it isn't Global Capitalism.  gt;And do u know the horrible conditions the workers of the industrial revolution had? Yes I know, but their conditions improved by miles compared to the past. You're a retard if you think that conditions improve over night, and If you condemn a system because it isn't perfect, when in reality perfection is impossible.  gt;And? Personal freedom and economic freedom are good things in moderation.  gt;Nope my ideology isn't completely IngSoc, just has elements of it. Hell even our current societies have elements of "dystopias." Yes they do, but your ideal society is dystopian pipedream, that will never come to existence in the foreseeable future.  gt;There would be no problems in hive mind collectivism. The state controls the people. Tells them what to think, feel. Since the state holds truth, dissent would be impossible. What use is equality in a society where you're not the decider of your own actions? Everyone's "equal", but no one is a person, everyone's just a mindless drone doing the whims of other mindless drones.  gt;Personal freedom is the reason we have the problems we do but since ur ok with the evils of capitalism and hierarchy and are ok with ppl being exploited, it doesnt surprise me that u agree with an immoral system. Just because I agree with some parts of Capitalism doesn't mean I like it's flaws. Your parents drive cars, does that mean that they agree with the destruction of the climate? You and your family participates in Capitalism, does that mean you like and support the bad things it entails? Do you know where you end up with slippery slope ideas? With your head stuck in a guillotine, waiting for the inevitable. _(Or)_ You and your family stuck in a gulag because one of your relative's ex-wife's friends dissented. _(Or)_ You and the whole bloody lot stuck in a concentration camp because of your ethnicity, religion, or some other thing you can't control. You don't understand that nothing's ever perfect, do you? And that it's better to be in charge of your own actions than to be a mindless drone who can't decide how to live your own life. Do you even understand how pointless Human life would be with no problems or challenges? This exact reason is why rich people who otherwise might've been upstanding citizens degrade into hardcore degenerates after they get their fortune. Because they've reached their goal and simply ask: "what now?". The thrill of the journey and challenge is ultimately gone for them, so they degrade into more degeneracy and more degeneracy until their back at square one. And I'm not even that biased here because I've talked to a Hive mind Collectivist before, and we had a quite lovely chat where we mostly agreed on everything. But he was much more pragmatic and reasonable than you are.</TEXT>

When your society is super close to Ingsoc (the most well known example of a dystopia) than it's a fucking dystopia.  gt;Doesn't matter when forced wealth redistributing happens. Still bigoted. Forced wealth redistributing tanks economies.  gt;Still doesn't disprove my point. Society is still progressing without them. Ah yes western birth rates are falling and the people who are now getting old don't have anyone to replace them, and more and more people are thrusted into extremism as they get thrown to the wayside by society. That's definitely what I call "progress".  gt;It would go well. The fact social conservatis has to be forced shows that social progress is inevitable. The state would force those to get with the program. Both ""Progressivism"" and Social Conservatism have to be forced. That's why there's a bunch of "Progressive" propaganda in schools. And your state isn't even viable now or in the foreseeable future, so your ideal society can't even exist.  gt;Oh so it's good that ppl had to be exploited so others could benefit? Sounds like capitalism. Wouldn't have had to suffer horrible conditions if they did forced wealth redistribution. You're so fucking retarded that you condemn Capitalism for having had flaws when it brought millions of people out of poverty. But news flash dumbass! Nothing's perfect, and nothing gets fixed overnight, so fixing Social and Economic problems doesn't take a second to do like your thick skull thinks it does. Not even a single fucking person that I know would even think of supporting your system, not even the poorest ones would.  gt;Wouldn't happen in hive mind collectivism. There is no individual thought and ppl worship the state. There would be no revolutions. There would be no conscious life either, because everyone would be a mindless fucking drone in your fucking la la land fantasy.  gt;No it isn't. They are, they're the things that move economies forward.  gt;The fact we have elements of them now kinda weakens that point. We have very small elements, but the fucking whole core of your society is fucking unachievable now and in the foreseeable future. You'll most likely be dead in the ground before we even come close to the capabilities necessary to have a Hive mind.  gt;Wouldn't have these issues under hive mind collectivism. And there you go again fucking dodging the fucking point, and giving nothing of substance.  gt;The 1st 2 would be deserved for defying the state. So if you and your family defied the "state" then you should die?  gt;The 3rd wouldn't happen because it would be a progressive society. And again you dodge the point because you can't fucking read between the lines.  gt;That bs would happen in conservatism, your stupid shit. And there you go again changing the subject. Extreme Nationalism is what leads to genocide, not Conservativism, you fucking dimwit.  gt;Rather be a mindless drone than be part of a system that exploits others for other ppl and never get to reap such benefits. No one I know would even think about choosing your system over what we have now, hell! They'd even choose Laissez-Faire Capitalism over your system. The truth is we don't live in the 1800's anymore, people actually have decent wages in the west. Yes problems still exist but problems always exist, and crying about it like you are isn't going to change anything.  gt;They could redistribute their wealth but due to personal freedom they dont. Every single Fucking person I know would rather live under Laissez-Faire Capitalism than under your system.  gt;Really? Would love to know their username and such. Would be cool to meet another one. 1. I don't remember their username, because it was so Fucking long ago. 2. They're a much more reasonable person than you are, so I wouldn't want to burden them with a nuisance like you. All you have said in this fucking argument has been of zero substance and has always dodged the point I was trying to make. So I'm just going to fucking end it here because I frankly don't have time to deal with a fucking nuisance like you. And frankly none of us are changing eachother's mind so there's nothing I have to gain from this argument, but wasted time and energy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I would argue the US is a form of soft totalitarianism. The State, and Corporate apparatus control virtually everything in this country. Any attempt to go against the States dictates will see you face severe penalties. There's no freedom here. Very cynical but somewhat true.  gt;Not the traditional Fascist definition, but this is very clearly the situation in the US. Corporatism is the dividing if the economy into groups, in practice is basically Welfare Capitalism but with indoctrination, some nationalisation and stare controlled trade unions. So no the US doesn't fit the bill  gt;The US is known around the world for toppling, and destabilizing other nations for it's own state, and corporate interests without regard for the rest of the world. It's not ethnically nationalist at all, but it is extremely Statist. It's extremely interventionist, and not at all at the levels of Racial Nationalism needed to be Fascist.  gt;Not a perfect fit, but I hold my position that the US is at least Semi-Fascist. No it isn't tough just because but it somewhat shares some points doesn't mean it's Semi-Fascist or Fascist for that matter. And saying that is just on par with Leftist amounts of "boogeyman syndrome".</TEXT>

(Think a cross between Wilhelm I and Salazar/Ulmanis/Metaxas). Political parties banned. Corporative representation on a national level, more democratic at a local level. Daniel A Bell talks about this in his book called the China Model. Authoritarian Democracy lean Auth, with Monarchist characteristics.  gt;Abortion:  gt;Banned except for expectional circumstances. So it's still banned in cases of rape and or danger to mother and child?  gt;Women's Rights:  gt;Except for a set-list of jobs (e.g. skilled engineers, gynoclogists, midwives, nurses, teachers etc.), women should be encouraged to be housewives given UBI and supported by a women's syndicate to network with other mothers, go on joint-holidays, learn skills etc. Socially Conservative.  gt;Healthcare:  gt;Like Germany. Competiting non-profits provide healthcare. Patient, employer and state pay in. Welfare Capitalism lean a bit more economically right.  gt;Education:  gt;Free, Merit-Based Education. Encourage trade-school as well Welfarism.  gt;Gay Marriage:  gt;No. Socially Conservative.  gt;Trans Rights:  gt;LOL.

So you don't have an opinion on if abortions should be allowed or not?  gt;Women #8217;s rights: tbh I don #8217;t know much about the women #8217;s rights movement, but they should be equal to men. Socially Liberal.  gt;Healthcare: Free healthcare (particularly well funded so you don #8217;t have to wait for an emergency room. Economically left-wing, lean a bit center.  gt;Education: Important. Would education be free or not? Would private schools be allowed?  gt;Welfare: Good, but needs to be done right so it doesn #8217;t end up as a trap. Economically left-wing.  gt;Gay Marriage: Should be legal. Socially Liberal.  gt;Trans Rights: Should be able to transition at 16 because studies show that #8217;s when your sexuality is fully developed. Staunchly Socially Liberal.  gt;Foreign Policy: Canada above all else, we should seek to further our influence and oppose evil regimes like Saudi Arabia or China. Interventionism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I'm talking about how he was against integration and pro the war on terror, war on drugs, plans on giving the police more funding, and the Patriot act. That's all just civcuckist slight Authoritarianism.  gt;Also there's all the semi-rascist things he's said that makes me think he's not too big of a fan of other races. Depending on if he's stupid or not, it's either due to his age or just a shock therapy marketing tactic.  gt;Or the way he treats women that shows he probably supports traditional gender roles privately. He's fucking 70 of course he wants a traditional woman (even tough he doesn't want to conform to traditional gender roles himself). Not wanting a woman who spreads her legs at every opportunity, isn't Fascism.  gt;Not to mention he said he'll veto Medicare for all if it ends up in his desk. A fascist, hell even most Nationalists would be in favour of universal healthcare.  gt;Not saying he's a fascist, I'm saying hes definitely not a socialist. He's a war-dog neo-liberal except far less left culturally. He's a pink capitalist larping as a Neo-Con larping as a Conservative.  gt;I was a Yang voter Respectable.  gt;but I can tell you neither Sanders not Biden are socialists True.  gt;there's such a wide gap between the two that Biden would probably prefer a fascist country than a true socialist one. Depends on the type of Fascism. He'd not like falangism, but he'd most likely just revert back to segregationism in a Silver legion ""Fascist"" state.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The war on drugs is more fascist than whatd you see on the left. Fascism  #8800; Authoritarianism. Yes Fascism is Authoritarian, but without the other components, it ain't Fascist.  gt;He said the Obama was a story book because he was the "first clean and articulate, mainstream African American" after he got the VP pick. It's widely excepted he was vp because Obama was trying to appeal to "less progressive" and older white voters. I remember Biden saying that. But that's just Biden being Biden, he grew up a segregationist, so some things he says aren't going to be up to today's standards.  gt;It isn't fascism to want that from a woman but I'm just saying that he clearly views women less as people (probably just because he's 70) so if he had to chose between a society where women were an equal part of the work force, or a trad wife he'd go with trad wife. Ehh, in a traditional society he wouldn't be able to do his yearly wife switch.  gt;Probably, mostly because it's much cheaper if it's goverment ran and we only don't have it in America because the insurance agency donates so much to each party. The main reason why the Dems won't let the more popular Bernie win, is because of the healthcare industry. Well Bernie isn't that popular tough, and really only did good in 2016 because of the anti-hillary movement.  gt;Were you a Yang too? He's basically just new Huey Long or new Henry George depending on how you look at it. I'm not American, but I can respect Yang's message. And funnily enough, he's a candidate for a E-Democracy party in one of my alternate-history timelines. Tough Yang's not really the new Huey long, because Huey long was a Social moderate (maybe a Social Conservative) and hung out with segregationists.</TEXT>

Due to this semantic difference, i see no reason to continue this discussion I understand what being Right-wing is. You're the one who thinks that just because a nation's overton window is super Socially left, the less Leftist left is actually Right-wing. Which it isn't, because most Right-wing Social values are almost all the same around the world, which means that there are requirements needed to be a Social Conservative. Which means that country's ""Right-wing"" might be Right-wing there, but they doesn't hold up to the wider world's standard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Authoritarian Progressivism is literally cringe. As the political definition of based is Social Conservatism. Authoritarian Progressivism is just mindless misery with no goals except for "stAtE pOwEr", like the state is some glorious light in the sky and not just a group of people. The thing is that Authoritarian Progressivism won't even work, as Progressivism increases Social disunity while Social Conservatism increases it.

Mindless misery (mindless misery = your system) is objectively a bad thing. There's literally no argument for it being good. I've seen some smart Auth-Progs so how you ended up so fucking thick-skulled is beyond me.  gt;Which is why free will should be eliminated with HMC. Any dissent is put down by force. Social disunity happens in conservatism as well. HMC isn't even a possibility in the foreseeable future. And is a system that almost no one will support.

I have met many Progressive Auths. And yes I criticized them, but they could actually respond with good counters and substance. While you're the only one to be the equivalent of a 12 year old who wants "daddy state" to take care of them.

Because the state in most western countries, in reality are just bureaucratic messes of tired systems.  gt;Social progressivism is also enforced. It's my way or the highway. You believe in idiotic things such as human rights and free speech and other nonsense. You just don't get it do you? It's not the fucking force that matters, it's the Social pressure. And Social pressure doesn't increase from Authoritarianism or Progressivism, but it does from Social Conservatism. Because Social Conservatism leads to honour and discipline based societies that are stronger because people will naturally think more about the consequences of their actions. While this doesn't happen in Progressivism, because it destroys the natural Social pressure. And allows people to freely be degenerates without consequences or shame.  gt;Enforcing traditional values that will inevitably always be challenge because you dont enforce enough authority. Most auth centers are totalitarian for a reason. How u decided on a dumbass constitutional puny authoritarian is beyond me. I've seen more reasonable people from the idiotic anarcho cringebols. I'm not a constitutionalist. Do I want some popular representation? Yes. Because otherwise your government will inevitably fall and make your Ideology a worldwide pariah. The truth is that totalitarian regimes don't last, but aristocratic republics do. Because aristocratic republics make politics into "bread and circuses" type shows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You based that off of your feelings. You cannot 100% prove that it is immoral or wrong. What is considered right or wrong changes throughout history. It is what society believes is wrong at any given point. This isn't hard to understand. That's just philosophical bullishit. If no one gains anything out of a system, then that system is objectively bad.  gt;I didn't mean that they were a force from heaven in a literal sense. C'mon you should know better than that. The state is seen as a divine group in ehich the people can go to for truth, knowledge, and basic necessities and is able to do this by breaking down selfishness which is derived from individualism, individual thought, and free will. If you could read subtext that you'd know I wasn't talking about literal divine power. I was talking about your delusional tendency to speak of the state like it's a divine power. When in reality it's more often than not a tired bureaucracy.  gt;There's no reason for me to respond with thought because what you see as criticism and issues, I see as perfectly good things. Do you get it now or do I have to keep reiterating myself? Just seeing then as "good things" doesn't change that there's historical precedence that disproves it. Like every single totalitarian regime being Socially Conservative.  gt;To believe that punitive authoritarism doesn't result in people believing in the consequences of their actions is asinine. If my values were to enforce racial acceptance, gender equality, etc. and going against that would sentence you to harsh punishments, you are going to think twice about rejecting these values. It is not social conservatism, but punitive harsh punishment that encourages discipline and adherence to the state. Force works. That's why you have to enforce your values onto the populace. Some people will naturally not adhere to your values. Also, imagine using degenerate unironically. This is why no one takes conservatives seriously anymore. Values change over time. Evidence? All of fucking human history. Force alone doesn't work though, as Progressivism doesn't put on any natural Social pressure and just forcing ideas on a already disunited and boiling society that Progressivism causes is just plain stupid. And if you want any sources on that just look to the increasing gender divides, sexual anger, and "outsider in my own country" mentality that is at it's peak because of Progressivism. This is the problem, your Ideology doesn't think of society and the consequences caused by your system. You just think fucking the people more in the ass will make them content with the ass-fucking. While Socially Conservative Authoritarianism makes the people feel ashamed for not supporting the ass-fucking, and makes the people regulate themselves.  gt;People are stupid and don't know what is best for their own good. Also all forms of government inevitably fall. People aren't very stupid though. I've seen much better takes from nihilistic 8th graders than any local Progressive (or any politican for that matter). And if you're concerned with people's ineptitude you should be supporting Technocracy and not HMC. And Technocracy requires individualism.  gt;If the state is the force that people look up to for guidance, food, truth, knowledge, then it would create that bread and circus feeling. Do you even know what "bread and circuses" means? _"entertainment or political policies used to keep the mass of people happy and docile."_ This does not line up with your system at all. As you need at least some form of republican politics to have it. Because the republican politics have to be a smoke-screen for the actual backroom politics. Like how the US is two shades of Neo-liberalism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You cannot dictate what is objectively good or bad. Why? Because it is based off of your own fucking feelings. You believe it is morally bad. Morality is subjective. There are no rules or laws that dictate what is morally right or wrong. Example: I believe homosexuality is good. You believe it is bad. Can we objectively prove our points? No we can't. You cannot argue morality without being philosophical. Morality is inherently philosophical. I don't believe homosexuality is bad. As long as you ain't a trannie, cuckold, polygamist, pedo or furry, you can have act sexuality you want. And at least I have a argument for my moral view on your system, which is that it has zero gains.  gt;You were arguing the issue of people "being screwed by the system." I was and am arguing against your think of the as being a omnipotent nanny god, while in reality most states are just overstuffed, tired and overgrown bureaucracies.  gt;There is a lot of social pressure going on now. Guess what will happen if you disagree with race equality, homosexuality, transgenderism, etc. You'll be seen as a bigot. You would be "cancelled." Seen as an asshole in a general society. This is why reactionaries can only larp on the internet and no one takes them seriously. If that isn't social pressure, idk what is. You still don't understand what I mean by Social pressure? The Social pressure in Progressivism causes disunity as it creates thousands of groups who are all cancelling eachother and are getting increasingly angry and radical. While in Social Conservatism Social pressure takes the form of subtle shame and self-disappointment, which leads to conformity.  gt;These are natural phases that happen with societal change. There will always be pushback against social progressivism and the pushback eventually loses. Progress is inevitable. The countries that are adopting these policies that are creating the previously mentioned problems. Are heading for collapse as all Social groups are nearing their breaking point. I know this because my own country is experiencing this as well as most of the west.  gt;This is literally only dependent on the values present. I can replace conservative values with progressive values and say the same thing. It isn't though, as I said above. The "'Social pressure"" caused by Progressivism causes instability as it divides and angers. While Social Conservatism causes unity through subtle shame and self-disappointment.  gt;If people weren't stupid, a central authority wouldnt be required to keep them in check and especially wouldnt be needed to impose your conservative values. You think all people are stupid, which is just _plain stupid_. Because most people have average IQs and test scores, so it's just untrue.  gt;Plus you use this type of argument all the time and its irrelevant. I can easily say "I've seen much better takes from a 1st grader than the President right now" and it wouldn't hold any ounce of importance. At least it's better than the zero substance you bring.  gt;Which is why im not a technocrat. Just hating individualism because it's individualism isn't a good thing.  gt;This is the Ingsoc transitional period to HMC. The people arent aware of the party's true intentions but have their strict loyalty to it no matter what they say. Maybe you didnt know that or maybe you didnt care but just letting yiu know. With Social media and your "daddy state" tendency. You're never going to fare well in politics, because you'll be exposed and cancelled by both sides.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I was using it as an example to prove my point. You cannot dictate objective morality, regardless of what argument you have pertaining to your views. You get it now? Like I said above, at least I have a argument for why your system is bad, while you have no counter. Because it is bad.  gt;If you are obsessed about unity, you can find unity in ways other than social conservative values (i.e. the state). Again, if you want social pressure, enforce the notion and belief that being against social progressive values can take form in subtle shame and self disappointment. It depends on the values present. You don't like transgender people? Enforce the societal norm that it isn't right to dislike them. How can you still not get it? How fucking simple do I have to make it. Force isn't the fucking thing that matters here. And Progressivism's Social pressure causes disunity and anger because it's based on a shitty version of "divide and conquer". While Conservative Social pressure is subtle and shame based because of communal focus. And you can't change this, because it's in Progressivism's nature to divide, so that it can get more supporters by stoking Social anger and radicalisation. While Social Conservatism is based on communal Social pressure centered on our psychology and deep rooted nature. Authoritarian governments fall without unity which is why every single Totalitarian regime has been Socially Conservative.  gt;Which is why a strong central authority is necessary to keep these people in check and crush conflict by force. Also, social progressivism isn't just inherit in modern society. You're not going to be able to crush revolts, when every Social group is at it's boiling point.  gt;To be honest even if what you are saying is true, I don't see this as a bad thing. Collapse by Social divide isn't a bad thing? The same thing is going to happen in your society, just slightly slower.  gt;It still depends on the type of values. It doesn't. Social Progressivism relies on social divide to grow as it needs disunity to be able to get groups it can put against eachother. While Social Conservatism relies on communal thinking, and thinking about long term consequences.  gt;Not all people, just a large part of them and who gives a fuck about IQ? Seriously? IQ AND test scores show that most people are average in intelligence and not stupid.  gt;This makes no sense whatsoever because "I've seen ___ have better ideals than you" isn't an argument at all and practically carries zero substance, which is what you accuse me of. I rightfully accuse you of it, because you don't bring anything new or any new arguments. Except for repeating the same nanny-state rhetoric and saying "jUsT uSe fOrCe". Which is dumb because it doesn't consider wider society and it's consequences.  gt;Radical ideals can only be implemented through revolution. No radical person has the intention on running for president to implement IngSoc. Also "both sides." Really? No one's going to support your revolution though. As people don't want to give up their free will and the Progressives have much better options than the mindless Totalitarianism you support. You'd get dunked a billion times harder than Bernie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;We wouldn't be having this discussion if I had no counter. You don't have any counters though, the only thing you've said is: "morals can't be objective". Which isn't a argument for your system being morally good or even morally neutral.  gt;It still depends on the fucking beliefs of the system omg. If the general social views of a society are transgenderism, homosexuality, race equality, etc. and an opposing views says they are against these things, social pressure will indicate that this person would be ashamed to things against such things. Omg it's not that fucking hard to understand jesus fucking christ. That is not what happens though. It doesn't fucking depend on the bloody values because Progressivism can't take the Conservative form of Social pressure, because it's psychological and societal, not political. Social Conservativism characteristics are what leads to it being shame based. While Progressivism characteristics leads to it being "divide and conquer" based. This is because Conservativism is communal in nature and relies on subtle cultural factors like religion, honour based culture, nationalism and tribalism.  gt;And it still doesnt fucking matter anyway because social progress is fucking inevitable and isn't just happening in modern society but throughout all of fucking human history. Literally all of it. There are other ways to achieve unity such as worship to the state. Just forcing people to worship the state won't fix anything, when they all hate eachother's guts and are becoming increasingly radicalised.  gt;And what makes you say that? If you have a strong, large military with access of some of the most lethal and dangerous weapons vs the general populace that has no way of access to gain these weapons, it seems thay yes you can crush revolts. Revolts get crushed more times than you think. Not when every Social group your going to be trying to conscript hates eachother and would rather kill eachother than stay united. You're not going to have a bloody army in the first place as no one will want to enlist at least not even close to the army you want or the army you need. And just forcing people into the army would make it MUCH worse.  gt;All societies crumble. What's your point? Yours will collapse because of something easily preventable. And will make your Ideology into a pariah like never seen before.  gt;IQ measures your ability to solve certain problems. That's it. That's why I said IQ AND test scores.  gt;I don't need to because your criticisms don't force me to. Force is one of the most effective ways to implement policy. To the greatest extents if necessary. Just using force in every situation doesn't fucking work as it doesn't consider wider society or it's problems. The only thing it will do is make the already volatile Social situation created because of your system, even worse.  gt;Oh so out of billions of people around the world, you believe there is little to none who dont share my ideals? I mean I get my views are unpopular but no one? Cmon now. At least my socialistic views and progressivism would appeal more to general society than you spouting off about "muh degeneracy." Your full views are almost certainly so bloody fringe that you can't even consider your system a Ideology. Because no one wants to give up their individualism and subsequently their humanity. And the policies of yours that might appeal to some people exist in much better parties and political organisations then your hypothetical one might ever be. Because they appeal to the people's actual views and not the views of a few extreme "nanny-state" lovers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It wasn't an argument for my system, it was an argument against your notion that my system is objectively morally wrong. I wasn't arguing for my system, I was rebutting against your notion. If you have no arguments for system being morally right then why should it be implemented? It doesn't fix anything and takes away what makes us human.  gt;What makes you believe progressive values can't come in a communal nature? Religion is merely just a unifying force, in which anything else beside it can be a unifying force, even a simple progressive value. Honor is subjective and can be applied to a progressive value (i.e. it is honorable to be gay or transgender). And nationalism and tribalism have lead to conflicts between other tribes and nations (which is why the concept itself should be abolished) and yet I say again, there are other ways to unify people besides conservative values. Jeez. Because Progressivism doesn't work that way. It needs to divide to get groups to advocate for and pit against eachother. Which is why it doesn't unify and can't unify. And taking away tribalism is impossible because it's deep rooted in human nature.  gt;It still doesn't matter because yet again, social progress has existed throughout all of fucking human history. All of it. It's inevitable whether you like it or not. And your (or my system for that matter) will never ever be achieved. And nothing will ever change except for a few Social collapses here there before Neo-liberalism comes back in a new form. Which means this whole argument is fucking useless because none of our ideals will ever be implemented.  gt;I mean it generally will, especially if the people get their truth and knowledge from the state. If the unifying force between the people is the state despite their difference, combined with a large military to quell dissent, yeah it fixes a lot. You're not going to be able to unify people who hate eachother's guts, and your military will be fucking useless because no one will enlist when there's a Social war going on. And putting the state's force on it will only make it worse.  gt;Again the state is the unifying force of the people. Just like in a conservative society where the nation is the unifying force. Theyre differences in conservative societies that could lead to conflict (i.e hierarchy). But rebellions have been quelled and a nation is a unifying force despite the difference. The state is my unifying force. You're not going to be able to quell revolts when no one wants to enlist because of boiling over Social situation. And state force won't quell the Social hatred that Progressivism causes, and even if you by some miracle got the people to enlist. Your army would be full of soyboys, women, feminine men, and trannies. Which doesn't make for even a slightly okay army. This is why all totalitarian governments have been Socially Conservative, because the state needs tools to be able to unify the nation. And those tools are: Nationalism and Social Conservatism and not Progressivism. Because like I said above Progressivism doesn't unify but divides.  gt;Oh don't kid yourself. Even if my ideology became a pariah, there will still be those that would adhere or admire it. All "pariah" ideologies do: (i.e. Nazism). And those that adhere to it will be in even lower numbers than the ones of Nazism. And they'll be even more deplorable than skinheads. And your system would inevitably head for collapse because the state won't have a unifying force (the state needs other unifying forced than itself) and the ""HMC fix"' won't be a thing for the foreseeable future.  gt;What test scores are you referring to? You're being vague. The ones in my country show that most people are average in intelligence and not stupid as you claim.  gt;Force is one of the most effective ways in dealing with unrest in the populace. You can also break down individual thought and free will as much as possible. It isn't though otherwise the anti war movement in the US would've been stomped. But it wasn't because the already volatile Social situation was worsened by the state using force. Which is what will inevitably happen in the chaotic and over-boiling society you want.  gt;I do consider it an ideology. You don't want to believe it is. Do I have to explain what I said, again? What I meant was that almost no one is going to support your Ideology because it takes away their freedom and humanity (which people like btw). And even if you get a few thousand supporters (which in of itself is very doubtful) you won't have even close to having the army needed to start a revolution.  gt;I have met at least 2 other HMC within the auth subreddit. Also, this is a huge speculation and you have little clue on the vast amount of people in the world that could share my values. Most people want freedom and personal liberty. Yes they also want security but it's about balancing the two and not going full throttle into one or the other. And i've met around 30 people who share my specific Ideology on Reddit alone, though they still doesn't negate the fact that my Ideology is unpopular.  gt;Subjective. You're one of the most passive authoritarians I have ever seen and that's a bad thing. Just saying "subjective" isn't a fucking counter. And if the people who vote for Progressivism wanted your system or anything close they would vote for the Auth-Prog parties that already have exist. But they still don't because they want personal freedom. And in some areas I am passive, but in others I'm not. Because I understand that people aren't going to support you if you make their life a living hell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I think that protecting your nation first and foremost is an admirable thing. I also think that most people are uninformed (in the U.S for example, most people vote based on a single issue) and that people who know what #8217;s best should lead. Yeah, that's a problem with Democracy. In that most people don't care enough or just don't have the time, to invest in getting the facts.  gt;Also, the economic side of things seems like an amazing idea (capitalism with state unions sounds). Corporatism is sort of similar to welfare Capitalism, in that it usually has some form of state assistance, but it's also a bit more unique because of its emphasis on the state, nation and class collaborationism.  gt;I #8217;m not particularly conservative tho What are your opinions on these Social issues: 1. Abortion. 2. Gay marriage. 3. Women's rights (obvious but you can never be too careful these days). 4. Immigration. 5. Tranny """"rights"'""".</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;1: Pro-life unless if the mother is in danger. Socially Conservative.  gt;2: I #8217;m fine with gay people, but I don #8217;t know if 2 same-sex parents can do the same job as a mom and dad. Not sure right now. Socially Centrist lean Socially Conservative.  gt;3: Equal rights. Wanna work? Sure. Wanna be a housewife? Sure. With that said, I dislike divorce. Imo, unless if there #8217;s something severe like domestic abuse going on, a couple with children under 18 shouldn #8217;t divorce. Socially Centrist.  gt;4: Multiculturalism doesn #8217;t work. Preferably the situation would be like Japan where it would be monocultural, tho a couple of well-educated immigrants can come every year. Cultural Nationalism.  gt;5: Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and  #8220;trans #8221; people should get therapy. If they are particular delusional, then they #8217;ll be welcome to a mental asylum. Based and Socially Conservative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Neocons are definitely socially conservative. How old are you? The bush regime was homophobic, transphobic, and of course racist as fuck. Possibly even more so than the Trump regime. The Bush presidency*. Trump presidency". For one the bush presidency doesn't line up with Neo-Conservatism, and is only considered as such because of it's interventionism. Neo-Conservatism before was considered to be Warhawk-Liberalism, and comes from Liberals who supported Vietnam and joined the Republicans. Which is the definition I use, and lines up with the test results you'd see at the early stages of r/neoconNWO.  gt;What? I mean they are liberals. (Economically anyway) All conservatives are. Yes if use economic liberalism to mean economic Right-wing. But I like to use Ideologically neutral terms like: Socially Right-wing and Socially Left-wing, instead of Conservative and Liberal. But you do you I guess.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Official Post] American Lore from 1932 to 1988</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 10:19:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>The US has a very strong red scare in the 20's to 30's, and with the depression being worse with no FDR (FDR loses to hoover) and a overall worse situation. This leads to Huey (I'm in every single alternate history scenario) Long becoming president. With Long as president the lines between Democracy and Authoritarianism get blurred, with him using his Far-right connections to get the right on his side and his Populism to get the Left. He basically becomes "the American Peron". Later on in 1952, Huey long is assassinated, and his brother Earl takes over as ruler of the United States. Earl then reforms the United States, and puts it on a semi Democratic course, he also commemorates the Long family and strengthens the Longist personality cult. Earl dies in January of 1960, and the senate takes over, and ensures a peaceful democratisation. In the 1960 election Joseph P. Kennedy Jr loses to Richard Nixon, with the Democratic Party heading for a more Liberal direction after the failure of Joseph's Liberal Conservatism. Nixon wins a second term in the 1964 election against Lyndon B. Johnson. Barry Goldwater then goes on to win in 1968 because after 24 years of Longism, the country wants more freedom and market reform. And after Nixon's fumbling of the economy a more radical shock therapy economic reform is popular. Barry Goldwater fucks the economic like an American Yeltsin, but goes on to complete the political reforms of 1960 leading to a French like Semi-Presidential system. John F. Kennedy goes on to beat Barry Goldwater in 1972 in a landslide, because of the shitty economy. John goes on to further the Vietnam war, leading to a split in the Democratic Party between the, more Centrist Independent Democrats, and the more liberal, Liberal Democrats. Famously his brother RFK joins the LD's. The hart-celler act doesn't happen because of the Nixon presidency, and the civil rights acts is much less "radical". With segregation basically being legal, but black economic reform being a bigger focus. So more "sperate but equal". This leads to the country being more white and more Right-wing Socially. Because of the Longist relationship with the Far-right, the White Nationalist movement is much stronger and has an alliance with the Black Nationalist movement because of their "common goals". This alliance somehow lasts because the BPP and WL (later ANP) party founders (Malcolm X, and George Lincoln Rockwell respectively) inforced it strongly. And because it's strategically better to work together and succeed than to lose while fighting against eachother. In the 1976 election JFK narrowly wins against Nelson Rockefeller. With the economy worsening after Kennedy's victory, a Republican presidency in 1980 is almost assured. Vice President Robert Sargent Shriver Jr goes on to surprisingly lose the Democratic Party nomination to a Jerry Brown-Fred Harris ticket. The Jerry Brown-Fred Harris ticket loses to the former Technocrat (Now Republican) Ronald Reagan and moderate John Anderson. In the 1988 election the Republican primary is won by Televangelist Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp. While the Democratic Party nomination is won by Joe Biden and Al Gore. And the stage is set for a decisive election as the Christian Conservative Robertson-Kemp ticket goes up agiant the Populistic Biden-Gore ticket.</TEXT>

Yes I #8217;m aware of the origins and the bush regime* (sorry does that word trigger you?) was the ultimate endgame of it. The bush regime was basically controlled by PNAC bruh 1. It wasn't though. Yes bush had a lot of Neo-Con advisors, but he himself was more of a Christian Conservative. And the Bush presidency wasn't a regime, even saying that just makes you seem like a buthurt Al Gore supporter. The truth is that all politicans are at least somewhat corrupt and morally flexible, because the profession attracts power hungry shits. 2. Neo-Conservatism is defined as Warhawk-Liberalism, which means that the Conservatism of bush doesn't fit the bill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nah those people want therapy for them. Supporting transitioning stretches from far left to Center-Left in varying degrees. While Center-Right in general is a bit unclear when it comes to Social issues. Because it's more like: "When you're an adult you can do what you want, as long as you don't push it on anyone. Yes, even though I'm against it I don't have the right to dictate your actions" Though this could just stem from the Social Center-Right being full of Conservative Libertarians and Liberal Conservatives. So it's hard to understand what an Authoritarian Socially Center-Right person would think. Because when you're that Authoritarian, you don't really have any qualms with enforcing your moral views on the general population.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The state is a real concept and much better than any of the other concepts you mentioned (which are dumb asf). It isn't though. Like always you don't bring any counters to refute my points. The state isn't a real concept, because it's only a arbitrary group of people. Which is why it has much less meaning in the real world than race, ethnicity or culture. Because those things come with actual real world connections, while the state doesn't. Which is why the state needs those things to have real world connections.  gt;All you need is a revolution and to take charge amongst the populous. Establish a strong military and boom its good. All you need is some form of unity, which the state provides. Kinda like a religion except it actually exists. Revolutionary fervour almost always is snuffed out very quickly, either by the new state apparatus or by the old guard. Because the most revolutionary people are the ones who are most likely to overthrow their new governments. The state doesn't provide unity by itself. Because just forcing people to unify more often than not unites them against you. Because you're only giving them a common foe, and not a common sense of duty or obligation. Because the state can't provide that. You don't hear of anyone ever saying "I did X for my government", but "I did X for my nation" is much more common. Because the state doesn't have a natural driving force behind it.  gt;Nationalism is dumb asf because it puts the people above a state. The state always goes first. Saying otherwise makes you a lousy authoritarian. Do you know literally anything about real world Authoritarianism? Do you know why German kids sacrificed themselves in Berlin 1945? Because of Nationalism (Also nation based fear and Ideology).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You never give me a reason to. I do though. I saw: X doesn't work because of: A. TEXT B. TEXT While you reply with: "no"  gt;If the state is seen as a divine force and high praised power that the people can go to for guidance, knowledge, food, etc. it has a connection and a better one than something as retarded as race (which is a stupid asf concept btw), ethnicity because ppl put themselves above the state, and state worship in itself is a culture (though I reject the concept of culture itself). Just "providing" people with things doesn't work. And that's been proven countless times now. So that's your only connection gone. And even a convoluted concept as race has much more power over people than a functioning state can. And rejecting culture itself is absolutely retarded, because culture is: food, traditions, customs, myths, jokes, and a shit ton of other things.  gt;I only see revolution as a way to achieve my ideology. Everything else to quell rebellion is a win for me. Your Ideology isn't even viable in the foreseeable future. And even then it comes with a shit ton of problems.  gt;I literally just told you how it can. The worship to the state show parallels to religion, in which you can't even argue that. Only difference is, the state actually exists. Religion as a concept actually exists. And both the state and religion as concepts are almost equally arbitrary. Though religion has much more power over people. And if you want the state to become a religion, then you want either a Ideology centered religion or a personality cult.  gt;Thats because in most cases, they are intertwined. The state is literally a governing force amongst the people. It is there to make them feel safe. To maintain law and order. It does have a natural driving force because it is the state. You need the state to even bring unity within a nation, which is why auths rely on it all them time, because without state enforcement, their national identity gets snuffed out. Don't you get what I meant by driving force? Needing the state for law and order  #8800; a driving force. Neither does anything else the state can provide by itself. Nationalism has a driving force behind it, because it can naturally by itself drive people to do stuff for it. This is what the state doesn't have, which it is why it relies on other factors to keep it above water. Like: religious zealotry, nationalism, ideological fervour, and revolutionary fervour. Religious zealotry: religious zealotry is like a flame on a candle, it can last by varying degrees depending on the candle. Nationalism: nationalism as a driving force is strong because of it's wide range of enemies and in-groups. Though it can just as easily take you down from the pedestal as it put you up there. Ideological fervour: Ideological fervour is dead in water without external help. But if you can get enough external help for, than Ideological fervour can be a very good tool. Though as good as it's for you, it can also be as dangerous. Because people can use the Ideological framework (yes even your own framework) against you. Revolutionary fervour: basically the same as Ideological fervour but with a shit ton more violence. Revolutionary fervour doesn't work on it's own, and always needs a Ideological framework behind it.  gt;Yes That was a rhetorical question.  gt;All the nation serves is a unifying factor amongst the people. The state can do that as well. Fear and force and propaganda are ways to implement this as well. Again, in the manner of which the state is the provider of knowledge and guidance and essentials, it is the force that unifies the people and naturally, people would fight for it and bow toward it. Yes it can alone be that factor. The state can't alone be that factor. Because it's propaganda is nothing without the contents. Which is why the state needs things like Nationalism. It is a part of it's toolbox. And the State providing essentials doesn't work, because the people won't work for a cause without any gains. Because how are you going to get bread to the people when the farmers quit and moved to the city. Because they get no gains out of farming when everyone gets their yield for free.  gt;But I'm not trying to have another debate with you rn. We can continue this later. Every debate with you leads to the same place. With you only replying with "no" to all my points. And frankly I'm to sick and tired (literally am both sick and tired) to do this over and over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Mainly because the actual substance of your argument doesn't appear until later in your comment. Your points often repeat and I addressed them earlier. I always bring up the necessary amount of substance. And if a point I made fits in multiple places then I write it in both.  gt;That's mainly because people still retain their free will and individual thought and indoctrinating people with propaganda and torture is effective. If people get their absolute truth and knowledge from the state, they are going to see as divine and they cannot rebel because their truth comes from the place they are trying to rebel against. Bruh get that not even possible in the foreseeable future ass Hive mind collectivism shit. I'm not going to spend my precious time debating over something that's not even possible in the foreseeable future.  gt;Even the glimpse of individual thought they might have would be put down by force. North Korea has this down btw. It's really fascinating how the people both love and fear their leader. He is the state and he comes first. And North Korea is a fucking shithole.  gt;Yeah ik because culture can come from something as stupid as taking a shit, which is retarded asf. So you just want everyone to be an uncultured NPC with nothing special about them? That takes away what makes people human, and not just robots. Why not just kill all of em if we're not gonna have any say in how we think or feel?  gt;Neither is yours. We are just a bunch of idealist auths circlejerking in a subreddit and if our views were brought to general society, they would get shot down immediately. I don't see how this point is relevant at all. My views can actually be achieved now though. Yours aren't achievable in the foreseeable future.  gt;Have you not been reading about how I describe the state? I have. You describe like some pie in the sky artificial god, while in reality it's just a group of people awarded power by another group of people.  gt;And how so? People will inevitably sacrifice their freedom for security and rely on an institution with power to keep them safe. This is why anarchist societies would be unsustainable. You don't see people going out in the streets of the US killing for police officers. Providing law and order doesn't drive the people to a cause. Because providing law and order is something all states have to do in the first place to some degree.  gt;Only the people that would have equal control over me, same within a rebellion. I meant external help as in other factors not people.  gt;You keep addressing this and I keep answering it the same way. The state is seen as divine amongst the people like a religion and mandatory use of force is always helpful. Propaganda works as well. There are plenty of tools to use besides nationalism. There are plenty tools. But the ones you would have at your disposal wouldn't be enough. How are you gonna get anyone to the side of your revolution without any Nationalism? Hell even the closest thing to your ideal society is an ethnostate drunk on Nationalism. Wonder why? Well because no one's going to fight their country men because some dude who wants to make them into NPC wants a """"better world"""" for a Ethiopian worker named Jamal, while they live in the US.  gt;People that put the nation above the state aren't truly authoritarians, because anything that threatens their precious nation from the state, they would gladly rebel against it. Even fascists. A bunch of faux authoritarians. It makes me sick. Being a Authoritarian  #8800; Blindly following the state like some retarded child. Being an Authoritarian is about wanting a strong government to keep society safe and orderly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You bring up the meat of your substance later on in your comment but not within your initial point. Which is why I don't expand on my view until later. I bring up as much meat as have been necessary for all my other """"debates"""". It's just that you don't understand what I bring up.  gt;But you have and you will continue to do so because you know you can't resist me :) A dude using emojis unironically? That's just cringe.  gt;Every country has their shitty parts. Wouldn't be the case if free will was broken down and the state was able to control how to people think and feel. North Korea has their good parts as well. North Korea has a few good parts. Like the Ethnic-Nationalism, and Social Conservatism. But the rest is just dog shit.  gt;Yes, you accidentally came to the right answer. Would you want to live without free will or freedom of thought?  gt;So? Why not just end humanity if no one has any say in their life? Life will become utterly meaningless if all you do is work, sleep, eat and shit. Without any spontaneity, unpredictability or freedom.  gt;My end goal? You're right which is why I desire a transitional IngSoc stage into HMC, which can be achievable. Even Ingsoc was Socially Conservative and Nationalistic, because of the benefits it gave to their dictatorship. Which is why Authoritarian societies usually are Socially Conservative, while Libertarian ones are Progressive.  gt;It doesn't matter in reality, it is just how they are perceived. If people can believe in a God without seeing them, what makes them believe they won't especially when they CAN see them (at least depicted as such). Look back to North Korea. The Supreme Leader stuff they got going on is awesome asf. So you would be fine with the supreme leader just taking your three daughters, raping them while you can do nothing? How is that law and order, and not just anarchy?  gt;This is literally going on right now in response to BLM. No none police are killing for police officers. They're killing so that they can "save" America.  gt;It does though because they trust that the state provides this, which is why they give up to freedom to do so. Going back to the people protesting BLM in the name of protecting and loving the police. They love the state. They don't love the state, they love America, the Republican party, and law and order. They're fighting for their neighbourhoods, families and country. Because in their mind the ANTIFA and BLM hordes are coming for that.  gt;What's not to say I wouldn't get external help? If I do, I see that as an absolute win. How are you this thick-skulled?? I meant Ideological fervour getting help from other factors.  gt;Ideological beliefs which is something you mentioned and dissent against me would only happen with people who share the same amount of influence and power within the revolution. Ideological fervour doesn't cut it alone. It can help start a revolt or civilwar, but without other factors it doesn't do anything.  gt;That sounds based but I'm not a globalist. I'm content with one area of land. And people have fought their countrymen for ideological beliefs as well so it's not impossible in the slightest. You just don't like my ideology. Of course people have fought their countrymen. But that's because they thought they were saving their country.  gt;You should blindly follow the state because they provide a strong government to keep society safe and orderly. If you had your ideal society and would rebel against the state in any way, you aren't an authoritarian. Going against the state  #8800; not being a Authoritarian. Authoritarianism is just wanting a strong state to keep law and order. Nothing more nothing less.  gt;You people never cared about the state. You make me sick to my stomach. You pr*g-cucks don't care about your people, or anyone for that matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You bring your meat later within your comment and express it vaguely in the beginning or you add on to it later so there is no reason for me to go bulls blazing in at the beginning. I go into as much detail as I've needed in other arguments.  gt;Don't see how emojis are relevant to the discussion but ok. The smiley face. It's just a text-emoji  gt;Nah the good parts are mandatory worship to the state and a form of state socialism. Not a fan of those 2 at all. Tho Marijuana is legal there so that's a plus. Social Conservativism is opposition to: gay marriage, abortion, women's rights, immigration and transgenderism. In varying degrees.  gt;Yes that's literally what I want. Who's gonna control everyone then? Who's gonna be the mine to y'all's NPC hive?  gt;Because I would have to be an imperialist and I don't want to be one. Plus why can't work, sleep, eat and shit be the meaning of life. Why not have a central power to control how you feel and think? That seems pretty awesome to me. It'll be office depression on steroids. The normal 9-5 desk monkey life isn't the meaning of life, because otherwise you wouldn't see people striving for the rich life so that they can purchase shit and fuck 24/7.  gt;I'm not going through this clusterfuck again. I more am interested in the ways that IngSoc broke down individual thought and how they became the bearers of truth to the people they controlled. Yes but the tools they used for that were: Social Conservativism and Nationalism. Nationalism literally was a key-point of Ingsoc.  gt;See why do you have to say that? Why that scenario? This is irrelevant because I wouldn't have any children. Because if the state controls your mind, then what stops the state from abusing you or your family?  gt;They are still killing for the state because the state provides that law and order that they love so much. That's why the state exists. How do you not get that? Just because they're fighting for law and order doesn't mean that they're fighting for the state. They're at most helping the state. But in reality they're just fighting to save America and their families.  gt;And where does the republican party and law and order come from? Newsflash: it comes from the state. As for America they do love that but without the state, there could be no America to love. They love the nation, and party Ideology. Not the state. If the state was fighting against them, then they would still be fighting for the nation and party.  gt;If it helps start a civil war or revolt, then there is a chance of that revolt becoming successful. Foreign help can also help as well. Some help has literally been given to rebellious groups because the country that provided it hates the country the people are going against. I was talking about other factors, not external aid. I was talking about factors like: religious zealotry, Nationalism and such.  gt;Or ideals. People fight for what they believe in and what they fight for isn't always for their country. They believe they're fighting for their nation. Not just ideals.  gt;In your ideal society it is. No that's how it is in the real world. Authoritarianism is only about wanting a strong government. Not about blindly following the state.  gt;And when you go against those sentiments for your nation, you aren't an authoritarian. You don't have to support every single government to be Authoritarian. To be Authoritarian you just have to want a strong government.  gt;You cuckservatives don't give a shit about ppl either because you wouldn't condemn them for inherit traits that they can't control. This is why conservatism never lasts because progress always wins. The fact that you assholes would put a nation before the state speaks volumes and what auth you are. You're better off just calling yourself a plain nationalist, cause you are no authoritarian. How retarded are you? There's no code of conduct that states you have to be a dumb fucking child that blindly follows every governments every whim, to be Authoritarian. Social Conservativism is about protecting wider society, traditions, culture and customs through preserving traditionalism. Social Conservativism is just Social Collectivism. While Progressivism is just Social issues centered individualism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What does this have to do with our discussion? You used a smiley face text symbol.  gt;A super AI or a set group of people. Preferably an AI. Why not just have automation do all the work, while humans get to do what they want?  gt;The meaning of life is literally to do all of that. Work, eat, shit, sleep then die. Anything else is hopeful bullshit that shouldn't or barely happens to the majority of the populace. The meaning of life is achieving personal happiness and providing for yourself and your family.  gt;Nationalism in the form of a party, which is a part of the state. There is no "Party Nationalism" or "State Nationalism".  gt;Nothing but there is nothing wrong with the state abusing me. It would do it for good reason. That's how awesome the state is. So let's say the state kills you for wearing ugly shoes. Is that justified?  gt;The state is the one that provides law and order dipshit. They are inseparable. If you are fighting for law and order, you are fighting for the state. They're fighting to protect their families and neighbourhoods. If the state was on the enemy side they would still be fighting. The state is neutral while it's reaping the benefits of the fight.  gt;Where does the party come from? It is from the fucking state and without the state, there could be no America. Do you get it now? The Republican party is it's own origination that interacts with the state and works within it. So fighting for the Republicans doesn't make you automatically fight for the state.  gt;They can fight for just their ideals. Not everything has to be about the nation. You do understand that right? I do understand that. But their Ideals are intertwined with Nationalism.  gt;It can be both. Yes. But blindly following the state is not a requirement.  gt;You also should worship it. If you defied the state in your ideal society, you are going against it making you not an authoritarian. It doesn't though. The only practical thing that can make you not be something you preach is you yourself doing the opposite of it (at least when it comes to politics). Which is why defying your "ideal government", doesn't make you not Authoritarian. It just makes you picky.  gt;I'm not at all but judging from your views, you seem to be pretty mentally challenged. Says the fucker who willingly wants to become a NPC drone.  gt;And how well has that gone for you? Not so well. Which is why it is dumb asf. Some countries are Socially Conservative. Some are not.  gt;So social progressives groups like the LGBT community and "muh minority rights" aren't collectivism? Now you're just being disingenuous. I already addressed how this isn't the case. Must suck that your traditional values will disappear like they always do and will continue to. They aren't collectivist, because they want to split the collective. Social Progressivism's focus is on the freedom of the individual. While Social Conservatism's focus is on the preserving of wider society.  gt;Fucking disgrace of an authoritarian. Just gonna call you a nationalist cuz you don't deserve the title of Authoritarian. Ahhh yes. Not blindly following the state like some fucking chump, makes you a Lolbertarian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Because if I did that, humans would still have the free will to defy the state. That shouldn't happen. Both fix your main issues. Both aren't achievable in the foreseeable future (automation is gonna come long before though). So why not take the one which keeps individuality?  gt;That's YOUR meaning of life and it's stupid asf. So your meaning of life is misery for you and your family?  gt;That's how IngSoc formed unity amongst the people, through the party, which is a part of the state. If that isn't nationalism then you should believe that they weren't nationalistic. Ingsoc was Nationalistic in its rhetoric that kept it's endless war thing going.  gt;If wearing ugly shoes defies what the state says, then yes it is justified 100%. Don't wear ugly shoes. It's that simple. How is it justified though? It's just the arbitrary whims of some power hungry people. You've obviously never interacted with a government in your lifetime. So let me tell you mine: they're inefficient bureaucratic messes who's individual components try to slide under ANY obligation. They're also slow as hell and just plain stupid to the point you'd think they're just trolling. Now this doesn't excuse that Anarchism never works, and that Lolbertarianism is just a fucking joke.  gt;They are fighting for law and order, which is integral with the state. You're shifting from that point now because you know I'm right. You're not right at all. Does the state enforce law and order? Yes. But that doesn't make people who are fighting for law and order state lovers. That just means they have a common enemy. And that they're fighting for the same thing, but not under the same banner.  gt;The Republican party interacts with the state because it is OF the state. Political parties are of the state so yes if you are fighting for the party, you are fighting for the state. So I'd two political parties and their members are brawling in the streets are both fighting for the state? No. Because one's in power and the other isn't.  gt;Not always. If I were to fight for my ideals right now I wouldn't be fighting for a nation. It's that simple. Not everything is about your precious nationalism. Stick it up your ass. I said their Ideals you fucking dimwit. Most people are somewhat Nationalistic in their justifications for their beliefs.  gt;Yes it is. Maybe not blindly but following the state is. Once you defy the state, you are no longer authoritarian. If your opinions are Auth, you're Auth. There's nothing that says otherwise.  gt;Yes it would. I would never defy the state in my ideal government because if I did, I wouldn't be Authoritarian. The government stops being your ideal government, when you don't agree with it. So defying your ideal government doesn't work.  gt;How is that a bad thing? You literally lose your humanity. Your uniqueness.  gt;Ones that are "socially conservative" have shifted their ideals and views throughout the beginning of time and have shifted their "traditions." It's unsustainable and you know it. Does culture and traditions change? Yes. But those countries are still Socially Conservative. Conservativism didn't even exist in those times.  gt;Yes, you accidentally came to the right conclusion. That was sarcastic you fucking moron.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Because individuality causes dissent to the state. How are they going to dissent when their lives are just easily controlled boxes?  gt;That is what you believe to be misery. I find it nice. You literally said that "personal happiness for one and one's family" was only my definition. Which means you don't agree with it, and means you want misery for you and your family.  gt;They were fighting for IngSoc by IngSoc orders. They weren't fighting for the people but for the state. They were energised through Nationalistic rhetoric.  gt;They defied the state. Who's the state in your ideal society?  gt;It does though because law and order is a part of the state. If you fight for law and order, you are fighting for the state. Law and order is something the can state give. It's not a part of it. There are states that have no law and order. So fighting for law and order doesn't mean that you're fighting for the state.  gt;Yes because political parties are of the state. I can use your example now. The party in power is fighting to keep that power, power that they have because they have control over the state at the moment. Political parties aren't entirely in the state. They're also their own organisations. So fighting for a political  #8800; fighting for the state.  gt;Again not every fucking thing people fight for is for a nation. It can be straight idealistic in a theoretical sense. Not everything is about a nation my God. Were you always this slow? I never said everything was about Nationalism, you fucking moron. Just that most people justify their Ideals through a sense of Nationalism.  gt;Let's say your ideals came to fruition, but you weren't happy with the result. You shouldn't defy it now that your ideals backfired in your face. You would no longer be an authoritarian. If you're not happy with the results it stops being your ideal government. The only thing that matters if you're Authoritarian or not is how you'd act with power.  gt;Culture and traditions are a part of social conservatism dumbass. Even if we want to go to the point were social conservatism started existing, are you saying social values did not shit at all within these countries from its origin? If you are, you're definitely being disingenuous. Cultural values have shifted, yes. Culture and traditions aren't a part of Social Conservatism, Social Conservatism is about Conservativism on social issues and preserving cultural values. That doesn't mean that all parts of culture and traditions are part of Social Conservatism.  gt;Again, how is this a bad thing? Because you don't have control over your own actions. Someone else decides your fate and can play god with your life, just because they were in the right place at right time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yeah tell that to the British Muslims that keep immigrating into their country and stripping away their national identity. Good luck trying to fighting the rising social values in the west. You will lose like you always do. White Britons as going to be the majority by 2100. So you're 100% wrong.  gt;Again and again, you say that same shit like the retarded man-child you are. You never being anything new to an argument and only know how to use buzzwords. And there is no fucking pie in the sky state that has any wide ranging authority here. So get you and your trash views out of my comment. This is my fucking post. And doing what you just did only proves my point that you're a fucking retard who can't argue for shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;They still have the individuality to think badly about the state. How is thinking badly off the state dangerous, when they can't act on it?  gt;Probably should have specified more. I meant your view on what personal happiness is. I should have specified better lol. My view on personal happiness. Is just that: Personal.  gt;They are literally intertwined. With the state comes law and order. I don't understand how you are so inept on that construct. Law and order doesn't come with the state. The state CAN provide law and order. Some do and some don't. So fighting for law and order doesn't mean you're fighting for the state.  gt;Organizations that are a part of the state. So fighting for a political party = fighting for the state. They are naturally authoritarian, even the dumbass libertarian parties. The state isn't everything political. So fighting for s political organisation doesn't mean you're fighting for the state.  gt;And im saying it is not always that way you fucking moron but you keep making it out like it is. I never said everything was about Nationalism. Butt like I said before. Most people justify their Ideals through Nationalism.  gt;You are an authoritarian if you hold the power of the state, regardless of what you do with it. Doesnt matter what you do with your power, you're still authoritarian. So a Libertarian ruler is Authoritarian?  gt;You're an actual idiot. If preserving culture values is part of social conservatism and it shifts, then you didnt preserve it. You can't pick and choose what parts of cultures and traditions isn't social conservatism just because it doesn't go your way dumbass. Social Conservativism isn't about preserving all culture. Social Conservativism is about Conservativism on social issues, and preserving the cultural values related to those issues. Preserving cultural values like the nuclear family is Socially Conservative. While preserving 80's culture isn't Socially Conservative.  gt;Again, you have yet to prove how this is a bad thing. Someone who has literally zero claim to legitimacy as god over your life and your fate. Gets power over your life and your fate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Because they only worship the state to not get killed, instead of actually and truly worshipping the state. Giving them the individual thought to defy the state isn't HMC. HMC isn't even achievable in the foreseeable future. And people thinking things when they can't do anything about it, is better than having everyone be a useless NPC that could as easily be replaced by a fucking robot. Why even keep humanity when no one gets to keep their humanity?  gt;Ok so ur views on misery are just as personal. My views on what personal happiness is, is personal. Because it's my personal happiness.  gt;I don't know if you're just show or disingenuous but to make sure I don't lose brain cells, I'm not repeating myself again. I don't know how you can't understand that fighting for the same thing doesn't necessarily mean that you're fighting togheter. You can fight the same foe without being allies.  gt;It literally is though. Everything political in a country relates to the state in some way. It relates to it. But it's not a part of the state.  gt;So there was no point in mentioning that when they were some who don't justify their beliefs through nationalism, like me. There was a point in mentioning it. Because it was related to my point.  gt;Libertarian ruler is an oxymoron. It isn't though. Libertarianism is just smaller government, not "no government".  gt;They are intertwined. Music, for example, would have to conform with the social values of the nuclear family and what not, in which often times it doesn't. Culture change changes social values and vice versa. Making society conform with your values is a given. But that doesn't mean that all parts of general culture has to be changed for a political change to occur.  gt;You have yet to prove how this is a bad thing. I stated my point of why it's a bad thing above. So yes I have proven why it's a bad thing. You just don't have any good arguments for why it's good.</TEXT>

If you count non hispanic whites, what I said is correct. It would still be of a product of immigration. Racial classification systems will always be shit because of how many wide ranging ethnic makeups people and people groups have.  gt;I'm surprised they could tolerate your views.

    <TEXT> gt;You keep repeating this shit, I say the same answer, and we do the cycle again. I addressed everything in this. Not doing it again. It's the truth though. HMC cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future. So using it in your argument is pointless, because it's not even possible yet.  gt;Yes. They're still shit though. In your opinion. But that's the thing about personal happiness. It's personal. So what makes one person happy might make another unhappy.  gt;It literally is though. Political parties are not a thing unless they are a part of the state. If 2 random people and I made our own political party and said we were one, does that make us a political party? No it doesn't. We have to be a part of the state to do that. You don't have to be a part of the state. You just have to go through the political process of becoming a party.  gt;And your point isn't relevant because people can fight for ideals that don't relate to nationalism. My point is relevant. Because my point was that most people justify their views through a sense of Nationalism.  gt;The state will gradually expand and increase it's power like it always does. It's literally an oxymoron. There's no way to accurately say that because Libertarianism is too vague, to accurately say which government is and isn't Libertarian.  gt;It would still be social progressivism on the rise, even if a political change doesn't happen. Culture change doesn't have to be through political methods, but it would still show social progress. Social Progressivism is about Social issues. Like how Social Conservatism is about Social issues. So cultural changes outside of the Social issues, have basically nothing to do with it.  gt;Because it isn't bad in the slightest. It sounds really good actually. Why would I argue against something I agree with? I didn't say that you should argue against it. I literally said before that you haven't argued for it. Which you haven't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It still doesn't make a fucking difference. If BAME are non white britains and by your source, they are increasing in percentage as White Briton decreases, it still proves my point. I didn't say that the immigrant population isn't increasing. But that immigration is on the decline. meaning that less people are immigrating.  gt;Yeah race is a stupid concept in general but given as what we have defined it, my point still stands. Race exists, but it's too big to be accurately represented.  gt;Because the people there are nationalistic idiots who would put their nation above the state and are only "authoritarian" for the sake of the dumb concept of Nationalism. They wouldn't be authoritarian if there was another way to keep national cohesion in their eyes. If they found garbage ass anarchy to be a way to bring the best for the nation, they would gladly shift to it. They aren't authoritarians. They are Authoritarians though. Because they want Authoritarian governments (when they're in power), which is literally the only requirement for being a Authoritarian.  gt;You literally are whining about me commenting on your shit post.

It isn't possible in the foreseeable future. That's the truth. There's literally nothing close to the technology needed for it.  gt;Which is why free will shouldn't exist and why everyone should think the same. Because personal happiness isn't universal? Taking away free will just forces everyone into mental slavery.  gt;So if me and a random person on the street declare ourselves a political party, are we one then? No ofc not. Political parties are of the state. If you and a group of people form a political party that meets the requirements, then you have a political party. Political parties don't have to be a part of the state, they just have to interact with it.  gt;And it is possible and there are some that DO NOT HAVE TO. Of course some don't justify it through Nationalism. I just said "most do".  gt;Which is why libertarianism is a stupid concept and it is an oxymoron. They say minimal gov, but at what point is the gov minimal? If one decides that at one point it is and other says no, then it wouldn't be libertarian. It is an oxymoron. Who says at which point a government is large enough to be Authoritarian? Of course people have different standards for what is X and what isn't.  gt;Social and cultural issues are intertwined within another. A change in one is going to change the other in some way. Yes, in varying degrees both are connected. But Social Conservatism is only about Social issues, and the things closely related to those issues.  gt;Because it's a moral debate. It's subjective. There's no point in it and there is no such thing as objective morality so don't try and pull that shit again. If you have no arguments for it being good. The. It's not good, simple as.</TEXT>

That's 36 years from now.Still, it is only a projection and could change long before then and social and cultural factors would still shift due to the rising immigration population.

No I frankly don't want to do any of this because it's a big fat waste of time to debate someone who has literally zero substance in his counters. There's literally nothing that says that there's more than the one requirement to be Authoritarian.

    <TEXT> gt;In which I address that and we start the cycle again. You have literally given no counters with substance against that. Because it's the truth that HMC isn't achievable in the foreseeable future. And yes I know you want a "transitional iNgsUcKKK" state. But my point that you shouldn't bring up HMC as a point in the argument still stands.  gt;A requirement is that it has to be a part of the state. It doesn't though. It only has to interact with the state.  gt;Then your point isn't fucking relevant then. My point isn't irrelevant, because it was just a small part of a bigger point that you focused on.  gt;Yeah that's fair but it's still an oxymoron. How can a ruler be libertarian? If they have minimal rules, regulations and government interference.  gt;And if you acknowledge that cultural values get shifted, then so do social values. They are intertwined. If a cultural value of a place progresses, so does its social values. Just because culture changes doesn't mean that Social views change. They affect eachother, but just because one changes doesn't mean that the other does.  gt;This is probably the most idiotic thing you have ever said. It's not that I don't have "good" arguments, it's that my belief of what's good is different from yours. You might not find it good so how can I argue for it to be good if there is no objective morality of what is good? There you go with that objective morality nonsense again. You really need to read up on morality. It's not good if you literally can't argue for it being good. I didn't say that you'd have to argue for it being objectively good.

You're just too smooth-brained to comprehend shit or you're blinded too much from your hatred of my views. Either way I don't care. If you want to stop, then don't fucking respond. Bruh a shit ton of your """"counters"""" have just been "no", literally nothing else. So you don't have substance to your arguments.  gt;And worshipping and not defying the state with your ideal society. There's literally nothing that states that as a requirement for being Authoritarian. It's just that you want to gatekeep Authoritarianism as some bootleg version of Totalitarianism.  gt;It doesnt stop when things don't go how you wanted it to. The government stops being your ideal government, when it defies your wishes. And not supporting a state that adheres to your Ideology, doesn't make you not Authoritarian. The only way to not be Authoritarian is to not want a "strong government" in your ideal society.  gt;Do you honestly think I owe you anything? No one owes you any form of decency that you think you're entitled to. Given that you're still commenting, either you have some sense of pride to exuberate or you're just mentally challenged.

    <TEXT> gt;Yes I should because through a transitional IngSoc stage brings HMC. Why would I not bring up my ideology? Jesus christ you're dumb asf. You shouldn't bring it up because it's literally not even possible yet. Which makes everything you bring up pointless, because what you want can't exist yet.  gt;The only way it can interact with the state is if it is a part of the state. Being a part of the state is being a part of the ruling state apparatus. So you can interact with it without being a part of it.  gt;Because that was the only relevant part.

While your ancestors would most likely fucking kill themselves after killing you If they met you.  gt;And what is "minimal?" Is there a set amount of rules that make it minimal and anything outside that would be considered authoritarian? If there is, I'd love to see it. What amount of government is considered big? Totalitarianism could as easily be considered small, as Minarchism could be considered big. It's all just relative.  gt;It literally does though. In some way, shape, or fashion it does. It might change a little, but not enough to change Social alignment.  gt;It really doesn't even matter because I don't know 1 country in the world who has maintained their social values from the day it was created.

All my other points still stand. My points for why immigration is on the decline aren't temporary. Because it's gonna take awhile before a second wave of conflicts and subsequently immigration comes.  gt;We would not even be having the discussion we have if this was true. If that's all you perceived this as, then you look dumb as fuck for continuing a conversation with me in that sense. It is true though. You've literally responded with counters that only amount to: "no". I only responded so that I could attack you on doing that and responding to your very few substance having replies.  gt;Yeah gatekeeping is required because people like you like to downplay what authoritarianism is. We aren't downplaying what Authoritarianism is. You just want to limit Authoritarianism to people you agree with. But there's literally nothing out there with authority on the topic stating what you're saying.  gt;You got your government and therefore must live with it. Don't defy it now because it didn't go they way you wanted it to. Faux authoritarian. Looks like you did want to go through this again. Disagreeing with a Authoritarian government you previously liked, doesn't make you not Authoritarian. The only way to not be Authoritarian is to have opinions contrary to the idea of "big government".  gt;Again, no one owes you a goddamn thing. Oh no he's not showing me muh decency. Boo fucking hoo. You're not gonna get it from me so stop sulking about it. It's a given that you'd act like a uncivilised edgelord.  gt;Pretty ironic statement, especially since you latch on to conservative values which literally go against any sentiment of natural human progress since the beginning of humanity.

Social Conservativism and Conservative values haven't existed since the beginning of time.

That's just basic common sense, but given our discussion, I shouldn't be surprised that you lack it. The argument started about it but has derailed into being about other things. If we were specifically talking about HMC then of course you have to talk about HMC. But you can't bring into it to a discussion about something else, because it's not fucking possible yet. If you just had any understanding of subtext or politics in general, we wouldn't even be having this argument anymore.  gt;Political parties interact with the state by being a part of it, but given how you think me and 2 random people can form a political party without the state, it's not surprising that you keep arguing this.

It didn't address it because it was about something entirely different. You didn't even ask for a source for the immigration decline. You asked for a source on the British demographics.  gt;So you acknowledge that my arguments do have substance, only you're downplaying it to try to make your previous argument not look like you just shifted the goalposts. First they have no substance, now they have few substances? Which one is it? Almost all of your arguments have zero or close to zero substance. A few have a little substance. Saying "all have no substance" was just a angry hyperbole.  gt;In which your views do, because once you got your ideal big government and it didn't go they way you wanted it to and you go against it, you aren't an authoritarian. Which is why I genuinely call you a nationalist. There's literally nothing that states that as true. The definition of Authoritarianism is wanting a big government, that's it. There's nothing about blindly following every Authoritarian governments whim.  gt;You can't argue for shit either, because your responses are full of shit I already address in which I have to repeat myself and the cycle restarts. I tried being civil but something else is going on in that thing you call a brain and it isn't good. My responses are detailed and hard hitting.

There would be no point in mentioning it. Do I seriously have to keep repeating this? It's not that I can't, it's that there is no point. Get it now? Morality is subjective. But that doesn't excuse not having a argument for your moral views.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;And how has Russia been now since the 1920s? Well Lenin died, Stalin happened, WW2 happened, the Soviet Union collapsed, Yeltsin and his shock therapy happened. And now they have Putin.  gt;Hungary has become more conservative? Yeah, specifically under Orb #224;n.  gt;I'd need a source and countries "that stayed in the same place" definitely weren't the same as they were in their creation or probably more than 60 years ago.

    <TEXT> gt;Your argument originally was for immigration decline. I asked for a source and you gave me one on British demographics. You qouted the British demographics thing and then asked for a source. So I have you s source on what you asked for.  gt;Once you go against the government that you got, you are no longer an authoritarian. I aint repeating it again. There's nothing with authority on the topic that says anything about having to do that to be Authoritarian.  gt;Because either you lack any capability of making a decent point or I have to keep reiterating myself because you're too mentally challenged to understand simple sentences. Says the one who literally argued against their own strawmans because you couldn't understand my easily understandable argument.

    <TEXT> gt;I'm talking about the social values from then until now. Homosexuality became increasingly demonised. Soviet feminism was thrown to the gutter.  gt;More conservative pertaining to their original values or what we consider social conservatism? Social Conservativism. You could also perceive the increase in paganism as a Culturally Conservative rise, but ehh.  gt;That much is vague and relative. If there is change at all going forward, it's still social progressivism. Ahhh so becoming more Socially Conservative on social issues is Social Progressivism?  gt;If conservatism is about retaining traditional values, then the change isn't social conservatism. That depends on what is happening. If a country is becoming more Conservative on Social issues. Then it's become more Conservative.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is it still equally demonized in the same way or is their more or less some tolerance? Are there movements that are fighting for change against such homosexuality and feminism? If so, that is social progressivism. Social Progressivism is primarily pro homosexuality and feminism (and the other things too). Russia was slightly more Progressive under Yeltsin, and was a little more Progressive under the late Soviet Union.  gt;Haven't they radically changed their constitution a bunch of times? Has this Orban guy implemented old Hungarian traditional values? He has changed the constitution. And pushed hungry further to the right Socially.  gt;Depends on the given time. They are not retaining their traditional values. This is why I argue that it depends on the values present. What we consider social conservatism now would be different from the future. Are they going back to their original ways yes or no? It doesn't depend a lot on the time. Social Conservativism is primarily Conservativism on Social issues. So against things like abortion, gay marriage and such. Preserving cultural and traditional values is more the definition of general Conservativism.  gt;Again are they retaining their traditional values? If not, it isn't social conservatism. The traditional values generally come in the package with Conservativism on social issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The argument is still related to it because you keep mentioning it, especially when you want me to argue my morality for it. It's still relevant so ofc I'm going to mention it. The arguing for the morality thing came later on. But when it's not relevant anymore you're not gonna be able to mention it as a fix to a problem because it's frankly not possible yet.  gt;Yes it fucking is. It wouldn't be a political party otherwise. I really am not going to reiterate it again. This most likely stems from a definition difference.  gt;It was. I think you forgot something here.  gt;No point in mentioning it at all. You started nagging about something that I never even said In the first place.  gt;No you're shifting the goalposts because you keep editing your argument and you just did it there by adding "reliably saying it is good" and beforehand, you said it just plain "it wasn't good." If you knew the subtext then you'd know that it's the same argument. Just different wording.  gt;Do you not get what I am saying. It's not that I don't have an argument, I fucking do. It is that THERE IS NO POINT BECAUSE MORALITY IS SUBJECTIVE. It is really not that hard to comprehend. It seriously isn't, like at all. Well show your argument then, If this is a card show then why are you not showing your cards?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8226; Land reform: All land should be #160;publicly owned #160;by 'democratic counties', which should be largely self-governing. Rents of land in counties to be shared equally amongst the county population, as a form of #160;social dividend. The landlord profession should be abolished.  #8226; Private Property: You can own houses, appliances and other objects. But land is owned by the counties mentioned previously.  #8226; Government: Trade unions elect representatives to the National parliament. There is only one party, but that party has factions within it. States are made up of multiple provinces (provinces are made up of multiple counties) in the same region, that elect representatives to the parliament through state wide elections.  #8226; Social issues: decided by the states.  #8226; Economics: Syndicalism on a national level. With states free to decide some economic policy to a degree. Bourgeoisie and Capitalist systems are largely prohibited, except for Social Capitalist systems.  #8226; Religion: Public Atheism. With private worship permitted.  #8226; Military: Sizeable military budget. Every male has to start military training at the age of 16 with the training ending at the age of 18. This training will also teach basic life skills, public speaking and healthy living.  #8226; Welfare: Extensive welfare state for the unemployed, disabled and such. Job and financial training will also be mandatory while on welfare.  #8226; Infrastructure: All forms of transportation like trains, buses and such are owned by local companies with the state having two thirds shares in them.  #8226; Policing: Police forces are administrated on the provincial and county level. Policing training is long and focuses on community help, facing stressful situations and both physically and psychologically preparing police officers for all scenarios.  #8226; Ideological enforcement: State police exist to "protect" from ""bourgeoisie takeover""  #8226; Media and journalism: Movies are Regulated by a largely Conservative organisation. High amounts of propaganda in media. Journalism is slightly freer.  #8226; Banking: Mutualist banking system.  #8226; Foreign policy: Militaristic "not in my backyard" interventionism. Think Monroe doctrine.  #8226; Science budget: Science is heavily subsidized.  #8226; Serfdom/Slavery: Full abolition.  #8226; Prison system: Rehab for small crimes. Large "thought crimes" are punished by re-education. Violent crimes are punished by long stays in prison, mental hospital and rehab depending on situation (violent crimes may also warrant life time in prison).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;We may have different understanding of what State Capitalism is, but in my understanding State Capitalism is something like China, with dangerously unregulated markets that are nationalist and serve the will of the state. I'm talking something more like what I understand to be like Market Socialism: That is, there is a large system of government safety net and the government has a large amount of power to regulate, take over, fine, etc. companies, and the government also completely controls certain market sectors or "industries" that the private sector cannot be trusted with (healthcare, energy, prisons, etc.). State Capitalism is China, Nazi Germany and such. While Market Socialism is more about worker's co-ops. The thing you stated above is very left-wing Welfare Capitalism.  gt;I consider it sort of a social issue and it has become a somewhat relevant and popular issue. I also thought it would be worth mentioning because most people in my area of politics are noted for extremely severe and uncompromising ideas of law that I don't like to be associated with. Ehh, it's kinda a Social issue, like you stated. But it isn't really.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Fascism does not have a clear definition. If you find me one beyond the, admittedly loose, definition I was applying from wiki then I will willingly read it and see how well it applies to what is shaped above. Even the one from Wikipedia crushes your argument. It even said Ultra-Nationalism was a requirement. And Ultra-Nationalism is clearly defined as an extreme version of Nationalism.  gt;Ultranationalism #160;is "extreme #160;nationalism #160;that promotes the interest of one state or people above all others", or simply "extreme devotion to one's own nation".[1][2] #160;When combined with the notion of #160;national rebirth, ultranationalism is a key foundation of #160;fascism.[3]  gt;According to #160;Janusz Bugajski, "in its most extreme or developed forms, ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a #160;xenophobic #160;disdain of other nations, support for #160;authoritarian #160;political arrangements verging on #160;totalitarianism, and a mythical emphasis on the 'organic unity' between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous  gt;movement-type party, and the nation".[4]  gt;Roger Griffin #160;asserts that ultranationalism is essentially #160;xenophobic #160;and is known to legitimise itself "through deeply mythicized narratives of past cultural or political periods of historical greatness or of old scores to settle against alleged enemies". It can also draw on "vulgarized forms of physical #160;anthropology, #160;genetics, and #160;eugenics #160;to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny,  gt;of degeneracy and subhumanness".[5] So your weak example of statism is just statist and doesn't fit the bill.  gt;I #8217;ll admit that my personal believe that authoritarianism and fascism can be interchangeable is an opinion. And if you look at my defence of why I would consider this post facist you #8217;ll see I even admit that in a sense, it could be argued not to be. After that though I made it clear what I use fascism for. Well it's dumb to use it that way. Because then Totalitarian Progressive states can be considered Authoritarian, while they don't fit the historical examples of Fascism in the slightest. There's literally no use for it other than "mUh bUzZwOrDs!!".</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Well golly. Here I was thinking  #8220;the people should have the utmost respect and devotion to the state #8221; and treason  #8220;should be punishable by death #8221; and  #8220;dissent should be quickly curbed #8221; and  #8220;torture should not be ruled out for enemies of the state #8221; and forced conscription was enough to qualify as  #8220;... extreem devotion to ones own nation #8221;. But I guess not? And as OP didn #8217;t explicitly mention rebirth of a notion I guess your right it isn #8217;t fascism. Wow destroyed. That's not at all Nationalism. That's just Authoritarianism. Nationalism is pride and love for one's Nation ("Nation" is a concept separate from the state and not usable as a synonym for "state"). So none of that is even close to Nationalism or Ultra-Nationalism because that requires a sense of 'pride" or for "love" one's Nation (Not just state), which almost always is based on either an ethnic, cultural religious or racial identity.  gt;And there I was thinking that  #8220;in its most extreem or developed forms #8221; ment that there are varying levels can exist and still be considered ultra-nationalism. There are varying levels. But nothing you stated above is Nationalist in the first place. And Ultra-Nationalism is extreme Nationalism, so varying degrees of extreme Nationalism is the correct wording.  gt;But your right  #8220;support for authoritarian political arrangements verging on totalitarianism #8221; totally isn #8217;t what we are seeing here, nope, clearly not supporting highly auth politics. Mort Ultra-Nationalists are Totalitarian or Authoritarian but that isn't a requirement. So still you have provided zero evidence of Ultra-Nationalism.  gt; #8220;Mythical emphasis on the  #8216;organic unity #8217; #8221;, I feel like saying that  #8220;people should also have the utmost respect and devotion to the state #8221; being would support that but maybe not. Organic unity between Nation and leader  #8800; devotion to the state. Because the concept of Nation is separate from the state, but can be combined with the state.  gt;As for the Roger Griffin assertion  #8220;vulgarised forms of physical anthropology, genetics, and eugenics to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny #8221; If only OP vaguely alluded to some forms of people not being valid, perhaps some aspects of the LGBT community. Oh and who exactly is determining the standard of  #8220;somewhat normal life #8221; that a fetus has to be determined to have before an abortion is legally enforced, this is the definition of eugenics. And to pretend you can detect  #8220;normal life #8221; in the womb would happily defend as a vulgerizarion of genetics. But what do I know I #8217;m not the head of state. Did you just gloss over the "National Supremacy" part? Fascism often useses genetics to assert "National Supremacy" _ #8220;vulgarised forms of physical anthropology, genetics, and eugenics to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny #8221;_ Doesn't fit anything you stated above. Because again it has nothing to do with the Nation or Nationalism for that matter.  gt;So yeah, guess your right. Definitely not ultra-nationalistic. Nope, they slow down gays in so I guess they are progressive and as we all know, all those progressive totalitarian states are totally not fascists, they can #8217;t be. Progressivism is opposed to authoritarianism or something???? Authoritarianism  #8800; Nationalism. And nothing you've stated above is Nationalist in the slightest. It's just Authoritarianism. Progressive states can't be Fascist because Fascism from Historical examples is inherently Nationalist and Socially Conservative. If it's Progressive but close to Fascism in the sense of government and economics then it's "State Liberalism".</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;none of those are fascist though fascism may hold those characteristics it is not its essence. Fascism in practice is Ultra-Nationalist and Conservative.  gt;Could've sworn I read somewhere he described fascism as a crony corporatism and rejected both Hitler and Mussolini type fascism. He did however prefer the old leaders of the nsadap which kept the name socialism in national socialism. You don't have to be Corporatist to be a Red-Fash. Red-Fascism. He mostly rejected them both mostly on economic issues. Which Red-Fascism also does because it's Socialist. Paetel also talked a lot about "uniting the hammer  amp; sickle with the swastika". His Ideology in the simplest terms could also be described as a more Socialist form of Strasserism. Because they both wanted a council system and were Nationalists. Red-Fascism isn't 100% Fascism with a new coat of paint. But a form of Nazbolism that is closer to Fascism. I'd say Paetel's Ideology is like 20%-30% similar to Fascism. While Niekisch is more like 30%-40%.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think the Longist party would win anything in v #228;stra g #246;taland, especially in the 2040's. This place would be a SD stronghold with how much the younger generations support them. And an American Ideology spreading over here would be basically unthinkable. The place of the Longists would be most likely taken by KD (the Christian Democrats). And with how anti-immigrant sentiment is growing especially in the south of Sweden, a pro-immigration party winning there is very unlikely. With OTL current trends you'd see an SD surge in the 2020's and 2030's. With the party either splitting on immigration between hardliners (AFS types) and more moderate (Jimmie  #197;kesson type) people. And being anti immigration is a large part of being Socially Conservative. So the Longists wouldn't win almost any Right-wing voters, especially with youth radicalisation and earlier political activity among teens. And the political market for the Longist's views already exist in the form of KD and to a lesser degree SD. So, everything points against this whole thing being even remotely possible, especially with a OTL like political set-up.</TEXT>
