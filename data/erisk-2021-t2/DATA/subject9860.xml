    <TEXT>I know it #8217;s hard for some people to live like this, I believe it #8217;s normal that you feel alone especially now without knowing what to do as I understood. I #8217;d suggest you to try and play some games on whatever thing you have, or listening to music so you can enjoy your time, play an instrument. I met most of my friends playing games, so maybe you will to! You #8217;ll get through this, don #8217;t worry  #8216;cause you #8217;re not gonna be alone forever/never, I #8217;m here for you if you want to!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not worth it, killing yourself just stops every good thing that could happen from happening and makes all the ppl who cares about you, fall in the same pit. There #8217;s a lot of ppl that says bad and mean things to everybody but also a lot of ppl who don #8217;t even know you but care about you, here specially. Even though it seems hopeless and non-important you need to show the world how strong you are, think of those who had depression and get through it, they seem like heroes to me at least, think about being that person, and we all know you can be that type of person, it #8217;s hard at first and a lot of people escapes depression with help. Not you though, I know you #8217;re stronger than them  #8216;cause you didn #8217;t do anything yet! and even post your problem here! There #8217;s hope, there #8217;s always something beautiful to fight/live for and it doesn #8217;t even have to be in your life, like waiting some more years to see humans landing on mars or exploring europa ( moon of jupiter ) in search for life! Just find something that really interests you and stick to that while also trying to kick the shit out of depression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re thinking about committing suicide, don #8217;t, there #8217;s always something to fight/live for, I too had the same problem with suicidal thoughts  #8216;cause I felt alone and didn #8217;t know what to live for. I started to get interested in astronomy, physics and chemistry and found out a lot of really interesting things and I #8217;m currently waiting for a lot of astronomy stuff to happen. Maybe that #8217;s the thing keeping you from being happy, so if you wanna talk a little bit I #8217;m always online. We care about you man so stay with us and be happy! #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not bad to be weak, after fighting for so long you just don #8217;t need to fight more, just resist and find someone you like ( a friend, family member ) who personally cares about you. We all love you here and we know that you are much stronger than you think, it #8217;s only that is harder to fight this alone, don #8217;t do anything stupid  #8216;cause I can personally tell you it #8217;s not worth it, please. One day you will enjoy small things like being outside again, the sun hitting you or even eating the most normal food. Keep fighting but this time, call reinforcements! We all love and care about you #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should get help, a lot of ppl think that therapy is for crazy ones but when a family member or a friend needs one, they know that it #8217;s not because you #8217;re crazy ( kinda hypocrite but It #8217;s what happened to me ) so don #8217;t be afraid to ask for some help, whenever and wherever! ( I think that means anywhere and anytime but idk ) Anyways try to ser some stuff on YT maybe, do something peaceful like listening to music or playing with your dog, sometime when I #8217;m anxious, nervous or anything I watch  #8220;LockPickingLawyer #8221; ( a YT channel about locks and stuff ). I think what you have is a  #8220;fear on stage #8221;? ( idk hoe to call it ) but I at least get really nervous when talking to a group of people, sweating, not being able to talk, a tick on my leg or snapping my fingers. If it #8217;s that I know how it feels like, but if it #8217;s not like that it doesn #8217;t matter, you #8217;ll get through it with or without help! And throw those blades to the trash, I used to cut myself a lot and I #8217;m trying not to do it again watching those cuts and thinking  #8220;I #8217;m getting through it, that was a bad move but a proof that I #8217;m stronger now #8221; You #8217;re strong and you sound like an amazing person, so don #8217;t think you #8217;re selfish  #8216;cause we all are smart in our own ways #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m struggling with a similar thing, my gf left me 2 months ago saying that she was tired of seeing me with a fucked up mental health and I was just annoying most of the time, that It didn #8217;t seem that I was trying to fight depression and shit. I #8217;m too struggling with suicidal thoughts since and almost successfully kms. I can #8217;t say it #8217;s gonna get better but just know that there are a lot of ppl who have the same problem as you, if you wanna talk, my dm will always be open for you.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been struggling with depression and stress for 5 years now ( I #8217;m 16 ) and my first gf had problems with her looks, we enjoyed every little while we could be together and had a discussion once. We helped each other a lot to the point I was able to make her see the beauty she is, shame it wasn #8217;t the same for me. The moment she saw how I was still struggling after almost 2 years of being together, she feared she could fall back again, so she dumped me like a week after that. When I thought we were gonna have our anniversary, and started trying to recover, she fucked me up. It #8217;s difficult to say who #8217;s a better  #8220;choice #8221;  #8216;cause you could get fucked up like me, or help each other at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m no expert and I didn #8217;t officially studied anything, but it #8217;s a fact that proving the wrongful of something wrong is pretty hard. I don #8217;t think you can say something does fall because of gravity that would be convincing to an ex-flat earther or flat esrther, maybe you could show then some properties of gravity like orbits, black holes or space-bending anonalies. Also, the title is implying something that fall due to gravity and not density/boyancy, suggesting those things actually help falling objects fall, so I #8217;ll change that. I hope you get them to understand gravity and it #8217;s amazing properties!</TEXT>

Time fucking stopped, I couldn #8217;t listen to the music anymore and I quickly stepped back just as the motorcycle was about to hit me, I paralyzed in place knowing I could #8217;ve died in front of my own house, then went back to listening to music and laughed at the almost lethal accident.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not only too short, it #8217;s not really detailed enough to be interesting to read, what makes ME read scp #8217;s is the way they explain how scp #8217;s do things, or how they think they do and how they clarify what they do. Here it has none of that, the description of the scp is fused with the scp #8217;s request for her project and all those spelling errors like  #8220;projekt #8221; destroys the scientist-like document the scp foundation is supposed to give. I #8217;ll suggest taking more time thinking about what you would like you scp to be, taking examples from other ones, using some time explaining why or how that scp does what he does as you like ( Unproven or provenly explanations ), and for the spelling errors, you could write it on word maybe, taking your time for no typos and paying attention to the red line below the wrongfully typed words. Hope with that you can write an enjoyable and interesting scp, wish you luck!</TEXT>

You shouldn #8217;t be angry at yourself for not knowing how to or not being able to talk to other people, love other people and shit, those thing are achievements friends you like should get, not anyone. Also I guess the irritation comes from all those problems, not getting to express or behave as you #8217;d like. For that I just play games all day and listen to deathmetal and shit, heavy stuff generally for me to free my emotions in a non-annoying way to anyone.

      <TEXT>I personally like when I can hang out with a girl as a friend, and in a relationship I expect the same, being more attached friends but still, It #8217;s the best thing being able to just enjoy a good time together without doing anything or playing games and shit you do with your pals. I #8217;m not saying I wouldn #8217;t treat her as my gf, just that I can treat her both. Above that there needs to be love for each other, without having to change anything unless it hurts someone in some way.</TEXT>

Anyways I remember just dreaming about her having a convo with me about the breakup we had, how she met her new bf two days after that and was cooler than me and shit, luckily my mom set up my alarm to wake me up at 6am exactly, so It didn #8217;t get worse than that.

      <TEXT>I listen mostly to deathmetal and heavy stuff, and I don #8217;t really think about anything at all when I listen to music, it #8217;s actually a way to ignore the problems I #8217;m going through at the time. It must be a really specific lyrics or a song I have some history with to make me feel some emotions about my personal life, let #8217;s say Everything Ends - Slipknot, Second Heartbeat - Avenged Sevenfold or Four seasons - Rex Orange County. Sometimes when I start to listen to any song after having a really bad moment of some kind, the music is just a background noise wich I try to focus on.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I came back from holidays, texting my bf every day saying how I was and asking for her, nothing wrong there. I come back, the first thing she texts me is  #8220;We gotta meet, are you up to that? #8221; Obviously I said  #8220;Yes! I miss you so much! #8221; or some shit like that. we meet with the promise that we were going to eat, head out and do something outside as we used to, not this time. She starts telling me that she can #8217;t handle my depression anymore and she doesn #8217;t wanna get involved again with mental problems, that I was a golden person bla bla. Says we should breakup, that she was thinking that for a while now and doesn #8217;t wanna know about my mental state anymore, all of this while I was fucking crying like never before ( she never saw me crying, I try to not cry in front of anyone ). We get out, she asks if I #8217;ll be okay, with a fucked up face I clean my tears and say  #8220;Yes, I #8217;ll be ok dw! #8221; while doing the fakest smile I #8217;ve ever did. the first thing I did was hug her, cry again, clean my face again and head to my house. I had to walk 3 fucking km to my house because I had no money for the bus ( I didn #8217;t even cared when I was going to meet, since spending time with her was all that mattered to me ) Mid trip I have the brilliant idea of doing self harm once again, I buy some blades ( I had my credit card ) and keep walking. Once in my home I just lay in my bed and keep fucking crying. An hour passes and I #8217;m still there crying and thinking why the fuck did she broke up with me in that moment. a month goes by and I start having suicidal thoughts, some days after that I start planning my death, 2 days or so after that I try to hang myself but the rope broke. A week goes by and I try to km again but now using pills, not swallowed enough and I suffer the worst headache and stomachache I #8217;ve ever went through. Another month goes by ( almost present day now ) and I #8217;m feeling better, ignoring any kind of thought about her, recovering myself by talking to some friends, browsing in my first account on reddit, to then discover by a friend that she, 2 god damn days after the breakup, was dating another fucking guy. Clues everywhere that she was dating him since I went to brazil for holidays ( I #8217;m from argentina ). And now I #8217;m here, with once fucking again suicidal thoughts and struggling to say anything to anyone unless is a fucking stranger on the internet.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My ex-gf also experienced this and a little more, I remember walking down the street searching for a shop when a guy started screaming sexual things at her, saying she had a nice ass and stuff like that ( I was 14 and she was 15 ). I and her ignored the first two disgusting things he said and tried walking away, when ge screamed the third one I was a little far but still I screamed at him saying  #8220;What the fuck is wrong with you cunt? Try finding someone of your age next time if you can! #8221; I can #8217;t say I wasn #8217;t a little nervous, but as an introvert the adrenaline made me stay in place waiting for an answer and a possible fight ( Although I prefer just talking, I #8217;ll rather call the police than get into a fight ). He sweared something I don #8217;t remember and didn #8217;t say any other word. The beautiful thing was that he was asking for some alms during that, and no one gave him anything ( in a place where 4/7-9 give alms ). Fucking beautiful</TEXT>

He didn #8217;t even tried to hit the other protesters, just the one that punched him, that #8217;s not being aggressive that #8217;s trying to defend yourself. The problem is when you have braindead people who fight for the blm movement and are so sensitive that if they see a black person getting in a fight, it #8217;ll always be the good guy, even if he punched first. There are some ppl protesting for blm that don #8217;t do that, at least my hope is on them.</TEXT>

But really, the  #8220;n-word #8221; has it #8217;s power of being so bad and such an awful word because we gave it that power and I don #8217;t think a simple word needs to be a bad word, not even swear words. I find it hard to express myself correctly since I didn #8217;t fucking sleep but I #8217;m trying to say that the  #8220;n-word #8221; is such a bad word because we want it to be like that, we want it to be offensive just like swear words, and when we normalize that ( it #8217;ll surely happen ) it #8217;ll be just as any swear word, some people will avoid saying it but most of us will be fine when hearing it.</TEXT>

If people fake depression it #8217;s really easy to see it, especially if you already know a person dealing with depression or you are one.

      <TEXT>every match feels the same maybe because you play on the same maps every time, don #8217;t fuck around with friends or play alone. You shouldn #8217;t rush every time every round being for example a ct. Matchmaking is atrocious ntl. Most of the cheaters are playing on no-prime so don #8217;t bitch about it, just buy prime or earn it to n lvl 21. How is the gunplay slow and boring if you rush every time? and how do you only hold an angle every round, every match if you and your team always rush? You have Running ( every gun without holding shift, and with small variations depending on what gun you #8217;re holding, ) walking ( again, velocity depending on the gun holding ) jumping and crouching, also there are boosts, and runboost but you didn #8217;t know abut that, did you? There are beautiful skins for under 20 dollars, if you only focus in the most expensive guns then the problem is you, let #8217;s say a faded mp7 is 14 dollars, an ak is much more expensive, so you don #8217;t have to spend hundreds of dollars if you master a gun like the mp7, mp9, etc. Idk what you mean by player expression. The community is toxic, but csgo is more enjoyable with friends. Cs:Go is a tactic, non-dynamic first person shooter that requires deep knowledge of the guns, maps and player-timing for you to play good and enjoy the game, if you don #8217;t like that type of game then don #8217;t say it #8217;s shit just because of that. cs:go is objectively one of the best, tactic and skill-requiring fps out there, not a cod-like game.</TEXT>

Also, to the comment you deleted: It was definitely one of those excuses, I don #8217;t drink, don #8217;t smoke, don #8217;t start any problems. I #8217;m a calm guy who really cared about her, even after 2 years of relationship I helped her with some self esteem problems. She just wanted someone else to fuck with probably, after 4-5 days they were saying the same thing she and I struggled to say with a real meaning ( I love you and shit like that )</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oh yeah, people who are already with bad intentions or existing problems aren #8217;t the cause of crimes, it #8217;s the violent video games that make normal people commit crimes independent of their mental state. Oh, looks like there #8217;s violence on TV as well, showing those kind of crimes, oh what a surprise the movies also show violence! let #8217;s handle reality with responsibility because a typical human being could start thinking about committing a mass shooting and shit. Also, to the case you addressed, if a game teaches me how to fly a plane, why the fuck would that be violent in any way? it #8217;s you that wants to fucking crash that plane and kill someone, not the video game telling you to do it. You could #8217;ve seen how to fly a plane in any other way and then what? isn #8217;t that violent? Same case with everything else, real life is violent, crude, disgusting and awful in many ways, a person can become violent in any fucking way without the need of playing video games or watching any kind of entertaining. PD: There are less crimes from teenagers ( Idk young adults ) now than some years ago when video games weren #8217;t a thing.</TEXT>
