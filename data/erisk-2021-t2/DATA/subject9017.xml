I would start listening to an album then after 20min it went to sleep and the music stopped. I got this app I'll leave a link below. You have to select all the apps you want to keep alive and it requires mouse toggle app to use it. There are other apps where you can just stop it going to sleep all together.

    <TITLE>Who has 3rd party apps that work with voice keyboard?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 13:53:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Does anyone have any 3rd party movie apps on their Fire TV/Stick? If so does the voice keyboard work everytime you do a search? I reset mine the other night and the voice keyboard worked on Silk Browser, Firefox etc. When I started installin 3rd party apps it still worked for (LiveNetTV, Mobdro) then when I started installing 3rd party movie apps (Cinema HD, Tea TV) I noticed the voice keyboard option disappeared. Anyone still has it working or noticed the same issue I've had? Thanks</TEXT>

I have an app that allows me to force stop apps in background when I'm not using them. I have noticed if I force stop Mobdro it starts running in background again after a while in sleep. No other app does this if I force stop it. Why does it do this?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Movies Buffering</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-24 16:01:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Does anyone have problems with movies buffering? I have a couple of Movie apps which I've installed. I also have a Fire TV with the same apps on. My Fire TV works flawless when playing a movie. The Shield starts playing but then starts to buffer after about 20 seconds and then every 5 seconds or so after the first buffer. It's the same distance as Fire TV from router. I've tried changing settings etc but no joy. Wondering if anyone else has these issues?</TEXT>

The exact same movie and source won't buffer on my Fire TV. Also if I turn my VPN on, on my Shield movie will play without buffering. So why does movie buffer on Shield with VPN off but with it on it doesn't buffer. Why doesn't it buffer on my Fire TV with VPN turned off? I just don't get it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the same source if that's what you mean? It's Vex movies (Google video) source. The film is The Burning. Like I say strange thing is it works with VPN on but buffers when it doesn't. It starts to play well before it buffers. Starts quickly and plays for a minute but then the buffering starts. It's like something is interfering with it. The VPN is obviously blocking it from doing it. The same movie plus source doesn't buffer on Fire TV. In fact I've tried many sources and movies and they all buffer bad on the Shield with the VPN turned off but are fine on the Fire TV without VPN on. Super confusing. I'm sure there's something either on the Shield setup or Android TV that does this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry to ask this as I'm sure you have been asked a load of times before but how does Stremio work? I have a Nvidia Shield and a 4K Firestick. I want to use Stremio on them. Now I would like to use it with the Juan Carlos addon. When streaming does the movie download to the hard drive of my device while it's streaming? If so once I have finished watching the movie does it delete it or does it get stored in a folder till I manually delete it? Also what are the best settings to use as little memory as possible with the device. Any help would be great thanks, I mostly use streaming apps that aren't torrent based so new to this side of it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It might have low memory. If you install 3rd party apps and then update them the apps install installation files and eventually they can clog up the memory. I'd download ES File Explorer and then go to the download folder and see what's in there. Also delete any cache in apps from the Fire TV settings. Try see if that improves it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No offence to you but Ola is absolute turd. It has say for eg, 20 UK sections of which probably 17 are all the same section with same channels under a different name. Don't know why the dev does it as it's totally pointless. Maybe just wants users to think it has 1000 UK channels when in fact it just has 40. Most of which either freeze or don't work at all. It's a waste of time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You might of done these options but I'd try if you haven't. Install ES File Explorer, load it up and on the left select the Local tab, then the Home tab (2nd one down) then go to downloads folder and see if any apk installation files are in there (if you use 3rd party apps) delete if there is. Next go through each app (in the Amazon settings, applications, installed applications) and check the data. Some apps save a lot of data after a lot of use. If there are some with a lot saved delete it but word of warning it will reset any saved settings that app has. It won't break anything but you will have to maybe change settings to your preference again. Also as zahi36501 says set the screensaver to never and then clear the data for it in applications settings. Also turn off Amazon photos in applications settings. Hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Brand new external hard drive not working on Shield</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-22 14:02:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just bought a Intenso 2TB external hard drive 3.0 usb for my Shield. When I connect it just says "Issue with Intenso USB Drive, Intenso USB drive is corrupt, Select to fix". When I click the option it takes me to the storage tab in the settings, the removable storage option just says "Intenso is safely ejected". I have 2 other Intenso hard drives (500GB, 2.0 usb) and they work fine. My new drive works as I've tested on my laptop, it's formatted to Fat32 as are the other 2 Intenso hard drives which work. I've tried restarting my Shield and it still doesn't work. Does anyone have an idea how I can sort this? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Has anyone ever got a trackball game working with a game pad analogs? I'm playing Golden Tee Golf for Mame and trying to figure out how to get it working well with the analogs. I can change the settings for the analog but it seems to be fixed if that makes sense. If I set the Track Y Digital Speed at 100 it will be like I've moved it at 100% speed but I'd like it if it was sensitive to the analog so not the same set speed all the time. Hope this makes sense</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have 3 USB external hard drives. Got the 3rd only recently. I have a USB 4 port adapter and have plugged the 3 drives into that. I have noticed one of the drives will turn on and off. Is this because there isn't enough power to work all 3? Any help/advice would be appreciated, thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this probably isn't the right place to ask this question but everyone here is always very helpful so thought i'd give it a shot. I've got a LG TV and am buying a sound bar. The sound bar has HDMI ARC as an input. I have 3 HDMI inputs on my TV including an ARC one. The thing is all 3 HDMI inputs are taken up. Is there a type of HDMI ARC splitter that anyone knows of so I can use the port for the audio from TV and still use it for say my Shield video input without having to press a button to switch?</TEXT>
