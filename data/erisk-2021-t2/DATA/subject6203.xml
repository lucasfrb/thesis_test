    <TEXT>There's definitely a lot of spotlight on damage players. They're generally the flashiest to watch and their actions are the easiest to breakdown/digest. I do wish that casters would spend more time going over the intricacies of tank and support, however. Perhaps this would motivate others to choose these roles, especially with the 2-2-2 role lock coming to live servers soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just bought an Intel processor that has the letter "T" on the end (i5 6500T, to be specific). While I do know that the T indicates lower power consumption, does this also indicate that the chip is of lower performance (due to the low TDP). I couldn't find much information on traditional CPU benchmarking sites on this topic.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's not about the days. It's about making the days count.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-02 10:07:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>After a 105 day streak, I messed up and relapsed. Gamed for a few hours over the week-long school break due to boredom and procrastination. I was quite disappointed at myself for a few days and took time away in order to evaluate my decision and reflect on my actions. Over the past few days, I've realized that I have been looking at the streak the wrong way. Throughout the 105 days of sobriety, I was merely going through the motions of life. I was never attempting to elicit change in myself. I did not pursue any of the goals that I had set for myself from the beginning (get better grades, lose weight, socialize, etc.) and just went through the days in order to feel good about the streak that I had set for myself. I pondered and thought about my actions and why I relapsed. And I realized that it was never about counting the days. It is about making the most out of every day. The days that I stay away from gaming do not matter if I do not replace the time-wasters with progress toward my goals. I did not attempt to make myself a better person but thought that merely staying away from gaming would make me one. This challenge that we endeavour on in order to obtain self-improvement is not binary; there is no "on and off" switch. Recently in my AP Biology class, we learned about how enzymes catalyze substrate. And I realized that this was a perfect analogy to my life - the current situation that I am in right now. I am the enzyme. Gaming was my competitive inhibitor, and I've removed that from my active site. But removing the inhibitor does not automatically entail that the substrate will be catalyzed. The enzyme has to still catalyze the substrate. And this is what I've realized. I've got to go out there and accomplish my goals. Catalyze my substrate. I'm restarting my counter from 0 again, this time with a clear mindset and vision for what I want to do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to enable modification of S/L/E in Catalina?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-20 06:08:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone. I have a successful Hackintosh on 10.15 Catalina (i5 6500T, HD 530, 12GB DDR4) but I need to modify the S/L/E folder in order to replace IO80211Family.kext to get my Wifi card (DW1510 working). When I run the following command - sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext - I get the error that S/L/E is read only. Is there any way that I could enable the modification of S/L/E, or is this not possible? Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>After 6 miserable years, I'm free now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-18 00:49:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>To provide a bit of backstory, I have been addicted to video games for the past 6 years of my life. I felt inferior and incompetent to the people around me and believed that I could not live up to the standards that they possessed. I felt like nobody in society. Gaming provided me with a fortress of solitude, a "comfort zone" that I lived in. Over time, I built up a dependence on compulsive gaming; I could not see anything in my life other than my username going higher and higher on the leaderboard. The fortress of solitude was a fire that kept me warm but burned me whenever I went outside it. Anytime that I was not at my computer I was upset, waiting for the moment that I could return home to play games. Anytime not spent on games was spend thinking about strategy or watching Twitch/YouTube. I was stuck within the walls that I had built upon myself. Society moved on and I fell behind. It wasn't until August of last year that I began to take my addiction seriously. A good friend of mine talked to me about it, and I realized that I needed to get out. However, after building dependence on gaming for so long, it was strikingly difficult to move away. After missing so much of real life, I was scared to move away from my comfort zone, this fire that had kept me warm for so long. But I realized that I needed this for my life. I realized that with video gaming, I could always be happy, but I would never be content. I gave my passwords to my friend to change and keep and sold my graphics card. The first time of quitting gaming was shockingly refreshing. I took a good look at real life for the first time in so long and it shocked me. However, my mind was still stuck on playing video games and I could not get away from that. I would turn on Twitch streams as soon as I got home and was essentially at square one again. I kept a Day Counter and got up to 108, but this meant nothing because I did not make any progress. I was still very unhappy with myself and reinstalled some games with someone else's account and played 10-20 hours each in November and December. I had taken the SAT in December and was feeling pretty confident with my score. However, when my score came out on December 21, I realized the true extent of how little I had progressed even though my day counter was so high. Every day was a chore to get through and I just followed the number without having a plan in mind. I became sorely depressed and relapsed a second time, this time playing for a solid week. However, I gained stony resolve at the end of winter break and decided to put a foot down. I forced myself to craft a new mindset and sold my entire setup, monitor and computer included. I only kept a MacBook for school. I decided to look past from this dark time in my life. It was the beginning of a new decade, a new year. And I wanted to change, so badly. January was the beginning. I forced myself to stay away from computers and enjoy life. The application of the new mindset was difficult, but much easier this time. I was motivated to work on my schoolwork, my assignments, the academic teams that I am on, and other projects/hobbies. I began to see the change, the light at the end of the tunnel. For the first time in so long, the majority of my grades were A's and I received high marks for my work, which I began to put effort and dedication to. I had an academic competition in that month as well, and while I did not get a placement that time I competed, I was one position away from earning a medal for my team; a feat that I had not accomplished before. Additionally, I talked to a girl in my Biology class that I had a huge crush on. She was very pretty and smart, a far cry from the person that I used to be. Yet, I was surprised to learn that she regarded me as an intelligent person instead. I realized that the world still believed in me - that I was not stupid, that I had still potential. And that motivated something in me. February was a continuation of that mindset I had garnered earlier. No longer was gaming even a thought in my mind. I continued to push forward and started going to the gym, as all the years of compulsive gaming had damaged my physical fitness and caused me to be classified as obese according to BMI. I went to the gym every day that I could and ended up losing 15 pounds by the end of the month. I maintained the grades that I had earned in my classes and continued to get high marks. My academic team went to another competition and this time was finally a breakthrough for me as well, as I managed to earn medals this time. Additionally, I managed to work up enough confidence to confess my feelings to the girl I liked; something that I would never have imagined myself doing just a few months ago. Although she did not express similar feelings towards me, we continued as friends and I felt largely more confident in myself. This has been my story so far. Covid-19 has cancelled many of the opportunities that I was originally intending on pursuing (volunteering, competitions, retake of the SAT). But what I realized is that chasing dreams is like chasing fire. You never know what's going to happen, when it's going to extinguish. But that's the fun in life - the uncertainty, the prospect of doing something in this short time we are on the planet. With gaming, I was always happy when I was at my computer, but always felt upset when I could not be there. I was chained to video games and that was the only thing that I could think about. Things are different now. My life has completely changed for the better and I am fully committed to traveling this new path now. After 6 years of not believing in myself and feeling inferior, I'm free now. Free from this poisonous mindset, and ready to embark on a new journey. This is only the beginning!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds really cliche, but I #8217;m currently looking to try some new things that I #8217;ve been wanting to try for quite a while. I remember my mom gave me a guitar a while back and I never played it; seems like a great idea to try it now. Additionally I #8217;m also attempting to learn some computer programming, such as Scratch or Java. Honestly I have been tempted to go back to games sometimes, but my mindset has completely shifted and I feel compelled to try new things now, rather than stick to the old. There #8217;s so much to do once you just think about it for a little bit. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that it is possible for couples to experience gaming together when in moderation; however, from the way you described your husband it is evident that his level of negligence is hurting your relationship. As an addict in recovery I would recommend talking it out or marriage counseling, as I feel that communication with my friends and family is what really got me to realize the negative effects of video gaming on my life. Perhaps he does not realize how detrimental his behavior is.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Days, not streaks</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 06:27:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>This journey has undoubtedly been one of the hardest I have ever gone on in my life. Thanks to this sub, I have been able to connect with many others who share similar experiences and connect to their stories. Each one of your posts has inspired me to push forward and continue on this journey. However, one thing that I think about a lot is what "streaks" and "relapses" really mean. As with any addiction, the end goal is to escape it and eventually become clean in the end, therefore taking back one's life. But I feel that a relapse, or a loss of a streak, shouldn't be viewed as something overly negative. Sure, you may have played games at 100 days in, but even though you lost that one day there were still gained 99 days out of the process. Falling off the wagon doesn't mean that all progress is lost; rather, it is an opportunity to learn from the mistakes that caused us to divert off our goals and continue on the pathway. While you may have to start at 0 numerically, I think the reality is much more optimistic. Even if you do relapse, you are now 14, 30, 90, or even more days better than what you would have been had you not recognized the addiction at hand and tackled it. Personally, I feel that this experience is very valuable. I have technically relapsed twice since August (both times were last year), but each time I picked up it was much more easier to keep running forward, to see where the light is again. In conclusion, I just feel that "falling off the wagon" shouldn't be viewed as something terrible. We're all human, we all make mistakes. Hell, by even attempting to tackle our mistakes in the first place we're already making tremendous progress. Every relapse, every mistake in life is an opportunity to learn something new and avoid that trigger in the long run.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've experienced a similar feeling personally. Quitting your escape means that you are forced to acknowledge the problems in your life. Once you start to tackle those problems and make your life better, you will see just how much you are now in control of your destiny. I know this is quite cliche, but trust me, it gets better! You've already taken the first step; something that many struggle with doing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're talking about a $1500 iPhone you're probably referring to the iPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB. However, the new iPhone SE (2020 model) has the same A13 Bionic processor inside of it and costs nearly 1/4 of the price of the top of the line model. I would suggest going for that one instead since that's a great value; you'll be getting nearly the same performance, as well as at least 4-5 years of support with the processor inside. If looking on the Android side there are many refurbished Google Pixels that I've personally used in the past. Stock Android is very clean and you can find these easily for under $250 depending on storage and what device you get. The cameras on these phones are also amazing and Google has been great with software updates as well. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you don #8217;t need the absolute best gaming performance, I would suggest going with the Ryzen 5 3600 and a B550 motherboard (releases this month). Saves you some cash while being better in multi core applications, and is an all around good CPU. But both processors are very capable. List looks good overall.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, media bias is apparent on both sides of the political spectrum. But trusting numbers from an obviously biased source (mind you, this is the same thing that Ben Shapiro used to write for) and then using it as a political statement is just blatant agenda pushing. Also, saying "Black Lives Matter" is essentially saying "All Lives Matter." If one house on a street is on fire, you're not going to get a firetruck to spray water at all the houses. All lives matter, so we should help the people in society that are the most disadvantaged.</TEXT>

What I was saying was that Brietbart is obviously skewed to the far-right and will twist numbers to push agendas, just like the left-biased media. Breitbart News Network (known commonly as Breitbart News, Breitbart or Breitbart.com) is an American far-right[6] syndicated news, opinion and commentary[7][8] website founded in mid-2007 by American conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, who conceived it as "the Huffington Post of the right".[4][9][10] Its journalists are widely considered to be ideologically driven, and some of its content has been called misogynistic, xenophobic, and racist by liberals and many traditional conservatives alike.[11] The site has published a number of conspiracy theories,[12][13] and intentionally misleading stories.[14][15]</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't change the fact that these numbers will obviously be skewed to push an agenda. Additionally, it is common knowledge that Brietbart is skewed right - not some left leaning agenda. What's disgusting here is the usage of skewed statistics to misrepresent an underlying, socioeconomic issue of this country. You don't have to be a liberal to accept the reality that life for African Americans is harder than it is for whites. That's just a fact.</TEXT>

In fact, you actually changed the subject by making the argument that I never made - saying that left-biased media exists, which is irrelevant to the fact that you are still using biased statistics that favors a certain political agenda. This is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.</TEXT>

I've plugged in the GPU into a working system but the fans do not spin, no matter what I do (I've tried to control fans through Afterburner, no luck). Don't really have the time right now to deal with it since it has no warranty so I'm hoping someone more experienced knows how to fix it or can attach regular fans to the card (Linus has a good video on this).|[https://imgur.com/a/5xlytr2](https://imgur.com/a/5xlytr2)| |~~ASUS Radeon RX 560D 4GB GDDR5 Graphics Card (READ DESC)~~|~~$30~~ SOLD|Again, the fans do not spin on this card no matter what I do.

Just needed more DIMMs so I swapped it out for a B85. Works with Haswell LGA1150.

    <TEXT>God I will never understand how much this has to be explained to people.  #8220;Black Lives Matter #8221; is an acknowledgment of the fact that systemic racism has had a profound historical impact on the lives of African Americans. It is not meant to devalue the lives of white individuals, but attempting to help blacks who have historically been underprivileged (example: effects of redlining). By saying  #8220;Black Lives Matter #8221; one is essentially saying that  #8220;All Lives Matter. #8221; Yet saying  #8220;All Lives Matter #8221; is basically slapping the face of African Americans. Yes I agree that the rhetoric of the slogan is not the best but the core intentions of the movement are not based on devaluing other lives as many have stated here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there, I'm wondering if there will ever be a possibility to get macOS Big Sur with proper acceleration on a 2011 MacBook Pro (2nd gen i5 CPU). I'm no software developer and I understand that because of the lack of Metal it is much harder to patch this version of macOS, but I was just wondering if such a feat would be possible at all post-Beta or if it's just out of the question entirely. Just curious, no pressure on any developer, you guys are actually legendary and have allowed me to get two more years out of an unsupported machine. Thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Last year DosDude made a video around November for macOS Catalina 10.15. At the time there were still bugs with the patcher which have been ironed out since. Considering that macOS Big Sur is going to be considerably more difficult to patch than previous versions of macOS, I'd say to not get your hopes up until at least January. These developers do all this work for free and patches like these take a lot of time. Be patient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congrats on realizing the problem and taking the first step. I have a similar situation and can relate to your struggles. A desire to be the best in a virtual world has isolated us from society. It's never too late. Even though you may think of yourself as a failure right now, look in the mirror and imagine the person that you actually want to be. There's no easy path, but what keeps me going is the promise of a rewarding future and a fulfilling life. Good luck on your journey!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-08-31 15:30:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there HWS! I'm looking to save up a little bit of cash so I'm selling some things I don't need. Today I am selling a Dell Inspiron 15 3567 Laptop. Originally bought for school but I think the money is better used somewhere else at the moment. The specs: i5 7200U, 8GB DDR4-2400 RAM, 500GB WD 3D SSD, HD Touchscreen Display Timestamps: https://imgur.com/a/0Dm2gML The laptop is in good cosmetic condition. All the major functions work correctly. The two main issues are that 1) the optical drive does not work (but I didn't have a use for it anyways) and 2) the right hinge is somewhat loose because of a missing screw that I don't have. These two functions do not affect the function of the laptop and everything is still structurally well for the most part. Considering these issues, I am asking for $220 shipped or $200 local pickup (originally paid nearly $400 including upgrade made). I am also open to offers! Local is 91780. Thank you for checking out my post!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there, I #8217;m looking for broken 2012 MacBook Pros to fix up. Specifically looking for the unibody non-retina model. Things that I #8217;m looking for are defects like broken glass, broken touchpad, bad battery, missing HDD/RAM, faulty WiFi. Looking to pay $70-$200 shipped depending on condition. I know this is quite niche, but if someone has one I #8217;d be willing to consider any offers. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, I was wondering if it was possible to find a stock ROM for BOBBA360. Not looking for RW_LEGACY or UEFI firmware, just for the original shellball. I know this can be extracted from a recovery image but I don #8217;t have an extra Chromebook laying around. Thanks!</TEXT>

I won #8217;t be able to get the shellball from the managed device, and I don #8217;t have an extra chromebook to grab it from. Sorry if this seems confusing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey there, I am a current HS senior and I signed up to take the October SAT in order to have a strong(er) showing in that department. However, now with the UC injunction, I am not sure whether I should put in the effort to go and take it or if I should spend the time on app writing/grades/ECs etc. I was planning on applying to mostly UCs. I have already taken the test and got an okay-ish score (1400s) but was looking to retake to make up some ground for a mediocre GPA. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never said the 1619 Project was better? I just think that it is important to show both sides of the story. There's been a lot of decisions historically that have impacted minorities, African Americans, etc. and that should be mentioned in a learning environment. School should be an unbiased place for learning, not a circlejerk of patriotism and "AMERICA IS GREAT, NOTHING IS WRONG, TRUMP 2020 WOO!" Edit - There are STILL places in America that say that the Civil War was fought over states' rights and land (Even PRAGERU has a video debunking this). Our history is biased whether people are going to admit it or not. This circlejerk isn't going to change that .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hitler Youth were taught a biased history that showed the greatness of the Nazis. Likewise, this sort of patriotic circlejerk is a biased history based off of nationalism that heavily skews towards the "greatness of America." What about the millions of Native Americans and Africans who got fucked over historically? "the lies and Jew hate is found within leftwing ideologies" any evidence to that? Also, I'm not comparing the Trump presidency to Nazi Germany. I am comparing this executive order to a method that was used to promote violent nationalism in Nazi Germany. Which it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unrelated, but I went through a similar phase a little over a year ago. I had a real problem with gaming that had affected my life for half a decade, and finally decided to cut the cord. Sold my setup and used my MacBook. Props to you for taking the bold step, and good luck with your journey! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm surprised at how well the answer sync feature worked. There were delays at times but they were relatively few and far between. Overall a lot smoother than I had initially expected!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[USA-CA] [H] PayPal [W] iPhone 6S Plus 64GB/128GB</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hey there, I'm looking for an iPhone 6S Plus in the 64GB or 128GB configuration. I had a component fail on my motherboard and it's something that I do not have the tools to fix. Repair shop quotes are $150 for a Backlight IC repair, which is outright ridiculous since it's literally more than what the phone is worth. I'm currently using a iPhone 7 and while it is good, the battery is too physically small for my use case. I do not mind battery health percentage or screen problems, I have all the tools to replace such parts. Just looking for something in the $80-$110 range.</TEXT>
