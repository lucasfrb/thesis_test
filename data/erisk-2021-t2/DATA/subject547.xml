    <TITLE>Random girl jumped in my car.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-23 01:21:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Really don't know how much context this needs but i'll try to keep this short and sharp. I was living in London at the time and had just driven home after work and pulled up outside my flat on a terraced house street. To my surprise the front passenger door opens and this blonde girl jumps in. BG: "Hi" Me: "Ahh, This is not an Uber." BG: \*Looks towards me and then the colour drains from her face. "Ohh $h!t!" Promptly jumps out and ducks back into her flat without looking back. (2 doors down from mine) I parked the car, went inside kacking myself, and it dawned on me; Ya don't get in the front seat of an uber! So i looked out the window and sure enough: 5 minutes later another black hatchback pulls up.... sits there a while.... BG gets in the front seat.... the car sits there a while.... BG gets out.... black hatchback drives off.... 2 doors down, party ensues. Either she got in the wrong car again or.... ....most probably the latter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This happened about 2-3 weeks ago but only got to me this morning because of an increase in new virus cases over the last week or so in our state of Australia. Notice to those people that still haven't got it: So I had just arrived for work and had gone to the urinal before starting. There you were, in your 50's, already mid-stream. 30-sec pass, I hear your fly zip up and walk away. WTF do you think should be the next sounds I hear? Soap dispenser? Rushing water? Paper rustling from its holder? Hand dryer whirring to life? WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!! It was you... opening the F\*\*\*ken DOOR!! Man, I swear if the place that I worked for was not so climatic about the reviews we get online, I would have marched up to your table, castigated you in front of your wife, daughter and the other (oddly lovely) couple that you were sitting with and accused you of being solely responsible for the spread of Rona and Herpes! Instead I pointed you out to all of my colleagues as we all jeered and avoided you. Let this be a warning to all customers: We know if you are coming into our venue just by the way you walk. We know what you want to drink before you even ask. We know if you are going to complain by the blank look on your face. We know if you are the type of person that might even try to FAKE washing your hands (Really, It happens) and despite your best efforts... everyone... I repeat EVERYONE... knows you are a grubby little shit! So don't take it out on any venue that calls you out on YOUR bad behaviour... (the next server might not give a shit about their job!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NSFW tagged because R18 rather than graphic TLDR at the bottom So, over the years working with booze, nothing really surprises when it comes to human behaviour and alcohol. I've been shocked several times but then I remember, drunk people do drunk things. Of the many stories that I have, there are few that personally affected me. This one damn near ruined my life! I worked an indoor/outdoor cocktail bar and nightclub. 5 rows deep in the summer and a Monday in winter you'd barely take $100. I always worked Monday's with Jon. We were the only ones that could stand each other #8217;s presence when the music was not thumping. On alternating weeks one, of us would go from top to toe of the venue doing a deep clean and the other would have picked up some cheap meat and veg and learnt to perfect the roast with the help of the chefs from the fine dining restaurants nearby. This day, the 2 of us got unseasonable busy so; no roast for us today. \*poop Sam, our general manager, was in on his day off with 20 of his mates, celebrating a friend #8217;s first show as a drag queen. The lot of them in full fanfare and feathers. It was an amazing and intimidating sight as there were all HUGE and loud. As a couple of them got a little bit boozey, I got a little bit uncomfortable with the direct and overt flirting. But that was okay, because on the other side of the bar there was also a group of 20 people from a neighbouring fine dining restaurant on a staff piss-up. Some of whom I knew. One of the girls I had never met before and instantly had a huge crush on! (Can #8217;t remember her name because it was like a decade ago. But think, the girl with the short dark hair from the music video Butterfly by Crazy Town #8230;. \*cringe) Between periods of busyness, I would stop, chat and we would flirt with each other. At some point she asked what was  #8220;going on over the other side #8221; referring to the sashay of the drag queens. I brought her around and introduced her to my manager and a few other and we all did shots together. The night grew thin and so did her attention as she got more drunk. I now could see that this Incubus colleague of hers was taking advantage of the situation. This was a battle that I was going to lose. We still had at least 2-3 hours of deep clean after everyone left! The staff party left with the object of my desire. Sam was giving me shit because someone else had stolen her from me. He and the flock hung around another hour before we had to shut the doors to the public because they got out of control! It was  #8220;Young hearts, run free #8221; full blast, standing on every table. Jon and I left them there when we went home at 6am, to later find out, Sam never left! This was a blessing in disguise. I walked in at 5pm the next day to start my shift. There I was greeted by Bryor with a  #8220;What the hell happened last night? #8221; thinking that she was having a go at me about the state of the bar when she arrived; maybe because it looked like we never cleaned it. I told her we were busier than usual and we had left Sam  amp; Co. there lip-syncing the night away; but assure her that we cleaned it.  #8220;No, why was there an angry guy calling up, claiming that you drugged and tried to rape his fianc #233; and that he was going to call the cops?! #8221; She said with consternation in her voice.  #8220;What the Fuck?! #8221; I spurted, as my heart dropped.  #8220;No way that could have happened #8230;. Jon and I cleaned here and walked home together #8230; I was here all night #8230; ask Sam #8230; where #8217;s Sam?! #8221; We tried to call but Sam #8217;s phone when directly to voicemail. 5min later we found him asleep on the floor in a different office room. Bryor told him what had happened and I stood there, drained of all colour and swapping between panic and anger. Jon then appears and tells us all that there is a guy downstairs, flying into a rage at staff and is looking for  #8220; #8230;the bartenders that were working last night. #8221; Sam told me to stay put while he went down to chat with him. Now I can #8217;t remember verbatim what was said so here is the rundown: **Guy**: Lost his shit, said he called the cops, was going to kill me or cut off my knob because his fianc #233; did not come home last night. When she finally made it home, told him about how the bartender (me) had drugged her and tried to take her in a taxi back to my place. Now she was too scared to go to work. **Sam**: Mentioned that the story that she had fed him was a bunch of shit as he was here, with me, until 6am and she had left long before that and we had cameras to prove it. So threw the idea back at him, that if he had indeed called the cops, he would need to get his story straight or it would he and his fianc #233; that would end up in jail. The guy disappeared and I was left despoiled of emotion and sanity for the rest of my shift. Later that week, I had a visit from a friend, Anna, who worked with, and was friends with, the girl and her soon to be husband. Anna told me that she did not show up for work that evening, after the party. That when her fianc #233; came in to get answers about what happened the night before. Found out about how she went home with the Incubus that  #8220;stole #8221; her away from me. Punched him in the middle of a packed restaurant. She was then subsequently fired #8230; and they split up. The lesson that I learnt from this is not what you think. From this point on I never paid for drinks if it was a girl I liked. They get too drunk and it sets a precedent where they think this is how it works. You never know if someone is just using you for free booze. I #8217;m just glad there were cameras and someone there to back me up!!! **TLDR:** **Cute girl claimed I drugged her to avoid fianc #233; finding out that she slept with her colleague.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Understanding is the key to tolerance. I rage at most things and im the 1st to say the worst road users are other cyclists. But before you start spewing your anti-bike rhetoric about how cyclist choose to use (or not) the road, put those shoes on your feet. Everyone believes they're in the right but you dont get to choose when they die because you want to teach them a lesson. Learning why people ride the way they do, instead of thinking they are out to personally piss you off, will save you mountains of stress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know what it is, but once people get to a certain age, they start saying; "I #8217;ll have a cappuccino; but make it hot." For those that have worked in hospo for a few years will say "*Sure thing*." turn around and roll their eyes. Now a cappuccino it quite heavily foam, which will hold heat down, but will not be hot itself. This means that the small amount of liquid that is there, will cool down quickly because of the cups conductivity. So generally, we make and run this drink last with no delay once it hits the saucer. \--- One fine and sunny afternoon, I had a table of 4 Gerry's (Geriatrics) whom had request 4 of the aforementioned cappuccinos. We have a machine that only had one group so can only make 2 coffees at a time. So to make sure they were hot, you'd do this.... \- Make 2, send hot - Waitress comes back - Make 2 more, send those hot. Otherwise, by the time that you have finished plating the second 2, the first would be cooling already. GOT IT? So what happens? The first 2 that were sent out, sat there, in front of the customers, until the next 2 arrived. (note: this is general table etiquette) We could have said to them, "Drink now while it's hot the other 2 will be here in a minute!" but who are we to tell people how to consume? 2 or 3 minutes pass and then I see the waitress walking towards me with a full tray, a crushed expression and fried hair. On woman had just given her a spray about how she ignored their request, that she was useless, and asked her if she was an imbecile. She was welling up. I like this girl. She would not hurt a fly, everyone loves her, always smiling.... and they took that away.... So went in to speak with her. Tried to explain my predicament with the resources we have. I could only do so much without something cooling down. Did she care? NOOOOOOO, of course not! "Do it again properly, or we are not paying" or something to that effect.... (the others were noticeably quiet and almost embarrassed) Screw Karen.... she wants it hot???? Some staff will hold the heating wand under the milk for a longer period (not a good idea because you burn the milk.) Some will put hot water in the coffee (not a good idea as it waters the coffee down.) I took one of the cups to the kitchen and asked the chef to put the cups under the salamander while I made the coffee and milk. (He resisted at first until I told him why) Then took those to the pass. I let the cup cool a bit so it would not crack from the temperature difference. Gave the waitress a tray and a commis cloth Told her not to touch the cup, but THAT one is for Karen. Told her to warn the cuntstomers that their drinks are hot; as requested. As suspected, the cantankerous old biddy picked up the cup and immediately dropped it spilling all over the table. She, quite rightly, lost her shit. As the "manager" I had to come in and conflict resolve. I can #8217;t remember verbatim what was said because I was in panic mode. "*That cup is scorching*!!" she exclaimed. "*What? This one?*" I said, pointing at the mess on the table. "*You asked for them to be remade hot and I did these myself?"* "*YES, BUT NOT THAT HOT!*" she replied. I picked up the cup from the table, which was now by now the same temperature as the others. I remarked "*It is no different to these other ones*." trying to make her look insane. "*Yes but now it has cooled down!"* she said as her eyes widened.................. (long pause) "*Oh, so now you understand*." Then I **sarcastically dropped a mic and walked out**. I had to check the cameras to see what happen. I wish I had a recording of it that I could make into a .gif for [r/BetterEveryLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop) **TLDR**: Lady complained coffee was not hot, nearly made the waitress cry, so I nuked the cup and she drop that shit everywhere! (**sarcastically dropped a mic and walked out)** did not happen, I wish it did, this is how I choose to remember it... sue me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Down the rabbit hole to OC...](https://www.cbsdance.com/post/lions-and-tigers-and-bears-oh-my) # Lions and tigers and bears...oh my! Today is the first day of our course...or at least it should have been. Course number 9. Welcoming a new, energised, nervous, excited and ready-to-go group of performers. Alas, it is not to be and in spite of the disappointment and heartbreak this year, we have against all odds come together even more. From chatting to friends and scrolling through a boundless amount of social media over the last few months, I have sensed an abundance of clarity, heart, passion and determination surfacing more than ever. I'd say that's pretty special and a sign that those rainbows really have made us stop and 'check in'. It has been a turbulent year for all of us, with our own physical and mental hurdles to overcome. Some days the white flag has been propped up, yet when a glimmer of motivation shimmers through, that glimmer has kept us battling on. We like to think it's the latter where we have truly shown resilience, strength and the determination to not take 'no' for an answer which I do believe is true, but the others have in some way perhaps been more significant. Allowing us to ponder on our thoughts, reflect and work through challenges in a way we often wouldn't allow ourselves time for. It's these times that can and maybe have been the scariest, most revealing and hardest to face, but in the long run will help create that clarity and direction we need. ### We are all sailing on the same sea, yet on our own little boats going at very different speeds. As we move forward, there is an evident imbalance in people's situations. Some are back at work, many are not and we have to be incredibly appreciative, mindful and understanding of this. The next few months will continue to be unpredictable and the only way we can get through this is by standing side by side and helping each other out. ### Have the courage to push forward, but the heart to look behind. At this time, it is important to focus on you. Do what you need to do, but also reach out to check in with those who may be feeling left behind. With different responsibilities, commitments and living situations, non of us can compare (yes, we all know we still do) and need to keep reminding ourselves of this. ### Where we're at now is not a testament of our talent, it's what we've done to survive. If you've been motivated for months and starting to feel that momentum flatten out, that's to be expected. Give yourself a break. If you're only now gaining momentum, don't feel guilty about that couch time. It was needed (and seriously, next time you get that might be when you retire). If you've stayed motivated and still going strong....you deserve a holiday. If you've had to temporarily step away from your craft and the industry, then that's been 100% the right decision for you. Come back when you're ready. You never know there might be a stronger fire in your belly and a drive like you've never known after shifting focus for a while. Yes it's been pretty rubbish for most of us. Heartbreaking for many and a real challenge. But I think we can all agree there's a bucketful of goodness that has come from this that we need to carry with us and trust it will help us find a new and improved 'normal'. ### Let's not forget, we wouldn't have the Hollywood we know and love today if it wasn't for the last pandemic. The cameras stopped rolling. There were no new 'movies'. Studios were shut down and headlines read 'The beginning of the end' for Hollywood. Yes, thanks to the 1918 Spanish Flu, Hollywood was hit hard. However, this resulted in the consolidation of multiple smaller film companies, making the big companies, BIG and giving us the Hollywood we know today. If it wasn't for this, I'm not sure some of those magical movie moments we all know and love would even exist. And, I don't think life would be quite the same without 'There's no place like home' and other one liners that make us all warm and fuzzy inside. So, if we're going to learn anything from the past, it's that we will get through it, we *are* getting through it and we're doing it together, because together, 'we got this'. Let's look forward to when the industry is thriving once more and we can indulge in that moment in the theatre when you get all goosebumpy and emotional. Jeez, it's gonna be something else. No, we're not in Kansas any more, but at the end of this long road we might just end up somewhere kind of magical.</TEXT>
