    <TITLE>How do i get rid of gnats?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 11:13:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi! I need some help. There are little flies around my houseplants and in their soil, i know that they're called fungus gnats and that moist soli attracts them but i don't know how to get rid of them. They're a great annoyance and because of it my housemates won't allow me to bring my plants (in containers) back to their original place and instead they sit on the balcony. Here where i live it's slowly getting colder so i better think of something before it's too late. If you know how to help it'd be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!</TEXT>
