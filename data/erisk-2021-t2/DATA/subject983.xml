    <TEXT>Same here. The only reason I really "upgraded" to the 4XL was because I did a duff job of cleaning the charge port out and must have shorted something, as the phone shutdown and the charge port smoked as I plugged it in! I'd easily recommend a used 2XL to anyone after a cheap phone today still. The battery life I was getting was still all day and then some. I really miss swiping the fingerprint reader for notifications. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes and no. If you buy the premium stuff (the free buildings, cars, etc) while playing on Epic you will keep them when you load up on Steam. But if you try and redeem the freebies on Steam you'll need to pay cash.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I play with friends from Steam on Epic version? Do I get the Premium content from Epic on Steam? Do you need to re-download the whole game? I did some digging to hopefully help people asking the questions out!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 19:58:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>*I'm not sure why my original post was deleted as I posted it.. Trying again!* So like many people, I've had GTAV since release on Steam. I've also redeemed the freebie on the Epic Store this week. Seems like there's a lot of unknowns as to if they play nicely together or if the content transfers, so I've done some digging and testing to hopefully answer these questions! Note: I've tried all of this over a few days, so I have no idea if this works past tomorrow, or what any long term effects, if any, are. If anyone has more info on any of these topics, or more to add, I'll edit the post. :) # 100GB is a lot to download again. Can I just use the steam files to play on Epic? Yes! 1. Start downloading the game on Epic. Let it go for a minute or so just so Epic can create the directories, then pause the download. 2. Close the Epic Store, check it's not running in the system tray. 3. Copy all the files from ...\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V 4. To ...\\Epic Games\\GTAV 5. Re-open Epic and resume the download. Epic will see there are more files now, and verify them. 6. Epic will probably need to download some missing files as part of the verification, some people have said only 300mb, but mine was 1.13GB - Either way, let it download. 7. Run the game! NB: Mine crashed first time. The game then re-verified in Epic but then worked fine after this.  #8203; # Can I play with friends on the other store? (Steam to Epic, or Epic to Steam) Yes. The friend system is done via the Rockstar Social Club, not Steam or Epic servers. I personally played on Steam with a party of friends on Epic, and had no issues outside of the current Rockstar Server issues.  #8203; # Does my Steam save game work on the Epic Store version of the game? Yes if you use social club cloud saves. I've flicked between the two in testing and I start where I leave off, both in single player and online. At a guess, as long as you leave the game to upload the save file safely you shouldn't have any issues.  #8203; # I have the Steam version. Can I just log into the Epic version of the game and get all the free stuff and go back to steam? Sort of.. When you launch through Epic for the first time you'll be asked to link the copy of the game to your Rockstar account. The premium version must register as a different "game" on Rockstar's end (probably just an ID in a database somewhere...) but at it's heart it's still just GTAV. For single player people, you'll see no different. You'll start wherever your save game from Steam was. For GTA Online players, you will be able to redeem all the Starter Pack content for free when played through Epic **only**. Your bunker, cars, weapons, etc. All free on the relevant websites in the game! If you try and buy them when you play through Steam, you'll have to pony up your hard earned money. *HOWEVER*, if you buy all your freebies while playing via the Epic version first, when you next login to GTA Online through Steam, you will still have your purchases! I bought a couple of cars and the bunker, and they were there as I would expect when I switched over to Steam. Tl;dr, Login and redeem all your free stuff via Epic before going back to your Steam version.  #8203; # Can I just add the Epic version of the game to Steam as a non-steam game? I don't think so! (Please let me know if you can, and I will update) - When adding the GTAV executable from the Epic folder to Steam, it errors saying to launch the game via the Rockstar Launcher. :(  #8203; # Do mods work on the Epic version? Unfortunately I'm a boring vanilla guy with GTAV! I've not modded a GTA since GTA4 had a taxi glitch.  #8203; Hope this helps someone!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s a very good question, and I honestly don #8217;t know. My guess would be no, as I think achievements work on triggers. Maybe if you do something again in Steam it may trigger. But again that #8217;s just a guess.</TEXT>

Kyle actually said on a recent Bitwit video ([the one where he's waiting for the utilities to come back on](https://youtu.be/Zn_TVqeugOc?t=755), around 12:58) that he was probably going to disassemble the PC once it's done as it was 'just a build'. For me it's more about the creativity with the parts, like watching an artist use the same materials to do countless pieces.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on what you are trying to do the iPad *does* do multi-screen output. And by that, I mean watching stuff and only watching stuff. Twitch puts the chat on the iPad but the video (in 16:9 too, maybe whatever the native res of the screen is?) out to the external screen. Apple TV also does this. But you can't then use the iPad for something else, only control media. To me, this means the iPad is fully capable of it, just Apple lock it down. Likely so you are forced to mac for proper multitasking support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you just use your normal email when you sign up to a website or service and they get hacked, breached or they sell your details off to another party, when you start receiving spam (or worse a service is signed up for in your name/email!) it should be super easy to tell who was the culprit. For example, you sign up to Reddit with myemailaddress+reddit@gmail... You'll see when the spam comes in its addressed to myemailaddress+reddit@...</TEXT>
