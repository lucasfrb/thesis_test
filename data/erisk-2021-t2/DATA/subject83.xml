    <TEXT>I completely agree with your point about how it has to be equal from both ends. Personally speaking, I have always messaged first on tinder or any other dating platform if I match with a person. Even offline, it #8217;s its someone am interested in. I have put in the effort to keep the conversation flowing. But guess what? Just because 90% of the woman out there play hard to get as default and make courting a compulsion. Men immediately assume that I am up for casual sex and I would be a easy lay for a ONS just because I am being sweet. This has happened countless number of times to me that I have completely given up now. Though I still would insist on splitting the bill, I don #8217;t ask a guy out anymore. Not on the first time atleast. So maybe not all girls are like that. Some of us are forced to fit into that mould to preserve our sanity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do believe I don #8217;t deserve this. I guess the fact that it #8217;s my first relationship in life and that I am a very codependent person makes this really hard. I don #8217;t know how people move on or believe in love again after something like this in their life. Thank you for your honest thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I said am a codependent person, I believe that am more attached to him than normal people in relationships. We are independent monitory wise. Otherwise I have spent the past five years obsessed with him. I don #8217;t sleep in the night if I can #8217;t cuddle him. He is into rock climbing. Whenever he goes on a climbing trip, I literally count days and wait for his return. Even if I meet my friends, I take him along cuz I prefer to always be with him. It #8217;s like the honeymoon phase never ended for me in the relationship. We have a really active sex life, like twice a day on a normal day in the past five years and mostly am the giver even there but I have loved that nonetheless. I know I have been the major giver in this relationship but it never really affected the way I felt for him. So essentially, I shaped my whole life to revolve around him. Now if I remove him from the picture, I don #8217;t know what I #8217;ll be left with to find happiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I completely agree with you. I always knew he could make mistake by having an impulsive ONS someday and I was mentally prepared for that. But having an affair for few months is a conscious choice and I also don #8217;t think it can be explained with ADHD. Thank you for your thoughts. I will reflect upon it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have a point there. I used to have that bond with my mother. Am the last born in my family. Pampered by everyone. I was very close to my mother as a kid. Couldn #8217;t sleep without cuddling her. Etc. Then when her sisters had kids, she started obsessing over the kids younger than me. I remember being very upset over that. Post that only, I started seeking out relationships in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No you aren #8217;t bullshitting. Everything you said is spot on. My mother is a narcissist. I realised that after a couple of courses on psychology. I took her to counselling once but she didn #8217;t follow through. I think I became a people pleaser or a giver because of her. To seek validation from her always and have her like me. She wanted a son. Prayed for one when she was pregnant with me apparently. Though I had few cousin younger sisters, she still obsessed over me. But when a cousin brother was born ten years after me, then she stopped giving me attention as she was obsessed with him. Would choose him over me at silly simple things. All of that used to get to me. I don #8217;t think I have ever established to be a fully independent adult in my life. That #8217;s my personal drawback. I was just clinging on to family #8217;s approval and love until I met him and then everything has been about him ever since then. I come from a place where arranged marriage is the norm. My family was extremely disappointed with me when I told them I want to marry my boyfriend. My father was supportive though but my mother wasn #8217;t. She gave her approval after two years. Another biggest fear I have is telling them to cancel the wedding plans. I might probably be emotionally disowned by my family as well and hear  #8220;Told you so #8221; for choosing love over arranged marriage system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not really sure how to become an independent person though. I guess the first step to that would be to live alone for a while until the depression goes away and see what happens post that. That #8217;s the only way I can think of getting there. I think most of my fears would be of disappointing them. I have a lot of strong morals and I have never hurt people as such. So am more afraid of hurting them than the approval part. Though it #8217;s the inevitability in this situation and knowing I was not the cause for the relationship ending should help in the guilt I #8217;ll feel, I suppose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not really sure about the answer to this question about difference between dependency or not. I think being able to live alone and find happiness with things to do on their own too would be a big trait of being independent. I don #8217;t think it #8217;s possible to live life without hurting anyone. Hurting someone isn #8217;t always a bad thing either. I did hurt my parents badly when I didn #8217;t let them choose a partner for me and choose someone on my own. My mother even told me that she thought her daughter would rather kill herself than disappoint her parents that way. I know it was her hurt talking. But that was inevitable. That was one decision in my life I didn #8217;t want to compromise on. So I chose to hurt them. I don #8217;t regret that. But the shame they would face in front of all the close relatives when they have to cancel the wedding would be on me. That is something I would have to learn to live with.</TEXT>

I think she figured that he is getting bored of me and he needs to be alone for a while to realise either he is going to value the good things we share or walk away. B. I strongly believe in this too. Just calling it unforgivable isn #8217;t helping in anyway. C. True. I don #8217;t think I can ever be polygamous. D. Yes, I will work on the courage to do that. E.

    <TEXT>I agree. It does boil down to the fact that I have never made any life decisions so far. I wanted to be a psychologist but my father wanted me to be a biologist and I choose science over psychology. Be it work too, I have chosen fields that my dad picked out again. Even in the relationship, I have let him decide and make all the plans. Other than picking clothes, I don #8217;t think I have ever decided anything for myself till date. I did feel responsible for the hurt my parents felt when I rejected arranged marriage. In their eyes, I wasn #8217;t an ideal daughter. They reacted like I let them down. Though I couldn #8217;t comprise on this to make them happy, it did hurt me to let them feel that way. Leaving him would be the best decision for my sanity. I have never had a supportive family who could ever understand that though.</TEXT>

That can probably be my first independent decision in life for myself :) Thank you for your support. I cannot even express how helpful this conversation has been for me personally. Thank you for that too. I hope I get good at being independent soon as well. Will consciously strive for it from now onwards in life.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually he isn #8217;t begging or crying. Just claims that he knows he destroyed the only love he could have ever had in life plus the memory of me standing outside the door will haunt him forever. And that since he is capable of having an affair again in the future too due to rash decision making always. I should dump him. I am the one working on the courage to make that decision. Yeah. I can already relate to the rollercoaster. I am going through cycles of anger, disgust and full blown teary breakdown since it happened. I don #8217;t think I #8217;ll ever be able to trust men for a really long time. Even the thought of love nauseates me now. So dating shouldn #8217;t be a problem at all. Unfortunately None of the gyms are open here due to Covid. I thought I #8217;ll give meditation a try. Been getting drunk to numb the pain pass out every night and I should probably try meditation or workout before I turn into an alcoholic. Even am new to this app. Still figuring things out. Thank you for the hope and advice. It really helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. I have always made excuses for his bad behavior in this relationship. I #8217;ll ask him to leave. He was ready to leave yesterday itself. I didn #8217;t let him go. Cuz his mind works in a out of mind and out of sight manner. And a part of me wanted him to stay and see what his actions have done to me. Just to hurt him back with guilt. I know it #8217;s not healthy but I just couldn #8217;t let him go away and distract himself from his actions. You are spot on about the brain working over time for finding logic. I just can #8217;t seem to shut it out for the love of god. Hope time runs by faster for the healing to happen. Ah okay. I have never had a proper physical routine. I just run one hour a day. That #8217;s all. But that doesn #8217;t tire me out so much. I will watch something on YouTube and will try this out. Keep looking forward to that eventuality when this brutal feeling goes away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah. The realisation of the five years gone down the drain is terrible. I think in some ways, me wanting him to see my hurt could me more because of the fact that I think it would change him to be a better person and he won #8217;t cheat again than to hurt him back. I just fool myself that #8217;s it #8217;s later. Good to know you have completely healed from a situation like this. I hope I get there someday too. Haha, I used to have the same fear too. Turning muscular, but I guess at this point, I don #8217;t care. Anything to stop the thoughts trail in my head. Will try it out for sure. Yes, he is moving out this weekend.

No question there. Just that there has been a lot of evidence for love as well. He has planned all our vacations upto my liking till date. Treated me with utmost respect and love amongst friends and family. Surprise parties for my birthday. So much more. I honestly haven #8217;t decided anything yet. I have seen quite a few really happy married poly couples as well. Good friends with some. Though If I cannot accept the polygamous lifestyle, I #8217;ll have no choice to leave him.

    <TEXT>I guess it ultimately depends on how each person perceives the no contact break to be. I personally don #8217;t believe in postponing conflict resolution in a relationship and in turn no contact makes no sense to me. When I had that phase in my relationship, my partner wanted it for three to five months. I offered only two weeks. Anything beyond that was too much for me personally. If he had pushed it, I would have probably properly grieved the loss of the relationship during that phase and wouldn #8217;t have never been able to feel the same way for him again even if I love him. I don #8217;t know if you guys discussed the duration of the break before it started, I would suggest you do have a clear timeline with both your consent, if you intend to make this relationship work.</TEXT>
