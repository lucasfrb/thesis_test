    <TEXT>Here is a [pro-TPP argument by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/), who have extensively studied US labor markets adjustments to trade competition shocks caused by China (their [paper](http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf) was even cited by the anti-TPP folks in a recent AMA). I wrote this in another thread regarding labor/environmental protections: Regarding labor standards: According to Human Rights Watch, the TPP side agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei ["are a unique and significant step in efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements"](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/qa-trans-pacific-partnership#4). According to PIIE, ["the TPP includes more protections of labor rights than any previous US free trade agreement"](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/labor-standards-tpp). Regarding environmental standards: According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the ["TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history"](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment). The Peterson Institute for International Economics argues that the TPP is ["the most environmentally-friendly trade deal ever negotiated."](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/tpp-and-environment). Environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Humane Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Defenders of Wildlife, International Fund for Wildlife Welfare, and World Animal Protection have expressed support for TPP.

    <TEXT>TPP is good geopolitics and has economic benefits beyond the specific contents of the agreement. The [US-centric language of the TPP](http://rap.sagepub.com/content/3/3/2053168016658919) will, for instance, influence future trade cooperation, the agreement will strengthen bargaining power with China (both on economic and political issues), lessen the likelihood of China successfully setting up alternative institutions and lessen the likelihood of China dominating its smaller neighbors. Looking beyond strict US self interest, the agreement boosts the GDP of countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia by ca 10% by 2030 (improving the quality of life for the 120-something million who live there), and strengthens protections (people can disagree whether these protections are sufficient but they clearly seem to be a net improvement) regarding human rights, the environment, good governance and labor. edit: I missed the claim about "a wash to negative long term": of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have AFAIK net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from the Tufts economists. I won't pretend to understand these studies but the first three seem to come from fairly authoratative sources and consistent with mainstream economics (judging by Robert Lawrence's and Dani Rodrik's thoughts on the studies). Regarding the Tufts analysis, Dani Rodrik (who you could fairly call a free trade skeptic), says that it does ["a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective".](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tpp-debate-economic-benefits-by-dani-rodrik-2016-02) I definitely don't know the science behind it all but I would definitely lean towards what I perceive as the mainstream economics view.</TEXT>

Clinton stated that her vote for the legislation was contingent on the inclusion of provisions intended to protect women, including allowing women to collect child support payments after the father has declared bankruptcy.[20] Credit card companies and banks supported the overhaul, as did women's groups, while consumer groups opposed the legislation. When explaining her vote, Clinton stated, "I will not vote for final passage of this bill if it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing... I am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and it is making progress towards reform." The bill did not come up for a final vote that legislative session. When similar legislation came up again in 2005 but without the amendments added by Democrats in 2001, Clinton opposed the legislation."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to you, her position switched due to money. That's totally unsupported. Given Clinton's insistence in 2001 that she would only support the bill (note that she only voted to advance the bill, did not vote on the final version of it) due to the potential pro-women aspects of the bill , WaPo confirming that women's rights groups supported the bill, and her failure to support the bill in 2005 when those provisions were not included, I think a far simpler reason for her having voted "to advance" the bill in 2001 was a genuine belief that it boosted protections for women (an issue that Clinton has consistently and staunchly pushed for).</TEXT>

In 2012, Stein asserted, "three times more jobs are created per dollar invested in conservation and renewables. Nuclear is currently the most expensive per unit of energy created." * **Foreign policy** - She is sympathetic to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea. She is anti-NATO. She wants to give China carte blanche in the South China Sea. [Her official statement on Brexit praised the outcome of the referendum as a "victory". Two days later, she changed her official statement (without indicating any changes), saying that she supported the UK staying in the EU (the original statement had nothing that could be interpreted as support for the EU or the UK staying in the EU).](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/green-party-jill-stein-busted-cover-up-praise-bigotry-driven-brexit/) * **Snowden** - She wants Snowden as a Cabinet member. * **Human rights** - [Stein likened her arrest for trying to break into the hall of a presidential debate to the persecution suffered by Russian dissident Sergei Udaltsov (he organized protests on a public square against Putin's regime; is still in jail for it)](https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/258990979133091841) * **Vaccine denial and funding of homeopathy** - She refuses to clarify her views on vaccines and whether the US government should fund homeopathy research/treatments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A case for TPP: **Economics:** * Of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have AFAIK net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from two Tufts economists (IIRC, they find net negative effects for ALL signatories, which sounds weird). I won't pretend to understand these studies but the first three seem to come from fairly authoritative sources and consistent with mainstream economics (judging by Harvard economists Robert Lawrence's and Dani Rodrik's thoughts on the studies). Regarding the Tufts analysis, Dani Rodrik (who you could fairly call a free trade skeptic), says that the Tufts economists do ["a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective".](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tpp-debate-economic-benefits-by-dani-rodrik-2016-02) I definitely don't know the science behind this kind of research but I would definitely lean towards what I perceive as the mainstream economics view. * Labor: Here is a [pro-TPP argument by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/), who have extensively studied US labor markets adjustments to trade competition shocks caused by China (their [paper](http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf) was even cited by the anti-TPP folks in a recent AMA). * The losers of the TPP should be compensated. However, even if they weren't, TPP would still be good, as it makes Americans on the whole better off. The ideal outcome would be that anti-TPP congressmen push for greater trade adjustment assistance (and other social programs) in exchange for their support of the TPP. That would be fantastic. * As a non-American and looking beyond strict US self interest, the agreement boosts the GDP of several developing countries (the winners are clearly Vietnam and Malaysia who will boost their GDP by 10% by 2030 thanks to TPP, improving the quality of life for the 120-something million who live there), and strengthens protections (people can disagree whether these protections are sufficient but they clearly seem to be a net improvement) regarding human rights, the environment, good governance and labor. **Labor rights:** * According to Human Rights Watch, the TPP side agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei ["are a unique and significant step in efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements"](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/qa-trans-pacific-partnership#4). According to PIIE, ["the TPP includes more protections of labor rights than any previous US free trade agreement"](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/labor-standards-tpp). **Environmental standards:** * According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the ["TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history"](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment). The Peterson Institute for International Economics argues that the TPP is ["the most environmentally-friendly trade deal ever negotiated."](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/tpp-and-environment). Environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Humane Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Defenders of Wildlife, International Fund for Wildlife Welfare, and World Animal Protection have expressed support for TPP. The representative of one environmental group against TPP, the Sierra Club, made a fool of herself in an AMA on TPP the other week, providing no substantive answers to any questions. I won't pretend to know all these environmental groups but I'm hardly surprised that groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club are against TPP. I don't have a good impression of them and I'm 99% confident they'd be against it regardless of the contents. **Geopolitics and future trade cooperation:** * TPP is good geopolitics and has economic benefits beyond the specific contents of the agreement. The [US-centric language of the TPP](http://rap.sagepub.com/content/3/3/2053168016658919) will, for instance, influence future trade cooperation, the agreement will strengthen bargaining power with China (both on economic and political issues), lessen the likelihood of China successfully setting up alternative institutions and lessen the likelihood of China dominating its smaller neighbors. * Those concerned about the plight of American workers vulnerable to trade competition should want *the US* to write the rules of trade, *not the competition*. * I don't recall ever hearing anyone say that TPP is bad geopolitics for the US. **Intellectual property:** * Big pharma has complained about the IP protections being too lenient (leading some Big Pharma Senators like Orrin Hatch who otherwise support every free trade agreement to voice their skepticism of TPP). Economists who study drugs, IP and developing countries (such as [Walter Park](http://www.cato.org/events/tpp-pharmaceutical-protections-too-strong-too-weak-or-just-right) ) argue that the existing literature does not show that developing countries will have greater prices and less access to drugs in the wake of more strict IP protections. Research suggests that the pharmaceutical protections in TPP could enhance unaffiliated licensing in developing countries, lead to tech transfers that contribute to local learning-by-doing, stimulate new drug launches in more countries, expand marketing and distribution networks, and encourage early stage pharmaceutical innovations. Anyway, the TPP aligns with TRIPS, which allows developing countries to circumvent patent rights for better access to essential medicines. **ISDS** * ISDS is *good*. It allows entities to seek monetary damages (no, it does not overturn local laws) for treaty violations (no, "lost profits" is not a treaty violation) in a neutral tribunal (note that both parties decide the judges). One such treaty violation is discrimination of foreign firms. If your country does not set up rules that specifically try to put the kibosh on foreign firms, you will be fine. The White House and USITC also present TPP's ISDS provisions as a significant upgrade on the ISDS provisions in previous free trade agreements (there are ISDS provisions in more than 3000 trade agreements - note that we're all still alive): tobacco companies (guilty of numerous frivolous ISDS cases in other trade agreements) are totally excluded from TPP's ISDS provisions (one reason why the pro-tobacco Sen. Mitch McConnell who otherwise supports every free trade agreement dropped his backing of the TPP); lots of leeway for governments to enact health, safety and the environmental regulations; and opening up arbitration proceedings to the public. * The International Bar Association corrects a bunch of ISDS myths [here](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qi4m9bYqevMJ:www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx%3FDocumentUid%3Df30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e+ amp;cd=1 amp;hl=en amp;ct=clnk amp;gl=en). USTR also has a Q amp;A section that addresses many of the most annoying misconceptions that redditors have about ISDS. **Other good stuff:** * According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, signatories are required to join the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC); criminalize bribery of public officials; have in place a code of conduct for public officials; take measures to decrease conflicts of interest; effectively enforce anti-corruption laws and regulations; and involve private organizations in the fight against corruption. The USTR asserts that ["research also shows that trade improves human rights conditions by fostering pluralistic institutions and increasing open exchanges of information](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#standing-up-for-human-rights) edit: Added text on trade adjustment assistance, ISDS, added non-American perspective, typos.</TEXT>

Plenty of anti-vaxers agree that vaccines work in the abstract and concede that *some vaccines* work while they remain highly suspicious of most vaccines used today or imply that there is something suspect about them. Raising concerns about "dangerous substances" and scheduled vaccinations is pandering to anti-vaxers and promoting anti-vaxer rhetoric. It's like climate change deniers who equivocate on the extent of warming ("some warming according to some estimates") and humans' role ("some role according to some") while they raise concerns about the integrity of climate science and say that "questions and concerns have not been addressed".</TEXT>

Oh, you can't use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I'm okay with that because I'm talking territory instead of Muslim."

    <TEXT>Her [position on fracking seems pretty clear](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/13/bernie-s/does-hillary-clinton-support-fracking/): * In a March 2016 debate, Clinton outlined her position as follows: "I don #8217;t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don #8217;t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don #8217;t support it  #8212; No. 3  #8212; unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that's the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated." * According to PolitiFact, the implementation of Clinton's three conditions "would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix." PolitiFact notes that there are 11 states with noted cases of spills (which could be covered under her second condition) and two fracking states where there are no rules on chemical disclosure on the books (which would be covered under her third condition).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a person who has never (i) held any real public office; (ii) had to make hard compromises; (iii) proposed policies that she'd have to take the consequences of; and (iv) been scrutinized by the media, Jill Stein sure has [one of the most ridiculous compilations of ideas and plans among left-leaning US politicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Stein#Political_positions). If you ever asked yourself what a liberal version of Ben Carson looked like, here she is: * **Federal Reserve** - In Stein's 2012 platform, she wanted to "nationalize" the Federal Reserve and place it within the Treasury Department, ending its independence. * **Debt Ceiling** - In 2012, Stein opposed the raising of the debt ceiling, arguing that the U.S. should raise taxes on the wealthy and do spending cuts to offset the debt. * **Quantitative Easing/Student Debt** - Stein has spoken in favor of cancelling all student debt, arguing that it could be done "using quantitative easing" and without raising taxes.[120][121][122] She says that quantitative easing "is a magic trick that basically people don't need to understand any more about than that it is a magic trick."[121] * **Energy/Environment** - Stein proposes to make the United States transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030.[112] Stein supports a national ban on fracking.[112][124] She has spoken against nuclear energy, saying "nuclear energy is dirty, dangerous and expensive, and should be precluded on all of those counts." In 2012, Stein asserted, "three times more jobs are created per dollar invested in conservation and renewables. Nuclear is currently the most expensive per unit of energy created." * **Foreign policy** - She is sympathetic to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea. She is anti-NATO. She wants to give China carte blanche in the South China Sea. [Her official statement on Brexit praised the outcome of the referendum as a "victory". Two days later, she changed her official statement (without indicating any changes), saying that she supported the UK staying in the EU (the original statement had nothing that could be interpreted as support for the EU or the UK staying in the EU).](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/green-party-jill-stein-busted-cover-up-praise-bigotry-driven-brexit/) * **Snowden** - She wants Snowden as a Cabinet member. * **Human rights** - [Stein likened her arrest for trying to break into the hall of a presidential debate to the persecution suffered by Russian dissident Sergei Udaltsov (he organized protests on a public square against Putin's regime; is still in jail for it)](https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/258990979133091841) * **Vaccine denial and funding of homeopathy** - She refuses to clarify her views on vaccines and whether the US government should fund homeopathy research/treatments. At the moment, [her position is](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/29/jill-stein-on-vaccines-people-have-real-questions/):  gt; * Some vaccines are great  gt; * We can't know if all vaccines are good  gt; * Regulatory agencies can't be trusted due to corporate influence (WaPo notes that most members of the advisory committee on vaccines work at academic or medical institutions)  gt; * Questions surrounding toxic substances in vaccines have not been fully addressed. * **Wi-Fi** - Stein has voiced her opposition to wireless internet (Wi-Fi) in schools, saying, "We should not subjecting kid #8217;s brains especially to that... and we don #8217;t follow this issue in our country, but in Europe where they do, you know, they have good precautions about wireless. Maybe not good enough, you know. It #8217;s very hard to study this stuff. You know, we make guinea pigs out of whole populations and then we discover how many die." * **Distinguishing between political candidates** - Stein saw no difference between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in 2012. She sees no difference between Trump and Clinton in 2016. The latter is interesting given that [Stein is a 91% match with Hillary Clinton on a "yes"/"no" quiz on political stances](https://twitter.com/drjillstein/status/742450334556028928). * **VP choice** - [A conspiracy theorist who sees white supremacists everywhere (including Barack Obama and Ta-Nehisi Coates).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajamu_Baraka) #CherneyOrBust</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you set your threshold for "hawk" as low as supporting R2P style humanitarian interventions and making use of drone strikes, then yes, she's a hawk and a lot of us are. The term becomes meaningless if it just means "wiling to use force".  gt; Before calling Clinton prudent, it might serve the authors well to come up with a single instance where Clinton looked at a prospective intervention and said "hmm, maybe let's not go to war." I think these count: * Clinton helped negotiate the Iran deal. * Clinton favors withdrawing from Afghanistan and negotiating with the Taliban to that end. * She's unwilling to commit ground troops to Syria and Iraq. * I'm not aware of her advocating for sending troops into Ukraine or pushing for NATO membership. * She rejected an intervention into Darfur during the 2008 primaries. * As SoS, she heeded expert advice and refrained from responding in a knee-jerk fashion to Boko Haram and labeling it an FTO. * I'm not aware of her having had hostile rhetoric over the Russia-Georgia crisis; she played her part in the Russian reset a couple of months later. If anyone has more examples, please add them.  gt; Arming rebels against Assad was a massive failure. Some of the "moderate" rebels turned out to be Al Qaeda, and Assad's weakness was ISIS' gain (and thank God Obama was President in 2013, not HRC). Intervening in Libya with little followup was, similarly, a disaster. Syria is a great example of what happens when an American President sits on his thumbs and lets things just play out. The Libyan intervention was better than the counterfactual of leaving Gaddafi be. It would have been even better if Clinton would have been in charge and committed more resources to postintervention Libya.  gt; I'll add that there is a kind of easiness among the authors with the constant drone warfare being practiced by the United States. There is nothing smart about drone warfare. Our politicians are getting achieving political goals (low casualties, ability to assuage the public that we are "doing" something about terrorism), while constant civilian casualties alienate populations in Pakistan, and worsen the long-term problem of terrorism. Your hypotheses are both poorly substantiated. Drone strikes were seemingly effective in [crippling Al-Qaeda](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/30e9ub/new_secret_documents_reveal_al_qaedas_real/) and [reducing terrorism in Pakistan](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/3zll35/the_johnston_and_sarbahi_study_which_finds_that/). The [harm to civilians is hyped up](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/2ihftu/ethical_and_methodological_issues_in_assessing/), as is the [notion that drones radicalize](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/27zght/what_pakistanis_think_about_us_drone_strikes_and/). If you have the means to cripple terrorist groups and their campaigns, it seems a fool-thing to commit to never using those means.  gt; will face a target-rich environment. I don't buy your narrative that the whole world is about to go to hell. The issues you mention are minor and of declining importance. Russia is worse off than it was five years ago, the far right is not taking over Europe and China remains too tightly wound up in the world economy to start to war with the world. I don't buy the repeated claims that the US is in a massive decline either: * https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/4n1zwd/vox_piece_uses_brooks_and_wohlforth_to_challenge/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/4etxas/the_once_and_future_superpower_why_china_wont/  gt; And in HRC's case I will admit that I frankly doubt her domestic policy commitments (many of which were made at the insistence of Sanders delegates). Clinton has a solid liberal rating by any standard from her time in Congress or through an examination of her stated positions. Clinton, as rated by [Crowdpac](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/upshot/hillary-clinton-and-the-2016-democrats-mostly-liberal-together.html), is more liberal than Biden, Cuomo, and O'Malley. [OnTheIssues](http://www.ontheissues.org/Hillary_Clinton_VoteMatch.htm) rates Clinton as being a "Hard-Core Liberal." As analyzed by [Voteview](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), Clinton was more liberal than 70% of Democrats as Senator, even more liberal than Obama. As tabulated by [govtrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/hillary_clinton/300022), Clinton's voting pattern fell to the left of most Senate Democrats in 2010. Using [DW-NOMINATE](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate#), one can find that Clinton was the 11th most liberal senator in the 107th, 108th, 109th, and 110th congresses. (credit to /u/hcregna for putting this together) Also, a [New York Times analysis](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=1) found that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton voted in synch 93 percent of the time during their two overlapping Senate years. She is also infamous as a wonk and surrounds herself with legions of economists and public policy people. [Wonkblog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/02/how-hillary-clinton-thinks-about-policy-behind-the-scenes/) had a piece a few days ago, saying she was involved with so many economists that it was hard to figure out what her core team was: "One of the more interesting features of Hillary Clinton's circle of economic policy advisers is that many economists aren't sure whether they are, in fact, in it. This is both a function of how many policy experts Clinton has consulted in the course of this campaign, and of the fact that she consults some of them far more than others." That she moved further towards Sanders' policies on 3-4 issues and has more nuanced and evidenced-based positions on most issues than the Tea Party Left does not mean that she's insincere about her domestic agenda. **edit :** Throwing together some things that I'd associate with a hawk: * unilateralism (e.g. going against the UNSC, world opinion), * preemptive use of force (e.g. dismissing deterrence and containment), * an extreme belief in the utility of force, * a disdain for compromise and negotiations * promote democracy (or other preferences) in an aggressive and unpragmatic fashion I don't think Clinton's willingness to: * engage in humanitarian interventions to stop atrocities with the help of international coalitions and widespread international support, * use limited force (e.g. drones) to stop the activities of terrorist groups, * take a hard position against rogue states (e.g. imposing sanctions on Russia over Crime and E-Ukraine, impose sanctions on Iran to stop their nuclear program), * negotiate with your enemies (e.g. Iran, Cuba, the Taliban), * promote democracy in a slow and pragmatic fashion (e.g. leave autocrats alone unless they attack their citizens, work with autocrats when democracy is unachievable and destabilizing), counts as 'hawkishness'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**1/2**  gt; President Barack Obama has told Americans that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would grow American jobs as trade barriers are removed and exports to foreign countries increase. The same promises were made with past trade deals, but those deals wound up hurting America's middle class. Not true. IGM surveys and literature reviews show that trade deals, like NAFTA, had small but positive benefits for the average American: * http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0dfr9yjnDcLh17m * http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.15.1.125 * https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf  gt; The federal government has estimated that the United States will have a very small net gain of jobs from the TPP. And these official estimates have a track record of overestimating the positive effects of trade deals. [Citation needed]  gt; When the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement was completed in 2010, official predictions said our trade balance with Korea would improve, but instead we've imported more goods from Korea than ever before while American exports have remained stagnant. [Citation needed]  gt; One of the main reasons these projections are wrong is that, while the United States opens its markets to foreign competitors, other countries simply find new ways to advantage their local products over ours. Again, this is not written by an economist and does not point to any research. If only there was a component of TPP that stopped signatories from discriminating against foreign firms and goods... If only TPP addressed non-tariff barriers to trade in addition to tariff barriers...  gt; The TPP fails to address many of the ways that other nations unfairly disadvantage American workers... Additionally, the TPP fails to protect international labor rights. The TPP forces American companies to compete against countries that suppress workers' rights and fail to pay fair wages  #8212; which steals jobs from Americans. It has the most robust labor standards of any US FTA. [Economists that have looked closely at US labor adjustment to trade shocks favor joining TPP because it would reduce the vulnerability of US workers.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/) The research of these economists was even cited (incorrectly) by TPP opponents in a recent AMA. If anyone knows this shit, it's David Autor and co.  gt; It lacks any measures to combat currency manipulation, which occurs when a country uses the foreign-exchange markets to decrease the value of their currency. There are good reasons for this. [Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel: currency manipulation would be hard to enforce (in part because it is impossible to tell whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued); "currency manipulation" can often be legitimate; China, often alleged to be a major currency manipulator, is not party to the TPP; currency manipulation accusations are often meritless; and because it would restrict U.S. monetary policy (muh sovereignty).](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2015/06/the-top-ten-reasons-why-trade-agreements-should-not-cover-currency-manipulation)  gt; The TPP also undermines American laws through its expansion of the Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS, system. Under the TPP, foreign corporations  #8212; but not domestic companies, labor unions or individuals  #8212; have the right to attack American laws on important issues such as financial stability, health standards and the environment. Not only do these international courts bypass our legal system, they lack an appeals process and transparency. This is totally false. See below.  gt; I support fair trade and developing new trade agreements, but they must benefit America's middle class, raise wages and safeguard the consumer and environmental protections that we rely on. This is why I believe TPP is precisely such an agreement: **Economics:** * Of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have AFAIK net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from two Tufts economists (IIRC, they find net negative effects for ALL signatories, which sounds weird). I won't pretend to understand these studies but the first three seem to come from fairly authoritative sources and consistent with mainstream economics (judging by Harvard economists Robert Lawrence's and Dani Rodrik's thoughts on the studies). Regarding the Tufts analysis, Dani Rodrik (who you could fairly call a free trade skeptic), says that the Tufts economists do ["a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective".](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tpp-debate-economic-benefits-by-dani-rodrik-2016-02) I definitely don't know the science behind this kind of research but I would definitely lean towards what I perceive as the mainstream economics view. * Labor: Here is a [pro-TPP argument by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/), who have extensively studied US labor markets adjustments to trade competition shocks caused by China (their [paper](http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf) was even cited by the anti-TPP folks in a recent AMA). * The losers of the TPP should be compensated. However, even if they weren't, TPP would still be good, as it makes Americans on the whole better off. The ideal outcome would be that anti-TPP congressmen push for greater trade adjustment assistance (and other social programs) in exchange for their support of the TPP. That would be fantastic. * As a non-American and looking beyond strict US self interest, the agreement boosts the GDP of several developing countries (the winners are clearly Vietnam and Malaysia who will boost their GDP by 10% by 2030 thanks to TPP, improving the quality of life for the 120-something million who live there), and strengthens protections (people can disagree whether these protections are sufficient but they clearly seem to be a net improvement) regarding human rights, the environment, good governance and labor. **Labor rights:** * According to Human Rights Watch, the TPP side agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei ["are a unique and significant step in efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements"](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/qa-trans-pacific-partnership#4). According to PIIE, ["the TPP includes more protections of labor rights than any previous US free trade agreement"](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/labor-standards-tpp). **Environmental standards:** * According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the ["TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history"](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment). The Peterson Institute for International Economics argues that the TPP is ["the most environmentally-friendly trade deal ever negotiated."](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/tpp-and-environment). Environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Humane Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Defenders of Wildlife, International Fund for Wildlife Welfare, and World Animal Protection have expressed support for TPP. The representative of one environmental group against TPP, the Sierra Club, made a fool of herself in an AMA on TPP the other week, providing no substantive answers to any questions. I won't pretend to know all these environmental groups but I'm hardly surprised that groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club are against TPP. I don't have a good impression of them and I'm 99% confident they'd be against it regardless of the contents. **Geopolitics and future trade cooperation:** * TPP is good geopolitics and has economic benefits beyond the specific contents of the agreement. The [US-centric language of the TPP](http://rap.sagepub.com/content/3/3/2053168016658919) will, for instance, influence future trade cooperation, the agreement will strengthen bargaining power with China (both on economic and political issues), lessen the likelihood of China successfully setting up alternative institutions and lessen the likelihood of China dominating its smaller neighbors. * Those concerned about the plight of American workers vulnerable to trade competition should want *the US* to write the rules of trade, *not the competition*. * I don't recall ever hearing anyone say that TPP is bad geopolitics for the US. **Intellectual property:** * Big pharma has complained about the IP protections being too lenient (leading some Big Pharma Senators like Orrin Hatch who otherwise support every free trade agreement to voice their skepticism of TPP). Economists who study drugs, IP and developing countries (such as [Walter Park](http://www.cato.org/events/tpp-pharmaceutical-protections-too-strong-too-weak-or-just-right) ) argue that the existing literature does not show that developing countries will have greater prices and less access to drugs in the wake of more strict IP protections. Research suggests that the pharmaceutical protections in TPP could enhance unaffiliated licensing in developing countries, lead to tech transfers that contribute to local learning-by-doing, stimulate new drug launches in more countries, expand marketing and distribution networks, and encourage early stage pharmaceutical innovations. Anyway, the TPP aligns with TRIPS, which allows developing countries to circumvent patent rights for better access to essential medicines. **1/2**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Much of Stiglitz's rhetoric on the TPP is full of the weak arguments you yourself complain about. He's been at the forefront of fear-mongering about ISDS, and is responsible for the poor state of debate.  gt; The pro-TPP side, on the other hand, talks about economic growth and the deal taking influence away from China, neither of which are really true. Pro-TPP proponents cite the mainstream economics studies and typically do so correctly, citing the small net positive benefits on employment and wages for the US and the massive net positive benefits for the developing countries involved. When you say that the TPP allows "products that are almost entirely manufactured in China", you're talking about some products that only have to meet a 35-45% rules of origins threshold. You start out with a complaint about the state of debate on the TPP, yet you bring up Stiglitz as the guy to look to on this agreement and spread myths about rules of origins. For my part, I have never heard anyone say or show that the TPP is bad geopolitics for the US or will somehow boost China at the expense of the US.  gt; Stiglitz goes through most of these arguments and, like me, concludes that the deal is mostly a corporate handout. It makes sense -- the advisory boards around the deal were 85% (!) business insiders. That's six business lobbyists per environmental or labour representative... The results were really quite obvious all along. Could it not be that you need more industry group representatives to give technical advice on the thousands of goods and services that the US exports/imports while there isn't an environmental group that specializes on each and everyone of those goods and services?  gt; The best studies show no expected growth benefits, the rules are written to favor corporations, the deal has no meaningful impact on environmental and labor regulations, poorly designed origin laws undermines the whole goal of taking away China's trade influence, and ISDS absolutely has the potential to undermine democracy. This is all false and/or fearmongering, except point #2 which is not bad at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>FYI, surveys show that more people support the TPP than don't. Surveys also suggest that as more people have become familiar with TPP, they increasingly support it. Democrats also support TPP and free trade in general more than Republicans. You shouldn't assume that the Tea Party Left's loud and staunch opposition to TPP and free trade indicates public opposition to TPP and free trade. Most progressives and people on the left like free trade, because unlike the right in US politics, people on the left still look towards evidence and research (for now), and there is no doubt that free trade benefits Americans on the whole and the world on the whole. Here's a basic summary of why Obama might be in favor of TPP: **Economics:** * Of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have AFAIK net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from two Tufts economists (IIRC, they find net negative effects for ALL signatories, which sounds weird).

    <TEXT>There is a great book on this by Alesina and Spolaore: 'The Size of Nations' (this [article of theirs](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic107502.files/Alesina_and_Spolaore.On_the_Number_and_Size_of_Nations.pdf) appears to address the same topic as the book). In the book, the authors  #8220;argue that the sizes of national states (or countries) are due to trade-offs between the benefits of size and the costs of heterogeneity of preferences over public goods and policies provided by government #8220; (3). **The benefits of large population size:** * Per capita costs of public goods are lower due to more taxpayers (economies of scale) * Can levy more efficient taxes but which have large setup costs costs (income taxes). * Military power: Defence against foreign aggression * Larger economies: greater productivity and wealth. * Large states can offer regional  #8220;insurance #8221;: transferring wealth from boom regions to bust regions (small states can't and are therefore more vulnerable to temporary volatility) * Large states can build redistributive schemes. This means that poorer regions have incentives to form alliances with large states inclusive of rich regions. **The costs of large population size:** * Greater heterogeneity leaves more individuals and regions unsatisfied with the central government's policies. * Robert Dahl's "restricted size" argument: the more citizens you have, the smaller impact each citizen will have on a government. Large states are consequently less democratic **They argue, convincingly in my view, that several factors will contribute to the emergence of more small states:** * Democratization: Dictators prefer large states so that they can extract greater rents.

    <TEXT>Just to put his positions in context: A large part of the Democratic Party supports TPP (incl. Pres Obama + surveys show more Democrats support it than oppose it) and is against a complete ban on fracking (incl. HRC and Kaine). While Keystone seems more unpopular among Democrats, you can find [more than a dozen Democratic Senators](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/113/senate/2/280) who support it. So none of these positions are fringe among Democrats. Using this as a purity test would mean that mainstream Democrats and the likes of Pres Obama would be unacceptable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's hard to take the piece seriously when it takes such a ridiculously critical attitude towards ISDS. I mean, it starts out by claiming that the rise of ISDS cases in the last two decades is due to a nefarious group of international lawyers looking to defraud countries. Couldn't the increase in ISDS cases be because there are more FTAs with ISDS provisions, that more foreign firms invest abroad, that foreign firms choose to invest in high-risk countries specifically due to ISDS provisions and so on? I read the first example (can't read the rest at this time) and it fails to illustrate that Sajwani was a criminal, and that the threat of ISDS proceedings would help him avoid a fair sentence, as opposed to force the Egyptians to give him a fair trial. The only thing Buzzfeed presents as evidence that he was a criminal is a sentence by an Egyptian court assembled two months after the fall of the Mubarak regime. Buzzfeed notes that a later court overturned the verdict, so what's up? Buzzfeed even notes that Sajwani ended up settling with the Egyptians before the ISDS case started, paying the Egyptian government. The underlying dilemma revolves around the morality of doing business with corrupt regimes, which is a separate issue from ISDS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Feingold didn't hold back on Monday, calling agreements like NAFTA and the TPP "corporate handshakes" that send workers into a "dark spiral" of job insecurity and job loss. NAFTA was a net benefit to Americans: * http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0dfr9yjnDcLh17m * http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.15.1.125 * https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf There are good reasons to think TPP will be a small net positive as well: * Of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have AFAIK net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from two Tufts economists (IIRC, they find net negative effects for ALL signatories, which sounds weird). I won't pretend to understand these studies but the first three seem to come from fairly authoritative sources and consistent with mainstream economics (judging by Harvard economists Robert Lawrence's and Dani Rodrik's thoughts on the studies). Regarding the Tufts analysis, Dani Rodrik (who you could fairly call a free trade skeptic), says that the Tufts economists do ["a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective".](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tpp-debate-economic-benefits-by-dani-rodrik-2016-02) Some of the Tufts study flaws are outlined [here](http://ecipe.org/publications/splendid-isolation-capaldo-study-ttip/). I definitely don't know the science behind this kind of research but I would definitely lean towards what I perceive as the mainstream economics view. * Labor: Here is a [pro-TPP argument by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/), who have extensively studied US labor markets adjustments to trade competition shocks caused by China (their [paper](http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf) was even cited by the anti-TPP folks in a recent AMA). * The losers of the TPP should be compensated. However, even if they weren't, TPP would still be good, as it makes Americans on the whole better off. The ideal outcome would be that anti-TPP Senators, like Feingold (hopefully he'll get elected, push for greater trade adjustment assistance (and other social programs) in exchange for their support of the TPP. That would be fantastic. * And Feingold is surely not talking about the economic costs and benefits for non-US signatories of the TPP. Looking beyond strict US self interest, the agreement boosts the GDP of several developing countries (the winners are clearly Vietnam and Malaysia who will boost their GDP by 10% by 2030 thanks to TPP, improving the quality of life for the 120-something million who live there), and strengthens protections (people can disagree whether these protections are sufficient but they clearly seem to be a net improvement) regarding human rights, the environment, good governance and labor. Not that this is evidence of macroeconomic impact of NAFTA but there was a [good piece by economist Chad Bown yesterday on how both NAFTA and the TPP proved helpful to the US poultry industry in the wake of the 2015 bird flu outbreak. Both NAFTA and the TPP (even though it hasn't been signed yet) boosted regulatory cooperation between the US and signatories, which prevented those countries from putting an end to US poultry exports, saving the jobs and salaries of workers in that industry.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/30/the-sky-fell-on-the-u-s-poultry-industry-last-year-but-nafta-and-the-tpp-helped-protect-u-s-exports/) Just one example of many of how these kinds of trade deals are good for US workers.  gt; The former senator quipped the only good thing he could say about the TPP is "you might have more choices" at the store. "I would prefer not having 15 choices of golf clubs  #8212; I would prefer having a job," he argued. I'll leave this to /r/badeconomics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Islamic terrorists intentionally try to induce a backlash against Muslims in the West and far-right bigots like Trump and a large number of his supporters are happy to oblige the terrorists in achieving their goal. [This recent study from a top econ journal](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12219/abstract) illustrates it well, showing that the backlash against Muslims in the US (as measured by hate crimes against Muslims) after 9/11 reduced Muslim assimilation.

Armies needed to be large, paid and professional, which gave large political units an advantage and killed off smaller political units which did not have the manpower or tax base to sustain large, skilled and well-armed armies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Trump's Supreme Court nominees:** * Trump has stated that he wants to replace Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court with "a person of similar views and principles".[428] He has released a list of eleven potential picks to replace Scalia.[429] The jurists are widely considered to be conservative.[429][430][431][432] All are white, and eight of the eleven are men.[430] The list includes five out of the eight individuals recommended by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.[433] Trump had previously insisted that he would seek guidance from conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation when it came to picking Supreme Court candidates.[430] Several of the judges listed by Trump have questioned abortion rights.[430] Six of the eleven judges have clerked for conservative Supreme Court justices.[430] * Trump has claimed that he "would probably appoint" justices to the Supreme Court who "would look very seriously" at the Hillary Clinton email controversy "because it's a criminal activity."[434] However, under the U.S. Constitution, Supreme Court justices "are neither investigators nor prosecutors."[23] * An analysis by FiveThirtyEight shows that, under the assumption that Scalia's vacant seat on the Court will not be filled and taking account of the old age of three of the sitting justices, that **a Trump presidency would move the Supreme Court "rightward toward its most conservative position in recent memory".**[438] **Supreme Court rulings that Trump wants overturned:** * **Abortion rights**: In May 2016, when asked if he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump stated: "Well, they'll be pro-life. And we'll see about overturning, but I will appoint judges that will be pro-life." In the same interview, Trump stated of the anti-abortion cause: "I will protect it, and the biggest way you can protect is through the Supreme Court."[262] The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, praised Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees as "exceptionally strong," while the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America called the candidates on the list "a woman's worst nightmare."[268] Short of overturning Roe v. Wade, Trump has pledged to sign legislation from Congress banning abortion at the 20-week mark (Roe v. Wade protects a woman's right to an abortion before a fetus is viable, which anti-abortion activists have argued is at the 20-week mark).[269] * **Gay marriage**: In June 2015, when asked about the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, he said: "I would have preferred states, you know, making the decision and I let that be known. But they made the decision. ... So, at a certain point you have to be realistic about it."[304] Later, in the run up to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Trump stated that if elected he would strongly consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.[305][305][306] When asked if gay couples should be able access the same benefits as married couples, Trump said that his "attitude on it has not been fully formed."[307] The Advocate, an American LGBT-interest magazine, characterized Trump's Supreme Court picks as "LGBT-unfriendly", noting that "not all have ruled in LGBT rights cases, but those who have are largely unsympathetic, and some have the backing of anti-LGBT activists."[308] * **Mandatory death sentences for killing police**: In December 2015, in a speech accepting the endorsement of the New England Police Benevolent Association, Trump said that "One of the first things I do [if elected President] in terms of executive order if I win will be to sign a strong, strong statement that will go out to the country, out to the world, that ... anybody killing a police officer #8212;death penalty. It's going to happen, O.K.?"[359][360][361][362] However, under the current U.S. legal system, these prosecutions usually take place in state court under state law, and the president has no authority over such cases.[355][363] Furthermore, 19 states have abolished the death penalty, and mandatory death sentences are unconstitutional, as held by the Supreme Court in Woodson v. North Carolina (1976).[355][363] **Clinton's Supreme Court nominees:** * An analysis by FiveThirtyEight shows that, under the assumption that Scalia's vacant seat on the Court will not be filled and taking account of the old age of three of the sitting justices, that **under a Clinton presidency, "the court may quickly become the most liberal it #8217;s been in at least 80 years."**[387] **Supreme Court rulings that Clinton wants overturned:** * **Citizen's United**: Clinton has said that she would, if elected President, introduce a constitutional amendment within the first 30 days of her presidency to overturn the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010),[37] which "launched a new era of unbridled fundraising" in U.S. elections.[38] Clinton says that she would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Citizens United, stating: "I will do everything I can to appoint Supreme Court justices who protect the right to vote and do not protect the right of billionaires to buy elections."[39]</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Stein and Johnson are incompetent but at least they're honest in their assertions as far as I'm concerned. What about when Stein posted a celebratory statement immediately after the UK voted to leave the European Union, calling the outcome "a victory"? She later changed the statement on her website (without indicating so), removing words like "victory" and adding the line, "Before the Brexit vote I agreed with Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas and the UK Greens who supported staying in the EU but working to fix it." She seems like a perfect combination of dishonesty and incompetence. It's sometimes hard to know where the incompetence ends and dishonesty starts, such as her idiotic plans to cancel student debt through quantitative easing and maybe use QE to establish a universal basic income or a Medicare for all. Her equivocations on vaccines are also dishonest, as she's either pandering to anti-vaxxers or trying to fool normal people. Her refusal to take a firm position on whether it's reasonable to call Obama an 'Uncle Tom' (like her lunatic VP has done) is also dishonest. She's no straight-talk express, that's for sure. She's also failed to release her full tax returns (only two pages for one year), while at the same time chastising Trump for his own failure to do so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He said that in August 2015, and the reason why he spoke against Citizens United is that his GOP rivals were benefitting more on it than he did. He also spoke harshly against superPACs and big money, saying that they are scams, that they buy candidates and that candidates should disavow them. He then proceeded, as soon as he had put away the GOP primary contest, to rely on superPACs and fundraise from big donors. He hasn't outlined any specific campaign finance ideas that he would like put in action, and there's absolutely no reason to assume that he's against Citizens United, and for various campaign finance reforms (such as public expenditures on elections, caps on expenditures). All his Supreme Court picks are likely to support Citizens United, and his VP choice loves Citizens United.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is relevant research in [this wiki section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration#Assimilation):  gt; Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation but that there is considerable assimilation overall.[119] Research finds that first generation immigrants from countries with less egalitarian gender cultures adopt gender values more similar to natives over time.[120][121] According to one study, "this acculturation process is almost completed within one generational succession: The gender attitudes of second generation immigrants are difficult to distinguish from the attitudes of members of mainstream society. This holds also for children born to immigrants from very gender traditional cultures and for children born to less well integrated immigrant families."[120] Similar results are found on a study of Turkish migrants to Western Europe.[121] The assimilation on gender attitudes has been observed in education, as one study finds "that the female advantage in education observed among the majority population is usually present among second-generation immigrants."[122] First-generation immigrants tend to hold less accepting views of homosexual lifestyles but opposition weakens with longer stays.[123] Second-generation immigrants are overall more accepting of homosexual lifestyles, but the acculturation effect is weaker for Muslims and to some extent, Eastern Orthodox migrants.[123] A study of Bangladeshi migrants in East London found they shifted towards the thinking styles of the wider non-migrant population in just a single generation.[124]</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Dr. Stein is the only candidate who has come close to winning my vote as a progressive **whovalues honesty, integrity and ethical conduct.** What about when Stein posted a celebratory statement immediately after the UK voted to leave the European Union, calling the outcome "a victory"? She later changed the statement on her website (without indicating so), removing words like "victory" and adding the line, "Before the Brexit vote I agreed with Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas and the UK Greens who supported staying in the EU but working to fix it." Honesty? Integrity? It's sometimes hard to know where the incompetence ends and dishonesty starts, such as her idiotic plans to cancel student debt through quantitative easing and maybe use QE to establish a universal basic income or a Medicare for all. Her equivocations on vaccines are also dishonest, as she's either pandering to anti-vaxxers or trying to fool normal people. Her refusal to take a firm position on whether it's reasonable to call Obama an 'Uncle Tom' (like her lunatic VP has done) is also dishonest. She's no straight-talker, that's for sure. She's also failed to release her full tax returns (only two pages for one year), while at the same time chastising Trump for his own failure to do so. So not only does she fail to meet the most basic transparency requirement for a presidential candidate, but projects this failure onto others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Virtually the entire spectrum of reasonable foreign policy views backs her over Trump. If you were to assume that a candidate's policies has to reflect that of her entire base of supporters, Clinton would be something like a liberal, order-committed, pacifist, humanitarian, offshore balancing, warhawk, cooperative security, selective engagement, restraint, neocon, feminist, pro-free trade, free trade skeptic, realist. That Intercept piece is true to form: idiotic. The very same people interviewed there would favor Obama over Trump. Can we deduce from Robert Kagan's preference for Obama over Trump that Obama "will escalate tensions with Russia, double down on military belligerence in the Middle East, and generally ignore the American public #8217;s growing hostility to intervention". Seriously, has the Intercept published anything that hasn't been polemic garbage? Clinton will just be an Obama 2.0 (liberal, order-committed, willing to negotiate, multilateralist, unwilling to upset public opinion with foreign policy adventures, humanitarian) with less tolerance for Russian aggression, greater willingness to engage in humanitarian interventions, and tougher postures against rogue states (e.g. Iran sanctions). Perfectly reasonable stances that don't amount to being a war-hawk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You equate a willingness to use force as amountin to war-hawk status. That makes the term meaningless, and makes anyone who isn't a die-hard pacifist or isolationist a war-hawk. There are definitely US politicians and foreign policy people who want to put troops on the ground all over the world (Iraq, Syria, Libya, whatever situation arises), want to make Ukraine a NATO member, want to respond more forcefully to Chinese aggression and what they perceive as unfair Chinese practices (hacking, dumping, copyright violations), want to retaliate everytime Iran does something, want to enact regime change at any given time, and would rip up the Iran deal and be prepared to go to war if need be. The term war-hawk loses all meaning when everybody from proponents of R2P to those who want to punish the conquest of other states' territories to those who want a full-fledged war with Iran are all lumped together. How about some nuance, people?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no reason to doubt that Trump's incoherent babble on foreign policy for the last year won't result in the same incoherent idiotic foreign policy once in office. Every single policy proposal of Trump's reflects how (i) he knows nothing about foreign policy (or any other policy for that matter) (ii) his advisors are clowns. Based on everything we know about Trump since he decided to run, it should be as clear as can be that he is either incapable of listening to advisors or finding decent advisors. Assuming that he actually listens to his advisors, that they comprise the likes of Peter Navarro, Gen. Flynn and a whole slew of individuals who are actual lobbyists for Russia and pro-Putin forces in Europe (Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Richard Burt) should be more concerning than Trump just doing something random. It is no coincidence that every respected, reasonable and well-informed foreign policy expert and economist rejects Trump. There is no reason to expect Trump or his trusted group of idiots to make deliberated and informed decisions on foreign policy or any policy. That anyone who has paid attention to this race can still at this point in the race say "Trump will come around" is mind-boggling and horrifying.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That article is garbage. The author doesn't bother to explore her policies, and past positions. He's read some blurbs from her website that he finds "vague" yet chooses to interpret those blurbs in the most extreme manner.  #8220;Standing up to Putin #8221; and  #8220;holding China accountable #8221; must mean US domination with carriers, airplanes and troops on standby, and one finger on the nuclear button. What a joke. Then he says that there are no limits "to the utility of military power" in Clinton's worldview? For the hundredth time: a willingness to engage in R2P at low costs (Libya) and a willingness to take a more aggressive posture to territorial conquest (Russia) and dictators massacring their own people (Assad) are not warhawkery or some unlimited desire to go to war. They're perfectly sensible positions that reasonable people disagree over, and positions that are not particularly distinct from Obama's policies (though he is also some crazed warhawk, judging by how the term is used these days). This myth that Clinton is a warhawk bugs me to no end, especially when juxtaposed to Trump. Clinton will just be an Obama 2.0.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The focus on the email thing is partially a distraction from the electioneering that has happened. The media's "black out" of Bernie Sanders in the early days of the race did as much damage to this election cycle as the free Trump advertising. Nonsense. The media covered the candidates in the same way that they've always covered candidates in the primaries: chasing controversy and paying attention to the front-runners. [Political scientists who have looked at it see absolutely nothing surprising about the amount of coverage Sanders received early in the race.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/23/is-the-media-biased-against-bernie-sanders-not-really/)  gt; I honestly believe that if we were looking at Trump vs. Sander's, Trump would be loosing by a mile, instead we have a nose to nose race. Again: nonsense. A self-described socialist is not going to win any general election by a mile. Especially not a candidate who was largely unscrutinized by the GOP (they even spent money on pro-Bernie ads!), Hillary and the media in the primaries, and *still* lost the primaries by a mile.</TEXT>

I have absolutely no idea what the precise impact of the embargo was on the Cuban economy, and neither do you. It may have played a key role in the Cuban economy's decline, but so may Cuba's horrendous political institutions and failure to use market mechanisms to organize the economy.</TEXT>

In all states with Voter ID laws, it is mandatory that IDs be supplied for free. Most people already have valid IDs, so to claim elsewise is inherently dishonest. What opponents of voter ID laws claim is that complying with the laws is burdensome and costly, dissuading the elderly and low-income groups. They are *unnecessarily* burdensome given that the type of fraud that would be prevented is exceedingly rare. Far more legitimate voters have been prevented from voting (e.g. elderly folks lacking birth certificates being unable to get their voter IDs) than instances of the type of fraud that would be prevented by these laws. * ["While many states with strict laws offer a free state ID for people without any other way to vote, these IDs require documents like a birth certificate that can cost up to $25 in some places. According to a study from NYU #8217;s Brennan Center, 11 percent of voting-age citizens lack necessary photo ID while many people in rural areas have trouble accessing ID offices."](https://www.propublica.org/article/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-voter-id-laws) Now we have research showing that these laws successfully depress the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities. I say, successfully, because there are several studies (in addition to several Republicans blatantly admitting that the purpose is to depress Democratic turnout) that show that Republicans enact these laws for electioneering purposes, as opposed to a genuine desire to prevent an extremely rare type of fraud: * http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440016630752 * http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912914554039 * http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168015587156 * https://gvpt.umd.edu/sites/gvpt.umd.edu/files/pubs/voter_id_adoption.pdf</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but called for a "surgical shot" to take out Gadaffi (whether that would have been feasible is another question entirely). That's what he said in 2016 after (i) [having pretended that he was in favor of Gaddafi staying in charge a few weeks earlier](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/donald-trump-moammar-gadhafi-saddam-hussein/) and (ii) [having pretended that he never expressed any opinion on the Libyan intervention a couple of weeks earlier than that](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-he-never-discussed-/). So that was his third position on the issue in 2016. What was his actual position at the time (2011)? Before the US intervened and when most foreign policy people had a wait-and-see approach, Trump [called on the US to stop the carnage](https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did) and [depose Gaddafi](http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-02-26/ap-fact-check-trump-objects-to-cursing). A few weeks later, he called on the US to [seize Libyan oil](http://www.wsj.com/video/trump-we-should-take-libya-oil/7E12BC15-38AE-465F-949A-CDB65ED6DC75.html). So that's the guy who is going to 'stop all these ill-planned invasions and interventions'. Of course, when the war turned unpopular, he shifted his views.  gt; I wouldn't say he's worse than Clinton or Obama He's favored every single intervention that those two have favored, but with the addition of wanting to attack Iran over every perceived slight (never mind ripping up the Iran deal, which substantially increases the risk of conflict), having expressed a willingness to send ground troops to go after ISIS in Iraq and Syria, starting trade wars with China and Mexico, setting relations with China back before he even takes office, and creating massive uncertainty in Europe over his commitment to defend NATO allies (which increases the risk of conflict; whether he intends to fulfill those commitments or not). If it's "time to stop all these ill-planned invasions and interventions", you voted for the wrong guy. He not only favors military force as an instrument, but seems to lack any principles or rationales for when it's appropriate to use force; judging by his history, he feels compelled to use it when he feels humiliated or just jump on the bandwagon when there is any kind of pro-war buzz going on, which are the worst possible instincts for a US president to have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-picks-up-the-u-s-trade-fumble-1479404990) characterizes the RCEP as a tariff reducer, but says that it does nothing to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (such as subsidies for state-backed firms and theft of intellectual property). So it reduces tariffs on goods, but does nothing to systemically liberalize the economies as TPP would have:  gt; its liberalizing effects will be limited mostly to lower tariffs on goods. That #8217;s progress as far as it goes, but trade in services and investment #8212;and non-tariff matters such as subsidies and property rights #8212;will see little improvement. With China dictating the rules, RCEP will be a safe space for statism and cronyism. A country like Vietnam can expect RCEP to facilitate increased manufacturing investment from firms in Japan, South Korea and China. But modernizers in Hanoi won #8217;t have the leverage TPP would have provided to drive systemic change, such as curbing handouts to inefficient state enterprises. Japan can expect easier access to labor in India. But RCEP #8217;s lower market-opening standards mean leaders in Tokyo will have a harder time facing down domestic cartels that prefer less competition and higher consumer prices. US firms will see eroded access to Japanese markets relative to Chinese firms, and greater outsourcing:  gt; The White House Council of Economic Advisers this month assessed that if RCEP passes in place of TPP at least 35 U.S. industries that annually export $5.3 billion in goods to Japan  #8220;would see an erosion of their market access to Japan relative to Chinese firms. #8221; This would affect 162,000 U.S. businesses that employ five million U.S. workers #8212;and that #8217;s only counting exports to Japan, one of seven TPP countries also involved in RCEP. In a further self-inflicted wound, the death of TPP and the rise of RCEP would also give U.S. firms greater incentive to outsource production to RCEP countries where, unlike in the U.S., they could get preferential access to Asia #8217;s booming markets. Such are the unintended consequences of America #8217;s rising protectionism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump's stance to foreign policy was not at all isolationist. Trump supported every single foreign intervention that the US did in the 21st century, in addition to calling for deeper involvement in Syria/Iraq, a more aggressive war against ISIS, sending troops to seize oil fields in Libya and Iraq, wanting to attack Iran over every perceived slight, and has a bizarre conspiracy-fuelled and emotional obsession with China. People who called Trump an isolationist or a pacifist during the campaign and still persist with it show a profound ignorance of Trump's stated political positions and actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; What most people cite when saying this is that he talks about only going somewhere when we have a clear plan about what to do and not engage in nation building. I see no evidence that he is against intervening without clear plans or that he is against nation building. His pathological tendency to oppose the wars and controversial military actions that he once supported after the point at which they become broadly unpopular seems to confuse a lot of people into thinking he has a principled opposition to military force and interventions. * He favored the removal of Gaddafi before the Obama administration did during the unrest in Libya (years later Trump claimed to have always opposed intervention into Libya). * He spoke sort-of favorably about ousting Mubarak and did not criticize Obama when Obama kind of let Mubarak get ousted in Egypt (Trump of course later criticized Obama for letting Mubarak fall when Egypt took a turn for the worse). * Trump criticized Obama and Hillary vociferously for having withdrawn US forces from Iraq. * One of his few consistent beliefs seems to be that the US should seize resources from hot spots in the world, which would always call for a ground troops presence. And so on...</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; At his rally in Roanoke, VA he specifically stated he was against nation building. He probably said it other times as well, as most of his rallies were just canned speeches with some ad lib. He states that in the context of opposing the Iraq War (which he once supported) and the Libyan War (which he once supported).  gt; I'd say that while he may have held different views in the past, his more recent remarks more likely represent his future policy actions. His most recent remarks (besides the pathological lying over his support for past interventions) were to criticize the Obama administration and Hillary for withdrawing troops from Iraq, and calling for seizing oil in Libya and Iraq. It's not hard to pin down his views at all.  gt; he wasn't a politician... he didn't have to inform himself to the same degree as an actual policy maker. That he hasn't been forced to take a position on these matters (unlike, say, Obama, Clinton and most other major politicians), yet somehow *nearly always* support the use of military force or for actions that are far more interventionist or belligerent than those taken by the Obama administration should be incredibly troubling.  gt; most of the evidence of his opinions come from interviews taken out of context Nonsense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Our findings provide evidence that helps us better understand the impacts of immigration in United States history. The first is that in the long-run, immigration has had extremely large economic benefits. The second is that there is no evidence that these long-run benefits come at short-run costs. In fact, immigration immediately led to economic benefits that took the form of higher incomes, higher productivity, more innovation, and more industrialization. These findings complement recent scholarship examining the selection of immigrants to the United States (e.g., Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2012, 2013, Spitzer and Zimran, 2013) and their experiences after arrival (e.g., Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2014), as well as the existing literature on the importance of the cultural legacies of immigration (e.g., Fischer, 1989, Ottaviano and Peri, 2006, Ager and Bruckner, 2013, Grosjean, 2014, Bandiera, Mohnen, Rasul and Viarengo, 2016). Our findings of the long-term benefits of immigrants within the United States complement existing studies that also find long-term benefits of historical immigration in Brazil (Rocha, Ferraz and Soares, 2015) and Argentina (Droller, 2013).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Peter Navarro:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro)  gt; Navarro's views on trade and China have been widely characterized by economists as fringe.[1][2][3][4][5][6] University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers described them as far "outside the mainstream," noting that "he endorses few of the key tenets of" the economics profession.[2] Scott Sumner, the Ralph G. Hawtrey Chair of Monetary Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that Navarro's views on trade economics and macroeconomics, two sub-fields that Navarro has published no peer-reviewed research in, demonstrate basic errors and confused thinking.[3]  gt; Navarro has, for instance, repeatedly characterized value-added taxes as a tariff, whereas Sumner notes that "this is a very basic error. International economists almost universally agree that a VAT is neutral with respect to trade."[3] A New Yorker reporter described Navarro's views on trade and China as so radical "that, even with his assistance, I was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them."[4] Tim Worstall, senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, has described Navarro as "alarmingly ignorant about trade".[7] According to Worstall, the reason why there are no economists who support Navarro's views is because he makes very basic errors about trade economics.[7]  gt; According to Richard Baldwin, Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute, Geneva, Navarro's economic plan for Trump reflects "astoundingly ignorant economics".[8] Dan Ikenson, director of Cato's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, described Navarro's views on trade as "misguided" and "dangerous".[9] The Economist magazine has described Navarro's views on trade as "dodgy economics" and "fantasy".[10] Laurence Kotlikoff, Professor of Economics at Boston University, describes Navarro as starting, together with President Trump, a new school of economic thought -- "Stupid Economics."[11]</TEXT>

I imagine "literally almost any" means you could find at least 20 sources to back up your claim. There are [at least 30 studies cited here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime#United_States) for the claims that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate.

    <TEXT>The Vault 7 leaks are not the first time that Wikileaks misleads the public and journalists as to the contents of its leaks. During the presidential campaign, the Wikileaks twitter feed repeatedly suggested wrong-doing and promoted conspiracy theories (incl. Pizzagate) based on the DNC leaks. It also falsely claimed to expose secrets about Erdogan's 'Justice and Development Party' in one of its leaks when it instead just violated the personal privacy of tens of thousands of ordinary people for no reason at all. Tufekci succinctly explains the playbook for the disinformation campaigns here:  gt; WikiLeaks seems to have a playbook for its disinformation campaigns. The first step is to dump many documents at once  #8212; rather than allowing journalists to scrutinize them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalize the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Schweller has no clue that Trump has in fact favored nearly every single US military intervention since his advocacy for the Iraq War, and has in many cases called for deeper involvement and intervention than the Obama administration or candidate Clinton did. In one week of March, the Trump administration dropped more bombs on Yemen than during the whole Obama administration. (edit: I'm not up-to-speed on this but didn't he also hand over drone strike authority to the CIA and approve a raid that the Obama administration considered too risky?) When Trump is advocating for retrenchment in a specific case, it #8217;s always after the pro-war buzz has faded and the conspicuous costs of that particular intervention are made apparent (e.g. Libya). Unfortunately, Schweller seems to take Trump #8217;s after-the-fact lies seriously, but not his actual position at the time when a decision would have been made. Schweller is right though that Trump hates free trade (one of Trump #8217;s few consistent views), and is willing to scuttle the US system of alliances and institutions unless those alliances come with payments and those institutions allow the US to cheat on the rules that have ensured unprecedented global prosperity (also one of Trump's few consistent views). If economic illiteracy, and a scuttling of the institutions that have ensured US dominance (and would have ensured US dominance in the long-term even as its relative power declined) in exchange for payments in the short-term is what realism is about, then it's no wonder that no one subscribes to that what-I-thought-was-a-caricature-version of realism anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're saying contradicts [the bulk of available economic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration#Economic_effects). A mass influx of immigrants has a clear positive impact on the employment and wages of most natives (this is something that even economists skeptical of immigration, such as George Borjas, concede). The research is mixed as to the impact on low-skilled natives (those without high school degrees) but whether it's slightly net positive or slightly net negative, the impact is small either way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me summarize: 1. "There is more to life than economic growth" - Yes, so what? The available economic research is also clear in that immigration increases wages and employment of most natives. 2. "Immigration undermines workers rights" - No citation. The [bulk of available economic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration#Economic_effects) shows that most native workers earn more thanks to immigrants. 3. "Immigration is bad for the immigrants" - How about we let the immigrants decide that for themselves? If we're going to be paternalistic and make the decision for the immigrants (which you seem to be advocating), we should forcibly move them to the West. There [are](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00544.x/abstract) good reasons to believe that migration from the [developing world](http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=9730) to the developed world is the most effective poverty reduction tool we have. 4. "Do we want X amount to live in Saudi Arabia when the economy no longer needs X amount of labor?" - In a world of open borders, they'd leave. In the current world of closed borders, there are enormous populations that are unemployed and paid far less than they'd otherwise be (the thing that you're worried about in your Saudi Arabia scenario). 5. "Natives and immigrants experience improvements in earnings and employment... missing step... the world goes to hell" - You need to fill in the missing step.</TEXT>

"We should solve poverty in the developing world" - There [are](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00544.x/abstract) good reasons to believe that migration from the [developing world](http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=9730) to the developed world is the most effective poverty reduction tool we have. [Research shows that the most successful anti-poverty programs in the developing world help the poor in the developing world make as much in a year as they would just by working a day in the Western world.](http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=9730) 2. "Emigration will leave those who remain in the developing world worse off" - To the contrary, [the bulk of research suggests that those who remain will be better off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight#Advantages_.28brain_gain.29). Emigration has been associated with boosting the quality of political institutions of the home country, encouraging more education and substantially increasing trade, FDI and quality of life. If you're genuinely concerned for the global poor, you should make it easier for them to migrate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/why-has-italy-been-spared-mass-terror-attacks-in-recent-years) piece on why Italy has been spared Islamic extremist terrorism: * Extremely good cooperation between law enforcement and intel agencies * Control of territory: the lack of ghettos and banlieues-like spots in major cities * Deportation of non-citizens at the first signs of concern * Law enforcement doesn't face significant legal constraints to start surveillance * Combating of radicalization in prisons In the long-term, migration is a great way to root out extremism and terrorism. [While immigration from terrorist hot spots could increase terrorism in the host country, migration lowers overall levels of terrorism.](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684679) There's a large literature on how first and second-generation immigrants adopt more liberal attitudes the longer they stay in Western countries: * http://www.nber.org/papers/w21756 * https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/92/3/899/2235880/Are-They-Acculturating-Europe-s-Immigrants-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext * http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2014.948394?journalCode=cjms20 * http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038040714537836 * http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147162 * http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imre.12113/abstract Research also suggests that naturalizing immigrants helps them to assimilate: * https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/div-classtitlecatalyst-or-crown-does-naturalization-promote-the-long-term-social-integration-of-immigrantsdiv/F46D864B22AD8C71D5ED1B0DE2FFB4CA * http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/673266 There are also good reasons to believe that the neighborhoods that migrants live in strongly shapes crime propensity and education, which suggests that we should not resettle refugees in crappy neighborhoods and do our best to steer immigrants to certain neighborhoods: * https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.6.1806 * https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.3.2.67 * http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119013000612 * http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/599336 * https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/118/1/329/1917042/Ethnic-Enclaves-and-the-Economic-Success-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext So, the hodge-podge of policies that occurs to me right now: better law enforcement-intel agency cooperation, zero/low tolerance for radicalization, lower legal thresholds for surveillance, steering migrants towards certain communities, and rooting out extremism in the long-term worldwide by lowering barriers to mobility of persons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; And worse than this, only Bernie-supporting Democrats seem to have suffered from this. I easily can find many instances of Bernie supporters complaining of this issue, complaining they were correctly registered, some who had been active Democrats for decades even... but I've never found a single Clinton supporter or Republican anywhere who had their registrations tampered with or deleted in 2016. The demographics of those purged were majority black and hispanic (demographics favorable to Clinton), with less than 5% of the purged under 29 years old (demographics favorable to Sanders). If anything, Clinton was hurt more by the purge. Don't make unsubstantiated BS claims about voter suppression. It's hard enough to stop real systemic intentional attempts at voter suppression without bernouts and idiotic Jill Stein supporters bringing up their BS conspiracy theories to discredit the cause. Your "I have only heard Sanders supporters claim they were disenfranchised" is no better than Kris Kobach's "There are lots of anecdotal reports of non-citizens being bused into New Hampshire to vote". Shame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The type of political regime that will prevail would be a function of two main variables: the military power between producers and looters; and the level of rents extracted by looters. Suppose that military technologies evolve to some degree independently of economic technologies (understood as those to produce things). To the extent that those warfare innovations dovetail more closely with the resources and skills of each particular group, the political regime in place responds to the interests of that group. If producers are better at waging war than plunderers, republican structures form at a higher rate. By contrast, as soon as the producers #8217; technology of war worsens relative to that of the looters, monarchical regimes become the dominant form of government. The regime in place is also a function of the level of rents that is optimal for a dictator or monarch for the following reason. In a regime where the  #8220;stationary bandits #8221; have the monopoly of force (and therefore the producers do not retain any armed force to resist the rulers), the self-interest of the former is the only mechanism that guarantees that they will behave  #8220;well #8221;: the stationary bandits extractsrents below the total output in the economy to the point where they maximize their presentvalue income; any promise they may make to reduce those rents below their optimal choice will never be credible. Hence, as soon as rents (determined by the ease with which they can be extracted) exceed some given threshold, producers will stop having an incentive to subject themselves to a bandit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; When does an independence movement get to form its own nation? For decades, a set of unstated but well-known rules has supposedly decided that. But those rules include a number of contradictions. And as the Catalans in Spain and the Kurds in Iraq push for independence through referendum, those contradictions are becoming uncomfortably clear. The first rule: Portray your cause as a struggle for democracy and human rights first, national self-determination second. This helps get around the fact that there is no legal right, under international or often domestic law, for secession. Also, get the great powers, or at least the United States, to compel, coerce or bribe the government you #8217;re trying to break from into going along. If the breakup isn #8217;t mutual, it #8217;s almost impossible to peacefully resolve, so better to pretend everyone wants it. Ideally, seek independence from a ruler who is unelected and friendless. And hire lobbyists to persuade world leaders that your bid will promote their interests and values, presenting it as an easy choice. And make sure no one asks whether citizens from the rest of the country might want to keep their borders intact, which would reveal that any referendum excludes many of the people affected by the result... The modern international system is built, in part, on two ideas that turned out to be in tension: Borders are sacrosanct and people determine their own political status. The former was meant to put an end to war by discouraging invasion or separatist rebellion. The latter was meant to protect citizens from dictators or occupiers. But when a subset of a population decides to break off, those two principles collide.</TEXT>

The Monkey Cage is a blog run by politicial scientists, now affiliated with the Washington Post. This blog runs pieces by political scientists, most of whom are *summarizing their recent peer-reviewed research* from the top journals in poli sci. *This Monkey Cage piece in question* is a summary of a recent study published in the American Political Science Review. Had you read the Monkey Cage piece, you would have figured this out. Why do users on this subreddit respond so often in this way to submissions? It's beyond me. More importantly, it's tiresome.

    <TEXT> gt; Mixed Teams Rule In my opinion, one of the reasons why the current crop of Icelandic players is so good is because of a complete rejection of the idea that weak players should mix with strong players. Nearly every elite Icelandic player has regularly played with and/or against all the other Icelandic elite players since that they were kids. E.g. Gylfi Sigurdsson, Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, Alfred Finnbogason, Jon Gudni Fjoluson and other professionals from this youth cohort played against each other at least a dozen times from ages 10-16. Late bloomers progress through the A, B, C system while the best players develop further because they're constantly exposed to the best players. The defenders who face the best dribblers, speediest wingers and strong strikers will become better at defending and the dribblers, speedsters and strikers will become better, as well. My experience in a de facto 'mixed teams' youth system in another Nordic country was that there were limited challenges and lots of wasted opportunities to push oneself. Why improve my dribbling and strength when I could just easily speed past every other defender?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper studies the effects of legal street prostitution zones on registered and perceived crime. We exploit a unique setting in the Netherlands where these tippelzones were opened in nine cities under different regulation systems. Our difference-in-difference analysis of 25 Dutch cities between 1994-2011 shows that opening a tippelzone decreases registered sexual abuse and rape by about 30-40 percent in the first two years. For cities which enforced licensing in tippelzones, we also find reductions in drug-related crime and long-term effects on sexual assaults. Effects on perceived drug nuisance depend on the regulation system and the proximity of respondents to the tippelzone.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Whether public policy affects electoral politics is an enduring question with an elusive answer. We identify the impact of the highly contested Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 by exploiting cross-state variation created by the 2012 Supreme Court decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. We compare changes in registration and turnout following the expansion of Medicaid in January of 2014 to show that counties in expansion states experience higher political participation compared to similar counties in nonexpansion states. Importantly, the increases we identify are concentrated in counties with the largest percentage of eligible beneficiaries. The effect on voter registration persists through the 2016 election, but an impact on voter turnout is only evident in 2014. Despite the partisan politics surrounding the ACA #8211;a political environment that differs markedly from social programs producing policy feedbacks in the past #8212;our evidence is broadly consistent with claims that social policy programs can produce some political impacts, at least in the short-term.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We report the results of an intervention that targeted anti-Roma sentiment in Hungary using an online perspective-taking game. We evaluated the impact of this intervention using a randomized experiment in which a sample of young adults played this perspective-taking game, or an unrelated online game. Participation in the perspective-taking game markedly reduced prejudice, with an effect-size equivalent to half the difference between voters of the far-right and the center-right party. The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct, the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10%. Our study offers a proof-of-concept for a general class of interventions that could be adapted to different settings and implemented at low costs.

Using student-level panel administrative data, I exploit variation in the school funding formula imposed by Michigan's 1994 school finance reform, Proposal A. Students exposed to $1,000 (10 percent) more spending were 3 percentage points (7 percent) more likely to enroll in college and 2.3 percentage points (11 percent) more likely to earn a postsecondary degree. The effects were concentrated among districts that were urban and suburban, lower poverty, and higher achieving at baseline. Districts targeted the marginal dollar toward schools serving less-poor populations within the district. [Ungated](http://www.edpolicy.umich.edu/files/09-2016-does-money-matter.pdf).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We use new data on the pre- and post-migration wages of immigrants to the United States to measure wage gains at migration. The average immigrant from a middle income or poor country increases their wage by a factor of two to three upon migration. This wage gain is small relative to the underlying gap in GDP per worker. In a development accounting framework, this finding implies that switching countries accounts for 40 percent of cross-country income differences, while human capital accounts for 60 percent. Wage gains decline with education, consistent with imperfect substitution between skill types.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.

    <TEXT> gt; In a stylized theoretical framework, we argue the earliest states developed the fiscal capacity and coordination needed to achieve increases in productivity, but ultimately limited that productivity due to overcentralization. Although earlier states became stagnant, younger states were able to learn from them and surpass their productivity before they reached stagnation themselves. By contrast, very young states early in the process of building fiscal and institutional capacity, are at a relative disadvantage. Thus, along with young states, a very long state experience also comes with economic disadvantages relative to countries with intermediate state experience. We show that this more complex relationship starts to be visible with respect to economic development indicators (population density and urbanization) and technology adoption in 1500 CE, but it clearly reveals itself in 2000 CE economic performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; A number of studies have found little economic impact of board gender diversity on firm performance. We return to this issue in the context of large European firms. Our contribution is twofold. First, using information on the gender of CEOs children as a source of exogenous variation in female director appointments, we demonstrate a robust positive effect of female board representation on firm performance. Second, while previous work has considered female representation broadly, we focus on membership of board committees as a proxy for active involvement in corporate governance. We demonstrate economically meaningful positive effects on performance of female representation on board committees. Our evidence is supportive of an economic rationale for increased female representation on corporate boards.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Do businesspeople who win elected office use their positions to help their firms? Business leaders become politicians around the world, yet we know little about whether their commitment to public service trumps their own private interests. Using an original dataset of 2,703 firms in Russia, I employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the causal effect of firm directors winning seats in subnational legislatures from 2004 to 2013. First, having a connection to a winning politician increases a firm #8217;s revenue by 60% and profitability by 15% over a term in office. I then test between different mechanisms, finding that connected firms improve their performance by gaining access to bureaucrats and not by signaling legitimacy to financiers. The value of winning a seat increases in more politically competitive regions but falls markedly when more businesspeople win office in a convocation. Politically connected firms extract fewer benefits when faced with greater competition from other rent-seekers.

Using two identification strategies, we show for the first time that reductions of lead from even historically low levels have significant positive effects. A one-unit decrease in average blood lead levels reduces the probability of being substantially below proficient in reading (math) by 0.96 (0.79) percentage points on a baseline of 12 (16) percent. Since disadvantaged children have greater exposure to lead, lead poisoning may be one of the causes of continuing disparities in test scores.

    <TEXT> gt; Once Hersh and Ansolabehere were confident they had properly matched registered voters to their ID records, they used a commercial tool called Catalist to predict each voter's race. That tool analyzes names to determine how likely a given name is to be associated with one race or another. It also accounts for the demographics of the Census block where a given voter lives. Using this tool, the researchers confirmed what voting rights advocates already know to be true #8212;that black voters are more likely to lack adequate identification under voter ID laws. **According to the study, 3.6 percent of registered white voters had no match in any state or federal ID database. By contrast, 7.5 percent of black registered voters were missing from those databases.**  gt; **The algorithm shows a clear and disturbing racial disparity on voting rights. But Hersh says that it also shows that voter ID laws affect a relatively small percentage of the population. Across all registered voters in Texas, the researchers found 4.5 percent lack proper identification. For registered voters who actually showed up at the polls in 2012, it's 1.5 percent.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; US incarceration rates quintupled from the early 1970s to the present, leading to the US becoming the most incarcerated OECD country in the world. A driving cause behind this growth was a nationwide shift to more punitive criminal justice policy, particularly with respect to drug related crimes. This movement has since been characterized as the  #8220;war on drugs. #8221; In this manuscript, we investigate the impact of rising incarceration rates on drug use and drug markets by exploiting a natural experiment in the Texas penitentiary system. In 1993, Texas made massive investments into its prison infrastructure which led to an over doubling of the state #8217;s prison capacity. The effect was that Texas #8217;s incarceration rates more than doubled, due in large part to declining paroles. We use this event to study the effect that mass incarceration had on drug markets. We find no effect on drug arrests, drug prices or drug purity. We also find no effect on self-referred cocaine or heroin treatment admissions. However, we do find large negative effects on criminal justice referrals into treatment for cocaine and heroin, suggesting that mass incarceration reduces drug use in the population. Furthermore, our results indicate that this decline is driven by incapacitation effects as opposed to deterrence effects. [Here as a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C0cnSUs9u4).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper is one of the first systematic assessments of ex-felons #8217; workplace performance. Using FOIA-requested data from the Department of Defense, we follow 1.3 million ex-offender and non-offender enlistees in the US military from 2002 to 2009. Those with a felony background show no difference in attrition rates due to poor performance compared to those without criminal records. Moreover, ex-felons are promoted more quickly and to higher ranks than other enlistees. At the same time, we find that ex-felons are slightly more likely to commit a legal offense in the military system (5 percent of non-felons compared to 6.6 percent of ex-felons). We also find a higher rate of work-related deaths among the ex-felon sample; closer evaluation of limited data suggests this may be driven by ex-felons being assigned more often to combat positions. Overall, our study shows that the military #8217;s criminal history screening process can result in successful employment outcomes for ex-felons, at least in terms of job mobility and reliability, to the mutual benefit of employer and employee. An important question arising from this analysis is whether the military #8217;s  #8220;whole person #8221; review can apply successfully to the civilian sector.

This paper draws on a rich collection of Mexican microdata to estimate the effect of foreign supermarket entry on household welfare and decomposes this effect into six channels. We find that foreign entry causes large welfare gains for the average household predominantly driven by a reduction in the cost of living #8212;both through price reductions at domestic stores and through the direct consumer gains from foreign stores. These gains are, on average, positive for all income groups but are regressive. [PDF](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/62575/1/dp1351.pdf)</TEXT>

Existing research shows that undocumented immigrants: * increase the size of the U.S. economy, * contribute to economic growth, * enhance the welfare of natives, * contribute more in tax revenue than they collect, * reduce American firms' incentives to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods, and * benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services. Existing research shows that legalization would boost the earnings and consumption of undocumented immigrants, and improve the US economy. In addition, there is scholarly consensus that undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates than natives. Existing research shows that sanctuary policies have no significant impact on crime, and that immigration enforcement has no significant impact on crime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're misrepresenting the WaPo fact-check *(the fact-check literally gives Trump three Pinocchios for falsely claiming that immigrants are a net burden in the National Academy report*) and the National Academy report (*which you have not read*). Both the WaPo fact-check and the National Academy report make clear that immigrants are a net positive. This is WaPo:  gt; The panel analyzed data from 1994 to 2013 and found that in 2013, the total fiscal shortfall (calculated as the excess of government expenditures over taxes) was $279 billion for first-generation immigrants and $109 billion for the second generation. These figures represent deficits to the local, state and federal budgets combined. The White House said Trump was referring to these figures in the report. But there #8217;s a lot of other information in the study that gives context to these figures  #8212; and shows that immigration has an overall positive impact on the U.S. economy in the long run. The report found that over 75 years, each immigrant represents $259,000 in net present value for federal, state and local governments. Note that the WaPo fact-check is also about immigrants in general, not undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants do not have the right to the same services as legal immigrants, and are therefore less of a drain on public coffers. As for the CRS report, the total impact on public coffers are net positive. Do you think it's important to note that the impact on local and state level are negative while they're positive on the federal level? Fair enough, but I think it's more interesting to know what the effect on the whole is. You don't?</TEXT>

Instead, the situation is now going to be that US exporters and their workers are going to face discrimination (higher tariffs than TPP members) when trying to sell into TPP markets. Fringe nuts on the left and right seriously screwed over American workers. Redditors were for the most part wrong on this issue, as I and others [repeatedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4x1z33/tpp_more_likely_to_harm_than_help_american_workers/d6broa3/?context=3) tried to [explain](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4vc0ew/obama_to_push_for_tpp_passage_despite_opposition/d5x9i6a/?context=3 amp;utm_content=context amp;utm_medium=user amp;utm_source=reddit amp;utm_name=frontpage) to them. Edit: Seeing as how this is the last chance that I'll likely get to shill for the TPP, here's my 2016 case for TPP: **Economics:** * Of the economic estimates on TPP's impact you have: net positive effects from PIIE, World Bank and USITC and net negative effects from two Tufts economists. I won't pretend to understand these studies but the first three seem to come from fairly authoritative sources and consistent with mainstream economics (judging by Harvard economists Robert Lawrence's and Dani Rodrik's thoughts on the studies). Regarding the Tufts analysis, Dani Rodrik (who you could fairly call a free trade skeptic), says that the Tufts economists do ["a poor job of explaining how their model works, and the particulars of their simulation are somewhat murky... the Capaldo framework lacks sectoral and country detail; its behavioral assumptions remain opaque; and its extreme Keynesian assumptions sit uneasily with its medium-term perspective".](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tpp-debate-economic-benefits-by-dani-rodrik-2016-02) I don't know the science behind this kind of research but I would definitely lean towards what I perceive as the mainstream economics view. * Labor: Here is a [pro-TPP argument by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/12/why-obamas-key-trade-deal-with-asia-would-actually-be-good-for-american-workers/), who have extensively studied US labor markets adjustments to trade competition shocks caused by China (their [paper](http://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf) was even cited by anti-TPP folks who appeared in reddit AMAs). * The losers of the TPP should be compensated. However, even if they weren't, TPP would still be good, as it makes Americans on the whole better off. The ideal outcome would be that anti-TPP congressmen push for greater trade adjustment assistance (and other social programs) in exchange for their support of the TPP. That would be fantastic. * As a non-American and looking beyond strict US self interest, the agreement boosts the GDP of several developing countries (the winners are clearly Vietnam and Malaysia who will boost their GDP by 10% by 2030 thanks to TPP, improving the quality of life for the 120-something million who live there), and strengthens protections (people can disagree whether these protections are sufficient but they clearly seem to be a net improvement) regarding human rights, the environment, good governance and labor. **Labor rights:** * According to Human Rights Watch, the TPP side agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei ["are a unique and significant step in efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements"](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/12/qa-trans-pacific-partnership#4). According to PIIE, ["the TPP includes more protections of labor rights than any previous US free trade agreement"](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/labor-standards-tpp). **Environmental standards:** * According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the ["TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history"](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#preserving-the-environment). The Peterson Institute for International Economics argues that the TPP is ["the most environmentally-friendly trade deal ever negotiated."](https://piie.com/newsroom/short-videos/tpp-and-environment). Environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Humane Society, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Defenders of Wildlife, International Fund for Wildlife Welfare, and World Animal Protection have expressed support for TPP. The representative of one environmental group against TPP, the Sierra Club, made a fool of herself in an AMA on TPP the other week, providing no substantive answers to any questions. I won't pretend to know all these environmental groups but I'm hardly surprised that groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club are against TPP. I don't have a good impression of them and I'm 99% confident they'd be against it regardless of the contents. **Geopolitics and future trade cooperation:** * TPP is good geopolitics and has economic benefits beyond the specific contents of the agreement. The [US-centric language of the TPP](http://rap.sagepub.com/content/3/3/2053168016658919) will, for instance, influence future trade cooperation, the agreement will strengthen bargaining power with China (both on economic and political issues), lessen the likelihood of China successfully setting up alternative institutions and lessen the likelihood of China dominating its smaller neighbors. * Those concerned about the plight of American workers vulnerable to trade competition should want *the US* to write the rules of trade, *not the competition*. * I don't recall ever hearing anyone say that TPP is bad geopolitics for the US. **Intellectual property:** * Big pharma has complained about the IP protections being too lenient (leading some Big Pharma Senators like Orrin Hatch who otherwise support every free trade agreement to voice their skepticism of TPP). Economists who study drugs, IP and developing countries (such as [Walter Park](http://www.cato.org/events/tpp-pharmaceutical-protections-too-strong-too-weak-or-just-right) ) argue that the existing literature does not show that developing countries will have greater prices and less access to drugs in the wake of more strict IP protections. Research suggests that the pharmaceutical protections in TPP could enhance unaffiliated licensing in developing countries, lead to tech transfers that contribute to local learning-by-doing, stimulate new drug launches in more countries, expand marketing and distribution networks, and encourage early stage pharmaceutical innovations. Anyway, the TPP aligns with TRIPS, which allows developing countries to circumvent patent rights for better access to essential medicines. **ISDS** * ISDS is *good*. It allows entities to seek monetary damages (no, it does not overturn local laws) for treaty violations (no, "lost profits" is not a treaty violation) in a neutral tribunal (note that both parties decide the judges). One such treaty violation is discrimination of foreign firms. If your country does not set up rules that specifically try to put the kibosh on foreign firms, you will be fine. The White House and USITC also present TPP's ISDS provisions as a significant upgrade on the ISDS provisions in previous free trade agreements (there are ISDS provisions in more than 3000 trade agreements - note that we're all still alive): tobacco companies (guilty of numerous frivolous ISDS cases in other trade agreements) are totally excluded from TPP's ISDS provisions (one reason why the pro-tobacco Sen. Mitch McConnell who otherwise supports every free trade agreement dropped his backing of the TPP); lots of leeway for governments to enact health, safety and the environmental regulations; and opening up arbitration proceedings to the public. * The International Bar Association corrects a bunch of ISDS myths [here](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qi4m9bYqevMJ:www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx%3FDocumentUid%3Df30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e+ amp;cd=1 amp;hl=en amp;ct=clnk amp;gl=en). USTR also has a Q amp;A section that addresses many of the most annoying misconceptions that redditors have about ISDS. **Other good stuff:** * According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, signatories are required to join the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC); criminalize bribery of public officials; have in place a code of conduct for public officials; take measures to decrease conflicts of interest; effectively enforce anti-corruption laws and regulations; and involve private organizations in the fight against corruption. The USTR asserts that ["research also shows that trade improves human rights conditions by fostering pluralistic institutions and increasing open exchanges of information](https://ustr.gov/tpp/#standing-up-for-human-rights)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Over 20 percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States are currently awaiting trial, but little is known about the impact of pretrial detention on defendants. This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of pretrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Labor unions play a central role in the Democratic party coalition, providing candidates with voters, volunteers, and contributions, as well as lobbying policymakers. Has the sustained decline of organized labor hurt Democrats in elections and shifted public policy? We use the enactment of right-to-work laws #8212;which weaken unions by removing agency shop protections #8212;to estimate the effect of unions on politics from 1980 to 2016. Comparing counties on either side of a state and right-to-work border to causally identify the effects of the state laws, we find that right-to-work laws reduce Democratic Presidential vote shares by 3.5 percentage points. We find similar effects in US Senate, US House, and Gubernatorial races, as well as on state legislative control. Turnout is also 2 to 3 percentage points lower in right-to-work counties after those laws pass. We next explore the mechanisms behind these effects, finding that right-to-work laws dampen organized labor campaign contributions to Democrats and that potential Democratic voters are less likely to be contacted to vote in right-to-work states. The weakening of unions also has large downstream effects both on who runs for office and on state legislative policy. Fewer working class candidates serve in state legislatures and Congress, and state policy moves in a more conservative direction following the passage of right-to-work laws.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; I estimate the impact of a historic grant program, funded by George Soros, that provided grants to over 28,000 Soviet scientists shortly after the end of the USSR. Exploiting a discontinuity in the grant eligibility formula, I show that the grants more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting impacts. While existing evidence shows negligible impacts of scientific grants, I show that funding for science can have high marginal returns when funding levels are low relative to the stock of human capital.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper explores the impact of immigrants on the imports, exports and productivity of service-producing firms in the U.K. Immigrants may substitute for imported intermediate inputs (offshore production) and they may impact the productivity of the firm as well as its export costs. The first effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be seen as a cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as a trade-cost reducing effect. To test the empirical significance and size of these effects, we exploit differences in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets and a new firm-level dataset on U.K. service firms. We find that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. They also reduce the extent of country-specific offshoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks, and they increase country-specific exports, consistent with a reduction in bilateral communication and trade costs.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Political observers, campaign experts, and academics alike argue bitterly over whether it is more important for a party to capture ideologically moderate swing voters or to encourage turnout among hardcore partisans. The behavioral literature in American politics suggests that voters are not informed enough, and are too partisan, to be swing voters, while the institutional literature suggests that moderate candidates tend to perform better. We speak to this debate by examining the link between the ideology of congressional candidates and the turnout of their parties #8217; bases in US House races, 2006 #8211;2014. Combining a regression discontinuity design in close primary races with survey and administrative data on individual voter turnout, we find that extremist nominees #8212;as measured by the mix of campaign contributions they receive #8212;suffer electorally, largely because they decrease their party #8217;s share of turnout in the general election, skewing the electorate towards their opponent #8217;s party. The results help show how the behavioral and institutional literatures can be connected. For our sample of elections, turnout appears to be the dominant force in determining election outcomes, but it advantages ideologically moderate candidates because extremists appear to activate the opposing party #8217;s base more than their own.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We propose that individuals are more politically active in more like-minded social environments. To test this hypothesis, we combine administrative data from the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Postal Service. We identify 45,000 individuals who contributed to Barack Obama #8217;s 2008 presidential campaign and changed residences either before or after the 2012 election cycle.We examine whether living in an area with a higher share of Democrats causes higher contributions to Obama. We find that conformity effects are economically significant. Additionally, we conduct counterfactual analysis that shows that these effects are important for understanding geographic polarization.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This study examines the effects of implementing a congestion tax in central Stockholm on both ambient air pollution and the population health of local children. We demonstrate that the tax reduced ambient air pollution by 5 to 15 percent, and that this reduction in air pollution was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of acute asthma attacks among young children. The change in health was more gradual than the change in pollution suggesting that it may take time for the full health effects of changes in pollution to be felt. Given the sluggish adjustment of health to pollution changes, short-run estimates of the pollution reduction programs may understate the long-run health benefits.

    <TEXT>Reminder: [Trump has in nearly every serious 21st century debate about the use of American military force favored US military intervention](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5s6x5r/trumps_isolationism_out_of_the_window_so_early/ddcw3w6/?context=3). Where the US is not involved, he has favored going in. In the areas where the US is already involved, he has favored expanded use of military force. Where the US can plausibly oust a leader, halt negotiations or rip up an agreement, he has supported doing that. In every single instance where he has voiced opposition to interventionism, it has been (1) a considerable time after having initially supported intervention and (2) after the intervention grew unpopular. Trump's instincts are always to take the most extreme, violent, rash and idiotic option, but thankfully it appears as if advisors and officials have restrained him. The ouster of Tillerson and McMaster, and the elevation of Bolton, Pompeo and Navarro are extremely worrying signs for peace and stability in the international system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Despite substantial public, political, and scholarly attention to the issue of immigration and crime, we know little about the criminological consequences of undocumented immigration. As a result, fundamental questions about whether undocumented immigration increases violent crime remain unanswered. In an attempt to address this gap, we combine newly developed estimates of the unauthorized population with multiple data sources to capture the criminal, socioeconomic, and demographic context of all 50 states and Washington, DC, from 1990 to 2014 to provide the first longitudinal analysis of the macro #8208;level relationship between undocumented immigration and violence. The results from fixed #8208;effects regression models reveal that undocumented immigration does not increase violence. Rather, the relationship between undocumented immigration and violent crime is generally negative, although not significant in all specifications. Using supplemental models of victimization data and instrumental variable methods, we find little evidence that these results are due to decreased reporting or selective migration to avoid crime. We consider the theoretical and policy implications of these findings against the backdrop of the dramatic increase in immigration enforcement in recent decades.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Many analysts argue that U.S. drone strikes generate blowback: by killing innocent civilians, such strikes radicalize Muslim populations at the local, national, and even transnational levels. This claim, however, is based primarily on anecdotal evidence, unreliable media reports, and advocacy-driven research by human rights groups. Interview and survey data from Pakistan, where, since 2004, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has launched more than 430 drone strikes, show little or no evidence that drone strikes have a significant impact on militant Islamist recruitment either locally or nationally. Rather, the data reveal the importance of factors such as political and economic grievances, the Pakistani state's selective counterterrorism policies, its indiscriminate repression of the local population, and forced recruitment of youth by militant groups. Similarly, trial testimony and accounts of terrorists convicted in the United States, as well as the social science scholarship on Muslim radicalization in the United States and Europe, provide scant evidence that drone strikes are the main cause of militant Islamism. Instead, factors that matter include a transnational Islamic identity's appeal to young immigrants with conflicted identities, state immigration and integration policies that marginalize Muslim communities, the influence of peers and social networks, and online exposure to violent jihadist ideologies within the overall context of U.S. military interventions in Muslim countries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Scholars have shown that once in place policies can foster greater political participation. Indeed, politicians often deliberately design policies to shore up political support among their allies. But can political actors engineer the reverse effect, crafting policies that demobilize their rivals? Drawing on the example of conservative cross-state advocacy against public sector unions, I describe the strategy of policy feedback as political weapon, or when actors design policies to politically weaken their opponents. I then document that the passage of conservative network-backed legislation led to large and enduring declines in public sector union density and revenue. I further show that by curbing the power of public unions, the passage of conservative network-backed bills dampened the political participation of public sector employees. My findings emphasize the importance of considering how actors use policy to demobilize political opponents and explain why public unions are now on the defensive in state politics.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Political scientists often characterize state and local governments as marginal and highly constrained in policymaking. However, I suggest that in recent decades state governments have moved from the margins to the center of partisan battles over the direction of U.S. public policy. Across 16 issue areas, I investigate interstate policy variation, policy differences across states, and policy polarization, the changing relationship between party control of state government and policy outcomes. Since the 1970s, interstate variation has increased such that an individual #8217;s tax burden, right to obtain an abortion, and other relationships to government are increasingly determined by her state of residence. Policy polarization increases dramatically after 2000 in 14 of the 16 areas. I show that party control increasingly predicts socioeconomic outcomes in the polarized area of health care, but not in the nonpolarized area of criminal justice.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper analyzes the effects of immigration on waiting times for the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Linking administrative records from Hospital Episode Statistics (2003 #8211;2012) with immigration data drawn from the UK Labour Force Survey, we find that immigration reduced waiting times for outpatient referrals and did not have significant effects on waiting times in accident and emergency departments (A amp;E) and elective care. The reduction in outpatient waiting times can be explained by the fact that immigration increases natives #8217; internal mobility and that immigrants tend to be healthier than natives who move to different areas. Finally, we find evidence that immigration increased waiting times for outpatient referrals in more deprived areas outside of London. The increase in average waiting times in more deprived areas is concentrated in the years immediately following the 2004 EU enlargement and disappears in the medium term (e.g., 3 #8211;4 years).

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper develops a new test for identifying racial bias in the context of bail decisions #8212;a high-stakes setting with large disparities between white and black defendants. We motivate our analysis using Becker #8217;s model of racial bias, which predicts that rates of pretrial misconduct will be identical for marginal white and marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially unbiased. In contrast, marginal white defendants will have higher rates of misconduct than marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially biased, whether that bias is driven by racial animus, inaccurate racial stereotypes, or any other form of bias. To test the model, we use the release tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to identify the relevant race-specific misconduct rates. Estimates from Miami and Philadelphia show that bail judges are racially biased against black defendants, with substantially more racial bias among both inexperienced and part-time judges. We find suggestive evidence that this racial bias is driven by bail judges relying on inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of releasing black defendants.

We document this surprising outcome and propose an explanation using a model of political support. Politicians care about consumer welfare but also enjoy retaining control over industrial policy. We show that politicians from different countries who set up a common regulator will make it more independent and more pro-competition than the national ones it replaces. Our comparative analysis of antitrust policy reveals strong support for this and other predictions of the model. European institutions are more independent than their American counterparts, and they enforce pro-competition policies more strongly than any individual country ever did. Countries with ex-ante weak institutions benefit more from the delegation of antitrust enforcement to the EU level. Our model also explains why political and lobbying expenditures have increased much more in America than in Europe, and using data across industries and across countries, we show that these expenditures explain the relative rise of concentration and market power in the US.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This article offers an additional explanation for why corrupt politicians survive democratic elections. I argue that, unlike other electoral issues, corruption possesses some specificities that make it an issue that voters tend to believe politicians are particularly incompetent to deal with. When voters believe corruption to be a constant among candidate options, they are likely to overlook this aspect of government performance, basing their vote on other concerns. This attitude is particularly prevalent when corruption is more pervasive, which leads to the prediction that accountability for corruption will be weaker when it is needed the most. This study relies on a multimethod approach that brings together data from Brazil and a broader set of countries. This article helps one to understand why corrupt governments go unpunished and informs efforts to curb this problem. The article can be accessed by punching the DOI or URL into sci-hub.tw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Paper on Germany](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3078172):  gt; Many European countries impose employment bans that prevent asylum seekers from entering the local labor market for a certain waiting period upon arrival. We provide evidence on the long-term effects of such employment bans on the subsequent economic integration of refugees. We leverage a natural experiment in Germany, where a court ruling prompted the reduction in the length of the employment ban. We find that even five years after the waiting period was reduced, employment rates were about 20 percentage points lower for refugees who, upon arrival, had to wait an additional seven months before they were allowed to enter the labor market. It took up to ten years for this employment gap to disappear. **Our findings suggest that longer employment bans considerably slowed down the economic integration of refugees and reduced their motivation to integrate early on after arrival. A marginal cost-benefit analysis suggests that this employment ban cost German taxpayers about 40 million Euro per year on average in terms of welfare expenditures and forgone tax revenues from unemployed refugees.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This paper theorizes three forms of bias that might limit women's representation: outright hostility, double standards, and a double bind whereby desired traits present bigger burdens for women than men. We examine these forms of bias using conjoint experiments derived from several original surveys #8212;a population survey of American voters and two rounds of surveys of American public officials. We find no evidence of outright discrimination or of double standards. All else equal, most groups of respondents prefer female candidates, and evaluate men and women with identical profiles similarly. But on closer inspection, all is not equal. Across the board, elites and voters prefer candidates with traditional household profiles such as being married and having children, resulting in a double bind for many women. So long as social expectations about women's familial commitments cut against the demands of a full-time political career, women are likely to remain underrepresented in politics.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; A frequent belief is that the rise of so-called  #8220;gig work #8221; has led to the displacement of workers in a wide range of traditional jobs. This paper examines the impacts of the flagship of the gig economy #8212;Uber #8212;on workers employed in conventional taxi services. Our analysis exploits newly collected data on the staggered rollout of Uber across metropolitan areas in the United States and a difference-in-differences design to document that incumbent taxi drivers experienced a relative earnings decline of about 10 percent subsequent to Uber #8217;s entry into a new market, while there are no significant effects on their labor supply. Additional evidence from a battery of placebo tests, event study estimates, and specifications using Google Trends data to capture differences in treatment intensity underlines these findings. A triple-differences design that compares changes among taxi drivers relative to bus, tractor, and truck drivers that were unaffected by the arrival of Uber, provides further supporting evidence that the diffusion of Uber has reduced the earnings potential of incumbent drivers in conventional taxi services in the United States.

The degree of economic harm depends on post-Brexit relations with the EU. If the UK remains integrated with the EU through the EEA, the British economy will suffer the least harm. But in doing so, the UK will have next to no say on the EU legislation that they will be forced to implement. So to sum up: * Hard Brexit: Suffer massive economic harm * Soft Brexit: Suffer modest economic harm and adopt EU legislation without any say Brexit has no merits, and the folks who favor Brexit are not reasonable.</TEXT>

In 2012 and 2014, state legislative politicians from both parties dramatically overestimated their constituents #8217; support for conservative policies on these issues, a pattern consistent across methods, districts, and states. Republicans drive much of this overestimation. Exploiting responses from politicians in the same district, we confirm these partisan differences within individual districts. Further evidence suggests that this overestimation may arise due to biases in who contacts politicians, as in recent years Republican citizens have been especially likely to contact legislators, especially fellow Republicans.

    <TEXT>Abstract: * Employing the universe of juvenile court decisions in a U.S. state between 1996 and 2012, we analyze the effects of emotional shocks associated with unexpected outcomes of football games played by a prominent college team in the state. We find that unexpected losses increase sentence lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex ante have no impact. The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants. The impact of upset losses on sentence lengths is larger for defendants if their cases are handled by judges who received their bachelor's degrees from the university with which the football team is affiliated. Different falsification tests and a number of auxiliary analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings. These results provide evidence for the impact of emotions in one domain on decisions in a completely unrelated domain among a uniformly highly educated group of individuals (judges) who make decisions after deliberation that involve high stakes (sentence lengths). They also point to the existence of a subtle and previously-unnoticed capricious application of sentencing. [Working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2914649)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[The study:](https://jamesfeigenbaum.github.io/research/pdf/fhw_rtw_jan2018.pdf) * Labor unions play a central role in the Democratic party coalition, providing candidates with voters, volunteers, and contributions, as well as lobbying policymakers. Has the sustained decline of organized labor hurt Democrats in elections and shifted public policy? We use the enactment of right-to-work laws #8212;which weaken unions by removing agency shop protections #8212;to estimate the effect of unions on politics from 1980 to 2016. Comparing counties on either side of a state and right-to-work border to causally identify the effects of the state laws, we find that right-to-work laws reduce Democratic Presidential vote shares by 3.5 percentage points. We find similar effects in US Senate, US House, and Gubernatorial races, as well as on state legislative control. Turnout is also 2 to 3 percentage points lower in right-to-work counties after those laws pass. We next explore the mechanisms behind these effects, finding that right-to-work laws dampen organized labor campaign contributions to Democrats and that potential Democratic voters are less likely to be contacted to vote in right-to-work states. The weakening of unions also has large downstream effects both on who runs for office and on state legislative policy. Fewer working class candidates serve in state legislatures and Congress, and state policy moves in a more conservative direction following the passage of right-to-work laws.</TEXT>

On the other hand, he did support multiple foreign interventions before they occurred, and then afterwards (when those interventions turned unpopular) claimed to have opposed them. He's also advocated all kinds of bizarre military actions (ousting Mubarak, attacking Iran over slights etc) that were not seriously contemplated in public discourse. Despite all of this, a shockingly large number of people believe that Trump holds noninterventionist principles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He was misled by his own staff into expelling Russian diplomats, has regurgitated RT talking points on Crimea, advocated for Russian re-entry into the G7, repeatedly praised Putin, repeatedly casting doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, refuses to take action to prevent further Russian interference, congratulated Putin on his undemocratic re-election, repeatedly attacks Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in American elections (which the investigation concluded is on-going) and nudged Ukraine to stop cooperating with Mueller's investigation (in exchange for arms), as well as repeatedly and consistently attacking America's long-standing allies in a way that only benefits Russia. Trump's presidency is the greatest boon to Putin imaginable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Economists have identified product entry and exit as a primary channel through which innovation impacts economic growth. In this paper, we document how high-skill immigration affects product reallocation (entry and exit) at the firm level. Using data on H-1B Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) matched to retail scanner data on products and Compustat data on firm characteristics, we find that H-1B certification is associated with higher product reallocation and revenue growth. A ten percent increase in the share of H-1B workers is associated with a two percent increase in product reallocation rates -- our measure of innovation. These results shed light on the economic consequences of innovation by high-skill immigrant to the United States.

    <TEXT>The conventional narrative is that Russia's election interference proved a massive success for Russia and its interests. Nexon pushes back on this narrative, noting that the interference may not boost Russia's interests and security in the long run. The decision to interfere in the first place was insanely risky and would have likely cost Russia big time in the event of a Clinton victory. That Trump somehow managed to win means that Russia interference will be front and center of mainstream news coverage for the rest of his presidency, and it's likely that the next president will have a staunchly anti-Russia perspective and a Congress united in its opposition to Russia. So, in short, the decision to interfere was reckless and will likely backfire for Russia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We explore the conjecture that norms of racial rhetoric in US campaigns have shifted over the last several years. Prior work suggests that the way politicians talk about race affects the power of racial attitudes in political judgments. Racial priming theory suggests that explicit racial rhetoric #8212;messages overtly hostile toward minorities #8212;would be rejected. When race is cued subtly, however, the power of racial attitudes on issues is significantly enhanced. Replication attempts have recently failed. We identify two historically related shifts that lead us to expect that the effective distinction between explicit and implicit racial rhetoric has declined in recent years. Four nationally representative survey experiments strongly support our predictions: regardless of whether political messages are racially explicit or implicit, the power of racial attitudes is large and stable. Finally, many citizens recognize racially hostile content in political communications but are no longer angered or disturbed by it.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We used data from a 2014 survey (n = 1,287) of U.S. residents and recent polls to assess how public support for the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) changed over time, and whether protecting controversial species affects support for the law. We assessed support for the ESA, trust in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and attitudes toward wolves across three regions with different experiences in conserving gray wolves through the ESA. We found: (a)  #8764;4 in 5 Americans support the ESA, whereas  #8764;1 in 10 oppose; (b) support for the ESA remained stable over the past two decades; (c) strong majorities ( gt;68%) of individuals identifying with 8 special interest types support the ESA; and (d) no differences in support for the ESA, attitudes toward wolves, or trust in the FWS across regions. Results suggest that protecting species #8212;even controversial predators #8212;does not weaken support for protective legislation. Relevant [NY Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/climate/endangered-species-act-trump-administration.html):  gt; The Endangered Species Act, which for 45 years has safeguarded fragile wildlife while blocking ranching, logging and oil drilling on protected habitats, is coming under attack from lawmakers, the White House and industry on a scale not seen in decades, driven partly by fears that the Republicans will lose ground in November #8217;s midterm elections. In the past two weeks, more than two dozen pieces of legislation, policy initiatives and amendments designed to weaken the law have been either introduced or voted on in Congress or proposed by the Trump administration.</TEXT>

To the surprise of many, empirical studies often found minimal effects. The predominant focus of early work was on U.S. elections, though. Nazi propaganda as the archetypal and, in many ways, most likely case for strong effects has rarely been studied. We collect extensive data about Hitler #8217;s speeches and gauge their impact on voter support at five national elections preceding the dictatorship. We use a semi-parametric difference-in-differences approach to estimate effects in the face of potential confounding due to the deliberate scheduling of events. Our findings suggest that Hitler #8217;s speeches, while rationally targeted, had a negligible impact on the Nazis #8217; electoral fortunes. Only the 1932 presidential runoff, an election preceded by an extraordinarily short, intense, and one-sided campaign, yielded positive effects.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Previous research found that Medicaid expansions in New York, Arizona, and Maine in the early 2000s reduced mortality. I revisit this question with improved data and methods, exploring distinct causes of death and presenting a cost-benefit analysis. Differences-in-differences analysis using a propensity score control group shows that all-cause mortality declined by 6 percent, with the most robust reductions for health-care amenable causes. HIV-related mortality (affected by the recent introduction of antiretrovirals) accounted for 20 percent of the effect. Mortality changes were closely linked to county-level coverage gains, with one life saved annually for every 239 to 316 adults gaining insurance. The results imply a cost per life saved ranging from $327,000 to $867,000 which compares favorably with most estimates of the value of a statistical life.

In this paper, we demonstrate that while individual elections are often uncompetitive, hierarchical, temporal, and geographic variation in the locus of competition results in most of the country regularly experiencing close elections. In the four-cycle period between 2006 and 2012, 89% of Americans were in a highly competitive jurisdiction for at least one office. Since 1914, about half the states have never gone more than four election cycles without a close statewide contest. More Americans witness competition than citizens of Canada or the UK, other nations with SMSP-based systems. The dispersed competition we find also results in nearly all Americans being represented by both political parties for different offices.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Taking advantage of a unique event in American history, the Second Great Migration, we explore whether the rapid entry of African Americans into nearly exclusively White contexts triggered  #8220;racial threat #8221; in White voting behavior in the state of California. Utilizing historical administrative data, we find that increasing proximity to previously White areas experiencing drastic Black population growth between 1940 to 1960 is associated with significant increases in aggregate White voter support for a highly racially-charged ballot measure, Proposition 14, which legally protected racial discrimination in housing. Importantly, we find that this result holds when restricting the analysis to all-White areas with high rates of residential tenure and low rates of White population growth. These latter findings indicate that this relationship materializes in contexts where a larger share of White voters were present during the treatment and exercised residential-choice before the treatment commenced, which is suggestive of a causal effect.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; This article uses a natural experiment to analyze whether incarceration during the pretrial period affects case outcomes. In Philadelphia, defendants randomly receive bail magistrates who differ widely in their propensity to set bail at affordable levels. Using magistrate leniency as an instrument, I find that pretrial detention leads to a 13% increase in the likelihood of being convicted, an effect largely explained by an increase in guilty pleas among defendants who otherwise would have been acquitted or had their charges dropped. I find also that pretrial detention leads to a 42% increase in the length of the incarceration sentence and a 41% increase in the amount of nonbail court fees owed. This latter finding contributes to a growing literature on fines-and-fees in criminal justice, and suggests that the use of money bail contributes to a  #8220;poverty-trap #8221;: those who are unable to pay bail wind up accruing more court debt.

We examine whether revenue collection activities compromise the criminal investigation functions of local police departments. We find that police departments in cities that collect a greater share of their revenue from fees solve violent and property crimes at significantly lower rates. The effect on violent crime clearance is more salient in smaller cities where police officers #8217; assignments tend not to be highly specialized. We find that this relationship is robust to a variety of empirical strategies, including instrumenting for fines revenue using commuting time.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We study the impact of the integration of women in US policing between the late 1970s and early 1990s on violent crime reporting and domestic violence. Along these two key dimensions, we find that female officers improved police quality. Crime victimization data reveal that as female representation increases among officers in an area, violent crimes against women in that area, and especially domestic violence, are reported to the police at significantly higher rates. There are no such effects for violent crimes against men or from increases in the female share of civilian police employees. Furthermore, increases in female officer shares are followed by significant declines in rates of intimate partner homicide and non-fatal domestic abuse. These effects are all consistent between fixed effects models with controls for economic and policy variables and models that focus exclusively on increases in female police employment driven by externally imposed affirmative action plans following litigation for employment discrimination.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; A long-standing debate in political economy is whether voters are driven primarily by economic self-interest or by less pecuniary motives like ethnocentrism. Using newly available data, we reexamine one of the largest partisan shifts in a modern democracy: Southern whites' exodus from the Democratic Party. We show that defection among racially conservative whites explains the entire decline from 1958 to 1980. Racial attitudes also predict whites' earlier partisan shifts. Relative to recent work, we find a much larger role for racial views and essentially no role for income growth or (non-race-related) policy preferences in explaining why Democrats "lost" the South.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Donald Trump #8217;s success in the 2016 presidential primary election prompted scrutiny for the role of news media in elections. Was Trump successful because news media publicized his campaign and crowded out coverage of other candidates? We examine the dynamic relationships between media coverage, public interest, and support for candidates in the time preceding the 2016 Republican presidential primary to determine (1) whether media coverage drives support for candidates at the polls and (2) whether this relationship was different for Trump than for other candidates. We find for all candidates that the quantity of media coverage had significant and long-lasting effects on public interest in that candidate. Most candidates do not perform better in the polls following increases in media coverage. Trump is an exception to this finding, receiving a modest polling bump following an increase in media coverage. These findings suggest that viability cues from news media contributed to Trump #8217;s success and can be influential in setting the stage in primary elections.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Debates over the extent to which racial attitudes and economic distress explain voting behavior in the 2016 election have tended to be limited in scope, focusing on the extent to which each factor explains white voters #8217; two-party vote choice. This limited scope obscures important ways in which these factors could have been related to voting behavior among other racial sub-groups of the electorate, as well as participation in the two-party contest in the first place. Using the vote-validated 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey, merged with economic data at the ZIP code and county levels, we find that racial attitudes strongly explain two-party vote choice among white voters #8212;in line with a growing body of literature. However, we also find that local economic distress was strongly associated with non-voting among people of color, complicating direct comparisons between racial and economic explanations of the 2016 election and cautioning against generalizations regarding causal emphasis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; A big population is obviously an important power asset.38 Luxembourg, for example, will never be a great power, because its workforce is a blip in world markets and its army is smaller than Cleveland's police department. A big population, however, is no guarantee of great power status, because people both produce and consume resources; 1 billion peasants will produce immense output, but they also will consume most of that output on the spot, leaving few resources left over to buy global influence or build a powerful military.  gt; To rank among the most powerful nations in the world, a state needs to amass a large stock of resources, and to do that a state must be big and efficient. It must produce high output at low costs. It must not only mobilize vast inputs, but also produce significant output per unit of input. In short, a nation's power stems not from its gross resources, but from its net resources #8212;the resources left over after subtracting costs.39  gt; What costs? There are three main costs that erode countries #8217; power resources: production costs, welfare costs, and security costs.  gt; Production costs are the price of doing business; they are the resources a nation must input to generate economic and military outputs. In economics, production costs include the raw materials consumed, and the negative externalities (e.g., pollution) created, during the production process. In military affairs, production costs refer to the number of assets needed to generate a given level of force and are mainly a function of skill and technology #8212;a military with skillful military personnel and superior technology will use fewer resources to accomplish a mission than a military with low skill and outdated technology.40  gt; Welfare costs are subsistence costs; they are the expenses a nation pays to keep its people from dying in the streets and include outlays on basic items such as food, health care, social security, and education.  gt; Security costs are the price a government pays to police and protect its citizens. The logic of deducting assets tied up in domestic law enforcement and homeland security is simple: police and military units that are bogged down chasing criminals, quelling rebellions, or defending borders against foreign invasions cannot project power abroad or create wealth at home. Measuring security costs thus accounts for the fact that two nations with identical sets of gross resources may, nevertheless, wield vastly different levels of power if one country is surrounded by enemies and wracked by internal strife whereas the other is stable and surrounded by allies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/slavery.pdf) in one of the top political science journals:  gt; **We show that contemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South in part trace their origins to slavery #8217;s prevalence more than 150 years ago. Whites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860 are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative action, and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks.** We show that these results cannot be explained by existing theories, including the theory of contemporary racial threat. To explain the results, we offer evidence for a new theory involving the historical persistence of political attitudes. Following the Civil War, Southern whites faced political and economic incentives to reinforce existing racist norms and institutions to maintain control over the newly freed African American population. This amplified local differences in racially conservative political attitudes, which in turn have been passed down locally across generations.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Several studies show a beneficial effect of peacekeeping operations (PKOs). However, by looking at individual effect pathways (intensity, duration, recurrence, diffusion) in isolation, they underestimate the peacekeeping impact of PKOs. We propose a novel method of evaluating the combined impact across all pathways based on a statistical model of the efficacy of UN PKOs in preventing the onset, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of internal armed conflict. We run a set of simulations based on the statistical estimates to assess the impact of alternative UN policies for the 2001 #8211;13 period. If the UN had invested US$200 billion in PKOs with strong mandates, major armed conflict would have been reduced by up to two-thirds relative to a scenario without PKOs and 150,000 lives would have been saved over the 13-year period compared to a no-PKO scenario. UN peacekeeping is clearly a cost-effective way of increasing global security.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We characterize the factors that determine who becomes an inventor in the United States, focusing on the role of inventive ability ( #8220;nature #8221;) vs. environment ( #8220;nurture #8221;). Using de-identified data on 1.2 million inventors from patent records linked to tax records, we first show that children #8217;s chances of becoming inventors vary sharply with characteristics at birth, such as their race, gender, and parents #8217; socioeconomic class. For example, children from high-income (top 1%) families are ten times as likely to become inventors as those from below-median income families. These gaps persist even among children with similar math test scores in early childhood - which are highly predictive of innovation rates - suggesting that the gaps may be driven by differences in environment rather than abilities to innovate. We then directly establish the importance of environment by showing that exposure to innovation during childhood has significant causal effects on children #8217;s propensities to invent. Children whose families move to a high-innovation area when they are young are more likely to become inventors. These exposure effects are technology-class and gender specific. Children who grow up in a neighborhood or family with a high innovation rate in a specific technology class are more likely to patent in exactly the same class. Girls are more likely to invent in a particular class if they grow up in an area with more women (but not men) who invent in that class. These gender- and technology class-specific exposure effects are more likely to be driven by narrow mechanisms such as role-model or network effects than factors that only affect general human capital accumulation, such as the quality of schools. Consistent with the importance of exposure effects in career selection, women and disadvantaged youth are as underrepresented among high-impact inventors as they are among inventors as a whole. These findings suggest that there are many  #8220;lost Einsteins #8221; - individuals who would have had highly impactful inventions had they been exposed to innovation in childhood - especially among women, minorities, and children from low-income families.

Skilled workers are arguably important in these sectors, increasing the scope for demand effects that counteract wage pressure for natives. Indeed, we find that the increase in employment of foreign workers and the positive wage effects on natives are concentrated in these industries, and that the reform stimulated firm and productivity growth of incumbents in these sectors. Second, we show that the reform boosted firm expansion by relaxing prior constraints to recruit skilled workers. We observe substantial gains in labor productivity in firms that had reported to be constrained by a lack of specialized personnel before the reform. Third, we show that the free movement policy increased R amp;D employment, patent applications, and product innovations, mainly in firms that had suffered from lack of R amp;D workers before the reform. Fourth, we find evidence of capital adjustments: the share of new establishments increased by 4 percentage points in the regions closest to the border. Finally, these firm effects created opportunities for natives to grow professionally: their likelihood to work in top managerial positions increased. These transitions into high-paying management explain roughly one third of the positive wage effects for highly-educated natives.

    <TEXT> gt; ProPublica estimates a toll of at least $18 billion every year, but the true cost could easily run tens of billions of dollars higher. The cuts are depleting the staff members who help ensure that taxpayers pay what they owe. As of last year, the IRS had 9,510 auditors. That #8217;s down a third from 2010. The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking. Almost a third of its remaining employees will be eligible to retire in the next year, and with morale plummeting, many of them will.  gt; The IRS conducted 675,000 fewer audits in 2017 than it did in 2010, a drop in the audit rate of 42 percent. But even those stark numbers don #8217;t tell the whole story, say current and former IRS employees: Auditors are stretched thin, and they #8217;re often forced to limit their investigations and move on to the next audit as quickly as they can.  gt; Without enough staff, the IRS has slashed even basic functions. It has drastically pulled back from pursuing people who don #8217;t bother filing their tax returns. New investigations of  #8220;nonfilers, #8221; as they #8217;re called, dropped from 2.4 million in 2011 to 362,000 last year. According to the inspector general for the IRS, the reduction results in at least $3 billion in lost revenue each year. Meanwhile, collections from people who do file but don #8217;t pay have plummeted. Tax obligations expire after 10 years if the IRS doesn #8217;t pursue them. Such expirations were relatively infrequent before the budget cuts began. In 2010, $482 million in tax debts lapsed. By 2017, according to internal IRS collection reports, that figure had risen to $8.3 billion, 17 times as much as in 2010. The IRS #8217; ability to investigate criminals has atrophied as well.  gt; Corporations and the wealthy are the biggest beneficiaries of the IRS #8217; decay. Most Americans #8217; interaction with the IRS is largely automated. But it takes specialized, well-trained personnel to audit a business or a billionaire or to unravel a tax scheme  #8212; and those employees are leaving in droves and taking their expertise with them. For the country #8217;s largest corporations, the danger of being hit with a billion-dollar tax bill has greatly diminished. For the rich, who research shows evade taxes the most, the IRS has become less and less of a force to be feared.</TEXT>

Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans (Democrats) because they are conservatives (liberals)? Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs actual  #8220;conservative #8221; and  #8220;liberal #8221; policy statements from President Trump, we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue #8212;in either a liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.

Abstract:  gt; Between 1990 and 2008, air pollution emissions from U.S. manufacturing fell by 60 percent despite a substantial increase in manufacturing output. We show that these emissions reductions are primarily driven by within-product changes in emissions intensity rather than changes in output or in the composition of products produced. We then develop and estimate a quantitative model linking trade with the environment to better understand the economic forces driving these changes. Our estimates suggest that the implicit pollution tax that manufacturers face doubled between 1990 and 2008. These changes in environmental regulation, rather than changes in productivity and trade, account for most of the emissions reductions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[The study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151272 amp; amp;from=f) tests your hypothesis and fails to substantiate it:  gt; If firms have changed their focuses of production within one of our 17 sectors from more- to less-dirty sectors and products, then our analysis may confound regulation with product substitution. Additionally, if firms offshore particularly dirty parts of their production processes, then trade might affect pollution through the exchange of intermediate goods. The statistical decomposition presented in Section I at the product level suggests that compositional changes in the type of goods produced within narrow product categories are not able to explain a significant fraction of the observed emissions reductions. If US manufacturing had disproportionately increased offshoring of dirty products, then one would expect the offshoring of these dirty products to change the composition of US production to cleaner goods. Our statistical decomposition, however, provides very little role for composition effects, and looking at product rather than industry level delivers similar results. This evidence suggests that fragmenting production or offshoring is not likely to account for a large share of the reductions in emissions intensities</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We investigate whether preschool-age children exposed to Sesame Street when it aired in 1969 experienced improved educational and labor market outcomes. We exploit geographic variation in broadcast reception derived from technological factors, namely UHF versus VHF transmission. This variation is then related to Census data on grade-for-age status, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes. The results indicate that Sesame Street improved school performance, particularly for boys. The point estimates for long-term educational and labor market outcomes are generally imprecise.

Results suggest that black households pay more for identical housing in identical neighborhoods than their white counterparts and that this rent gap increases with the fraction of the neighborhood white. In neighborhoods with the smallest fraction white, the premium is about 0.6%. In neighborhoods with the largest fraction white, it is about 2.4%. This pattern holds across different types of areas. The findings of this study is consistent with a [large literature on racial discrimination in the American housing market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_based_on_skin_color#Housing).</TEXT>

The odds of reaching the achievement benchmark fall by 12% on average, considerably more for students likely to be interested in football.

    <TEXT>[Abstract:](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/68/6/1007/5160090?redirectedFrom=fulltext)  gt; Changes to the media environment have increased polarized voting in America through both addition and subtraction. We argue that the decline of local newspapers has contributed to the nationalization of American politics: as local newspapers close, Americans rely more heavily on available national news or partisan heuristics to make political decisions. We assess the impact of newspaper closures on polarized voting, using genetic matching to compare counties that are statistically similar but for the loss of a local newspaper. We identify a small but significant causal decrease in split-ticket voting in presidential and senatorial elections in these matched communities: in areas where a newspaper closed, split-ticket voting decreased by 1.9%.

    <TEXT>[Maybe the relationship is reverse](http://www.columbia.edu/~aw2951/WimmerCPSFinal.pdf):  gt; states that are capable to provide public goods across the entire territory and that are politically strong enough to disempower and integrate local elites provide incentives for minorities to adopt the language of the dominant groups and to eventually adopt the core identity. Ordinary citizens shift their primary language to communicate more easily with state officials, to demand services, participation, and recognition more effectively, or to become a civil servant themselves. Linguistic heterogeneity should thus decrease the stronger the capacity of the state to interfere in the daily lives of its citizens and provide them with public goods. From a long-term historical perspective, therefore, ethno-linguistic diversity is not exogenously given, but results from slow-moving, generation-spanning processes of linguistic assimilation (and dissimilation). Following recent arguments in sociology, we can assume that religions and that racial phenotypes are more resistant to such assimilation, the first because it is more closely associated with cultural norms and practices (and thus more costly to change; Brubaker, 2013) and the second because it cannot be changed at the individual level (though it can, of course, be re-interpreted, see Loveman  amp; Muniz, 2006).  gt; In France, to give an example for the process I have in mind, the king had started to extend a uniform and integrated bureaucracy, personified by the royal intendant, since the 17th century. From the 18th century onward, it also provided public goods by financing local police, postal services, construction and repair projects, and the  #8220;hospitals #8221; that cared for and at the same time confined and controlled orphans, the poor, and the sick. In the Third Republic, finally, a massive boost in state capacity occurred, and the center now mandated and financed public schooling for the entire population, new hospitals for the poor and sick, policing in every commune of the country, and so on (for details, the online appendix to Kroneberg  amp; Wimmer, 2012). The result of this increase in public goods provision was, as Eugene Weber (1979) has shown in a seminal historical study, that fewer and fewer speakers of minority languages identified as Proven #231;ale, Aquitaine, Occidental, and so forth, rather than as French. And fewer and fewer were able to speak these languages, given the impact of the school system and of universal conscription into an army commanded in standard French.  gt; Contrast this with mainland Tanzania, which did not know, throughout its modern history, any political entity centralized above the level of clusters of village and tribal segments. The Zanzibari Sultans militarily dominated the mainland from the early 18th century onward. Its slave raiders were operating throughout the area, but the Sultanate never administered the inland population directly #8212;let alone provided any public goods. By the end of the 19th century, during the period of the Third Republic in France, Tanzania had come under the rule of Germans, who controlled the territory by military force, rather than by building a strong state infrastructure. Conformingly, Tanzania today represents one of the most ethno-linguistically heterogeneous countries of the world</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Scholars have not determined whether exposure to a changing climate influences public understanding of or concern about climate change. We examine this question using a comprehensive index of public concern about climate change in each state from 1999 to 2017. The index aggregates data from over 400,000 survey respondents in 170 polls. These new estimates of state-level climate concern enable us to exploit geographic variation in locally experienced climate changes over an extended time period. We show that climate concern peaked in 2000 and again in 2017 and that climate concern is modestly responsive to changes in state-level temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that continued increases in temperature are likely to cause public concern about climate change to grow in the future. But a warming climate, on its own, is unlikely to yield a consensus in the mass public about the threat posed by climate change.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; An increasing number of minority youth experience contact with the criminal justice system. But how does the expansion of police presence in poor urban communities affect educational outcomes? Previous research points at multiple mechanisms with opposing effects. This article presents the first causal evidence of the impact of aggressive policing on minority youths #8217; educational performance. Under Operation Impact, the New York Police Department (NYPD) saturated high-crime areas with additional police officers with the mission to engage in aggressive, order-maintenance policing. To estimate the effect of this policing program, we use administrative data from more than 250,000 adolescents age 9 to 15 and a difference-in-differences approach based on variation in the timing of police surges across neighborhoods. We find that exposure to police surges significantly reduced test scores for African American boys, consistent with their greater exposure to policing. The size of the effect increases with age, but there is no discernible effect for African American girls and Hispanic students. Aggressive policing can thus lower educational performance for some minority groups. These findings provide evidence that the consequences of policing extend into key domains of social life, with implications for the educational trajectories of minority youth and social inequality more broadly.

Abstract:  gt; There is some evidence that liberal politicians use more complex language than conservative politicians. This evidence, however, is based on a specific set of speeches of US members of Congress and UK members of Parliament. This raises the question whether the relationship between ideology and linguistic complexity is a more general phenomenon or specific to this small group of politicians. To address this question, this paper analyzes 381,609 speeches given by politicians from five parliaments, by twelve European prime ministers, as well as speeches from party congresses over time and across countries. Our results replicate and generalize earlier findings: speakers from culturally liberal parties use more complex language than speakers from culturally conservative parties. Economic left-right differences, on the other hand, are not systematically linked to linguistic complexity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.

We compare outcomes for cohorts exposed in utero with those of slightly older, unexposed cohorts, across states with high versus low baseline iodine deficiency. Income increased by 11% labor force participation rose 0.68 percentage points; and full-time work went up 0.9 percentage points due to increased iodine availability. These impacts were largely driven by changes in the economic outcomes of young women. In later adulthood, both men and women had higher family incomes due to iodization.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Is American democracy under threat? The question is more prominent in political debate now than at any time in recent memory. However, it is also too blunt; there is widespread recognition that democracy is multifaceted and that backsliding, when it occurs, tends to be piecemeal. To address these concerns, we provide original data from surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of dimensions during the first year-and-a-half of the Trump presidency. We draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing. We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify potential areas of agreement #8212;bright lines #8212;among experts and the public about the most important democratic principles and whether they have been violated. Public and expert perceptions often differ on the importance of specific democratic principles. In addition, though our experts perceive substantial democratic erosion, particularly in areas related to checks and balances, polarization between Trump supporters and opponents undermines any social consensus recognizing these violations.

    <TEXT>Abstract of the [study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/702234):  gt; American politics in the age of Donald Trump is characterized by negative affect toward politicians of the opposing party and a willingness on the part of citizens to forgive most sins of copartisans. Against this backdrop, we ask whether Trump #8217;s numerous high-profile reversals on foreign policy issues matter. Given our polarized political environment, we argue that there is little reason for Trump to worry about looking inconsistent. Drawing on prior scholarship, we contend that when citizens evaluate a leader who has reversed, policy preferences will supersede any consideration of a flip-flop. We also argue that partisan motivated reasoning and preexisting attitudes toward Trump will overwhelm the impact of a reversal on most matters of foreign policy. Using two survey experiments that reflect real-world events, we show that citizens do not change their attitudes toward Donald Trump significantly even when his policy reversals are made explicit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Support for democracy in the population is considered critical for the emergence and stability of democracy. Macro-determinants and retrospective experiences have been shown to affect the support for democracy at the individual level. We investigate whether and how the individual life horizon, in terms of the prospective length of life and age, affects individual attitudes toward democracy. Combining information from period life tables with individual survey response data spanning more than 260,000 observations from 93 countries over the period 1994 #8211;2014, we find evidence that the expected remaining years of life influence the attitudes toward a democratic political regime. The statistical identification decomposes the influence of age from the influence of the expected proximity to death. The evidence shows that support for democracy increases with age but declines with expected proximity to death, implying that increasing longevity might help fostering the support for democracy. Increasing age while keeping the remaining years of life fixed as well as increasing remaining years of life for a given age group both contribute to the support for democracy.

We use the recent trade escalation between the US, China, the European Union (EU) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries to answer these questions.

Using the localized effects of climate change, we examine whether notable changes in temperature can raise the salience of the issue, thus encouraging a legislative response. To evaluate the behavior of individual legislators around climate policy, we utilize an original data set that includes geographic mapping of climate anomalies at the state legislative district level and incorporates individual, chamber, district, and state characteristics to predict climate bill sponsorship. Using a multilevel model that estimates climate change bill sponsorship among 25,000 legislators from 2011 to 2015, we find a robust relationship between temperature anomalies and bill sponsorship for Democratic members of state legislators while Republicans are unresponsive to such factors. Our data and methodological approach allow us to examine legislative action on climate change beyond final policy passage and offers an opportunity to understand the motivations behind climate innovation in the American states.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; The liberal international order, erected after the Cold War, was crumbling by 2019. It was flawed from the start and thus destined to fail. The spread of liberal democracy around the globe #8212;essential for building that order #8212;faced strong resistance because of nationalism, which emphasizes self-determination. Some targeted states also resisted U.S. efforts to promote liberal democracy for security-related reasons. Additionally, problems arose because a liberal order calls for states to delegate substantial decisionmaking authority to international institutions and to allow refugees and immigrants to move easily across borders. Modern nation-states privilege sovereignty and national identity, however, which guarantees trouble when institutions become powerful and borders porous. Furthermore, the hyperglobalization that is integral to the liberal order creates economic problems among the lower and middle classes within the liberal democracies, fueling a backlash against that order. Finally, the liberal order accelerated China's rise, which helped transform the system from unipolar to multipolar. A liberal international order is possible only in unipolarity. The new multipolar world will feature three realist orders: a thin international order that facilitates cooperation, and two bounded orders #8212;one dominated by China, the other by the United States #8212;poised for waging security competition between them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Well before President Donald Trump began rhetorically attacking U.S. allies and the open international trading system, policy analysts worried about challenges to the liberal international order (LIO). A more fundamental issue, however, has received little attention: the analytic value of framing U.S. security in terms of the LIO. Systematic examination shows that this framing creates far more confusion than insight. Even worse, the LIO framing could lead the United States to adopt overly competitive policies and unnecessarily resist change in the face of China's growing power. The  #8220;LIO concept #8221; #8212;the logics that proponents identify as underpinning the LIO #8212;is focused inward, leaving it ill equipped to address interactions between members of the LIO and states that lie outside the LIO. In addition, the LIO concept suffers theoretical flaws that further undermine its explanatory value. The behavior that the LIO concept claims to explain #8212;including cooperation under anarchy, effective Western balancing against the Soviet Union, the Cold War peace, and the lack of balancing against the United States following the Cold War #8212;is better explained by other theories, most importantly, defensive realism. Analysis of U.S. international policy would be improved by dropping the LIO terminology entirely and reframing analysis in terms of grand strategy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Labor unions have long been important political actors, mobilizing voters, shaping their members #8217; attitudes, and influencing representation and economic inequality. However, little is known regarding unions #8217; influence on political knowledge. In this paper, I argue that unions increase their members #8217; political knowledge through two mechanisms: direct information provision and workplace discussion of politics. I use data from recent national election surveys and a matching technique, showing that union members, particularly those with less formal education, who face higher costs in seeking out political information, are significantly more politically knowledgeable than their non-union counterparts and better informed about where political parties and candidates stand on the issues. I conclude by discussing unions #8217; capacity to reduce knowledge gaps and foster a more politically informed electorate.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; To identify the effects of televised political comedy on the 2016 presidential election, we leverage the change in hosts of two popular shows, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, and both shows' subsequent ratings declines. By combining granular geographic ratings data with election results, we are able to isolate the shows' effects on the election. For The Daily Show, we find a strong positive effect on Jon Stewart's departure and Trump's vote share. By our estimate, the transition at The Daily Show spurred a 1.1% increase in Trump's county-level vote share. Further analysis suggests that the effect may be owed more to Stewart's effects on mobilization, not his effects on attitudes. We also find weaker evidence indicating that the end of The Colbert Report was associated with a decline in 2016 voter turnout. Our results make clear that late-night political comedy can have meaningful effects on presidential elections.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; I estimate the effect of access to food stamps on criminal recidivism. In 1996, a federal welfare reform imposed a lifetime ban from food stamps on convicted drug felons. Florida modified this ban, restricting it to drug traffickers who commit their offense on or after August 23, 1996. I exploit this sharp cutoff in a regression discontinuity design and find that the ban increases recidivism among drug traffickers. The increase is driven by financially motivated crimes, suggesting that the cut in benefits causes ex-convicts to return to crime to make up for the lost transfer income.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using 138 prominent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016 in the U.S using a difference-in-differences approach. We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.

    <TEXT>During your 2018 campaign, you pledged not to turn Colorado into a sanctuary state and you appear to be considering a veto of sanctuary policy legislation that has passed the [Colorado legislature](https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2019/04/12/gov-jared-polis-colorado-shouldnt-block-local-cooperation-with-ice/). However, sanctuary policies are *GOOD... REALLY GOOD*. Here are some studies on sanctuary policies and immigration enforcement: * **Crime:** All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). * **Economy:** Studies shows that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary, it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money)). So, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants is bad for everyone. * **Health:** There are as far as I know no studies on the health impact of sanctuary policies, but studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)).

    <TEXT> gt; one problem I've seen when addressing crime rates is they assume illegal immigrants are the same demographic as your average American. More specifically, illegal immigrants without a highschool deploma commit less crimes than citizens without a highschool deploma. But because almost all illegal immigrants do not have a highschool education, and most citizens are educated, the average illegal immigrant has a higher crime rate than the average citizen. Nope, the studies find that illegal immigration has no impact on the crime rate. These studies are not looking at whether illegal immigrants commit crimes at lower/higher levels than comparable natives. If they did, I would have said that.  gt; Secondly, there is a reason pro immigration advocates focus on violent crime. Maybe because anti-immigration politicians and policy-makers incessantly lie about how illegal immigrants are coming to the US to kill and rape (i.e. do violent crimes).  gt; Unfortanatly Mexician culture has a massive dui and domestic violence problem right now. If you include all non immigration arrests the stats lean further away from your conclusion. Despite your anecdotes about Mexicans being drunks and wife-beaters, a 2017 study in the top public health journal found ["increased undocumented immigration was significantly associated with reductions in drug arrests, drug overdose deaths, and DUI arrests, net of other factors."](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303884)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Douglas Irwin's *Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy* and *Free Trade Under Fire*. Here's a relevant part of an [Economist review](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/11/23/a-historian-on-the-myths-of-american-trade) of the former book: * *Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; In the aftermath of Donald Trump #8217;s 2016 electoral-college victory, journalists focused heavily on the White working class (WWC) and the relationship between economic anxiety, racial attitudes, immigration attitudes, and support for Trump. One hypothesized but untested proposition for Donald Trump #8217;s success is that his unorthodox candidacy, particularly his rhetoric surrounding economic marginalization and immigration, shifted WWC voters who did not vote Republican in 2012 into his coalition. Using a large national survey, we examine: (1) whether racial and immigration attitudes or economic dislocation and marginality were the main correlates of vote switching; and (2) whether this phenomenon was isolated among the White working class. Findings indicate that a nontrivial number of White voters switched their votes in the 2016 election to Trump or Clinton, that this vote switching was more associated with racial and immigration attitudes than economic factors, and that the phenomenon occurred among both working-class and nonworking-class Whites, though many more working-class Whites switched than did nonworking-class Whites. Our findings suggest that racial and immigration attitudes may be continuing to sort White voters into new partisan camps and further polarize the parties.

    <TEXT>**Relevant research about the relationship between illegal immigration and crime:** * There is a consensus that illegal immigrants have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9125.12175), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12300), [3](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/05/13/is-there-a-connection-between-undocumented-immigrants-and-crime), [4](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/)). * All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [2](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). **Relevant research about the economic impact of illegal immigration:** * Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). * A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. * Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary, it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Leading research is converging on the finding that citizens from immigrant-receiving nations strongly prefer the entry of high-skilled to low-skilled immigrants. Prior studies have largely interpreted this  #8220;skill premium #8221; as deriving from sociotropic economic considerations. We argue that a purely economic conceptualization offers an incomplete understanding of the processes generating the skill premium, as it overlooks the role of prejudice as a factor undergirding citizens #8217; preferences. We contend that the skill premium is a manifestation of prejudice inasmuch as it constitutes a preference for those atypical of the existing immigrant population. Through reanalysis of data from published work, as well as through original survey experiments, we demonstrate that a purely economic interpretation of the skill premium fails a range of critical tests. Our findings suggest that rather than solely representing a race-neutral preference for skilled immigrants, the skill premium partly represents a preference against disliked prevalent immigrants.</TEXT>

The analysis provides a helpful comparison of Democratic and Republican tax cut proposals. It shows how geared the GOP tax reform was towards the richest Americans. All the Democratic proposals offer far more tax relief for the 80% than the GOP tax cuts while costing far less. The Democratic tax proposals would likely have a far more beneficial impact on the economy than the GOP tax cuts. This recent [study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701424) in one of the top economics journals concluded, "that the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower-income groups... the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment growth is small."</TEXT>

Our preferred panel data regression specification, unlike the statistical model of Lott and Mustard that had previously been offered as evidence of crime #8208;reducing RTC laws, both satisfies the parallel trends assumption and generates statistically significant estimates showing RTC laws increase overall violent crime. Our synthetic control approach also finds that RTC laws are associated with 13 #8211;15 percent higher aggregate violent crime rates 10 years after adoption. Using a consensus estimate of the elasticity of crime with respect to incarceration of 0.15, the average RTC state would need to roughly double its prison population to offset the increase in violent crime caused by RTC adoption.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Can exposure to successful celebrities from stigmatized groups reduce prejudice toward that group at large? We exploit the sudden and phenomenal rise to fame of Liverpool F.C. soccer star Mohamed Salah, a visibly Muslim player, to answer this question. We causally estimate the effect of Salah joining Liverpool F.C. on Islamophobic attitudes and behaviors using 936 county-month hate crime observations, 15 million tweets from U.K. soccer fans, and an original survey experiment of 8,060 Liverpool F.C. fans. We find that Merseyside county (home to Liverpool F.C.) experienced a 18.9% drop in hate crimes relative to a synthetic control, while no similar effect was found for other types of crime. We also find that Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets (a drop from 7.2% to 3.4% of tweets about Muslims) relative to fans of other top-flight English soccer clubs. The survey experiment suggests that these results may be driven by increased familiarity with Islam. Our findings indicate that positive exposure to outgroup role models can reveal new information that humanizes the outgroup writ large.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Although sexual harassment in the workplace is illegal, it often goes unreported. This study employs causal evidence to evaluate one deterrent to reporting: bias against women known to be sexual harassment targets. I theorize about the form this bias takes and test the argument with a national survey experiment run in five waves from October 2017 to February 2018, where participants were asked to propose employment outcomes for an employee with one of four harassment experiences. Participants were less likely to recommend a woman for promotion if she self-reported sexual harassment relative to otherwise identical women who experienced nonsexual harassment or whose sexual harassment was reported by a coworker. The woman who self-reported sexual harassment experienced normative discrimination: that is, the promotion bias was significantly mediated by perceptions that she was less moral, warm, and socially skilled than the woman whose coworker reported her sexual harassment. These results indicate that women may hesitate to report sexual harassment because they rightly perceive that doing so could cause them to experience bias. Yet they also suggest that bias can be avoided if a bystander reports the harassment. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that in the wake of #MeToo this bias may be fading.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; A key question in the study of minority representation is whether descriptive representatives provide superior substantive representation. Neglected in this literature is the distinction between two forms of substantive representation: rhetoric versus policy. We provide a systematic comparison of presidential minority representation along these two dimensions. Barack Obama was the first African American president, yet his substantive representation of African Americans has not been fully evaluated. Using speech and budget data, we find that relative to comparable presidents, Obama offered weaker rhetorical representation, but stronger policy representation, on race and poverty. While we cannot rule out non-racial explanations, Obama #8217;s policy proposals are consistent with minority representation. His actions also suggest that descriptive representatives may provide relatively better policy representation but worse rhetorical representation, at least when the constituency is a numerical minority. We thus highlight an understudied tension between rhetoric and policy in theories of minority representation.</TEXT>

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n #8201;= #8201;251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate #8217;s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more hirable than Black candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* Do well on the GRE. You can see what kind of GRE grades are necessary to get into a top program [here on pages 23-24](http://wws.princeton.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions-viewbook), for example. I get the sense that great quant scores are necessary to get into most top 20 programs, although some name recognition schools may be less hung up on that. * Find scholars at programs who share your interests and reach out to them. Ask if they are taking on graduates students and whether you're a good fit for the program. * Make sure you're a great fit at the programs you're applying to. From what I can tell that's one way they weed out candidates. Also, you don't want to study at a program where you're not a good fit. * Make sure to have fallback programs that you'd be willing to do a PhD at and apply to lots of places (it's expensive, I know). It's extremely competitive to get into the top 20 programs, and it's better to have multiple options to choose from if you get into programs. Judging by GradCafe, many students who are nonetheless excellent candidates (judging by where they end up) have all of their applicants rejected the first time they try, but get into a top program on the second attempt. Some of the folks who are tenured at great places and very successful academics only got accepted to one PhD program, which sort of demonstrates what a crapshoot it is. * It's way easier to get into good PhD programs in Europe than it is in the United States (for example, I got into all the PhD programs I applied to in Europe, but struck out on my first attempt for US programs (excluding an unfunded offer from a top 20 program) and only got into 25% of the programs I applied to on the second go). If you're European and can imagine yourself working as an academic in Europe, that's something to keep in mind. Also, applications to a lot of European programs are free and you don't have to pay the grifters at ETS to send GRE/TOEFL scores. * Go to the Poli Sci GradCafe forums and read old threads about the PhD application process. Lots of good tips there. * Be aware that many PhD students do not finish their PhDs. Of those who do finish, many do not get dream jobs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to a recent study, strong Republicans, Trump-supporters and conservatives are the most likely to change their policy positions if told that Trump favors a particular policy. [The study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51841c73e4b04fc5ce6e8f15/t/5c1924c2562fa7f0c0e90e08/1545151689089/Does_Party_Trump_Ideology_APSR.pdf): * Are people conservative (liberal) because they are Republicans (Democrats)? Or is it the reverse: people are Republicans (Democrats) because they are conservatives (liberals)? Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs actual  #8220;conservative #8221; and  #8220;liberal #8221; policy statements from President Trump, we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue #8212;in either a liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are several problems with this: * He says that the US only accepts 1 million immigrants, thus leaving 3 billion or so in poverty. Therefore, he argues, it's not worth it to help immigrants. But helping people improve their lives is good in and of itself. Helping 1 million is fantastic. You wouldn't let a child drown just because you can't help *every* drowning child. * He suggests that these immigrants are a burden to Americans, yet all existing research indicates that immigrants (whether legal or illegal) do not adversely affect the crime rate, the economy, native welfare or public coffers. In fact, most research indicates immigrants reduce the crime rate, improve the economy, pay more in taxes than they take, and make most Americans richer. **So, "helping" the migrants is not a burden for the U.S.** * He suggests that there is a brain drain (e.g. migration leaves the origin country worse off). However, the evidence for a brain drain is very weak, and on the whole, there appears to be more evidence to suggest that emigration is economically and fiscally better for the origin country, as well as better in terms of educational attainment and skills development. There is also some research that indicates it's good for democracy in the origin country, but this literature is more mixed. **So, emigration is not bad for the origin country.** So, he just ends up showing that the United States should accept more immigrants because it has no adverse impacts on anyone and helps to alleviate global poverty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Do legislators and lobbyists trade favors? This study uses uncommon data sources and plagiarism software to detect a rarely observed relationship between interest group lobbyists and sitting Members of Congress. Comparison of letters to a Senate committee written by lobby groups to legislative amendments introduced by committee members reveals similar and even identical language, providing compelling evidence that groups persuaded legislators to introduce amendments valued by the group. Moreover, the analysis suggests that these language matches are more likely when the requesting lobby group hosts a fundraising event for the senator. The results hold while controlling for ideological agreement between the senator and the group, the group #8217;s campaign contributions to the senator, and the group #8217;s lobbying expenditures, annual revenue, and home-state connections.

It's also worthwhile to note that the population of illegal immigrants in the U.S. peaked in 2007 (when they were 4% of the total), and that they are now 3.3% of the total.

    <TEXT>**Here's what the research about the relationship between illegal immigration and crime shows:** * There is a consensus that illegal immigrants have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9125.12175), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12300), [3](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/05/13/is-there-a-connection-between-undocumented-immigrants-and-crime), [4](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/)). * All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Research on immigration enforcement:** * **Crime:** All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). * **Economy:** Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary,it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)). * **Health:** There are as far as I know no studies on the health impact of sanctuary policies, but studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)). So, in short, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants does not just impose horrendous harms on the migrants (and what is in many cases their US-born children), but is bad for everyone. One obvious solution is to shift potential illegal immigrants into legal ones by implementing functional guest worker programs. [Research shows that strict border enforcement unintentionally increased the illegal immigrant population in the U.S., as migrants who used to criss-cross the border for seasonal/temporary work permanently settled on the U.S. side because they couldn't risk going across the border often.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5049707/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We study the political effects of mass emigration to the United States in the nineteenth century using data from Sweden. To instrument for total emigration over several decades, we exploit severe local frost shocks that sparked an initial wave of emigration, interacted with within-country travel costs. Our estimates show that emigration substantially increased the local demand for political change, as measured by labor movement membership, strike participation, and voting. Emigration also led to de facto political change, increasing welfare expenditures as well as the likelihood of adopting more inclusive political institutions.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act that mandated federal oversight of election laws in discriminatory jurisdictions, prompting a spate of controversial new voting rules. Utilizing difference-in-differences to examine the act's 1975 revision, I provide the first estimates of the effects of "preclearance" oversight. I find that preclearance increased long-run voter turnout by 4-8 percentage points, due to lasting gains in minority participation. Surprisingly, Democratic support dropped sharply in areas subject to oversight. Using historical survey and newspaper data, I provide evidence that this was the result of political backlash among racially conservative whites.

[All analyses](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-citizenship-question-could-cost-california-and-texas-a-seat-in-congress/) indicate that adding the citizenship question would have likely led to an undercount of between 5.8-10% of Hispanics and undocumented immigrants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Lindsey Graham on climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham#Climate_change):  gt; On December 10, 2009, Graham co-sponsored a letter to President Barack Obama along with then Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman announcing their commitment to passing a climate change bill and outlining its framework.[107][108] Graham was identified as a potential Republican supporter of passing a climate change bill and was thought to be a likely sponsor for the final bill.[109] However, he pulled his support for the climate change bill, saying that he disapproved of Senate Democrats moving forward with legislation to deal with immigration issues, a reaction to Arizona's passage of an illegal immigration law, Graham's withdrawal of support left passage of the climate change bill in doubt.[110]  gt; Graham told reporters in June 2010 that "The science about global warming has changed. I think they've oversold this stuff, quite frankly. I think they've been alarmist and the science is in question. The whole movement has taken a giant step backward."[111] He also stated that he planned to vote against the climate bill that he had originally co-sponsored, citing further restriction of offshore drilling added to the bill and the bill's impact on transportation.[112] **In 2015, Graham said he "completely understand[s] and accept[s]" that climate change is real, but said "I don't know" as to the role that human activity played.[113]** In short, Graham isn't serious at all about climate change and talks out of both sides of his mouth on the issue (possibly to seem sensible to the media but also appeal to the anti-science base and anti-climate change action backers of the GOP). He's teased his support for climate change legislation, but always pull out at the last minute over some BS, scuttling it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; In this paper, I use confidential UK corporate tax returns data to explore whether there are systematic differences in the amount of taxable profits that multinational and domestic companies report. I find that the ratio of taxable profits to total assets reported by foreign multinational subsidiaries is one-half that of comparable domestic standalones. The majority of the difference is attributable to the fact that a higher proportion of foreign multinational subsidiaries report zero taxable profits. I document how the estimated difference is related to profit shifting and show that using accounting data leads to much smaller estimates of the difference.

We estimate the lifetime and age-specific risks of being killed by police by race and sex. We also provide estimates of the proportion of all deaths accounted for by police use of force. We find that African American men and women, American Indian/Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men face higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. We find that Latina women and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women face lower risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. Risk is highest for black men, who (at current levels of risk) face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over the life course. The average lifetime odds of being killed by police are about 1 in 2,000 for men and about 1 in 33,000 for women. Risk peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for all groups. For young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death. [Ungated version](https://osf.io/hw9d2/). [Here's what other studies have found regarding police killings and race:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_based_on_skin_color#Criminal_justice_system)  gt; A 2018 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that black and Hispanic men were far more likely to be killed by police than white men.[77] A 2019 study by Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that while there are no racial differences in lethal use of police force, blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely to experience non-lethal use of force.[78] A 2019 paper by Princeton University political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer's data are not similar.[79] Reports by the Department of Justice have also found that police officers in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, systemically stop, search (in some cases strip-searching) and harass black residents.[80][81] A January 2017 report by the DOJ also found that the Chicago Police Department had "unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive and deadly force" and that police "have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color."[82] A 2018 study found that police officers more likely to use lethal force on blacks.[83] A 2019 study in the Journal of Politics found that police officers were more likely to use lethal force on blacks, but that this "most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force."[84]</TEXT>

If it's slave labor to employ willing workers, what is it to kick them and their families out and force them to do the same work back home for a tenth of the salary? If you're genuinely concerned for the well-being of the immigrants, you'd want to make it easier for them work legally.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Voters are very misinformed about the process by which Trump obtained his wealth. [Research shows that when voters are informed that Trump inherited his wealth, voters become less supportive of him and lower their evaluations of his personal character:](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-019-09527-y)  gt; We examine the effect of biographical knowledge on voters #8217; assessments of leaders. Prior research has shown that voters infer traits from candidate characteristics such as race, gender and incumbency, which are visible to even poorly-informed voters. Given voters #8217; limited knowledge, we argue that less-visible attributes may be easily misperceived, possibly affecting overall assessments of candidates. Focusing on President Trump, we find via a national survey that many Americans are unaware that he was born into great wealth. This misperception increases support for Trump, mediated through beliefs that he is both empathetic and good at business. We supplement our observational analysis with an experiment treating respondents with information regarding the role Trump #8217;s father played in his career. This information leads respondents to rate the president more negatively on both empathy and business ability. These findings suggest that correcting information about candidate characteristics can change the minds of even loyal partisans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Ungated version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3445792):  gt; I find that a one percentage point increase in the U.S. vaccination rate would result in approximately 795 fewer deaths per year in expectation. The mortality benefits primarily accrue to individuals 75 and older, but are mostly attributable to the vaccination of people under 75, suggesting substantial externalities. I also find that vaccination significantly reduces illness-related work absences. The estimates indicate that a one percentage point increase in the U.S. vaccination rate would result in approximately 14.5 million fewer work hours lost due to illness annually, in expectation. I find no impacts on either outcome during periods in which there is no influenza circulating and no impacts on outcomes that are implausibly related to influenza. In monetary terms, the estimates suggest that each vaccination confers at least $63 in social benefits due to reduced mortality and $87 in terms of reduced work absences. ...  gt; I consider vaccination policy targeted at individuals with large potential externalities by exploiting the roll-out of county-level influenza vaccination mandates that apply to health care workers in California. Most of these mandates apply to all licensed health care facilities in a county, and thus there is potential for these mandates to reduce the spread of influenza both within the hospital (the unit of analysis) and in other health care settings (e.g., long-term care facilities). I find that these mandates increase hospital worker vaccination rates by 10.3 percentage points on a base of 74%, reduce the number of influenza diagnoses for inpatient visits by 20.1%, and reduce the number of influenza diagnoses for outpatient emergency department visits by 8.1% during seasons with an effective vaccine. For inpatient visits, the impact is twice as large for influenza diagnoses that were not present at the time of admission (i.e., hospitalacquired infection). I estimate the marginal benefit of HCW vaccination in terms of health care cost savings to be $131 per vaccination.</TEXT>

This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). * **Economy:** Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary,it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)). * **Health:** There are as far as I know no studies on the health impact of sanctuary policies, but studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)). So, in short, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants does not just impose horrendous harms on the migrants (and what is in many cases their US-born children), but is bad for everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; There is robust evidence that higher minimum wages increase family incomes at the bottom of the distribution. The long-run (3 or more years) minimum wage elasticity of the non-elderly poverty rate with respect to the minimum wage ranges between  #8722;0.220 and  #8722;0.459 across alternative specifications. The long-run minimum wage elasticities for the tenth and fifteenth unconditional quantiles of family income range between 0.152 and 0.430 depending on specification. A reduction in public assistance partly offsets these income gains, which are on average 66 percent as large when using an expanded income definition including tax credits and noncash transfers.

    <TEXT>*How did they lose their trustworthiness?* [How:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks#Promotion_of_conspiracy_theories)  gt; WikiLeaks has promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich.[272][273][274] Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right-wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich was the source of leaked emails and was killed for working with WikiLeaks.[275] WikiLeaks fueled the conspiracy theories when it offered a $20,000 reward for information on Rich's killer and when Assange implied that Rich was the source of the DNC leaks.[276] No evidence supports the claim that Rich was the source of the leaks.[277][278] Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange "implied falsely" that Rich was the source in order to obscure that Russia was the actual source.[279][280][281][282] The Guardian wrote that WikiLeaks, along with individuals and groups on the hard right, had been involved in the "ruthless exploitation of [Rich's] death for political purposes".[283] The executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of WikiLeaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich: "If they feel like they have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it. The insinuations, to me, are just disgusting."[284]  gt; WikiLeaks has popularized conspiracies about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting articles which suggested Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals,[31][285][286] implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed,[32] claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange,[287] suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews,[288] promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health,[33][289][290] and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump #8211;related Internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper Laura Silsby.[291]  gt; WikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks.[335][336] Media outlets have also been criticized for uncritically repeating WikiLeaks' misleading claims about its leaks.[335] According to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, this is part of a pattern of behaviour.[335] According to Tufekci, there are three steps to WikiLeaks' "disinformation campaigns": "The first step is to dump many documents at once  #8212; rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting."[335]  gt; After the 2016 Turkish coup d' #233;tat attempt, WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative Justice and Development Party. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the Turkish government's crackdown on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt.[204] When these e-mails were released, however, it "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks."[335]  gt; WikiLeaks has published individuals' Social Security numbers, medical information, and credit card numbers.[44] An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published "the personal information of hundreds of people  #8211; including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients".[44] WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia.[44] Some of WikiLeaks' cables "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees".[44] An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables  #8211; including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C."[44] Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' release of their Social Security and credit card information.[44] In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.[337][338]</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; An institutional feature of the lender #8217;s underwriting process then allows statistical identification of the impact of payday loans on bankruptcy from a regression discontinuity. Payday loan applications are approved if the applicant #8217;s credit score exceeds a fixed threshold. Regression discontinuity analyses rely on unobservable characteristics not changing discontinuously at the threshold. **With this standard identifying assumption, differences in bankruptcy rates between barely approved and barely rejected applicants can be attributed to the causal impact of payday loan access.**</TEXT>

This is not a "report" produced by NBER, so the suggestion that this being a NBER working paper means it's "fossil fuel lobby astroturfing" is dumb. Also, the notion that NBER is [fossil fuel propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/cgatvf/nber_paper_the_annual_cost_of_replacing_all/) is idiotic in the extreme.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Those that say illegal aliens don't take jobs are, in my opinion, misinformed. That would be the academic literature on the economic effects of illegal immigration, which does not substantiate that undocumented immigrants and other low-skilled immigrant labor have substantial adverse effects on the average American or low-skilled Americans. The effects on the average American are positive while the effects on low-skilled Americans are largely non-existent. The argument that you're specifically making is known as the [lump of labor fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy). Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). Studies do not substantiate that border enforcement and restrictions on immigration boost economic outcomes for low-skilled natives ([7](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/003465302317331937), [8](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26536)). Of particular relevance is a recent study in the top econ journal that found that the Bracero program (which allowed half a million Mexican workers to do seasonal farm labor in the United States) had no impact on the labor market outcomes of American-born farm workers ([10](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20170765)). The article you posted even says:  gt; A 2016 study on the effects of immigration on the US economy found that immigration had  #8220;little long run effect #8221; on US wages. That's the only research referenced in the article. The article appears to refer to the comprehensive 2016 National Academy of Science review of the immigration literature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; For every 1 job at an employer that an illegal alien has, that is 1 job that an american does not have. It's that simple. This is the lump of labor fallacy. Your understanding of the economy is so narrow that you can only see someone taking a job (which you believe are finite), rather than fulfilling a need in a sector, purchasing goods and paying taxes, thus stimulating more economic activity. For example, it may be the case that the manufacturing industries that primarily rely on low-wage labor will in the absence of undocumented labor simply offshore or close their business, thus leading to lost labor opportunities for the natives who in some way benefit on the company's existence (one can find countless anecdotes about this occurring). Or that the presence of low-skilled foreign labor gives low-skilled natives opportunities to upgrade their job (for example, by being in charge of a crew, rather than part of the crew). That is what the research, which you either misinterpreted or ignored and which the readers of this subreddit downvoted, says: * [Foged, Mette; Peri, Giovanni (2016).

As for tax fraud, there is nothing to suggest that illegal immigrants are a drain on public coffers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Parking reforms in Seattle led to an estimated construction cost savings of more than $537 million over the first five years, which likely benefited both housing developers and consumers. Reducing parking requirements allowed developers to forego some construction costs, along with the opportunity cost of using valuable urban land for parking, rather than housing or commercial uses... There is good evidence from past scholarship that housing with less parking also costs less for buyers and renters. Many of these new Seattle housing units would have been more expensive had they included more parking. Additionally, if less parking led to more housing production, the additional housing supply may have helped to temper rising prices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Here](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/29/21065620/broockman-kalla-deep-canvassing)'s a write-up in Vox. Abstract:  gt;Exclusionary attitudes #8212;prejudice toward outgroups and opposition to policies that promote their well-being #8212;are presenting challenges to democratic societies worldwide. Drawing on insights from psychology, we argue that non-judgmentally exchanging narratives in interpersonal conversations can facilitate durable reductions in exclusionary attitudes. We support this argument with evidence from three pre-registered field experiments targeting exclusionary attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters #8217; exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04). Non-judgmentally exchanging narratives can help overcome the resistance to persuasion often encountered in discussions of these contentious topics. Related: **Research on illegal immigration and immigration enforcement:** * **Crime:** All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). * **Economy:** Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary,it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)). * **Health:** Studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)). So, in short, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants does not just impose horrendous harms on the migrants (and what is in many cases their US-born children), but is bad for everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a great piece that addresses lots of problems in how folks try to interpret and understanding Trump. In particular, attempts by people to infer some strategic logic and deliberation in whatever foreign policy decisions that Trump makes. There is none, and there is no consistency at all in what he does. I remember arguing with people on this subreddit when he was a candidate in 2016 about him purportedly being a "dove" and holding non-interventionist principles when he very obviously did not hold any consistent non-interventionist views. In fact, he had both supported and opposed every major US intervention over the last twenty years. His views on Iraq and Libya exemplify just how erratic and dumb his views are: he supported interventions and invasions when they were popular and when the media hyped them up, but then opposed them when the interventions turned unpopular. He's a dumb racist conspiracy theorist with a fragile ego and thin grasp on reality who has very weak capacity to learn and study, and is very easily swayed by whatever thing he was told five minutes ago by anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Summary of the Trump administration's record on the environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump#Environment). Highligts: * By December 2019, the administration had overturned or was in process of rolling back 78 environmental regulations.[323] * In June 2018, David Cutler and Francesca Dominici of Harvard University estimated conservatively that the Trump administration's modifications to environmental rules could result in more than 80,000 additional U.S. deaths and widespread respiratory ailments.[329] * In August 2018, the administration's own analysis showed that the loosening of coal plant rules could cause up to 1,400 premature deaths and 15,000 new cases of respiratory problems.[330] * From 2016 to 2018, air pollution increased by 5.5%, reversing a seven-year trend where air pollution had declined by 25%.[331] * Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement * Rollback of Obama's Clean Power Plan. * The administration has repeatedly sought to reduce the budget for the EPA.[342] The administration invalidated the Stream Protection Rule (which prevented coal mining debris from being dumped into streams, groundwater and surface waters),[343] regulations which limited dumping of toxic wastewater containing metals, such as arsenic and mercury, into public waterways,[344] regulations on coal ash (carcinogenic leftover waste produced by coal plants),[345] and an Obama-era executive order on protections for oceans, coastlines and lakes which was enacted after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[346] The administration rolled back major Clean Water Act protections. Studies by the Obama-era EPA suggest that up to two-thirds of California's inland freshwater streams would lose protections under the rule change.[347] The EPA sought to repeal a regulation which required oil and gas companies to restrict emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.[348] The EPA granted a loophole allowing a small set of trucking companies to skirt emissions rules and produce trucks that emit 40 to 55 times the air pollutants of other new trucks.[349] The EPA rejected a ban on the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos; a federal court ordered the EPA to ban the pesticide, because the EPA's own staff had recommended banning it due to extensive research showing adverse health effects on children.[328] The administration scaled back the ban on the use of methylene chloride, a lethal chemical.[350] The EPA lifted a rule requiring major farms to report pollution emitted through animal waste.[351] * The administration suspended a number of large research programs, such as a $1 million National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study on the public health effects of mountaintop removal coal-mining,[352] a $580,000 NAS study intended to make offshore drilling safer,[353] a multimillion-dollar program that distributed grants for research the effects of chemical exposure on children,[354] a project on the effects of chemicals on pregnant women,[355] and $10-million-a-year research line for NASA's Carbon Monitoring System.[356] The administration unsuccessfully sought to kill aspects of NASA's climate science program.[356] * The EPA expedited the process for approving new chemicals and made the process of evaluating the safety of those chemicals less stringent; EPA scientists expressed concerns that the agency's ability to stop hazardous chemicals was being compromised.[357][358] Internal emails showed that Pruitt aides prevented the publication of a health study showing some toxic chemicals endanger humans at far lower levels than the EPA previously characterized as safe.[359] One such chemical was present in high quantities around a number of military bases, including groundwater.[359] The non-disclosure of the study and the delay in public knowledge of the findings may have prevented the government from updating the infrastructure at the bases and individuals who lived near the bases to avoid the tap water.[359] * The administration weakened enforcement the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to start mining, drilling and construction projects in areas with endangered and threatened species.[360][361] The administration has actively discouraged local governments and businesses from undertaking preservation efforts.[361] The administration sharply reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah by approximately two million acres, making it the largest reduction of public land protections in American history.[362] Shortly afterwards, Interior Secretary Zinke advocated for downsizing four additional national monuments and changing the way six additional monuments were managed.[363] In 2019, the administration sped up the process for environmental reviews for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic; experts said the speeding up made reviews less comprehensive and reliable.[364] According to Politico, the administration sped up the process in the event that a Democratic administration was elected in 2020, which would have halted new oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[364] The administration sought to open up more than 180,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the largest in the country, for logging.[365] But both parties are the same and elections do not matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Paul K. MacDonald and Joseph M. Parent in *Foreign Affairs* ("Trump Didn #8217;t Shrink U.S. Military Commitments Abroad #8212;He Expanded Them The President #8217;s False Promise of Retrenchment")](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-12-03/trump-didnt-shrink-us-military-commitments-abroad-he-expanded-them):  gt;**The clearest measure of Trump #8217;s retrenchment efforts, or lack thereof, is foreign troop deployments. In the final months of Obama #8217;s presidency, approximately 198,000 active duty U.S. military personnel were deployed overseas, according to the Pentagon #8217;s Defense Manpower Data Center. By comparison, the most recent figure for the Trump administration is 174,000 active duty troops. But even that difference reflects an accounting trick. Beginning in December 2017, the Defense Department started excluding troops deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria from its official reports, citing a vague need to  #8220;protect our forces. #8221; When the estimated troop levels for those three countries are added back in, the current total is around 194,000 #8212;roughly equivalent to the number Trump inherited.**  gt; The main reason Trump has failed to reduce overseas troop levels is that every time he announces a drawdown he reverses himself. Consider Afghanistan. Prior to his election, Trump repeatedly called the war in Afghanistan a  #8220;terrible mistake #8221; and declared that it was  #8220;time to come home! #8221; But once in office, Trump increased the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan by around 50 percent. The Pentagon has since withdrawn some troops, but roughly 12,500 troops remain in Afghanistan, up from about 8,500 when Trump took office.  gt; A similar story played out in northern Syria, from which Trump ordered the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops in December 2018.  #8220;We have won against ISIS, #8221; he claimed in a video released on Twitter.  #8220;Our boys, our young women, our men #8212;they #8217;re all coming back. #8221; But after military officials and members of Congress pushed back and several administration officials resigned, Trump shifted gears and agreed to keep about half of the roughly 2,000 troops deployed to northern Syria in place. In October, the president announced that he would withdraw the remaining 1,000 troops, paving the way for a Turkish invasion of northern Syria and an assault on the United States #8217; Kurdish allies. But once again, Pentagon officials prevailed on the president to leave close to 90 percent of the troops behind to guard nearby oil fields. The remainder will be redeployed in the region instead of coming home.  gt; One place where Trump has successfully pressed for troop reductions is Africa. The Pentagon announced the phased withdrawal of hundreds of U.S. troops from that continent beginning in 2018. But the U.S. military footprint in Africa was relatively small to begin with, at roughly 7,200 troops, and because counterterrorism operations remain active in West Africa, military commanders have recommended slashing the proposed reductions by half.  gt; Moreover, Trump has stumbled into new military commitments in the Middle East and Europe. In response to rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, he authorized the deployment of some 14,000 additional troops to the Persian Gulf, including around 3,500 to protect Saudi oil facilities. Trump also agreed to expand the U.S. military presence in Poland with an additional 1,000 troops, and his administration is in talks to build a permanent military base there in the future.

    <TEXT> gt; We can also quantify the number of masked instances of racially discriminatory uses of force as a percentage of all uses of force against minorities, displayed in Figure 5. In the period we examine, black and Hispanic civilians experienced force at the hands of police 779,894 times. Using the approach in Fryer (2019), one would conclude that about 10% would not have occurred had those civilians been white. **Using our bias-corrected approach, we find that in fact 39% were discriminatory**. These underestimates persist across all force threshold analyses.

In terms of other relevant research, the book *How Democracies Die* by Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt is relevant. The two central norms that have helped to preserve US democracy are "mutual toleration" (competing parties accept each other as legit rivals) and "forbearance" (politicians showing restraint in terms of using institutions for maximum partisan advantage when they are in power). Those two norms have been seriously undermined in the last three decades. Unlike the study in OP which focuses on the public, Levitsky and Ziblatt focus primarily on elites, with a particular focus on the role of the Republican Party in contributing towards democratic erosion in the US. Key events include Newt Gingrich's House Speakership, Mitch McConnell's leadership in the Senate and ultimately the Republican Party's decision to lend its full support behind Trump even though he was grotesquely unfit for office and showed all the warning signs of authoritarianism. Would-be authoritarians: * Reject the democratic rules of the game (in actions or words) * Deny the legitimacy of opponents * Tolerate or encourage violence against the opposition * Indicate a willingness to curtail the civil liberties of opponents and the media Throughout US history and across many other countries, authoritarian figures have cropped up. However, responsible elites have exercised "gatekeeping" to keep these figures out (even at a political cost to themselves). Levitsky and Ziblatt title one of their chapters, The Great Republican Abdication, in reference to the party throwing its support behind Trump. At the same time, conservatives in France acted responsibly and refused to support the far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen when she faced off with Macron.

    <TEXT>Hi, you clearly did not read the paper, and I'm at a loss why you feel the need to misrepresent it. The study uses a natural experiment to draw causal inferences. Here's a tl;dr:  gt; In this paper, we use a natural experiment to study the effects of a sudden and important shock to the social lives of youth on their subsequent partisan identities in adulthood. In 2002, CharlotteMecklenburg Schools (CMS) ended race-based busing and redrew existing school boundaries. This reform generated large changes in the racial composition of schools. Motivated by a large literature on how exposure and contact with racial out-groups can shape attitudes (Key, 1949; Allport, 1954) and work on the link between racial attitudes and political affiliation (Sears and Kinder, 1971), we ask whether this change to racial context in childhood can affect one #8217;s political party affiliation more than a decade later in life.  gt;To identify causal impacts, we compare students who lived in the same neighborhoods and had pre-reform addresses that placed them on different sides of a newly-drawn school boundary. Our approach follows prior work studying schooling and arrest outcomes in this context (Billings et al., 2014) and estimates the effect of being assigned to a school with a higher share of minority students after conditioning on fixed effects for small geographic areas (i.e., Census block groups). This approach reveals causal effects if children on either side of the new boundary are similar prior to the redrawing. Institutional features of our setting support the plausibility of this assumption, and we provide statistical evidence showing no evidence of systematic sorting within neighborhoods based on the new school boundaries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is great news. Note though that there are many LGBT rights still on the line and that the 2020 election matters in terms of LGBT rights. After having falsely claimed that he'd be better for LGBT rights during the 2016 election campaign, [Trump has rolled back a large number of LGBT protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump#LGBT_rights):  gt;The administration rolled back numerous LGBT protections, in particular those implemented during the Obama administration, covering issues such as health care, education, employment, housing, military, and criminal justice, as well as foster care and adoption.[536][537][538][539][540] The administration sought to rescind rules prohibiting adoption and foster care agencies funded by the government from discriminating against LGBT adoption and foster parents.[538] The DOJ reversed its position on whether the Civil Rights Act's workplace protections covered LGBT individuals, and the DOJ argued in state and federal courts for a constitutional right for businesses to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.[538] The administration exempted government contractors from following federal workplace discrimination rules, as long as they could cite religious reasons for doing so.[538]  gt; The administration rescinded a directive that public schools treat students according to their gender identity.[538] The administration rescinded a federal policy that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, and dropped a lawsuit against North Carolina's "bathroom bill".[541] The administration rescinded rules that prohibited discrimination against LGBT patients by health care providers.[538][542] Rules were rescinded to give transgender homeless people equal access to homeless shelters, and to house transgender prison inmates according to their gender identity "when appropriate".[538] HHS stopped collecting information on LGBT participants in its national survey of older adults,[543] and the Census Bureau removed "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" as proposed subjects for possible inclusion on the Decennial Census and/or American Community Survey.[543] The DOJ and the Labor Department cancelled quarterly conference calls with LGBT organizations.[543]  gt; Trump said he would not allow "transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military", citing disruptions and medical costs.[538] In March 2018, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to prohibit transgender persons, whether transitioned or not, with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria from military service, except for individuals who have had 36 consecutive months of stability "in their biological sex prior to accession" and currently serving transgender persons in military service. Studies of countries that had allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military found "little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness",[544] and studies showed that the medical costs for transgender service members would be "minimal".[545] Just a few days ago, the Trump administration [rolled back a protection against transgender discrimination by health care providers.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/health/trump-health-care-transgender-rights.html) And it goes with saying that this Supreme Court decision is a defeat for the Trump administration, which had argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (that bars discrimination based on sex) did not extend to claims of gender identity and sexual orientation. This is not solely a Trump issue, but a [Republican Party issue](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/1272551518663847936):  gt; On the 2019 House vote to update the 1964 Civil Rights act to explicitly protect LGBT individuals, just 4% of House Republicans joined every Democrat in support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The more appropriate analogy would be if Biden supporters were hypocritically arguing that it's fine for him to hold rallies while they argue that it's not for Trump. Has that happened? There's a a difference between civil rights protests to deal with endemic civil rights problems in the country on the one hand and holding campaign rallies on the other hand. The absence of the former would prevent accountability and solutions to widespread problems (it's incredibly hard to overcome collective action problems without a spark  #8211; which is why the US is so backwards in terms of policing). The absence of the latter would have absolutely no impact on anything and are not necessary or essential in any sense. It goes without saying that both will worsen the coronavirus pandemic (no one has claimed otherwise). It was also entirely feasible to participate in the George Floyd protests in a socially distant manner (I'm not sure the same is possible when packing people into arenas).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Saying a Trump rally is dangerous but a protest by the thousands is not is disingenuous to everyone and sets a terrible example for the younger generation. This is a strawman. No one has disputed that the public gatherings will worsen the covid pandemic. There's a difference between a civil rights protest (which are temporally contingent on sparks to overcome collective action problems) and campaign rallies. If the George Floyd protests had been quelled, then absolutely nothing would have been done in terms of policing reform in the country and the cops who killed him may even not had to face justice. The "hypocrisy" analogy you're looking for is supporters of Biden arguing that it's OK for Biden to hold rallies while they argue it isn't for Trump. That's something that hasn't happened. If anything, I'm pretty sure Biden supporters would be pissed if he were to hold a rally under these circumstances.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A summary can be found [here](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2020/06/15.html). EDIT: In case the title of the submission isn't clear: * Child access prevention are associated with FEWER firearm deaths * Right-to-carry laws are associated with MORE firearm deaths * Stand-your-ground laws are associated with MORE firearm deaths States that have a combination of CAP with the absence of RTC and SYG are estimated to have 11% fewer firearm deaths than states that do not have CAP but have RTC and SYG. This is the abstract:  gt;We evaluated the effects on total firearm-related deaths of three classes of gun laws: child access prevention (CAP), right-to-carry (RTC), and stand your ground (SYG) laws. The analyses exploit changes in these state-level policies from 1970 to 2016, using Bayesian methods and a modeling approach that addresses several methodological limitations of prior gun policy evaluations. CAP laws showed the strongest evidence of an association with firearm-related death rate, with a probability of 0.97 that the death rate declined at 6 y after implementation. In contrast, the probability of being associated with an increase in firearm-related deaths was 0.87 for RTC laws and 0.77 for SYG laws. The joint effects of these laws indicate that the restrictive gun policy regime (having a CAP law without an RTC or SYG law) has a 0.98 probability of being associated with a reduction in firearm-related deaths relative to the permissive policy regime. This estimated effect corresponds to an 11% reduction in firearm-related deaths relative to the permissive legal regime. Our findings suggest that a small but meaningful decrease in firearm-related deaths may be associated with the implementation of more restrictive gun policies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Study in Science](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/9/eaap9519):  gt;Many European countries impose employment bans that prevent asylum seekers from entering the local labor market for a certain waiting period upon arrival. We provide evidence on the long-term effects of these employment bans on the subsequent economic integration of refugees. We leverage a natural experiment in Germany, where a court ruling prompted a reduction in the length of the employment ban. **We find that, 5 years after the waiting period was reduced, employment rates were about 20 percentage points lower for refugees who, upon arrival, had to wait for an additional 7 months before they were allowed to enter the labor market. It took up to 10 years for this employment gap to disappear. Our findings suggest that longer employment bans considerably slowed down the economic integration of refugees and reduced their motivation to integrate early on after arrival.** A marginal social cost analysis for the study sample suggests that this employment ban cost German taxpayers about 40 million euros per year, on average, in terms of welfare expenditures and foregone tax revenues from unemployed refugees.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Ungated version](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/19rptaxinghiddenwealth.pdf). The enforcement initiatives in question:  gt; beginning in 2008 the U.S. government conducted a series of enforcement initiatives aimed at offshore accounts of its citizens. First, it compelled a number of tax havens to accept information exchange agreements under which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can request account information about U.S. taxpayers suspected of tax evasion. Second, it took ad hoc legal measures to force major Swiss banks, most famously the world #8217;s biggest private bank, UBS, to turn over names and account details of many of their U.S. customers. Finally, complementing the measures aiming to facilitate detection of undeclared offshore income, it established a series of programs under which cooperating U.S. taxpayers who voluntarily disclose their previously unreported offshore accounts and the taxable income they generate are subject to reduced penalties and avoid criminal sanctions. Many countries have pursued very similar policies, combining crossborder exchange of banking information and incentives to self-declare foreign assets.</TEXT>

There is also general agreement among economists that if Trump succeeds in putting lunatics (e.g. [Judy Shelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Shelton), [Stephen Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Moore_(writer)) on the Federal Reserve, it poses a threat to the US economy.

    <TEXT> gt; Together such feedback loops are leading the Republican party to focus on catering for extremists and plutocrats rather than redefining itself to attract new constituencies. The Republican party could have attracted Latinos, if its commitments to the political extremes, and to its plutocratic funders had not made it effectively impossible to do so. The fundamental problem of the Republican party is that its electoral strategy, policy commitments and core support are both mutually supportive and politically pathological  #8211; they mean that its response to the Conservative Dilemma will become increasingly ineffective over time. The economic agenda of the Republican party is becoming ever more unattractive to voters, and ever more difficult to push through by using fear and outrage as a mobilizing strategy.  gt; This suggests that the Republican party can move in one of two directions. Either it can redefine itself so as to respond to the demands of a democratic system, that requires it to assemble majorities to get elected. This would require it to escape the trap, and begin figuring out how to appeal to voters in non-pathological ways. Alternatively, it can look to redefine the democratic system so as to better match the internal demands of its own internal coalition of plutocrats and rabble-rousers, by making it harder for majorities to displace Republican politicians. Hacker and Pierson emphasize that this doesn #8217;t necessarily require a lapse into dictatorship  #8211; the existing Republican enthusiasm for countermajoritarianism through gerrymandering, making voting harder, court restrictions on reform and the like  #8211; can deliver plenty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Together such feedback loops are leading the Republican party to focus on catering for extremists and plutocrats rather than redefining itself to attract new constituencies. The Republican party could have attracted Latinos, if its commitments to the political extremes, and to its plutocratic funders had not made it effectively impossible to do so. The fundamental problem of the Republican party is that its electoral strategy, policy commitments and core support are both mutually supportive and politically pathological  #8211; they mean that its response to the Conservative Dilemma will become increasingly ineffective over time. The economic agenda of the Republican party is becoming ever more unattractive to voters, and ever more difficult to push through by using fear and outrage as a mobilizing strategy.  gt; This suggests that the Republican party can move in one of two directions. Either it can redefine itself so as to respond to the demands of a democratic system, that requires it to assemble majorities to get elected. This would require it to escape the trap, and begin figuring out how to appeal to voters in non-pathological ways. Alternatively, it can look to redefine the democratic system so as to better match the internal demands of its own internal coalition of plutocrats and rabble-rousers, by making it harder for majorities to displace Republican politicians. Hacker and Pierson emphasize that this doesn #8217;t necessarily require a lapse into dictatorship  #8211; the existing Republican enthusiasm for countermajoritarianism through gerrymandering, making voting harder, court restrictions on reform and the like  #8211; can deliver plenty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There are winners and losers. The owners of capital win through lower wages, and low skilled workers lose through increased competition. Per every single credible estimate (even from immigration-skeptical academics like George Borjas), the average American benefits economically from increased immigration (whether low-skilled or high-skilled). As for the impact of low-skilled immigration on low-skilled natives, the research is mixed but all of it indicates that the impact (whether positive, negative or nonexistent) is small. So the winners are: the average native and the migrants themselves (the relaxation of restrictions on migration is the single most effective poverty reduction tool). The losers are: some low-skilled natives, maybe. Proponents of restrictive migration policies want to condemn a large part of the planet to poverty and to harm the average native just to -maybe- provide minuscule benefits to low-skilled natives. If neoliberals got their way on immigration and would be able to relax restrictions on migration, it would [lift more people out of poverty than the best available poverty reduction programs](https://oxfordre.com/economics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-353). I'd take that "neoliberal failure".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Judging by the short summary, the book in OP seems more to be about structural conditions that make democratic backsliding more likely (I haven't read it though). *How Democracies Die* was in my view more about party elites and their agency. Party elites have the choice of throwing in lot with the rising authoritarians or undermining the rising authoritarians. In the last few decades, party elites in the Republican Party took active steps to undermine democracy (e.g. Gingrich's House speakership, McConnell) before ultimately wholeheartedly supporting a would-be authoritarian. In past eras, party elites in both the Dem Party and Rep Party excised extremist elements (e.g. Henry Ford's presidential run) and constrained authoritarian action (e.g. Roosevelt's courtpacking scheme), per the book.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; The lockdown response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic and transport activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations, using satellite data and a network of  gt;10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find declines in the population-weighted concentration of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 60% with 95% CI 48 to 72%), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: 31%; 95% CI: 17 to 45%), with marginal increases in ozone (O3: 4%; 95% CI:  #8722;2 to 10%) in 34 countries during lockdown dates up until 15 May. Except for ozone, satellite measurements of the troposphere indicate much smaller reductions, highlighting the spatial variability of pollutant anomalies attributable to complex NOx chemistry and long-distance transport of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5  #181;m (PM2.5). By leveraging Google and Apple mobility data, we find empirical evidence for a link between global vehicle transportation declines and the reduction of ambient NO2 exposure. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings allude to the potential for mitigating public health risk by reducing  #8220;business as usual #8221; air pollutant emissions from economic activities.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; In the United States, hospitals and physicians independently negotiate contracts with insurers. Therefore, a privately insured individual can be treated at an in-network hospital #8217;s emergency department but receive a large unexpected bill from an out-of-network emergency physician working at that facility. Because patients do not choose their emergency physician, emergency physicians can remain out of network and charge high prices without losing patient volume. We illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians #8217; bargaining power with insurers. We conclude by analyzing New York #8217;s efforts to address out-of-network billing through binding arbitration between physicians and insurers over out-of-network payments. This intervention reduced out-of-network billing by 12.8 percentage points (88%).

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt;We study the political consequences of lifting restrictions on the funding of groups engaging in outside spending (e.g., independent political advertising) in elections. Theoretically, we assume that outside spending changes the salience of candidate-specific attributes relative to their party labels. Empirically, we employ a difference-in-differences design that exploits the removal of state-level restrictions on the funding of outside spending mandated by the federal-level rulings in both Citizens United and SpeechNow.org v. FEC. We find strong evidence that these regulatory changes increase the electoral success of Republican candidates, thereby leading to more ideologically conservative legislatures. We find no effect on polarization. Consistent with our theory, the size of our estimated effects depends on the power of labor unions and the alignment of business interests with the Republican party.

Not only does Reddit see inter-subreddit conflicts, as different communities disagree with one another (Datta and Adar 2019), but it also hosts intra-subreddit contestation as well, as communities negotiate between different perspectives on the interests they share (Buyukozturk, Gaulden, and Dowd-Arrow 2018; Leavitt and Clark 2014). The result is a dynamic, digital Great Community, where over time individual subreddits shift and change both membership and emphasis (Habib et al. 2019) and Redditors diversify their interests, posting in a greater number and variety of subreddits the longer they are users of the site (Tan and Lee 2015).  gt; Unlike Facebook, then, which creates conditions under which publics are atomized and rendered particularly susceptible to suggestions from propagandists, Reddit #8217;s design facilitates #8212; even encourages #8212;the kind of  #8220;interpenetration of populations #8221; which Lasswell argued protect publics from the manipulative effects of propaganda. As a result, Reddit, unlike Facebook, can and does host subreddits that, for example, engage in  #8220;constructive, public discourse about the practices of democratic institutions #8221; (Buozis 2019, 358), share, discuss, and contextualize news and information regarding current events (Gui et al. 2018; Leavitt and Clark 2014), and support citizen journalism projects characterized by  #8220;nuanced, comprehensive debate and coverage #8221; (Mitchell and Lim 2018, 414). Rather than remain in echo chambers, subject to filter bubbles and closed communities, Reddit #8217;s design facilitates the kind of critical, diverse, and collaborative engagement with information that Dewey argued we would see from democratically organized publics.  gt; Yet there are, of course, subreddits that do not facilitate the kind of self-correcting inquiry that marks democratic politics. Reddit often makes headlines for the conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns that are generated and spread by communities such as r/conspiracy, r/redpill, r/the_donald, and, famously, r/pizzagate. While these subreddits are a small subset of the overall Reddit ecosystem, they account for the majority of  #8220;alternative news sources #8221; shared on the site (Zannettou et al. 2017). In these subreddits, moreover, we see dynamics like those of the Facebook anti-vaxxer Groups, where long-time members of these communities  #8220;show signs of radicalization through their increased #8212;and increasingly exclusive #8212;engagement with the conspiracy theory community #8221; (Samory and Mitra 2018, 348). Because these subreddits restrict, or often ban, users and information which might contradict or expand their stated purpose, the longtime members of these sites end up generating the dogmatic approach to their shared interests that we see in Facebook #8217;s anti-vaxxer Groups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This study is broadly consistent with the existing literature on immigration which shows that the impact of immigration enforcement is to shrink the US economy without any clear rewards for any Americans. **Research on illegal immigration and immigration enforcement:** * **Crime:** All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime). * **Economy:** Studies show that undocumented immigrants are good for the economy and the average American ([1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00148-007-0182-3), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001600?via%3Dihub), [3](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/38v6c3b3), [4](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22834), [5](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25074), [6](https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EconomicEffectsCitizenship-6.pdf)). A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary,it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)). * **Health:** Studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)). So, in short, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants does not just impose horrendous harms on the migrants (and what is in many cases their US-born children), but is bad for everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Researchers have increasingly paid attention to the impact that the administrative component of elections has on voter behavior. Existing research has focused almost exclusively on the effect that legal changes--such as voter identification laws--have on turnout. This paper extends our understanding of the electoral process by exploring how one aspect of the precinct experience--standing in line to vote--can shape the turnout behavior of voters in subsequent elections. I demonstrate that for every additional hour a voter waits in line to vote, their probability of voting in the subsequent election drops by 1 percentage point. To arrive at these estimates, I analyze vote history files using a combination of exact matching and placebo tests to test the identification assumptions. I then leverage an unusual institutional arrangement in the City of Boston and longitudinal data from Florida to show that the result also holds at the precinct level. The findings in this paper have important policy implications for administrative changes that may impact line length, such as voter identification requirements and precinct consolidation. They also suggest that racial asymmetries in precinct wait times contribute to the gap in turnout rates between white and non-white voters. Some content from the body:  gt; The analyses in this paper provide consistent evidence that longer lines diminish voter turnout in future elections. The magnitude of the individual-level effect is roughly 1 percentage point for every additional hour of waiting. Given the literature on turnout, which has found that it is very difficult to change a person's probability of turning out by more than 4 or 5 percentage points (Gerber et al., 2008; Green et al., 2003), a difference of 1 percentage point for the millions of voters who waited at least an hour in 2012 is consequential.  gt; To estimate just how consequential, I used the results from Model 1 in Table 1 to estimate the 2014 turnout probability for every 2012 in-person voter in 1% sample of the Catalist data, based on their observed covariates and their ZIP code average wait. I then estimated their probability of turning out if they had lived in an area where there were no lines to vote. The difference between these two numbers is the expected change in turnout probability for a particular voter. Fig. 6 shows how these results vary by race. Of the roughly 107 million in-person voters in 2012, 192,100 (SE: 36,332) did not vote in 2014 as a result of waiting to vote in 2012. Given that midterms tend to be low-turnout affairs, a subtraction of 192,000 voters is not a meaningless one. This is especially true in close elections like in Arizona's 2nd congressional district, which was won by a margin of 121 votes in 2014 (out of over 220,000 cast). In that district alone, the model suggests about 258 (SE: 56.4) people did not vote as a result of lines in 2012. This is not to suggest that long lines determined the outcome of this election, only that there is a realistic potential that poor management at polling places could have an impact on election results in close races.  gt; We must also consider that minority voters are more likely to be burdened by long lines at the precinct. When voter drop-off is broken down by race, I find that the effect of lines on minority voters is disproportionate to their makeup of the electorate. While African-Americans comprised about 9.7% of the electorate in 2014, they made up 22.0% of voters turned off from voting due to 2012 lines. Similarly, 5.1% of 2014 voters were Hispanic, but 9.7% of depressed turnout came from this group. An implication of this finding is that long lines disproportionately depress turnout among African-Americans, when compared to white voters. If voters no longer had to wait in line, we would expect, in the long run, that turnout rates would increase more in Black and minority neighborhoods than in White neighborhoods. If the article in OP doesn't work, an ungated version is [available on the author's website](https://www.stephenpettigrew.com/articles/pettigrew-lines-and-turnout-es.pdf).</TEXT>

This study analyzes Prop 209's impact on student outcomes using a difference-in-difference research design and a newly-constructed longitudinal database linking all 1994-2002 University of California applicants to their college enrollment, course performance, major choice, degree attainment, and wages into their mid-30s. Ending affirmative action caused UC's 10,000 annual underrepresented minority (URM) freshman applicants to cascade into lower-quality public and private universities. URM applicants' undergraduate and graduate degree attainment declined overall and in STEM fields, especially among lower-testing applicants. As a result, the average URM UC applicant's wages declined by five percent annually between ages 24 and 34, almost wholly driven by declines among Hispanic applicants. By the mid-2010s, Prop 209 had caused a cumulative decline in the number of early-career URM Californians earning over $100,000 by at least three percent. Prop 209 also deterred thousands of qualified URM students from applying to any UC campus. Enrolling at less-selective UC campuses did not improve URM students' performance or persistence in STEM course sequences. Complementary regression discontinuity and institutional value-added analyses suggest that affirmative action's net wage benefits for URM applicants exceed its (potentially small) net costs for on-the-margin white and Asian applicants. These findings are inconsistent with the university  #8220;Mismatch Hypothesis #8221; and provide the first causal evidence that banning affirmative action exacerbates socioeconomic inequities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; In recent years, scholars have argued that protests that employ nonviolent tactics attract greater support and are therefore more likely to succeed than those that use violence. We argue that how protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective determination, but can be influenced in part by observer characteristics  #8211; in particular, by partisan identity. We conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the least disruptive. The findings have implications for theories of nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression, and the prospects for marginal groups to influence policy in polarized societies.

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; The contemporary practice of homeownership in the United States was born out of government programs adopted during the New Deal. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) #8212;and later the Federal Housing Administration and GI Bill #8212;expanded home buying opportunity, although in segregationist fashion. Through mechanisms such as redlining, these policies fueled white suburbanization and black ghettoization, while laying the foundation for the racial wealth gap. This is the first article to investigate the long-term consequences of these policies on the segregation of cities. I combine a full century of census data with archival data to show that cities HOLC appraised became more segregated than those it ignored. The gap emerged between 1930 and 1950 and remains significant: in 2010, the black-white dissimilarity, black isolation, and white-black information theory indices are 12, 16, and 8 points higher in appraised cities, respectively. Results are consistent across a range of robustness checks, including exploitation of imperfect implementation of appraisal guidelines and geographic spillover. These results contribute to current theoretical discussions about the persistence of segregation. The long-term impact of these policies is a reminder of the intentionality that shaped racial geography in the United States, and the scale of intervention that will be required to disrupt the persistence of segregation. The author talks about the paper in [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKLc1KPPpU). There is also a [related story in the NY Times today](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html) about redlining that may be of interest:  gt; The appraisers in Richmond were transparent in their racism as they mapped the city in the 1930s as part of a Depression-era federal program to rescue the nation #8217;s collapsing housing markets. Every Black neighborhood, no matter its income level, was outlined in red and deemed a  #8220;hazardous #8221; area for housing loans. The appraisers #8217; notes made clear that race was a key factor in giving these neighborhoods the lowest grade. One part of town was outlined in yellow and rated as  #8220;declining #8221; because, the appraisers wrote, Black families sometimes walked through. By contrast, white neighborhoods, described as containing  #8220;respectable people, #8221; were often outlined in blue and green and were subsequently favored for investment. Richmond, like many cities, was already segregated before the 1930s by racial zoning laws and restrictive covenants that barred Black families from moving into white neighborhoods. But the redlining maps, economists have found, deepened patterns of racial inequality in cities nationwide in ways that reverberated for decades. White families could more easily get loans and federal assistance to buy homes, building wealth to pass on to their children. Black families, all too often, could not. That inequity likely influenced urban heat patterns, too. Neighborhoods with white homeowners had more clout to lobby city governments for tree-lined sidewalks and parks. In Black neighborhoods, homeownership declined and landlords rarely invested in green space. City planners also targeted redlined areas as cheap land for new industries, highways, warehouses and public housing, built with lots of heat-absorbing asphalt and little cooling vegetation. Disparities in access to housing finance  #8220;created a snowball effect that compounded over generations, #8221; said Nathan Connolly, a historian at Johns Hopkins who helped digitize the maps. Redlining wasn #8217;t the only factor driving racial inequality, but the maps offer a visible symbol of how federal policies codified housing discrimination. Congress outlawed redlining by the 1970s. But the practice has left lasting marks on cities.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Economists have long been intrigued by an influential literature in psychology positing that monetary pay lowers performance on enjoyable tasks by crowding out agents' intrinsic interest in them. But typical experiments in this literature do not report a full set of performance metrics, which might reveal conflicting evidence on crowding out. Further, they may suffer from confounds. To evaluate these issues, we review over 100 prior tests and run a field experiment building on the canonical two-session test for crowding out wherein agents receive pay for an interesting activity in session one that is withdrawn unexpectedly in session two. We test whether pay harms performance using a comprehensive set of performance measures, and if so, whether unmet pay expectations might also contribute to this decline. Our results on output, productivity and quits are most consistent with a standard economics model than with a crowding out one. Additional, though more speculative, evidence suggests that unmet pay expectations may harm output quality. An older ungated version is available [here](https://spinup-000d1a-wp-offload-media.s3.amazonaws.com/faculty/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/Crowdingout-retaliation.pdf).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Abstract](https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/qje/qjaa027/5903299?redirectedFrom=fulltext):  gt; Nearly a thousand officer-involved killings occur each year in the United States. This paper documents the large, racially disparate impacts of these events on the educational and psychological well-being of Los Angeles public high school students. Exploiting hyperlocal variation in how close students live to a killing, I find that exposure to police violence leads to persistent decreases in GPA, increased incidence of emotional disturbance, and lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment. These effects are driven entirely by black and Hispanic students in response to police killings of other minorities and are largest for incidents involving unarmed individuals. [Ungated version](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ang/files/PoliceViolence_Ang.pdf). A Q  amp; A with the author can be found [here](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/gender-race-identity/hidden-trauma-police-killings).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-041916-021108  gt; Rational functionalist theories posit that institutional design reflects an optimal response to the functional and strategic problems that an institution seeks to solve.Distributive rationalist theories argue that institutional design is the by-product of purposive attempts by powerful actors to structure interactions in their favor. It matters whether we think of institutions as efficient solutions to a problem or as the means by which actors pursue their narrow self-interests at the expense of others. Historical institutionalist (HI) theories emphasize that past institutionalization and interdependence create new actors, interests, incentives, and constraints that influence future institutional design. World polity theories highlight that institutional design flows from the cultural, political, and social environment in which institutions operate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; We evaluate a randomized outreach study in which the IRS sent informational letters to 3.9 million households that paid a tax penalty for lacking health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Drawing on administrative data, we study the effect of this intervention on taxpayers subsequent health insurance enrollment and mortality. We find the intervention led to increased coverage during the subsequent two years and reduced mortality among middle-aged adults over the same time period. The results provide experimental evidence that health insurance coverage can reduce mortality in the United States.

    <TEXT>The topic has actually been studied. [Many voters believe that Trump is truly a self-made billionaire. When they are informed that he isn't (that his father gave him the money), they become less supportive of him.](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11109-019-09527-y?author_access_token=ir5Ssw_EXA1qr_flEOM5Wfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5916uJusQCNCIDKcfEl6KUFA-jZckmjhNr5V8K1K_AG1swAOzI3VADvB5AHVLSqKvfBD-_EBrZBon5Judwxkv7Uo9DgQyuBAvOe6zHkDnZ-w%3D%3D) The NY Times story is even worse than simply saying he inherited his wealth: he inherited it and **squandered it**. Abstract from the study:  gt;We examine the effect of biographical knowledge on voters #8217; assessments of leaders. Prior research has shown that voters infer traits from candidate characteristics such as race, gender and incumbency, which are visible to even poorly-informed voters. Given voters #8217; limited knowledge, we argue that less-visible attributes may be easily misperceived, possibly affecting overall assessments of candidates. Focusing on President Trump, we find via a national survey that many Americans are unaware that he was born into great wealth. This misperception increases support for Trump, mediated through beliefs that he is both empathetic and good at business. We supplement our observational analysis with an experiment treating respondents with information regarding the role Trump #8217;s father played in his career. This information leads respondents to rate the president more negatively on both empathy and business ability. These findings suggest that correcting information about candidate characteristics can change the minds of even loyal partisans.</TEXT>

First, clearly signaling extreme preferences (e.g., all-or-nothing demands for massive unilateral concessions to the US position) and/or a willingness to bear high costs to the point that it deviates from normal consequence-based decision-making (e.g., threats to start a war that will kill many people on both sides) is actually quite difficult. Target states often fail to receive the message a leader thinks he is sending. Second, even when other countries clearly receive a madman #8217;s message (or tweet), they often do not view it as credible for various reasons. Third, even when such demands and threats are deemed credible, they do not necessarily induce the desired behavior from the targeted country, because madmen have a hard time giving believable assurances of behaving in the future. In fact, madman tactics can backfire by making a leader appear impossible to placate and therefore making the target more likely to stand firm or even escalate.</TEXT>

First, clearly signaling extreme preferences (e.g., all-or-nothing demands for massive unilateral concessions to the US position) and/or a willingness to bear high costs to the point that it deviates from normal consequence-based decision-making (e.g., threats to start a war that will kill many people on both sides) is actually quite difficult.

In fact, madman tactics can backfire by making a leader appear impossible to placate and therefore making the target more likely to stand firm or even escalate. Looking back on discourse on this subreddit regarding Trump's foreign policy, the most annoying discourse was the one insisting that Donald Trump was a dove. There were two parts to this. One argued that his policy beliefs were avowedly non-interventionist (which was [false in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5s6x5r/trumps_isolationism_out_of_the_window_so_early/ddcw3w6/?context=3)) and that he would pursue retrenchment (which is [false today](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/iotdvo/reupping_this_amid_recent_lies_from_the_trump/)). The other part was that his erratic behavior was actually likely to induce peace and cooperation because of "madman theory", which was the geopolitics version of 5D chess. A flimsy justification for any and all behaviors by Trump. I think the piece linked above does a decent job delineating how weak the madman theory is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Abstract:  gt; Although widely used in policy debates, the literature on children #8217;s outcomes when raised by same-sex parents mostly relies on small selective samples or samples based on cross-sectional survey data. This has led to a lack of statistical power and the inability to distinguish children born to same-sex parents from children of separated parents. We address these issues by using unique administrative longitudinal data from the Netherlands, which was the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. These data include 2,971 children with same-sex parents (2,786 lesbian couples and 185 gay male couples) and over a million children with different-sex parents followed from birth. The results indicate that children raised by same-sex parents from birth perform better than children raised by different-sex parents in both primary and secondary education. Our findings are robust to use of cousin fixed effects and coarsened exact matching to improve covariate balance and to reduce model dependence. Further analyses using a novel bounding estimator suggest the selection on unobserved characteristics would have to be more than three times higher than the selection on observed characteristics to reduce the positive estimates to zero. [A large swath of the world prevents adoptions by same-sex couples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_adoption#Legal_status), purportedly because same-sex parents are unfit. In the United States, [the Trump administration is arguing in courts that taxpayer-funded adoption agencies should be allowed to discriminate against same-sex couples](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/adoption-agency-should-be-able-reject-gay-couples-trump-administration-n1224911), showing that LGBT rights are still heavily contested in the US. Next month, Texas Senator John Cornyn is up for re-election. [While he served on the Texas Supreme Court, he upheld a Texas law prohibiting "sodomy". While in Congress, he led the push for a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage, arguing that children raised by gay couples are "at higher risk of a host of social ills," such as crime, drug use and dropping out of school.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn#LGBT_rights)</TEXT>
