    <TEXT>So i wanna ask everyone here who has gone through it. i had a pretty bad relationship and been off for at least 6 months wanting to get back with my ex. i terribly failed no contact as i tried to reach her every week or so. just last week i decided to talk to her best friend. asked me how i was moving on. i said that i wasn #8217;t over her yet and still wanted to be with her. yet she insisted i forget about her and move on. it felt like it was being forced and so the rage came through and i lashed at her. as well as talked about my ex and said some pretty mean things. i thought she would keep it between us but that didn #8217;t happen and word got out. i didn #8217;t know at the time my ex was giving me chances hoping i could change but from what she heard she said no more it was the last straw. now i sit here at home i been sleeping all day without even moving a muscle. i thought maybe its best i isolate myself. all i do is cause damage when i #8217;m being depressed from the whole relationship. now my chances are gone with her. now idk how being by myself will feel. especially not talking to my friends. i wonder if some will be okay with me doing this or hate me. i been having such a hard time. i feel as if i deserve nothing in this world. idk why im here really and i dont want to be here. almost wanted to kill myself the other day. i drank down every single beer i got. that same night i just walked the streets aimlessly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>honestly fuck life. what makes it so great? i cant be with my ex anymore due to me being a complete fuck up. never cheated on her i just wanted to be there for her when she was having a hard time and she snapped and said she was done. days, weeks, months go by where im talking in between i keep making it worse saying dumb shit that comes to mind. finally say a couple things to her friend and it gets back to her. now im just completely ignored and she has no intention of talking to me. i sit here every fucking day waiting for a text or something. i guess im not the special guy i was before to her anymore. its like im weak minded. i am an emotional wreck and a sensitive person. now she is probably with some other guy and being more happy than me. i crashed my car a couple days ago. i just dk anymore. i feel like a complete waste of life and i just want all this to be over. not over in time but like actually die and never have to do shit again</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(28m) my ex broke up with me about 7 months ago its still hard. yet it feels like i never existed and all those good times we had its like it never happened to her. i cried countless times and she never talked to me again. i still send msgs from time to time trying to get her back but she never tried. it was a one sided battle. i too feel like i deserve to be alone. like im just not meant for anyone since im way to nice, sensitive, and an emotional wreck. some say its not true that the right person will come along. i barely believe it. right now its hard for me to even try with someone else because i feel like once they get to know me they will leave me for someone else :(.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(28M) Been depressed as fuck lately over 1 fucking girl. Still want the impossible to happen but i guess it never will. to much shit to go on about so ima keep it short. cut myself about a month ago because i tried to apologize to her for talking behind her back. yet she said it was too late. she finds out says i need help and go see a psychologist. didn #8217;t seem to care one bit. she was never supposed to find out but my friend sent her a picture. Number 1 mistake i ever did. otherwise now to the point. Gotten to the point where i just want to be alone there is no reason to bother my friends or family with my problems. my friends are trying to help me get better but i am just not accepting it. all i do is talk about my ex and always feeling down when i hang out with them. some stopped inviting me and others are still there supporting me. lost friends lately. like i express my feelings drawing or writing stuff down but once i share it. everyone flares up and gets upset at me. i said no more just no more ima be silent. ima decline all the invites my friends send me. no one needs to know where i would be even my family.</TEXT>

All I done is talk about my problems with friends or people from work and not doing anything about it. Like I should be silent and handling it myself. Then they start to question the person I #8217;m talking about. Well my friend that is. He seems okay with it but he #8217;s more pissed off. Now I feel like I deserve to be alone. i shouldn #8217;t be near anyone or even socialize with them. Would just end up doing the same and making things worse. i cant control myself because i #8217;m trying to get advice from others. yet i #8217;m making him/her whichever friend i have look bad. right now just laying in bed. deciding what to do. I should just isolate myself because i cant keep my mouth shut. I dont need to be here anymore. I can keep living but this world isn #8217;t for me. its better for me to be alone the rest of my life</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some advice i can give</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-11 15:33:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I broke up about a year ago and i couldn #8217;t let things go and held on like it was gonna happen again but never did. ima give some advice on my end i dont have much experience in a relationship it only being a year but i will try to help how i can 1 no contact mode it can work sometimes depending on the situation and what has transpired. its gonna be the toughest thing to do but you gotta pull through. if they initiated the breakup then let him/her get back to you. if they dont then they never loved you. i hate to say it but i went through this experience myself only making things worse 2 for example bringing up lets say Mercedes to your friends. now this can go 2 ways. 1 your friends can be supportive and 2 they will start to hate you because you cant move on and your still talking about Mercedes. In a sense its hard trust me to just be by yourself and you need someone to talk to. i would say talk to someone outside the friend group that they dont know. As time goes by your friends that you knew wont want to help you anymore or toss you aside because your still depressed about mercedes. they get tired of hearing your bullshit. 3 pictures/msgs/anything At this point i cant tell you what to do. all that stuff will make the feelings come back and open the wound a lot deeper. you will start to remember the good times and want to reinitiate contact. 4 going out with friends always and i say always ask is such and such gonna be there. you don #8217;t want to see him/her again after you started to finally get better for quite some time. that wound will reopen and you will end up acting awkward around everyone. 5 distracting yourself do whatever makes you happy. can be anything. if you need time alone use it. don #8217;t worry about what others think. you need to rebuild yourself. I cant think of anything else right now. if anyone with more experience like to add something for others here. i would say do so. i do lack experience and maybe i #8217;m not the one to give the best advice. i #8217;m just sharing what i learned</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my man i would for right work on you trust me. do what makes you happy. dont worry about her right now. if she comes back she will. your gonna go through a lot of phases up and down. i know this is what you dont wanna hear. yes it takes people time to realize what they once had. like my ex has this motto  #8220;you fuck up once we are done #8221; always hated it. i knew same thing would happen to me someday throughout the relationship. the phases i went through i destroyed so much. i should have deleted her number from the start but i didn #8217;t. i know exactly how you feel and you would do anything to get her back. right now your healing too. your not pathetic man your worth something and she lost it. didnt see the good in you just like my ex. dont worry about what others think. this year make it about you and be selfish. let her come to you. give her space to think because i know she still thinks of you here and there. i would say for now go to the gym and let off some steam. it might help. so anytime your thinking of her wether your sad or angry go lift the weights. the weights are there to listen to you they dont talk or judge you in anyway. they welcome you. use it as therapy. my man just listen to me i dont want you to end up like me. my bestfriend hates me and tells me to fuck off and stop bothering her. this is what i got the other day when we were all there and i wanted to keep hugging my ex but i held to long. best friend that has known her for 10 years. he choose her side over mine. its sad to see what he says right below It's all your own doing. I'm finally sick and tired of always repeating my self to you. I'm at my point where I've had enough of your nonsense. Grow the fuck up be a god damn man and go look for another chick. She does not want anything to do with you anymore and if she complains to me again about you massaging her our relationship will be strictly professional and that's it.i dont know how many times I have to tell you Joe. When she makes up her mind that's final. I've known her for close to a decade now. I know how she is. So as for you stop living in a fantasy land. Be a man and move on. After today, I will not be repeating my self again. Take a screen shot of this or save it if you need it to be repeated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No your not weak. I can post my whole story but i #8217;ll make it short. I loved everything about my ex when we broke up a year ago it devastated me. I did everything I could to get her back. Failed NC terribly. I still remember all those texts at first we were fine until i started to make things worse. Bringing up the past and my feelings for her. Every time i poured my heart out she wouldn #8217;t respond or ignore it. I would sit there all night. One day all the emotions i kept bottled up came out and i speaker my mind. She was furious with me and said she was thinking of a second chance but no she told me  #8220;fuck you #8221;. that was the end of it. I still blame myself throughout the whole relationship and wish that she would come back but for now all i can do is leave her alone. I might never love again tbh but I #8217;m willing to walk that path. Im off track here. Its hard to figure out what to say to you. Most of the time we all dont wanna hear anything. We follow our heart for how we feel.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Questioning friendship after trust has been broken</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-18 15:43:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wanna ask you all of reddit. Gonna keep this short as I can. So year ago broke up with ex exct. Find out my best friend who I trusted ended up having sex with her recently. I thought all guys follow that code don #8217;t have sex with your friends ex but thats a lie. I feel a sense of strong betrayal and the trust I had with him is gone. Felt very hurt ya know. Should I even consider him my friend anymore or drop him? He acts like everything is fine with a smile. like nothing happened. I have not talked to him in a good while. He would text me rarely but i respond very shortly. I hate him so much and the fucking worst thing is we work at the same place. Gonna start training for yard/line supervisor in the next 2 weeks and pretty soon me and him are gonna sit in the same room.... Also i know i cant control peoples actions and i cant tell him what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate this world and everything that has happened so far. I"m barely getting back on my feet but it seems like the world is still trying to push me down. Honestly I don't wanna be here anymore. I wish i could kill myself or cut my throat but i just cant.... and here i am still alive 28 year old guy. Lose a kid I never got to have. No one really likes me or understands me. I am just to fucking nice to everyone. I hate conflict and talking back to people that I rather be quiet and go about my day. The only ever good thing I done in life is just do my job. I always feel alone every single night. Stopped drinking for a couple of months knowing that it was bad for me when i feel this way. Yet here i am drinking away</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im in the same boat and its almost been 2 years. I know how it feels. everyday your angry or sad. A fake smile here and there to make everyone think your okay. You don #8217;t want to talk to people. Your friends either abandoned you or tell you just move on there is plenty of other girls out there. Hate that shit so much. Lately all I do is focus on work a lot. Go to the gym. More or so been focusing on myself. Its still okay to care for them. They never see us for who we are. I don #8217;t know what else to say to help... sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your not the only that feels pain and is alone. I can relate so much to this that it makes me tear up. I understand the self harm. Try to go out for a run or lift weights. There will be days when the thought comes up. I was in dark places for a while. Almost jumped off a bridge. Certain days I sat in the shower and wanted to stab my neck. Maybe its not okay for me to share this. Just know people do love you even though it doesn #8217;t feel like it. I just live my days however I can. work, exercise, read books. Do something you love to do the most and it can be anything. If no one had told you anything till this day. Im proud you are still here. I can see you have a big heart as well as a strong person deep inside. Lets take it 1 day at a time</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yea I know what you mean I would always wait for those msgs night and day. It would make me really happy but not anymore. Almost 2 years and I still miss her. Friends rarely text me. So far only time i really feel okay is being at work operating trains or supervising.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate everything about my life. I hate myself. I dont care how much better I have gotten over the past year after a stupid breakup. I didn #8217;t get to have my kid with my ex and its like the world denied me that. she told me it wasn #8217;t time. 2 months later she dumps me. I go into a strong depression then a form of self harm. Finally back on my feet beginning of this year. supervisor at my job close to becoming full time # 5 in seniority. Finally meet someone new but she says I #8217;m sorry after a couple of weeks of meeting her and 2 dates, and wants to go back to her ex. I liked this new girl. Guess its another of those so called  #8220;meant to be bullshit #8221;. leave work today and I am just drinking away. I feel as if I myself is destined to be alone. I literally wanna hurt myself right now but I cant because of friends and family. All I can do is sit here and clench my fucking fist because I ain #8217;t where I want to be in life. Almost 29 in september and I #8217;m just a pathetic piece of shit. All I do is work because thats the only thing that gets me by other than being at home. I figured no one will ever like me or want to raise a kid with me because I #8217;m a sentimental bitch and take things to heart. I want life to be over already. I know some may not reply and thats okay. I #8217;ll sit here by myself and drink all day and draw out my feelings or patiently wait to go back to work in 36 hours. Only thing that keeps me sane and living</TEXT>
