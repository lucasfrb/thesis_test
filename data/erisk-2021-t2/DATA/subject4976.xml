    <TEXT>**Some background information:** The tomb of Ramesses VI (KV 9) is certainly, for at least one reason, one of the most interesting tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Its decorations represent sort of a treatise on theology, in which the fundamental elements are the sun and its daily journey in the world of darkness. In general, the decorations provide the story of the origins of the heavens, earth, the creation of the sun, light and life itself. The decorative plan for this tomb is one of the most sophisticated and complete in the Valley of the Kings. However, as it turns out, Ramesses VI was not much of a tomb builder, for this tomb was originally build by his predecessor, Ramesses V. It was only enlarged by Ramesses VI. Why Ramesses VI did not build his own tomb, as was certainly the tradition, is unknown to us. However, the inscriptions for Ramesses V found in the first parts of the tomb were not usurped, and it is clear that the brothers probably shared a common theology.</TEXT>

A whale calf was spotted in distressed by a drone operator about 7am off Burleigh Heads and authorities were called in to help. But a  #8220;suspected communication issue with the Department of Fisheries #8221; delayed the rescue of the trapped mammal, the news website MyGC.com.au reports. Frustrated, the good Samaritan, who gave his name as Django to media, jumped into his tinny, raced out to the net and took matters into his own hands. That decision will now cost the man, with the *Gold Coast Bulletin* reporting he has been hit with a fine. Tampering with shark nets is an offence in Queensland that can attract hefty fines. So too is deliberately coming in close proximity to a whale.  #8220;I #8217;m in trouble, #8221; Django, who didn #8217;t give his last name, told 7 News.  #8220;It was an expensive day, but whatever. There are laws. They (fisheries officials) do a good job. It is what it is.  #8220;I thought most people would have done it. You just got to pay the price sometimes. #8221; **Update:** Despite the man #8217;s claim that he was fined, Fisheries Minister Mark Furner said the man wouldn #8217;t be punished for his good deed.  #8220;I encourage people to allow the professionals to do their job and make sure they release any marine life that may be unfortunately caught up in this equipment, #8221; Mr Furner said.  #8220;It is dangerous equipment, we have obviously seen loss of life of people themselves being entangled. #8221; James Kable, who spotted the whale with his drone, said the mammal was  #8220;very distressed, trying to breathe, just on the surface #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[News article](https://7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565): A pod of dolphins in Queensland has been bringing ashore gifts from the sea - apparently because they #8217;re missing interaction with humans. The humpback dolphins usually mingle with visitors at Barnacles Cafe  amp; Dolphin Feeding at Tin Can Bay, north of the Sunshine Coast. But it #8217;s been weeks since visitors lined up to feed the animals due to coronavirus restrictions. Among the treasures the marine creatures have provided are sea sponges, barnacle-encrusted bottles and pieces of coral.  #8220;The pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they #8217;re missing the public interaction and attention, #8221; said a post on the cafe #8217;s Facebook page.  #8220;They are definitely missing you all. #8221; A volunteer told the ABC while the pod has displayed the behaviour before, it had increased while the venue was closed. Barry McGovern, an expert in dolphin behaviour, said it was possible the dolphins were giving gifts because they missed humans, but unlikely.  #8220;Nothing surprises me with dolphins and their behaviour anymore, #8221; McGovern, a UQ PhD student, told 7NEWS.com.au.  #8220;They do everything - they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles.  #8220;In all likelihood, they probably don #8217;t miss humans per se. They probably miss a free meal and the routine. #8221; He speculated it may be a  #8220;play-like behaviour #8221;.  #8220;They often play with bits of weed and coral and all sorts of things and just leave it on their rostrum (nose), #8221; he said.  #8220;They #8217;re used to getting fed now, so they #8217;re used to humans coming in.  #8220;When it #8217;s not happening, maybe it #8217;s just out of boredom. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some background info: So in 2017 it was ruled that the Yindjibarndi people had exclusive native title rights to their land since they have been present in the area well before European settlement and had important cultural sites near Fortescue's operations. Fortescue had the audacity to challenge these rights, saying that future investment in a section of Australia's iron ore heartland is at risk if a bid to overturn a native title ruling fails. I am glad the ruling went in favour of the original owners of the land, not to a mining giant earning $6.5 billion in revenue each year, wanting to "undertake investment" on native, cultural land.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From another [article:](https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/black-lives-matter-protest-us-massive-crowd-surrounds-white-house/live-coverage/4fc8f3a0e65609b30458b5831a5de3d9) Mr Wischnowski apologised on Wednesday, the day the article was published, but the apology did not stop dozens of staff from calling in sick the next day as part of a mass walkout.  #8220;*The Philadelphia Inquirer* published a headline in Tuesday #8217;s edition that was deeply offensive. We should not have printed it, #8221; the paper's top editors wrote.  #8220;We #8217;re sorry, and regret that we did. We also know that an apology on its own is not sufficient.  #8220;The headline accompanied a story on the future of Philadelphia #8217;s buildings and civic infrastructure in the aftermath of this week #8217;s protests.  #8220;The headline offensively riffed on the Black Lives Matter movement, and suggested an equivalence between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans. That is unacceptable. #8221; Mr Wischnowski has since resigned with Lisa Hughes, the publisher of *The Inquirer*, saying she had accepted his decision to step down after more than a decade at the paper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>***Sam***: It #8217;s all wrong. *By rights we shouldn #8217;t even be here. But we are. It #8217;s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn #8217;t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it #8217;s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn #8217;t. Because they were holding on to something.* ***Frodo:*** *What are we holding on to, Sam?* ***Sam :*** *That there #8217;s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

    <TEXT>**Full article:** FAIRFAX, Va. (AP)  #8212; A white Virginia police officer was charged with assault and battery in connection with the use of a stun gun on a black man, authorities announced. Fairfax County Police Officer Tyler Timberlake was trying to get the man into an ambulance to go to a detox center on Friday, according to body camera video shown at a news conference late Saturday. Timberlake is seen striking the man with a stun gun and then getting on top of him, along with the officer wearing the body camera. Once Timberlake is on top of the man, he presses the stun gun into the back of his neck and fires again.  #8220;Together as a community, through our transparency, we will heal as a community, #8221; Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. said.  #8220;This is behavior we shall not tolerate. #8221; Roessler said someone had called police about a man walking down a street shouting that he needed oxygen. An officer who responded before Timberlake had tried to deescalate the situation, the police chief said, adding that it #8217;s unclear why Timberlake used his stun gun. The man was treated at a hospital and subsequently released, Roessler said. Roessler said at the news conference late Saturday night that Timberlake deployed force in violation of the department #8217;s use of force policies and ignored  #8220;the sanctity of human life. #8221;  #8220;Our nation is righteously angry at the law enforcement profession, as am I, #8221; Roessler said, in a reference to protests against police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25. Fairfax County Commonwealth #8217;s Attorney Steve Descano also seemingly referenced the protests in a statement announcing the three counts of assault and battery, which could yield a 36-month sentence for Timberlake if convicted, news outlets reported. It wasn #8217;t immediately clear whether he had a lawyer to comment on his behalf.  #8220;I can assure you that I am personally following this case closely to ensure a thorough prosecution and outcome, especially during these trying times, #8221; Descano said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. You can't expect a 17 year old to take on 4 cops in a situation like that.

When the wearer speaks, the 16 lights shine through the mask, giving the appearance of talking, while clicking the tongue can make the mask smile. The components for the mask cost around  #163;40, with the most expensive one being the flexible LED matrix into which the lights are inserted. Glaiel used an Arduino Nano, a small microcomputer akin to the Raspberry Pi, to control how the lights react. He also used some electrical tape, a small microphone, a 9V battery, and some electrical tape Glaiel stresses that the mask may not be safe or effective in stopping the spread of the coronavirus, and refers people to the CDC guidelines about using cloth masks.  #8220;This is mostly meant as a novelty. Also please wash the mask (with the electronics removed) between uses, #8221; he wrote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[News article:](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/10/us/ap-us-editorial-cartoon-owners-resign.html) The co-owners of a family-owned Missouri newspaper resigned from their positions in protest Wednesday after the publication of a racist syndicated cartoon that depicted a black man stealing a purse from a white woman while hailing funding cuts to police. The cartoon published in the *Washington Missourian* shows a white woman asking for someone to call 911, but the masked black man says,  #8220;Good luck with that, lady  #8230; we defunded the police. #8221; *Washington Missourian* owners and sisters Susan Miller and Jeanne Miller Wood said in an apology that the newspaper #8217;s publisher  #8211; their father  #8211; made the decision to run the cartoon and didn #8217;t let them know in advance.  #8220;As co-owners we believe it was racist and in no circumstance should have been published, #8221; they wrote of the cartoon.  #8220;We apologise to our readers and our staff for the obvious pain and offense it caused. For the record, we abhor the sentiment and denounce ANY form of racism. #8221; Publisher Bill Miller Sr. subsequently wrote in a column that the cartoon was meant to convey opposition to defunding police but was  #8220;racially insensitive. #8221;  #8220;It was poor judgement on my part and for that I sincerely apologise, #8221; he wrote. The co-owners said they resigned in protest because they don #8217;t have editorial control to prevent something like this happening again. They also said the publication of the cartoon hits close to home because it was their father who chose to run it.  #8220;Many families have been having these painful discussions in the privacy of their homes, #8221; they wrote.  #8220;We unfortunately have to have this debate in a more public way. #8221; It #8217;s not clear what the sisters #8217; resignations mean for their ownership of the newspaper. The cartoon was distributed by Creators, which in a statement said,  #8220;Black Lives Matter. Black voices matter. We condemn racism in all forms. #8221; The company has pulled the cartoon and says it #8217;s not aware of it being published anywhere else.  #8220;As a media distributor, Creators neither controls nor censors the content we receive from our writers and artists, #8221; the company #8217;s statement said.  #8220;However, in this instance, this editorial cartoon should not have been sent and we have pulled the cartoon from all distribution platforms. #8221; Cartoonist Tom Stiglich, who made the cartoon, told St. Louis television station KSDK-TV that the nation needs  #8220;more law and order right now, not less. #8221;  #8220;The rioting and looting was extremely disheartening, #8221; he told the station.  #8220;That cartoon was based solely on violent crime numbers here in the US. To ignore that would be doing a disservice to the reader. #8221;</TEXT>

Cops are claiming he "struggled" and stole a taser after they pulled it on him in the initial report.* ***EDIT #2:*** *Instagram video clearly shows he took the taser and ran so they shot him in the back as he was fleeing.* *In my personal opinion, a taser isn't a threat to the public and shooting him in the back while he ran away just solidifies that this was a yet another case of completely unjustified escalation and murder. It's possible that he stopped in the brief couple of seconds that he is off-camera to try to turn and use the taser, but I fail to see how that justifies the leap to using lethal force.* ***EDIT #3:*** *For those saying that a taser is a "potentially lethal weapon". I actually agree with you. So why was it being pulled to use for a DUI in the first place? If the police are terrified of a taser being used against them, then why is it okay for them to use it on a civilian who is not threatening (or currently committing) a violent act?* ***EDIT #4:*** [*Clip (timestamped) showing that Rayshard Brooks turned and attempted to use the taser on the cops chasing him while* *continuing to run away*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MawQYNNIoZ0 amp;feature=youtu.be amp;t=1710)*. I'm having trouble telling if he hit the cop or not, but either way it looks like it didn't really affect the officer other than a sidestep that caused a collision with a parked car. In response, the cops shoot him multiple times.* *So here we are. A drunk man sleeping in a car ends up dead because the cops decide to escalate the situation over and over until they have "no choice" but to shoot him.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After serving 28 years of a 48-year sentence, Clarence Moses-EL was a free man only after another man confessed to the crime. **His conviction came as a result of evidence given in court by a woman who said that she had dreamed that he carried out the attack.** There are several perplexing facts about this case. For a start, **Clarence was not the first person that the woman identified.** She had initially identified another man, Jackson, as being the rapist immediately after the incident happened. After some time, **she changed her mind following a dream** in which she claims to have seen Clarence #8217;s face. Jackson, the man she had first identified, later confessed to the crime in a letter to Clarence. Clarence lodged many appeals, but they failed every time. Police incompetence is at the root of this terrible travesty of justice. **The police disposed of vital DNA evidence that would have absolved him at the start of the investigation.** Clarence raised about $1,000 from other inmates to fund DNA testing and got court orders for the biological evidence to be preserved and turned over. However, just a few weeks later, **the Denver police department tossed the box containing the rape kit, bed sheets and other physical evidence into a dumpster, even though it was labeled  #8220;DO NOT DESTROY. #8221; Any chance Moses-EL had to use DNA testing to exonerate himself was destroyed.** The Colorado courts denied Moses-EL #8217;s subsequent claim that this destruction of evidence violated his constitutional rights. **It appears that Jackson had a long history of attacking women.** In 1992 he was convicted of raping a woman and her daughter in the same area where the current violent crime took place. However, his previous convictions were overlooked by police</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The whitewashed lighthouse is perched atop the tallest of the rocky cliffs, which stretches an impressive 120 feet upward. It #8217;s off the coast of the Westman Islands, which themselves are about 4.5 miles from mainland Iceland. Because of its isolation, some on the internet have jokingly dubbed the beacon a haven for introverts. The remote lighthouse was built right before the dawn of World War II. Constructing this lonely lighthouse was no easy task, as helicopters had yet to take to the skies when the work began in 1938. Builders scaled the cliffs to reach the pillar #8217;s pinnacle, laying out the groundwork by hand. They faced slick rocks, rain, and fervent winds knowing that one slip could send them plunging into the frigid North Atlantic Ocean that thrashed and splashed below. Now, thanks to advances in aviation, maintenance workers can take a helicopter to the far-flung beacon.

He set out to raise AUD$900 for the same hospital by walking throughout June - but smashed that target almost instantly, raising almost AUD$2 million on his online fundraising page as of Wednesday. Tony completed his walk on Tuesday in front of a sizable crowd in his hometown of West Malling, southeast England, and celebrated with his adoptive family.  #8220;It is incredible to think that just a few weeks ago Tony could barely take a few steps. He is such a strong and determined boy and we are so proud, #8221; his mother, Paula Hudgell, told the PA Media news agency at the event. Tony had only recently learned to walk on crutches but was inspired to complete the challenge after watching  #8220;Captain Tom #8221; Moore, the 100-year-old war veteran who became a national celebrity after raising millions for Britain #8217;s National Health Service by doing 100 laps of his back garden, his JustGiving page says. He had received support from a number of British celebrities, including the Duchess of Cambridge, former Prime Minister David Cameron and Chelsea footballer C #233;sar Azpilicueta. He raised money for Evelina London Children #8217;s Hospital, a part of St. Thomas #8217; Hospital in central London, which his parents described as his  #8220;second home. #8221;  #8220;Paula has been giving us regular updates and we #8217;ve been amazed at his progress, #8221; Caroline Gormley, Associate Director of Fundraising at the hospital, said in a statement.  #8220;His strength and the generosity of everyone who has donated will make such an incredible difference.

He set out to raise AUD$900 for the same hospital by walking throughout June - but smashed that target almost instantly, raising almost AUD$2 million on his online fundraising page as of Wednesday. Tony completed his walk on Tuesday in front of a sizable crowd in his hometown of West Malling, southeast England, and celebrated with his adoptive family.  #8220;It is incredible to think that just a few weeks ago Tony could barely take a few steps. He is such a strong and determined boy and we are so proud, #8221; his mother, Paula Hudgell, told the PA Media news agency at the event. Tony had only recently learned to walk on crutches but was inspired to complete the challenge after watching  #8220;Captain Tom #8221; Moore, the 100-year-old war veteran who became a national celebrity after raising millions for Britain #8217;s National Health Service by doing 100 laps of his back garden, his JustGiving page says. He had received support from a number of British celebrities, including the Duchess of Cambridge, former Prime Minister David Cameron and Chelsea footballer C #233;sar Azpilicueta. He raised money for Evelina London Children #8217;s Hospital, a part of St. Thomas #8217; Hospital in central London, which his parents described as his  #8220;second home. #8221;  #8220;Paula has been giving us regular updates and we #8217;ve been amazed at his progress, #8221; Caroline Gormley, Associate Director of Fundraising at the hospital, said in a statement.  #8220;His strength and the generosity of everyone who has donated will make such an incredible difference. He has made everyone at Evelina London so proud. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Sisters Augusta and Adeline Van Buren](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/first-women-cross-us-solo-motorcycles), descendants of Martin Van Buren, the eighth US president, crossed the United States on motorcycles in 1916, riding 5,500 miles in 60 days on hazardous roads. Why did they do it? They wanted to be dispatch riders for the army. This was for two reasons. First, in 1916 America looked likely to enter the First World War and it seemed unprepared. As such, the sisters became important players in the  #8216;Preparedness Movement #8217; to try to get America ready for war. Second, as part of the campaign to win women the vote, the sisters wanted to show that women could do any job a man could  #8211; in their case, becoming dispatch riders. This, they argued, had the added benefit of freeing men for other duties, such as fighting. They set out from Brooklyn on 4 July, riding high-end 1,000 cc Indian Power Plus motorcycles. En route, they were repeatedly arrested, not for speeding but for wearing men #8217;s clothes  #8211; military-style leggings and leather riding breeches. They arrived in Los Angeles on 8 September after a journey beset with both obstacles and achievements. At one point they got lost in the desert near Salt Lake City and were only saved by a passing prospector after they had run out of water. But they became the first women to reach the summit of Pikes Peak in Colorado by motor vehicle. Despite all this, the sisters were not allowed to be military dispatch riders. A motorcycling magazine that covered the journey called it a  #8216;vacation #8217; and praised the bikes but not the riders; and they were accused by a newspaper of using the Preparedness Movement as an excuse to escape their lives as housewives and of  #8216;display\[ing\] their feminine counters in nifty khaki and leather uniforms #8217;.</TEXT>

The clip shows a group of men attacking the defenceless animal with sticks and boulders after it came close to the shore. A crowd of people gather around to watch the brutal assault and appear to do nothing to stop the violence. The savage attack lasted until the seal lost consciousness, according to news reports. An unnamed witness said told local media: 'They beat the seal up until it passed out. 'Then they pulled it out of the water so that children could take pictures and have fun.

    <TEXT>Throughout the 1950s, Federal mind-brain scientists ingested a wide array of psychotropics in labs and government research hospitals. Researchers had two goals in self-administration. First, researchers aimed to experience temporary psychosis that mimicked schizophrenia. Second, researchers aimed to know the types of effects a biochemical had on consciousness. Influential mind-brain scientist Humphry Osmond was an advocate of self-administration. He conducted a literature review and found that all investigators considered self-administration  #8216;the essential precondition for such work #8217; (Osmond, 1957). He explained that self-administration was a crucial method for improving psychiatric research because it enabled investigators to  #8216;see in themselves #8217; and thus recognize the inarticulable experiences of patients, both sick and healthy subjects  #8216;under duress #8217;.

    <TEXT>Chatchai "Sam" Panuthai is a single father from Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Chatchai decided to wear a dress to his children's school's Mother's Day event because he didn't want his sons to feel left out as their mother couldn't attend. During the ceremony, children kneel at their mother's feet to thank her for all that she has done for them. This resulted in the wholesome picture in this post.

E.g. shopping all day in a shopping centre and the people you're shopping with go into a store but you're happy to just sit and wait outside? E.g. walking through a park/nature hike, and you need somewhere to rest, or sit to tie your shoe laces? E.g.

    <TEXT>From a quick search online: Orcas were given the name  #8216;killer whale #8217; by ancient sailors #8217; observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. They called orcas asesina ballenas, or  #8216;whale killer #8217;  #8211; a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier  #8216;killer whale #8217;. Their Latin name, Orcinus orca, also reflects this observation of orcas feeding on large whales. Orcinus translates to  #8216;of the kingdom of the dead, #8217; and orca refers to a kind of whale. We know that orcas are top predators, yes, but not the vicious  #8216;whale killers #8217; that the ancient mariners thought them to be.

Public transport is off-limits to prevent exposure to the virus, and transmission to colleagues and patients," she wrote on Twitter. "Your 'free permits' are long gone. There were too few to begin with. Many missed out." Dr Arandjelovic said parking inspectors were inadvertently targeting frontline health workers who were left with no option but to park in the streets around the Parkville hospital. "In lockdown, who do you think is parking in the streets by the hospital? It is the doctors, nurses, orderlies, pharmacists, physios, technicians, cleaners, cooks, ward clerks." Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews weighed into the saga, telling reporters on Tuesday afternoon he didn #8217;t think the fine was  #8220;appropriate at all. #8221;  #8220;I don #8217;t think that someone who #8217;s in there literally saving lives at considerable risk to themselves should be the subject of a parking ticket, #8221; he said.  #8220;I #8217;ll follow that up. In relation to parking inspectors though, as you know they work for the City of Melbourne and local government. #8221; Mr Andrews also added that he would review the need for parking inspectors as essential workers [Sauce](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-11/melbourne-icu-doctor-gets-parking-fine-after-treating-covid-19/12544782)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She did park properly. And exactly what RakshasaDealer said below. The issue is that there aren't enough parking permits for the health care workers. Dr Arandjelovic said the council #8217;s  #8220;free permits #8221; were long gone and that there had been  #8220;too few to begin with #8221;, and that many had missed out. In an update, A City of Melbourne spokesman later confirmed that the fine had been withdrawn. The council also announced it would provide up to 5000 additional temporary parking permits to frontline workers responding to COVID-19 from this Friday.

    <TEXT>She did park legally. However, the council enforced parking restrictions in the city because of covid. Hospital parking is expensive. Commercial car parks are closed because of covid. Health care workers have to drive to the city because public transport is off limits. The issue is the lack of parking availability for health care workers. Free parking permits were printed, however Dr Arandjelovic said the council #8217;s free permits were long gone and that there had been  #8220;too few to begin with #8221;, and that many had missed out.

    <TEXT>After years in captivity, beluga whales Little Grey and Little White finally found a new home in Klettsvik Bay, Iceland on Friday, Aug. 7. The two whales were caught at a very young age and in 2011, after spending time in a research centre in Russia, they were moved to the Changfeng Ocean World aquarium in Shanghai. There, they were made to entertain visitors by performing tricks in a show. They now stay in a bayside care pool at SEA LIFE Trust #8217;s Beluga Whale Sanctuary and will need some time to adjust to their new natural environment, before their final release into the wider sanctuary. According to the organisation, the whales are healthy and feeding well. [Sauce](https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/pkyvwk/smiling-beluga-whale-rescued-captivity-china)</TEXT>

The officers entered without identifying themselves and fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment, hitting Taylor at least eight times. Taylor's boyfriend was arrested for attempted murder for firing back \[the charges were later dropped\]. To this day, those police officers have not been arrested.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A goat that lost its hind legs and much of its front legs to frostbite in 2015 after being born in an an arctic freeze has been given a new life with four new prosthetic legs. Anna and her twin sister Elsa - named after two characters in Disney's 'Frozen' - were not looked after well by their owner, but five years later, the farmer asked if there was anyone who could give Anna a home. A veterinarian tech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania knew just who would take her - The #160;Yourth family living on Capra Farm, north of the city. #160; Since then, she has become part of an animal-loving family, who have now fitted her with prosthetic legs allowing her to walk on her own, and has even become a #160;surrogate mother to her own kids. #160; [Sauce](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8640009/A-little-goat-lost-legs-frostbite-five-years-ago-given-chance-start-again.html)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Free awards and the large amount of cheap reaction awards has devalued the meaning of Reddit awards</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-11 07:25:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>With the new system of people able to claim free awards, and the large array of cheaper reaction awards, I now often see posts with dozens and hundreds of awards, which has desensitised me to the specialness of awards. They used to be a rare or special thing to acknowledge something special or show gratitude, but now these awards are just thrown around every where and no longer have the same meaning to me as in the past. And for those wondering about free awards: On Reddit mobile, the coin section up the top may say free, and upon clicking it there is a free box, which when opened gives you a free award to give out within 24 hours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are correct. After further reading I found this description for the photo: *Two orphan tawny frogmouth chicks are pictured here snuggling up to a rescued non-related adult in care. WIRES wildlife rescue volunteer Julie says it's one of her favourite feel-good photos!* *All three tawny frogmouths were rescued by WIRES NSW branch volunteers and were successfully released. The orphans were soft released in Nimbin and the adult released where it was rescued.* \[The source is from the FB page ABC Perth, I tried to hyperlink it but my comments get auto deleted\]</TEXT>
