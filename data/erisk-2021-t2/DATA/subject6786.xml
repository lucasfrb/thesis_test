    <TITLE>I want to talk to boss about bringing up a potential addition to company benefits at their next meeting.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-15 17:55:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I talked to my boss today (national telecom company) and brought up to him a solution to our area shedding bodies because of competition's compensation. I brought up the potential to add a benefit of housing allowance rather than a pay raise to try and help retention. note that i am not very versed in business law, but I know some about taxes and deductions for expenses and such and how business recoup some costs of benefits. I also know some of the tax ramifications for fringe benefits, which is more along the line of what I am trying to propose. so when I brought this up, we talked about potential legal issues stemming from how the housing allowance would work as I suggested providing the benefit based on location and the inflation of housing prices compared to the national average. I also brought up the potential of having the amount of benefit provided based on how far away from an office someone is and would cover a general % of their rent. (I live in California). are there any legalities that would get in the way of doing this, and is there a good way I can present this as a solution that may cause people to take a deeper look into this? i really care about the place I work and the people I work with and hope that this may provide a solution that others can get on board with. Thanks for any responses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went to my wife's parents house for a day and brought my small copper melting foundry with me. her dad used to work at a foundry and I was looking to have a good conversation with him over molten metal. I accidentally threw in something with zinc that was pretty small size. oops. a few moments later the wind picked up and the zinc started vaporizing and oxidizing in the air and blew into the house as her dad was pulling into the driveway. zinc oxide when melted with other metal is apparently crazy toxic. I will never forget his face as we all run out from the backyard as white zinc oxide smoke filled the house as well as the neighborhood. we went out for dinner and spend a bit of time outside of the house. I had a very different conversation with her dad than I wanted to.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-08 08:28:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>hi folks, I am finally putting this out here in the open. I am usually a very happy person, and bubbly on the outside but I believe that I actually have a chronic issue, and I would appreciate it for some advice and maybe some support. so I have been having this issue for quite a few years now and thought it was normal for many people, but I had someone come up to me and ask if I was on one of my spirals again. I came to a realization that I have a cycle of potential depression that I cant quite seem to break out of. on the rare occasion I will have a lot of energy, and I will enjoy the things that I am doing as well as organize everything. over time I begin to fall out of my organization and things begin to rapidly spiral out of control, in ways such as my organization gets destroyed, I no longer have passion for my past times and I generally become rather depressed. is there anything I can do to maybe mitigate the amount of time in a downward spiral? or maybe a way to maybe break this cycle? I'm sorry if this is normal, im just not sure how to adress this issue. thanks for any help or suggestions you supply in advance. for further questions please feel free to ask. I'm kinuv in a leap of faith mood.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-07 21:31:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Oh wow so this just happened a few minutes ago. so for context I am a service tech for a large company. angry customers are nothing new, but this one was new for me. so I have a call where cable keeps going out. I show up (general greetings ensue and I walk in). as soon as i walk inside the customer begins screaming at me that if I told her it was her stuff and not our she was going to loose it. so I offer to replace the equipment and go to do so. mind you that it was actually her stuff that was bad. my supervisor is at my location at this point and I ask him to stand by the door but not intervene. I walk back in and begin swapping the equipment all while this lady screams obscenities at me and calls me names and tells me I am a bad person. (it was much more vulgar but I respect those reading from work). finally I hear my supervisor knock on the door and the lady asks him who he is to which he responds with "I am his supervisor ma'am." she then has him follow her to the backyard and closes the door. only a few minutes have passed and I have completed what I need to do and go out the back to let super know i was done. the lady immediatly snaps at me and yells "I closed that door for a reason you rude butthole." to which I respond with the kindness that i had displayed the whole time and decided to be a bit of a butthole myself. i walked out her front door and stood by her fence off of her property line and watched/listened. it was glorious seeing her face go beet red as she saw me watching and listening from the outside of her house. I let my supervisor know I am done and he and I depart the location. before she is out of earshot I blurt out "man people are so freaking rude." to which I hear him hold back a laugh and the lady gasp loudly. the super told me after we left that she had tried to tell him that I had harrassed her and was very rude and attempted to extort money from her in order to fix her services. he let her know that he was at the door the whole time and that she was lying and she apparently lost her mind (I saw this happen from the fence line but didnt know what was happening). she told him to leave and that she would call back for another tech. (noted on the account of the incident). good luck getting another tech to actually come to your door lady. super satisfying knowing a total Karen got caught in a lie and called out about it. TL:DR, i am verbally abused and customer gets caught in a lie by someone in charge and panics when she is called out. Sorry for formatting if it's horrid. I am on mobile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work as a cable guy, and at least once a month i get an instance of petty revenge. The one i remember the most though was an older lady who was an absolute psycho. When we would arrive she would demand that we were clean from head to toe (cable guys arent always spotless). We are always considerate and put on our boot covers at every house, but this lady was on another level. She would have us put on her own boot covers that were too small for out boots, and then let us inside. Que me walking inside her home to troubleshoot a problem that she has been having for a few months. I am looking at the issue and go to check the cable connections when she looses her mind that i have damaged her walls by touching them. No problem i thought, she is just a little nuts, nothing new in my line of work. i let her know i am going to check the outside cabling to verify signal integrity, and as soon as i disconnect her to check the levels, she comes out screaming that i have cut her cable and to connect it back at once. i explained to her that i told her it would only be a few minutes to check earlier, but she wasn't having it. a few back and forths later, she tells me i need to learn how to do my effing job and to get someone who is confident in their abilities. When i tell her that i am and have worked with the industry for a few years, she yells back that she is not confident with my abilities, and stomps back inside. I am usually very nice and forgiving, because people get a little stir crazy when their services are out for a few days. This was not one of those times. I opted to just get in my truck, and leave, with the cable disconnected. I closed the order out with a note that the customer was aggressive and not allowing me to do my job (we are the only provider in that area). I talked with some of my co workers about the incident, and they all knew her by name. When one of my co workers that i talk to regularly got the job to fix the cabling, he opted to not go at all based on the notes that i and other techs left. I learned that this same situation happened for about 6 months. When i drove back past that house, i noticed that nobody had been there since i had. it has been about 8 months now, and that disconnected cable reminds me every time i drive by it that some people just invite petty revenge right through their front doors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A few. I am a but too honest for some people's palate, and I tend to not censure myself. The biggest one was when I saw on of my best friends from high school about 8 years later. I was walking with my parents while Visiting for the weekend, and she was with her fiance. We were both flabbergasted that we met each other randomly after so long. First thing I did was say, "wow you put on some weight, you aren't a toothpick anymore!" I got surprised pikachu faces from everyone. My parents, her, and her fiance. I didn't realise what I had said until we parted ways and my parents brought up how rude I was. After that I was, and still am a mess. The second one was when i was talking with some online friends (never met in person before) and the chick in our group was sending everyone some pics of her at her new job cause she was super excited for the good position she got. I go off and blurt out, "wow I would have never imagined your eyebrows were so big." I fumbled through that one as I realized that it made her self conscious and I profusely apologized. I still think she holds it against me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a good time for all of those people who are Minimum wage to make their voices heard. They are putting their health on the line for little else other than the fact they are forced to to make a living because there is no other option right now. We in the area of essential businesses and work that are in the lower tier of pay should be making our voices heard because without us, these people wouldn't be getting their daily living supplies. we have been told many a time before that we are replaceable numbers. Companies would never admit to that, but managers and others know it, and have said it to our faces. Now we are being told we are essential, and that we cannot be replaced, but they still wont give us what we need to actually live. That is frankly, Bullshit. Could you imagine an "essentials" walkout after this whole corona virus epidemic has stemmed its tide to get what we want!? we have the argument now, we have the power, why sit on it and take this treatment laying down. Demand chairs to sit on at a till, demand higher wages, demand what you want to make you live a comfortable and happy life. you owe it to yourself, and if they are unwilling to make those concessions, then should they even be in business?</TEXT>

It converted the 91/30 to a scout sniper and it looks great! The iron sights are still usable under the scope. I now feel like i just completed a mechanic quest and i want to tout my exploits to the world. These mods should totally be added to the game.

Like, i dont have a fetish or anything, and i could care less (undergrad med student in my previous college, now IT) about her bodily functions, but she gets really upset with me about it, and we have been together for about 10 years. It still bothers her when i do it on occasion as a troll. My initial knee jerk reation was to say that she was unreasonable, but after reflecting on my own actions i do i understand your perspective. Good on you for not getting defensive and bothered by the fact that she took it personally. You are a better man than I. Cheers to you and your SO, OP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something i have noticed is something called "capacity issues". since there are a lot of people working from home, it is overloading the limits of the distribution node. I know that residential supervisors out of the local offices can check these things on their tools, but i know for a fact the phone reps dont have access to that info. Im in SF where there has been a lot of the same thing for me, and its come down to capactity issues. Nornally for me, the internet just drops out every few minutes and hours on business hours, and in the late evenings and weekends it doesnt seem to be as bad. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My big question to your question, is should there really be a need? The firearms industry has brainwashed people into buying guns for self defense, but that has only put more guns into the hands of irresponsible knuckleheads who think that someone is out to get them. It is more of a systemic issue than anything else.</TEXT>

Regular Trainings and refreshers on responsible ownership, marksmanship, and trigger control. Regulating to categories also allows for some to get special purpose weapons that relate to their license type.

    <TEXT>I think it depends on what state, or also what region of the states one is in. i know that southern food is a lot different from a standard California dinner, and that also varies greatly from a west coast dinner. I think it also makes a difference as to what history happened in the area. if your area was dominated by the french at one point, then the food is a lot more rich and has french cooking methods employed. EX. being Louisiana cajun food (gumbo particularly). A good example i know of is in Texas, there is a lot of German style foods because a lot of the areas in Texas were settled by German Immigrants. I can go on and on about the kinds of food for each area.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is one of the questions I have been waiting for. Yes they have tried. I have had lonely housewives open the front door in bath robes pretending they were fresh out of the shower. I have also had those same ones bending over in plain view and flashing all their junk at me. I have also had one that decided she was going to take a shower while I was there and came out naked thinking "I had already left". I have never acted on instinct thankfully and have kept it professional every time. The shower is their siren song.</TEXT>

One that catches my mind is when I went to someone's house and their line was undone. It was a simple thing, but she was pretty and the previous guy tole her he would fix it on his free time and to call him. We ended up filing a complaint on the guy. Decent movie I suppose.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man, just today I walked into a minor hoarding situation. The worst was when I was servicing a house where there was (probably) an illegal immigrant living in the garage in deplorable conditions. When I say deplorable, I mean no toilet. There was a shit bucket. And it was not covered. There was also food cooked on rusty pans and no real way for that person to shower. It was really sad. I ended up not being able to deal with the smell and had to leave.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way we do it, is i manage most of the finances, but we agreed to keep most monetary assets separate, but similar. For example, when I am managing our stock options, I invest us within the same diversity and if my bride wants to invest in something particular, I show her how to do it, and she does it. We also split even most of the physical assets and the ownership of certain things are pre determined based on our interest level in it. There are certain things, such as jewelery, that I have no interest in, so those will be hers, where as for me, a lot of my tools and crafting materials and tools are mine, as she has little interest in them.</TEXT>

A marriage is forever, even if people think that it is over after the fact. The prenuptial should not be a taboo topic for any couple.</TEXT>
