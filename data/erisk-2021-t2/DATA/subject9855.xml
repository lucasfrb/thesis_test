    <TEXT>I #8217;ve done both. Depends on your academic background. Basically if you want to dive into programming and algorithms and if you don #8217;t have much experience with programming definitely start with mit course. Cs50 can be hard for start and it requires a lot of work and motivation to finish the course. Nevertheless after finishing Python course it #8217;s really good option to start cs50 or dive much more into python especially if you want to get into data science. CS50 will show you some crucial concepts from computer science which every graduate should know.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi guys! So basically after realising that due to corona outbreak I'm gonna stay for the whole month at home I've made a decision to try and start get new habits. My main goal was to track all of the work (mostly learning programming cause I'm CS student) done during the month in pomodoro techniques (25min work 5 min break) and to see over the month how satisfied I am with the results. My other habits I tracked: * wake up at 8 or earlier * go to sleep before 24 * work out * read Here are the results. By this post I just really want to motivate you guys to track and achieve yours goals but also ask for advice. What do You think I should include in my tracker next month, which habits changed Your life? https://preview.redd.it/88qlq26690w41.png?width=1226 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=fd3e651a908d48391a44b66242d51312c9a5bc13</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Connecting to linux desktop from Mac OS through SSH/VNC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-12 09:57:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>So you can laugh at me cause I'm a CS student, but I don't I'm noob at linux and ssh :d I want to connect from Mac OS to my Linux desktop so that I can process my neural nets remotely, cause sometimes it's just too much at once. So I've tried screen sharing using vnc and ssh, but I don't really get how this works. Can anyone explain how can I achieve the desired result or send some articles to learn about it? I'm not even sure whether I have to host a server for that and only then access it remotely?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay so I successfully installed `sudo apt install openssh-server` Then after the command `sudo systemctl status ssh` `sudo ufw allow ssh` the status is active and I can connect to it but only using the terminal on Linux desktop (same machine). If I use ssh from Mac terminal it gives the same error as before EDIT: it worked only locally because I used local IP address (told You I'm Linux noob), it doesn't work with the public IP too, but I think I need to configure something with my router (not sure). But I try to connect using same internet connection, so I think I could use only local IP address</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Graphics card for 4k monitor recommendation</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-19 15:48:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys so I've just bought myself a new 4k resolution monitor. However my pc is quite old (10 years now and I only upgraded the disk to ssd) and my gpu is gtx460. I've just realised that I probably cannot use 4k resolution because it's incompatible with the GPU. Is this true? If it's not compatible I can get myself a new graphics card. My budget is around 150-200$. I'm a complete beginner in building pc, but if I buy a new GPU and probably twice as much RAM as I have now do I need a new charger as well? For now I have 650 W, so I hope it's fine. Here are some GPU that I've seen on the net that interested me: * Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 Ti D5 VR Ready * MSI GeForce GTX 1050Ti Gaming X 4GB GDDR5 (GTX 1050 Ti GAMING X 4G) * Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER Windforce OC 4GB GDDR6 (GV-N165SWF2OC-4GD) - the most expensive I play mostly Dota 2, but good gpu may be useful for me for some really big deepnets and rendering some graphics projects.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-24 10:28:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys so I'm building a new PC for myself. I'm not sure if it's the right sub to ask, but I choose between two GPU's: one of the RTX 2070 super **and** Sapphire Radeon RX 5700 XT PULSE Recently a phd friend told me that if I really want to dive into deep learning and neural nets I need nvidia card for CUDA / CUNN. So considering I'm still a beginner in deep learning but want to dive into nn and nlp and probably build my own chess bot in the future do I need NVIDIA card? Here's my full build just for comparison [https://pl.pcpartpicker.com/list/qCkyrV](https://pl.pcpartpicker.com/list/qCkyrV)</TEXT>

What are the main benefits of getting this card after tuning from either of the companies msi, Asus, zotac etc.? Is it just better cooling, bit better performance and design?

    <TEXT>Hey guys I'm trying to build my first PC and I'm really lucky cause I got the zotac rtx 3080 Should I get additional fans (I've heard phanteks has pretty good ones) Also is 500gb ssd enough? I guess maybe later on I add some hdd CPU - I wait for next gen Ryzen Any tips appreciated, thanks!

    <TEXT>I was thinking probably corresponding next gen model to ryzen 7 3700x or Ryzen 5 3600 Yeah the monitor was bought too much in a rush, 144hz would be much better, but fortunately i dont play that much fps and this Computer will be also used for deep learning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ll definitely swap the fans for arctic f/p 14 PWM, maybe even AIO cooling for the cpu. If I get good AIO and set it in front of the case there should already be good airflow from the front? E.g arctic liquid freezer II 280</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I #8217;m an exchange student studying at EPFL. I #8217;m confused about the new covid rules. When traveling outdoors by bike to the university should I already carry on mask? Or just at the university?</TEXT>
