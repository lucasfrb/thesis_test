    <TEXT>First, I #8217;m so sorry that you had to endure that and you #8217;re still trying to piece together everything that happened. Second of all, you are NOT wrong. You got taken advantage of and your extended family isn #8217;t taking the responsibility for their actions. You have every right to be angry and to separate from any toxic or narcissistic behavior. The manipulative behavior your family is showing is making you feel like the perpetrator when you #8217;re really the victim. You didn #8217;t do a single thing that was wrong and the pettiness as far as social media posts or talking behind your back is a sign for you to move on. Can you trust your family? I personally wouldn #8217;t be able too after that. Your grandmother is extremely selfish to play on your situation to her benefit. I would be interested to know about what ELSE may be hidden about me or details that have been kept secret. It #8217;s not your fault. I #8217;m so sorry you had to go through that and still are navigating through that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah in the long run, Li Bai only gets better and better. Always check the cross rank higher ups to see what heroes they have, usually if they don #8217;t have the super fabled (diaochan, Fucha, Zhuge Laing etc. ) they will always have Li Bai, Wan #8217;er and Xuanji. I occasionally see Song Yu but Li Bai is more ideal, he #8217;s also a finisher. If you set your gems up right, Pan an will go first, you or Wan #8217;er will go second and from there Xuanji will hit and Li Bai will finish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry to tell you but eventually you #8217;ll probably need to get rid of Prince Gao, Shizhen and Mulan. Those heroes don #8217;t fare too well in the late game. For now I feel like you don #8217;t need Gao and Mulan they #8217;re both tanks. I have a scholar set up so I #8217;m not much help with this except you #8217;d do better if you farmed other heroes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would suggest if you have Lord Yi, Li Bai and Wan #8217;er. It really all depends on what set up you want, if you desire to have a healer. Pan an and Wan #8217;er are usually staples; you don #8217;t necessarily need Pan an but he can survive and he gets better long term rather than just being good now. Xuanji is also amazing, she #8217;s easier to farm now. If you have the funds, all the older or rarer fables are good except Dongpo, and possible Taiping since no one really uses her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mulan becomes useless down the line. You don #8217;t want to keep building into a hero that isn #8217;t half as good as another hero. Li Bai is an excellent choice and works well with Xuanji. I think that would create the  #8220;meta formation #8221; or the ideal formation to have all the way till late game.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve been in an abusive relationship and when I finally moved on I ended up being with someone who was equally abusive just emotionally. It sometimes becomes a cycle whether we realize it or not. I went from being physically beat up to being emotionally drained. The liking exes trip is really a red flag especially when you express that you #8217;re upset about this. No friend would EVER want your sloppy, disgusting, weak, just straight up poopie seconds. You have every right to feel angry or whatever other emotions combined.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m about to turn 21 and I #8217;m the only one in my friend group who #8217;s still a virgin. My mom always taught me about having free will over my body. Due to me always being super aware of who made me comfortable I just never felt at ease enough to cross that boundary with any of my past relationships. It #8217;s honestly weird when people are grossed out by the fact that I #8217;m not interested in casual sex. I have a guy friend who #8217;s celibate but his friend group bullied him, called him (gay slurs) until he caved in to the peer pressure. He wasn #8217;t the same after that and I can tell he feels bad about breaking that promise to himself. There #8217;s nothing wrong with sex it #8217;s your choice. I just don #8217;t understand why being a virgin especially as an adult or waiting is  #8220;weird #8221;. Edit:: Thank you for the rewards I can die in peace. One thing..I can see some people assumed I was a guy and said comments along the lines of  #8220;you can #8217;t get laid #8221;. It #8217;s honestly sad that people who feel like this are apart of the problem. You can #8217;t preach that sex is a choice but shun people who choose not to have it. I #8217;m a woman but I can only imagine how much pressure men must go through to have sex to uphold their masculinity. I #8217;m really grateful for all the positive comments!! Edit 2: I hate that I have to edit this again but woah I did not expect all the feedback. I #8217;m trying to respond to every comment. I notice the people saying,  #8220;this isn #8217;t an unpopular opinion #8221; probably aren #8217;t virgins. Having sex is GREAT, and not having it is great as well. The comments judging people or even me about what I do with my body is the PERFECT example of why my opinion is so unpopular. You #8217;re free to have your opinion but by the comments you see there are so many people who have been nervous to open up about this topic. Be respectful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me personally, which I didn #8217;t want to put in my original post is I #8217;ve been sexually harassed/people have taken advantage of my boundaries. So for me my main issue is first being comfortable enough to even want to have sex with someone. I #8217;m happy that you have that experience and you #8217;ve gotten over that awkwardness. It #8217;s just funny when people assume virgins are against sex but usually whenever I rarely meet someone who is a virgin..they #8217;re just waiting haha. I would hope to grow sexually with someone or if things don #8217;t work out, atleast I was happy with sharing myself with them.</TEXT>

People say they don #8217;t think this an unpopular opinion but in these comments alone they #8217;re assuming that if you #8217;re a virgin it #8217;s because you can #8217;t find someone. It #8217;s kind of sad, people think what you do with your body is a joke. I was really hesitant to talk about the positivity thing!! As a woman I see a LOT of sexual posts from feminism pages but there #8217;s not a lot of openness about virginity it seems. On the other hand there #8217;s still this  #8220;ew #8221; factor when a person has a lot of partners. It literally makes no sense, you #8217;re gross for not having sex but if you have too much sex you #8217;re just as nasty...</TEXT>

It #8217;s like if I came on here and asked about sexual partners I #8217;m sure I #8217;d be judged for having too many partners as a woman. It #8217;s sad seeing the judgment towards men as well. Sheesh what #8217;s the deep rooted attachment to sex?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My mom taught me from experience. She went through a lot of horrible stuff from men either drugging her, getting raped..bad stuff. Not just bad things though, she was just very blunt and honest. As much as we want to say sex isn #8217;t important, it is because we all can experience it. Sex can be beautiful but with the right person. My mom really showed me that it #8217;s my body and you have to do the same with your children. You have no control over what they do, but you can help them. You #8217;ll know they learned when even when you #8217;re not around they know what #8217;s right and wrong</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much. It #8217;s not something I applaud myself for I just am happy I love myself enough not to break that promise. I have a friend who waited but gave it to her boyfriend who was just god awful. It #8217;s been three years and he has another girlfriend(yes girlfriend) but she still is sleeping with him because she feels attached to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Woah woah!! Now I won #8217;t lie, because of how I look people always think I #8217;m joking about being a virgin. However, it #8217;s a double edged sword for both men and women. I feel like the peer pressure for men is way higher and I #8217;m so sorry you guys have to endure it. But boy oh boy I can #8217;t explain to you how many guys have either tried to challenge my virginity to  #8220;conquer #8221; it or even go as far as sexually harassing me. But to society I still agree, usually older people give me strange looks but applaud me  #8220;for keeping pure #8221; EW.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve seen some comments from older people and I think it #8217;s because when you choose to not have sex..it #8217;s more of consent than just something you do for the hell of it. That #8217;s just my experience. It #8217;s just not important to me I guess?</TEXT>

It #8217;s honestly weird how men especially fetishize being a virgin. It #8217;s not a trophy it #8217;s just lack of sexual experience. Sadly, that #8217;s something you have to say off the get go because as soon as you say you #8217;re a virgin your potential partner may be uncomfortable. I #8217;ve been told that there #8217;s a pressure that I #8217;ll be  #8220;attached to them #8221;..sir who said I even liked you? Just keep going and know you #8217;re worth.</TEXT>

There #8217;s nothing wrong with sex and there #8217;s nothing wrong with me for waiting. I literally will not die if i never have sex. I sincerely hope men are scared away because if he can only focus on me being a virgin that #8217;s not the type of dude I #8217;ll ever lose sleep over.

    <TEXT>Yeah I always found that weird. I #8217;ve gotten some of those comments and being a virgin isn #8217;t a flex. It #8217;s honestly sad though seeing people get rejected for having too many partners or like you mentioned how they dressed. My whole point of this being an unpopular opinion is that people don #8217;t want to a knowledge that they should mind their business. What someone does or doesn #8217;t do isn #8217;t anyone #8217;s concern except their own. It #8217;s wrong to judge people or make them uncomfortable because you have your own beliefs</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hmm but that #8217;s your opinion as well. Something I learned is that we all place different values on things in our lives. Money might mean everything to one person and be worthless to another. Likewise some people really value marriage and having one partner. On the other hand some people enjoy sex and want to experience it. It #8217;s freedom of choice</TEXT>

With all the  #8220;change #8221; and progression there #8217;s still so many taboo subjects that just don #8217;t make any sense. How can you preach about acceptance but are uncomfortable with your virgin friend?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see what you #8217;re saying but the thing is there are numerous reasons someone is still a virgin. I just included it into the post because everyone has a different path for their lives. The point of the post is not my experience but the fact that people feel the need to find something wrong with what other people decide to do with their lives. Of course we all will have opinions but there #8217;s a limit where it #8217;s just annoying</TEXT>
