    <TEXT>Some people with autism like me don #8217;t like certain sensory things like I hate being wet so things like washing hands and having showers etc can be hard. But you #8217;ve still got to work with your child on keeping their hygiene up. Like my parents will remind me to shower because with depression and the autism I can either forget or prioritise other tasks and with hand washing I will use hand sanitiser and also wash hands with water still during the day when it is needed but I do really hate the sensation of water and being wet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have had 10 involuntary hospital admissions in Australia and New Zealand which are similar processes to the 5150s with the 72 hour holds except in my circumstances they decided every time I was too unwell to leave and made me stay 2 weeks to 3 months each admission. They can be really traumatic. I have a lot of trauma surrounding how I was treated by staff and what I have witnessed in those wards so I don #8217;t doubt that she could very well have some trauma from her 5150. When you are an involuntary patient you lose all your rights and they can do anything really. The stories I could tell I could probably write I book - all up I have probably spent at least 9-10 months possibly longer in those hospitals against my will. Two of those were 3 months long.</TEXT>

I used to escape out the locked doors hahaha, wait for someone to go through the door coming in and bolt and my ass would just get dragged back every time. They ended up having to get me my own nurse that had to stay within arms length of me - but this nurse would also be at arms length while I was on the toilet and in the shower. It was awful. I #8217;m like 16 and got this lady staring at me while I #8217;m doing a poo. Not going to escape down the toilet miss I think you #8217;re good to turn around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m autistic and was bullied every single day from kindergarten until I left school at 16, maybe closer to 17 after a 3 and a half long involuntary psych hospital admission (5150 but we call them ITOs in Australia - but I was so unwell that the 72 hours got extended which here they can then do for another 6 weeks and then there #8217;s a tribunal which they still kept me in after then) - I had been in and out on involuntary holds quite often for the past couple years and taken out of school and after that I just didn #8217;t want to go back. The bullying severely effected my mental health and made me very depressed and later on at 22 I actually got diagnosed with complex ptsd from the bullying and hospital admissions. I rarely leave my house now, don #8217;t trust people and don #8217;t make or want friends, have nightmares still about it all and relive it all. Because it continued for at least 12 years from preschool and then I dealt with it in the workplace as well. It can severely impact mental health if you are vulnerable and you have no escape and no where you can go and nothing gets done about the bullying. Even being on psych medication since possibly 13 or 14 and therapy since then I still had a lot of problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Completely agree. Why make me suffer with severe depression, suspected bipolar, bpd, cptsd and autism when all I do is go in and out of hospital, be sad and hate myself and want to die and then when you survive an attempt people just treat you like an attention seeker. I #8217;ve been accused of faker and been actually laughed at by medical and psychiatric staff after an attempt because I didn #8217;t take enough and it apparently didn #8217;t show in my bloods or something and they thought I faked and they laughed at me and told me I was an attention seeker. If I could go to a doctor and just get a damn injection and have it be done it would be such a relief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was officially diagnosed with bpd at 18 but suspected at 15 and they gave me the emotion unstable label at 15 until I turned 18 and got the bpd one. I have been getting help for this since 13 and my first involuntary psych hold was at 15 with many involuntary holds up until almost 19 and I #8217;m almost 22, thankfully at the moment I have a different psych who is super reluctant to put me in the involuntary ward because of the trauma I received there so I go private wards now. But I #8217;ve been receiving treatment for bpd since 13 but got the diagnosis officially at 18. I did have a lot of hospital admissions some lasting 3 and a half months involuntary though where they could watch my behaviour 24/7. But bpd is something that definitely can show before your thirties, I know many people diagnosed in their 20s from hospital stays and group programs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s up to you. I think it #8217;s important to seek a therapy like dialectal behaviour therapy if you are having interpersonal problems or trouble regulating emotions and tolerating distress. I have found since my diagnosis that I get stigmatised by medical professionals when they meet me and they make assumptions on me based on the stigma this disorder has which is frustrating. But if getting a diagnosis will allow you to seek treatment then that is important.</TEXT>

Autism Spectrum disorder diagnosed at 16 but you could definitely tell when I was a child and BPD officially diagnosed at 18 but they said  #8220;emotional dysregulation #8221; which was them basically considering me having BPD at 15 when I was constantly in and out of psych wards. I actually think all my mental illnesses came from the trauma of being undiagnosed autistic (most of my childhood/teen I was undiagnosed), not understanding why I was different and the severe bullying I had every day every year until I left school). BPD can be caused by trauma and I think the bullying is what caused mine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She doesn #8217;t need to be babied like everyone does online. I know many people with anorexia that have been hospitalised in medical and psychiatric wards because their body is unwell and having lots of severe medical complications that I met throughout all of my psychiatric ward admissions - they were all lovely but they didn #8217;t need to be babied that everyone does to Eugenia and all had an idea that what they were doing wasn #8217;t good for them, they just were so caught up in it that it was so hard to stop. Only one of my friends in there was in denial in the actual ward but I think that was to avoid getting caught because she wasn #8217;t in there originally for an ED but she didn #8217;t need to be babied either when she was brought in again and diagnosed with anorexia. People with mental illness shouldn #8217;t be babied and tip toed around and I #8217;m saying this as someone that has dealt with mental illness personally - you won #8217;t get any better or hold any accountability if you are babied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For something like this you should go if you feel like you need to go. If you have been thinking about returning then you could ask if an admission would be good for you. You know you best. There isn #8217;t anything black and white on when to seek help except always go if you feel you are a danger to yourself or others - other than that it #8217;s up to you and knowing yourself and when you need help. Where I live in Australia we have public hospitals and private, not sure what it #8217;s like where you are. The public ones people generally go if they need acute care and are generally a danger to themselves - I #8217;ve been n involuntary patient there many time #8217;s. Sometimes held against my will for up to 3 and a half months. These are generally not great for long term care but more for keeping you safe when you are in a crisis. Then we also have private hospitals that have group therapy programs that anyone with mental health or addiction programs can go whenever they feel that it might benefit them - they just need a referral from their doctor. These can be quite beneficial - I #8217;ve been to quite a few private hospitals - I stay there instead of going involuntary now as long as I can ensure my safety as I have a lot of trauma from involuntary.</TEXT>

But being forced into an involuntary ward can be traumatic (it was for me, I was kept against my will for three and a half months one time and different periods of time lots of times) and that is generally reserved for when someone is a significant risk to themselves or others e.g. has a plan to kill them self and plans to act on it not just suicidal thoughts, psychosis, eating disorders that require medical intervention etc. What #8217;s making your parents want that as an option for you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes you can, I am diagnosed with both (well it #8217;s autism spectrum disorder in my country because they wiped they Aspergers label since the DSM change but it #8217;s the same thing) They #8217;re not technically supposed to diagnosis personality disorders before 18 because the personality is still forming but some do. When I was 15 they basically knew I had BPD but said I had emotional dyregulation disorder or something and then changed it to BPD when I turned 18. Depends on your psychiatrist as to whether they would be comfortable diagnosing a minor with a personality disorder. The treatment for it is dialectal behaviour therapy and the modules for that are mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness - even if you can #8217;t get a diagnosis it might be good to start that if it #8217;s available to you. Some of the skills are pretty good for ASD/Aspergers as well I thought. To be diagnosed with BPD you would need to meet 5 of the 9 traits in the DSM.</TEXT>

For me I will feel very low and depressed, empty, like there is no life in me, I have no motivation to do anything, I don #8217;t enjoy activities I would usually find pleasurable, I often become suicidal, I can start self harming, i have no energy to do anything - at the moment I sit in a chair most of the day because I don #8217;t have the energy of motivation to do anything else. If you are concerned you might have depression I really do advise to see a doctor and therapist. You really don #8217;t want it to escalate.

    <TEXT>Sometimes when you #8217;re not eating enough calories you can end up binging which she would probably keep to herself out of shame and guilt. Some people will just binge and some may try and counteract with things like laxatives, purging, exercise but you will often still gain weight from a binge even if you try and counteract with something and if the scale says you lost weight after and you used laxatives or purging it would often be water weight - if she is having problems with binging that could be a reason why her weight is staying the same. She probably feels extremely self conscious about her weight and the fact that she isn #8217;t losing as quickly as she likes. I wouldn #8217;t jump directly to lying - some people #8217;s eating disorders can change and morph over time as well instead of just staying the same so you can start by restricting and restricting only and then you can start having problems with binging or binge purging etc. I would just be there for her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know. There #8217;s a lot that goes into a personality disorder and and certain things in the DSM that they would have to meet that would really be between them and a psychiatrist and you could only really speculate on it. If they are being rude, aggressive and manipulative you don #8217;t have to be their friend regardless of whether they have a personality disorder or not - it #8217;s up to them if they do have a personality disorder to seek support and treatment/therapy for that. I #8217;m diagnosed with borderline personality disorder so that #8217;s the one I #8217;m most familiar with. You can look up online what the DSM 5 criteria for different disorders are but it #8217;s really not best to just assume someone has a personality disorder - it #8217;s something for them to find out with their psychiatrist to work with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I don #8217;t get it. I don #8217;t have an eating disorder but I have other mental illnesses like depression and self harm and suicidal thoughts and I try and hide everything so hard solely because I don #8217;t want to worry people and my family and when they know my depression is back and see me in hospital or know I #8217;ve self harmed and I see how sad they look it makes me feel so upset and so guilty so I just couldn #8217;t imagine flaunting it. I would try and hide that because I just hate worrying people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I #8217;m 22 and have been very suicidal in and off from 15 until present and have had numerous hospitalisations for it. My family keep all medications locked in their room - their door has a lock so I cannot access. Good to see her medications are being controlled by parents. If they aren #8217;t already locked away in a lock box or safe or the parents door is locked it would be best to do that. When I am bad my parents check my incoming parcels to see if I #8217;m buying things like belts, sharp blades or anything that can be dangerous (I have a history of self harm) etc. Probably keep an eye out as well in case she gets desperate and tries to go to a chemist for something like Panadol that #8217;s easily accessible. You #8217;d basically just catch her throwing up and throwing up if she took that but it would be hours later, depending on how much confusion can set in as well - I didn #8217;t know what was going on. It #8217;s very unlikely that Panadol would do more than damage your liver unless left long enough and it was a massive dose but people get desperate. I took a massive amount and escaped with no liver damage but had to have 3 bags of IV antidote. Wasn #8217;t worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They all effect the brain differently. Antidepressants the newer classes that they start you on usually don #8217;t have as many side effects as different classes of psychiatric drugs. (I #8217;ve tried all classes of antidepressants except tricyclic but they won #8217;t start you on one of them, they generally start you on an SSRI class and I #8217;ve also used mood stabilisers, antipsychotics, and occasionally benzodiazepines) Could be worth a shot if your depression is not getting better with therapy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not everyone with BPD does things like drugs, hyper sexuality and reckless driving. To be diagnosed you need to meet 5 out of 9 symptoms in the DSM 5. The impulsivity trait you need to have two impulsive habits that are damaging - could be as simple as reckless spending and binge eating. If you are concerned I would advise to speak to a psychiatrist or psychologist that knows about BPD, it can be a very severe mental illness to live with - I #8217;m diagnosed with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dang the US is expensive. Our public hospitals are free (the ones you go through emergency with) but they only take you if you #8217;re a severe danger like intent to kill yourself, in psychosis, need medical intervention from an eating disorder etc and usually it #8217;s for people that get forced in involuntarily like a 5150/baker act sort of thing but it #8217;s an ITO here. I #8217;ve had about 10 of them sometimes up to 3 and a half months against my will- couldn #8217;t imagine the bill if my parents had to pay for that. Then we have private wards that insurance will cover depending on your level on insurance that has group therapy and stuff but you have to be safe to go to those ones. I #8217;ve been to them too. Luckily my level of insurance covers the whole lot and there isn #8217;t any excess or I would be screwed. The health care in the US is wrecked. Edit I #8217;m talking about Australia</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, my depression started around a similar age around 11 and I #8217;m 22 now. If possible I do really recommend trying to talk to your parents about it to try and get some sort of therapy for it, I know that #8217;s a really tough thing and I wasn #8217;t brace enough when I first developed my depression but the thing with it is that if its not treated it can escalate. My parents found out not by me telling them but by catching me mid self harm in the bathroom at about 12 or 13 and thinking back it would have been much better for me to sit down and try to have a conversation about my depression than for them to get that sudden shock. That #8217;s when they put me into therapy. If you can get a handle on it now it could possibly help stop it from escalating.</TEXT>

Trust me the longer you leave it the more things can further escalate until you are in over your head and can barely cope. It #8217;s worth it to reach out the moment there #8217;s a problem. The severity of your self harm doesn #8217;t mean shit and I say this as someone who #8217;s self harm escalated over the years - when I was self harming and it wasn #8217;t bleeding in the beginning I still had severe emotional problems and depression. Severity of self harm means nothing - to even contemplate hurting yourself means that you are having a really hard time coping and need some support. I needed just as much support and help and was just as valid no matter what depth my self harm was at.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In regards to a psych ward, they won #8217;t put you in one involuntarily unless you are a severe risk of harm to yourself or others - generally this is a suicidal plan with intent in the near future - suicidal thoughts that are passive will not get you admitted, you need a plan with the intent to follow through for them to be able to admit you against your will. I #8217;ve been involuntarily committed 10 times. In regards to the police I #8217;m not certain on that - I would think they wouldn #8217;t breach confidentiality unless you were a danger to yourself or it was a serious charge that it was putting someone else in danger like a violent sort of crime, a felony etc. Things like drugs they wouldn #8217;t report you to the police for as they deal with people in addiction all the time, not sure how the confidentiality would work with you being a minor though as to whether they would breach confidentiality for that. They generally will tell your parents if they are concerned for your safety e.g they #8217;re concerned you #8217;ll commit suicide, seriously injure yourself. Mine never told my parents when I self harmed - that stayed confidential. But honestly you are going there to get help. It #8217;s best to talk about everything. These things escalate and escalate until you get the correct help. At your age I was in and out of psychiatric wards against my will sometimes for months on end because no one was giving me the help I needed and I wasn #8217;t being honest with my psychologists and things just kept getting worse.

    <TEXT>Actually most people with depression are far better off just with psychotherapy and sometimes medication. These hospitals can actually be pretty traumatising and I have seen a lot of horrible things and have a lot of trauma from those wards and also how I have been treated. Inpatient/ #8220;mental hospital #8221; is generally reserved for people who are a severe risk of harming themselves or others. You generally need to be severely suicidal and have a plan and intent, even passive suicidal thoughts won #8217;t get you in involuntarily - I have had 10 involuntary admissions. Beds are tight and I know where I live they will turn you away if you are not severe enough (I never have been turned away, I was always dragged there but I know of many people who have been turned away) - it #8217;s to contain the crisis not a fun happy place. There are also private psychiatric wards with group therapy programs which I have also attended that thankfully my insurance covers but these are expensive and not everyone can afford these. This is in Australia. But it #8217;s the Baker Act and 51/50s are still similar to our ITOs in the fact you have to be a severe risk of harming yourself or others which generally means you need a plan and intent or they need to believe there is a severe risk, just saying you have suicidal thoughts doesn #8217;t cut it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on the medication you are taking and how your body reacts. Everyone reacts to different medications differently and there are also different classes of antidepressants that react in the brain differently. They will generally start you on an SSRI antidepressant which is the newest class and has the least side effects and are the safest - they don #8217;t give you artificial happiness but if it #8217;s working for you you might notice the depression lift. If you have any side effects you speak to your doctor. I have also tried SNRI class ones (venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and cymbalta) and now on an MAOI class one. My depression is very treatment resistant so they #8217;re not really doing much for me.

    <TEXT>Hey I have borderline personality disorder myself. Her behaviour isn #8217;t acceptable, she needs to try and put some work into dialectal behaviour therapy if she hasn #8217;t already which is the therapy for bpd and work on it. Physical altercations and screaming and being abusive is not ok whether you have bpd or not. There is no excuse for that. That is up to her and her responsibility to work on herself and her triggers. And if that is your mums house and she is making these rules your mum needs to step up her game and take her house back because she is walking all over you with those rules. That is honestly ridiculous. I have autism spectrum disorder which comes with sensory processing disorder and certain sounds physically hurt my ears with that - I would love it if the house was silent 24/7 to be honest but I #8217;m not going to police my family when they want to have the tv and music on. I occasionally have to ask them to turn it down a couple when my ears are hurting but I try and be reasonable and most of the time it #8217;s all good. I don #8217;t scream at my family for that and I have never ever laid a finger on anyone let alone my own family.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dad has filed complaints when I was an involuntary inpatient on a couple admissions because the care was so bad. They wouldn #8217;t listen and wouldn #8217;t listen so he made ministerial complaints which was when they were forced to listen which is government level complaints and on one admission when I kept managing to escape and get close to the train station to try and do something final and had also managed to harm myself so badly I needed a skin graft surgery on unit due to staff negligence (no supervision and they left the oven on and it #8217;s supposed to always be off) he did a Ryan #8217;s rule which is a complaint process we have where I live based on a boy who died because no one listened to his mothers complaints. But generally they don #8217;t give a shit in my experience. We are just mentally unstable and they are always right. It took other people fighting for my rights for mine to get looked at. Now if I have an issue with a provider I just get told I #8217;m wrong. This is why I don #8217;t trust mental health and medical professionals now and refuse to see all except my psychiatrist who often still does not listen to me but I need medication.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people have mental illnesses that don #8217;t go away no matter how much treatment they get. Mine are treatment resistant and I #8217;ve been getting treatment for 10 years and it #8217;s expected I will face these problems for the rest of my life and it gets hard when you see no way out of it when medication doesn #8217;t work, tms doesn #8217;t work, ect doesn #8217;t work, therapy doesn #8217;t work. A person can only take so much. At the moment I #8217;m trying to be strong for my family but dealing with this for life I know I #8217;m going to keep having suicidal crisis regularly. I #8217;ve been hospitalised for it so many times longest being three and a half months. I know people love me and I don #8217;t want to hurt them but it #8217;s hard to live being very unwell. Not everyone has mental health problems that improve and not everyone does it because they think people don #8217;t care about them. Some people are just in so much pain. I have been recently trying to stay alive so that my family aren #8217;t put in that situation but I know there #8217;s going to be one day I #8217;m going to snap and not be able to take it anymore again.</TEXT>

His behaviour towards you is not ok. If you suspect you have mania I would talk to your treating team (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist whoever you are working with). Mania with bipolar typically lasts at least 4 days for hypomania I believe and mania in bipolar 1 is at least 7 days although they can often last longer. BPD euphoria or mood like that would typically go within hours or days. Best to talk to your professionals about that because they will know best.</TEXT>

By the time I left that school I had had 8 involuntary psych holds lasting from a week til three and a half months (three and a half months was when I decided to just leave school). The school knew about that and for students that had severe problems were given this red card which allowed them to leave class or not turn up to class at all and go to the library instead and stay there.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s kind of taken me a while to work out how bpd fits for me. I always thought the first criteria for example never applied to me at the moment because I don #8217;t trust people and don #8217;t have relationships and then realised I don #8217;t have relationships so that I don #8217;t get abandoned. So that is technically a different way of the first criteria point manifesting it #8217;s just it #8217;s often seen where people will have relationships and will act out in fear of real or imagined abandonment. For me I don #8217;t have any relationships at all (except for my parents, sister and best friend who I know would never abandon me) and this is so I don #8217;t get abandoned. I have completely disconnected from everyone else. When I was a teenager my relationships were intense and I probably acted out more for fear of abandonment and then people abandoned me so much I didn #8217;t want to be abandoned any more and stopped all socialisation. It also took me a while to admit I split. My family don #8217;t notice it because I do it internally. My anger is usually internal. Very very strong but internal and I don #8217;t lash out and get angry most of the time when I do split (occasionally I do but usually I don #8217;t). Because I am autistic and I have very rigid black and white thinking and routine and way of life if someone breaks that or my expectations is when I will usually split. Then I kind of worked I meet most of them. I denied the anger one for a long time because I didn #8217;t want to admit I was angry but I get extreme internal anger - I just most of the time don #8217;t express it to other people so I didn #8217;t think it counted but it did because it can get bad. And how my mood can change quickly based on situations. A lot of the time I have a baseline flat mood thanks to depression though. I have an identity disturbance and have bounced around different things like what I want to be when I grow up, different religions, even whether I was trans (which I realised I personally am not, I was confused although I know people are legit trans and not confused). Different beliefs like if I #8217;m vegan or not. Self harm on and off from 12-22 and I #8217;ve been suicidal on and off 15 was my first involuntary hospitalisation which is a criteria. I can get paranoid when stressed and dissociate often. I often feel empty. And I am an extremely impulsive person. At the moment it #8217;s mainly spending which is only one and it #8217;s supposed to be two for diagnosis. But when I was driving I would drive recklessly which is 2. Also have had problems with different impulsive behaviours as well as spending at different times. Kind of taken me a while to admit I had bpd. Last month I was at my doctor crying trying to get my diagnosis removed because of the stigma I #8217;ve seen from people online and also from professionals who don #8217;t know me and just have straight away stigmatised you for having this disorder. I had one doctor who didn #8217;t really know me do a medical certificate up it was for government assistance and needed my diagnosis on it and he wrote in the bpd symptoms  #8220;manipulative and other traits of bpd #8221; - he was a normal doctor not a psychiatrist and probably just knew of the stigma behind bpd but I felt horrible. But the more I look into it the more it makes sense. I was officially diagnosed when I was 18 and I #8217;m 22 now, every psychiatrist I #8217;ve had since 18 has said I #8217;m borderline before getting my records and they suspected I had it from 15 and I #8217;ve tried to deny it until now but I #8217;ve kind of got to accept it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Personally I am not a fan of people self diagnosing themselves, not getting it confirmed by a professional and going around claiming to have the disorder. This is because it might not be the case and even things like depression might not actually be depression - you can have symptoms of depression from having a hypothyroid for example. So I think it is always important to consult a professional. I think it #8217;s fine to look things up and go  #8220;I suspect I have this #8221; and then go seek a professional and ask them what they think and get an outside perspective and knowledge and tests but I hate people going around claiming to have disorders sometimes very complex ones without much knowledge on them without any interest in actually seeing a professional and getting it confirmed. There are many disorders that overlap especially in mental health and they might find that they actually thought they had one thing and it is actually another for example. It #8217;s especially important to get a professional diagnosis. Because I #8217;m sick of people that I see online with these massive lists of mental illnesses that they don #8217;t know much about that they #8217;ve self diagnosed themselves with and when you ask them if they #8217;re getting a diagnosis they say no and you ask them if they #8217;re going to try and get therapy for them at least (you can even do booklets at home for therapy) and they say no and it #8217;s like what is the point other than going around parading this list like having a bunch of mental illnesses is something cool to have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can most definitely have mental health issues at 15. I #8217;m 22 now but at 15 I had diagnosed severe depression and anxiety and had my first involuntary psychiatric hospital admission at that age because I was severely suicidal and had plans and intent and was in over a week against my will and was put on a bunch of medication. Therapy was briefly started and then stopped because I was moving countries. Started up again after more involuntary hospitalisations. I got diagnosed with other mental illnesses on top of depression at 18 and 22. So you can most definitely have mental health problems at your age. Relying on alcohol probably isn #8217;t the best coping mechanism as your brain is still forming - the brain is still forming I believe until your early 20s but I understand we turn to other ways to cope when we are having a hard time. Definitely don #8217;t think you are faking at all so please don #8217;t think that.</TEXT>

The childcare I worked at from 19-21 (22 now and not working in childcare anymore) let me have my arms uncovered and none of the parents ever said anything even though I do have some scars that are noticeable especially at the beginning of my employment. They mainly cared they I had good relationships with their kids and their kids seemed to like me. Occasionally some of the older kids commented (3-4) but they were pretty easily satisfied with excuses like I fell into some bushes and went back to playing. Kids are extremely non judgemental.

The sedation needle would be used if someone was violent, severely manic and wouldn #8217;t calm down and refused medication to calm them down things like that. I did have an experience on the ward where I was wrongfully threatened to be injected simply because I refused to take a benzodiazepine that was a prn medication that they wanted me to take because I was talking loudly and they just wanted me to be quiet. Was told that they were going to get security to hold me down so they could inject me - I have found there can be staff that can be quite abusive in the 10 involuntary admissions I #8217;ve had taking advantage on involuntary patients and their rights. They also made me stay for very long periods of time sometimes but I can be very high risk for long periods of time. I #8217;ve had two 3 and half month long stays involuntary against my will. I used to run out the doors when people would come through and they #8217;d have to get a one on one nurse to guard me and even watch me in the bathroom. It was horrible. You would #8217;ve be allowed your pill cutter on you. You could ask them to keep it in the medication room and they could use it in there. But I would assume they would have a pill cutter themselves. Some hospitals allow phones and some do not. It is completely up to hospital policy and isn #8217;t a black and white thing. In regards to needles as well you will get a blood test when you arrive on the ward as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find them really hurtful as well. And what they say isn #8217;t even true about everyone with BPD either. BPD can manifest in many different ways. Some people instead of directing their anger out towards other people direct it towards themselves instead like myself for example and I have no relationships with others and completely avoid socialisation altogether (except my mum, dad and sister and best friend who I know won #8217;t abandon me) to avoid abandonment rather than when I was younger and had intense relationships where abandonment real or imagined was scary. They don #8217;t seem to realise that there are many ways BPD can manifest. Not just one way. Just like there isn #8217;t one way to experience depression etc. But people will have one bad experience with someone with BPD and then paint every person with BPD as an attention seeking, abusive manipulating person and it really hurts me because I know I #8217;m not like that. It hurt me so much I cried to my psychiatrist begging to have the diagnosis removed because I was sick of the stigma I got even from professionals who hadn #8217;t taken the time to get to know me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m In Australia too. The public ones were free for me but I was an involuntary patient and they will generally only take you if you are a severe risk of harm to yourself or others and are only a crisis containment point - they aren #8217;t there to make you better but to contain the crisis and send you on your way. I have had 9 admissions in public - most were in children #8217;s and some in adults. The things I witnessed there were traumatising and I was treated very badly. I had some very long admissions that were against my will, two were 3 and a half months long. You can go in voluntary which happened to me and then they decide you are too unwell to make your own decisions and make you involuntary and when you are involuntary you lose all rights to your own treatment. In Australia for involuntary treatment orders they can keep you for 72 hours then the psychiatrist reassess and then they can keep you for 6 more weeks, after that there is a tribunal hearing you go to on site and that is traumatising as well. I have gone to two of those and both said I had to stay and I was extremely upset. Then they can legally keep you for another 6 months I believe although I never was kept that long. Longest was 3 and a half months. If you really want to be in a ward I would only recommend private residential type places but they are expensive and you would need medical insurance for it. Those are voluntary only and you need to be safe for them - they won #8217;t take you if you are suicidal or self harming as they don #8217;t have the resources but offer extensive group therapy programs and psychiatric care. I have been in a few of them too. You get much better support in a place like that but unfortunately it #8217;s very expensive. But I really recommend outpatient therapy unless you are really in a life or death crisis in regards to the public system. It #8217;s honestly shocking. And they send a lot of people that ask to be admitted home as well. I know lots of people who have asked to be admitted who have been sent home because they don #8217;t have the resources unless you are in a very severe situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be admitted if they wanted to go to public they would have to turn up to emergency. Whether there is a cost depends on their state. I #8217;m in QLD and there isn #8217;t a cost for hospital at least I don #8217;t remember there being a cost. Not sure about other states. They would get assessed by a psychiatrist and it would be ultimately the psychiatrists choice as to whether they got admitted. Then there are private wards they could google around near where they live and find one but they are quite expensive especially if they don #8217;t have medical insurance. If they don #8217;t have medical insurance I wouldn #8217;t bother unless they could afford it which I couldn #8217;t because it #8217;s in the thousands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Public will pretty much only take you if you are a very severe risk of harm to yourself, generally suicidal intent or plan or very severe suicidal ideation. Not even passive suicidal thoughts. They admit for other things like psychosis and delusions where there is risk of physical harm to self or others and occasionally extremely severe eating disorders that need refeeding. They just don #8217;t have the resources to take everyone and actually send so many people who come to emergency home and they generally don #8217;t give therapy either. They are also more focused on containing the crisis than diagnosis - if you are a lower risk patient which is actually a lot of even the suicidal ideation patients that come in you will be out in 72 hours to a week and would not even receive a diagnosis for anything even if you asked for one because you would have only seen the psychiatrist a handful of times. I was quite unusual to stay as long as I did but when I am in crisis they get very long and very extreme. They usually try and kick people out as quick as they can though, especially voluntary patients which is the majority of patients unless you have psychosis or something or refuse to go or they think you can #8217;t make your own decisions. I don #8217;t like how the public system works. But they probably don #8217;t get much funding either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A 5150 is an involuntary hold. Not a voluntary one. And it #8217;s for severe risk of harm to yourself or others. Generally things like severe suicide intent and plan. Even having suicide thoughts isn #8217;t enough there has to be intent and plan because it is an involuntary hold. And 5150s are more crisis containment, they don #8217;t make you feel better or fix the problem. It #8217;s there to keep people from hurting themselves or others when they are in a crisis. Do you have a therapist or psychologist? Where I live there #8217;s private residential type places with intensive group therapies but you need medical insurance and things to go there because it can get expensive. If there is anything like that in your country that would probably help fix the problem more than a 5150 would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah you #8217;re expected to have a therapist or psychologist to help. Severe cases in Australia can get case management I believe, I was offered that when I left hospital as an adult but declined and went private. It can be hard to get because they don #8217;t have the resources but they give you a psychologist. I had it as a minor though. They offer it generally after hospital admissions for people that really need help, not sure if there #8217;s other ways to get it. But they are really stingy on it due to funding. You can go to your doctor and get a mental health care plan and get 10 free sessions with a psychologist bulk billed. They could be able to help figure out what #8217;s going on and direct to a good therapy and help with coping mechanisms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been on ITOs (9 in Australia and one in new new zealand) which are Australia #8217;s versions of 5150s and I was extremely traumatised by them. I had staff say things that were very rude and emotionally abusive, I was wrongfully threatened to be injected with sedatives just for talking loudly (I #8217;m autistic and can #8217;t regulate my volume) and they wanted me to be quiet and told me to take a benzo and I said I didn #8217;t want it and so they told me if I don #8217;t take it they will bring security in and hold me down and inject me and they could do that because I was an involuntary patient and you lose capacity to consent to treatment as an involuntary patient. But it was a real threat. I #8217;ve seen extremely traumatising things in there such as a code blue (medical emergency) for a kid that had tried to end their life on the ward and luckily they were able to bring him back but that was terrifying, I still remember the look of terror on the nurse who found himself face - it was horrible. My ITOs also got extended against my will past 72 hours, longest being 3 and a half months. I found it traumatising being locked up against my will for so long and begging to be let out and not being allowed out. From my experiences in hospital I now do not trust medical or psychiatric staff from the way they interacted with me on the ward, I was treated very poorly - when you #8217;re mentally ill people in those wards can treat you not very nice.</TEXT>

They won #8217;t keep her past 72 hours if they did admit her they generally have no therapy and are solely to contain a crisis - not really any help unless you are going to harm yourself or someone else.

    <TEXT>I completely agree. When I was 13 almost 10 years ago I was catfished by an adult that said they were 15-16 on a teenage sort of gaming site and we developed an online relationship and I was groomed and emotionally abused and manipulated and was asked to do some uncomfortable things as well. A lot of it I completely blocked out of my memory as I found it pretty traumatic. Even when my dad proved to me it was a catfish I remember screaming and crying to him lying that it wasn #8217;t real and getting so angry that my dad wouldn #8217;t let me speak to him. My sister had told on me that I was speaking to this person (we had a rule that we weren #8217;t allowed to speak to strangers online and being a defiant teenager I broke that rule). I spoke online and had a relationship online with them for at least a year. It happens far often than people think. Children and teenagers will think it will never happen to them, it most certainly can and I think the internet is probably more dangerous now than it was 10 years ago when it happened to me. We didn #8217;t have all these apps like Snapchat etc when it happened to me. We were speaking on plain on msn most of the time and sometimes emails.</TEXT>

It #8217;s often in my experience vulnerable kids and teenagers with low self esteem or who may be getting bullied etc and having that someone to talk to is so nice because no one else likes you, no one else wants to talk you. And then these predators are really clever at what they do and they groom you psychologically and often sexually which was what happened to me. Then in some cases you keep sending things and doing what you are told even when you are being emotionally abused because you don #8217;t want communication to stop and have no one to talk to again. I #8217;m an adult now. This happened a good 8 years ago for me luckily back in the days before things like Snapchat were a thing and we just had good old msn.</TEXT>

They just make you go to the wound clinic for the burns that were only second degree, surgery for the grafts and I had to go medical for the cellulitis.

They just didn #8217;t care about anything that wasn #8217;t going to send me to medical. They cared more about my running out of the locked door when someone came through to yeet it to the station which I got out a few times and then they ended up giving me my own one on one nurse that had to be within arms length at all times so I would refuse to shower and get naked.

It #8217;s a violation of privacy to take a photo. The hospitals I were in were very negligent. I was an involuntary patient at one considered high risk and they have an oven that #8217;s supposed to be off permanently except the rare occasion they do cooking with the patients that are well enough to engage which I wasn #8217;t and would be removed, they forgot to turn it off and I religiously checked the switches and it was on and there were supposed to be staff around and there were none in staff so I yeeted with that and ended up needing a skin graft surgery. This was the week after I had gotten my first skin graft surgery from something I did when they gave me my first home leave transition. They were honestly dipshits and I only got stopped because the receptionist looked up and was like  #8220;I smell burning #8221; and shut off the oven.</TEXT>

There was a high boss turnover at the third place. I found out later after being told not to come back after my stay in the psych ward that one boss has tried to seek legal advice on how to fire me for  #8220;actively self harming #8221; when I was never actively self harming and they had no proof of me actively self harming while working there even though my mental health was bad and they were all clearly scars my whole employment. The lawyer basically said they couldn #8217;t. I was sent all these emails and reasons as  #8220;proof #8221; of why I was too unwell to work there and why I was let go because I was getting a lawyer involved for disability discrimination as they were aware about my disabilities, told I was autistic when I was employed and some of the things they mentioned I was let go for were also because of autism and not my mental health. So that became a big headache. I #8217;m bound not to say anything more legally. But these things can be a nightmare if you have a shitty boss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah it was a huge safety risk. The switch to turn the whole oven and oven elements itself off is located behind the reception desk in the office area where patients can #8217;t get to it. It is generally always off but they would do cooking once a week because it was the children #8217;s ward (under 18). The switch had to be turned off immediately after cooking and this time they forgot. But no other patient would check the switches either so I don #8217;t know if they were expecting that. But surely they would have noticed me checking the switches every day to see if the light would come on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m personally wary about self diagnosis as often there can be overlapping symptoms for disorders and what you think is one condition can actually be something else you may not have thought of. Depression and anxiety are ones that aren #8217;t as bad to diagnose as other more complex disorders such as bipolar, personality disorders etc in my opinion but you still need to be wary for example people can think they have depression when they actually have a low thyroid as low thyroid can give you depression symptoms and an overactive thyroid can give more manic type symptoms in some cases and in those people they don #8217;t actually have the mental disorder it is actually a health condition. I wouldn #8217;t worry about offending people but I would probably preface it by saying  #8220;I suspect I have this #8221;. That #8217;s what I do when I think I have something before getting it confirmed with my doctor or psychiatrist - in some cases I #8217;ve been right, some cases we have had to watch my behaviour longer to see if it is right and in some cases it can be something else altogether</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need to make sure you go to a really good piercer if you want your cheeks done, preferably an APP certified piercer. Someone that really knows what they #8217;re doing. If they #8217;re not done in the right spot you can have a lot of complications including if they #8217;re pierced through or close enough that they migrate into the parotid gland you will have saliva running down your cheek which is very difficult to fix. People also have a lot of problems with abscesses and pus pockets, swelling that goes up and down throughout the healing period which can take months and in some people still happens years later and my piercer warned me that some people #8217;s takes months/years to heal and that some people #8217;s just don #8217;t heal. I was very lucky that mine have done really well and apart from one of them getting slightly infected at the beginning they #8217;ve healed really well but 85-90% of people I #8217;ve spoken to have had problems with their cheek piercings. They also do leave quite prominent scars if you take them out which is something to consider - it will look like permanent dimples even if you are not smiling. I think they #8217;d look cute but they are a huge commitment to make and have to be babied for months. If you are able to handle to commitment and have a really good piercer go for it. In regards to your comment about dermals though, cheeks are in a completely different league to them. I #8217;ve had both.</TEXT>

So I had the very top of my head on the pillow and my lower head and cheeks were off the pillow and my pillow was high enough that my cheeks were not touching anything.

    <TEXT>If those euphoric episodes are happening for over 4 days there is a possibility of it being a hypomanic episode and in that case if you are going from hypomanic episodes to depression and it cycling sometimes you can have normal in between there is a possibility it can be bipolar. I #8217;ve been in the same boat at the moment and have been talking to my psychiatrist about it. Look up symptoms of hypomania and see if that is similar to what you are experiencing and if it is I would try and talk to a psychiatrist if that #8217;s at all possible for you.

    <TEXT>It #8217;s really something that is best to talk with with a professional if possible. None of us are really able to know and you haven #8217;t really provided enough information to solidly say yes I definitely think you #8217;re bipolar either. There are two types of manias, hypo which is the milder form and mania. You either need hypomania that lasts at least 4 days or mania that lasts at least 7. What you are describing if it is bipolar sounds like it would be hypomania. Maybe have a look at the symptoms of hypomania online and see how they resonate with you. If the mood swings are less than 4 days borderline personality disorder is another condition that people can get confused with bipolar. You don #8217;t get manic generally with borderline but there is a lot of emotional Dysregulation and it #8217;s possible to have both. Anger is another one of the criteria. You need 5 out of 9 for a diagnosis and it can often be caused by trauma and invalidation. I am actually diagnosed with both. If possible it would be good to speak to a psychiatrist if possible. If it is bipolar and it #8217;s impacting your life they often look at medications to help get you on a baseline. For borderline they look at dialectal behaviour therapy. Whatever it is I hope you get some support and what you are looking for.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because it #8217;s a personality disorder and your personality is still technically forming some clinicians are uncomfortable diagnosing it. I had a conversation with my psychiatrist about this topic actually. He said it #8217;s still technically possible to diagnose but that a lot of clinicians won #8217;t do it because the personality is still forming but if you #8217;ve been showing symptoms for a long period of time there #8217;s a possibility you can get a diagnosis depending on who you see. I was diagnosed pretty much as soon as I turned 18 not by my current psychiatrist although he agrees with the diagnosis. I was suspected of having BPD from 15 years old although they wouldn #8217;t diagnose minors due to it being a personality disorder and instead called it emotional Dysregulation. That being said they still basically treated me for BPD from 15 by giving me dialectal behaviour therapy, just didn #8217;t put the BPD diagnosis on my file. Clinicians often debate giving minors a diagnosis of a personality disorder while their personality could still technically be forming and I was told they prefer to finalise it after they turn 18. This doesn #8217;t mean you won #8217;t have symptoms of the disorder before you turn 18 though, I had symptoms of BPD as young as 13.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m on disability and have just been diagnosed with bipolar since getting approved. In my country they base it mainly on your level of impairment and the diagnosis come second as long as you are fully diagnosed (the doctor isn #8217;t speculating or your self diagnosed) and you are fully treated and not expecting to improve for 2+ years. I applied for depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder and used the mental health tables. This was Australia. I had enough evidence of my hospitalisations and severity that I ended up getting approved. Since then I recently got a bipolar diagnosis so I would say it #8217;s possible. The bipolar is one of the main for me why work is so difficult because of the severe chronic depression I get where I can #8217;t move and it lasts so long and is treatment resistant. If you have a doctor willing to support you and give evidence I #8217;m sure it #8217;s possible.</TEXT>

If it were me I would just put the letters in the bin honestly if I were in the frame of mind of enabling my daughter - I wouldn #8217;t care. It wouldn #8217;t change what I was doing especially considering this is allegedly a pattern that has been happening for multiple years. Just like when I get a heap of junk mail in my letter box, I stick it in the bin without reading it - I have a feeling the same thing would happen here. You cannot help a person that does not want help and this is coming from someone with severe mental health issues that has been in and out of hospitals involuntarily. I have been held for months and months against my will in hospitals and kept going in and out against my will until I had to make a decision that I didn #8217;t want to be doing that anymore and I wanted to work on getting better for myself. It #8217;s a waste of time. I do really hope one day she sees the light and wants to get help and tries recovery for herself but unless she tries for herself and isn #8217;t forced into it for whatever reason it is very unlikely to work. You can get the best treatment but if you don #8217;t want to get better you are going to fall right back into the same patterns and behaviours once again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no way you would fail one of these evaluations for being nervous. I have done plenty of them and been admitted involuntarily against my will 10 times - they do not admit you or you  #8220;fail #8221; because you are nervous. They are trained to be able to tell whether you are severe risk of harm to yourself or others and whether you are capable of making rational decisions or not which I obviously wasn #8217;t when I was admitted and obviously she wasn #8217;t either when she was admitted. That #8217;s not to say those admissions can #8217;t be traumatising. I found my admissions very traumatic and saw things that were very traumatic and dealt with threats and emotional abuse by staff that has contributed to other traumas into complex ptsd for me personally which I am working through and because of that I don #8217;t trust medical and psychiatric professionals apart from my psychiatrist and refuse medical help because my experiences were so traumatic. But I have also spent much longer in - some of my stays were extended more than once to three and a half months against my will which they can do in Australia if a tribunal panel decides you are still unsafe and not capable of making decisions about your treatment. But no, you will not fail an evaluation for being nervous. Otherwise there would be a line out of the hospital because almost everyone would fail the evaluations because everyone is nervous when they have a psychiatric professional they don #8217;t know asking such personal questions.</TEXT>

She needed the eating disorder treatment centre type help where there is therapy designed for an eating disorder and staff trained in eating disorders. People with eating disorders don #8217;t get well in the type of hospitals they put you for 5150s/5250s, they #8217;re more to contain crisis where people are hurting themselves or others. My guess is that they would have decided that her being an adult that there wasn #8217;t much they could do for her and released her and that happens a lot unfortunately because eating disorders are a slower form of harm.

Stupid psychiatrists always held me longer and actually extended the 72 hours but they can release you earlier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If her mother is her conservator and one of her roles was to get Eugenia help and treatment when necessary and something serious happened like her death I would assume she could potentially be held criminally responsible if she didn #8217;t do everything in her power to prevent that from happening much like if a minor child dies in your care and you haven #8217;t done everything to prevent it. Purely speculation though, I don #8217;t know whether she is in a conservatorship or whether that would even be part of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If a psychiatrist marks her as gravely disabled it wouldn #8217;t be hard to get one where someone else can make decisions for her. I don #8217;t think it would be hard to get at all because to classify as gravely disabled you need to prove that she wouldn #8217;t be able to feed, clothe and shelter yourself and she #8217;s never been able to do anything for herself - she doesn #8217;t know how to do anything. If she was put out onto the street even with some money, I highly doubt she would be able to go get a taxi, rent an apartment, make food and do normal living things because she #8217;s never had to or been taught to do that - if you can #8217;t do that you can be classified as gravely disabled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I #8217;ve been sent to those same places where I have actually endured some really terrible things and it was my parents that put me in there (and unlike Eugenia in Australia they actually could force me to stay involuntarily for months against my will as well). But am I still to this day (this was 15-18/19 that I was involuntarily put in and I #8217;m 22 now) angry at my parents - no, I needed to be put in there or I wouldn #8217;t be alive today. I did see really traumatic things in there and the place I was at was really shitty where the staff where quite emotionally abusive but that wasn #8217;t my parents fault and they were just trying to keep me safe. Eugenia really needs to separate the fact that she really needed help otherwise they wouldn #8217;t have admitted her and that it came from a good place in Jaclyn and her friends hearts because they were genuinely worried about her.</TEXT>

One time I also got threatened to be injected just for talking a little loudly when I #8217;m autistic and can #8217;t regulate my volume well (I try) and it was the afternoon not night and they just decided they wanted quiet and said they were going to get security to hold me down and inject me if I didn #8217;t stop talking. Some staff can be really bad. A lot are really lazy too and sit in their desk all day in their office and don #8217;t actually watch the patients and would leave us unsupervised and really bad things would happen like me needing to get a skin graft for a third degree burn I did on unit so I ended up needing a one on one nurse that stays at arms length for two admissions because I became too much of a risk. I liked my one on one nurse a better than the permanent staff. They were nurses that didn #8217;t belong to the ward but they were a lot nicer to me and treated me like a human.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah trauma has made me not want to socialise at all and I don #8217;t leave my house or socialise with anyone except for my immediate family and one friend so 4 people. I can type fine so strangers on the internet have actually accused me of lying about my autism but if you speak to me in public I generally won #8217;t look you in the eye, may not even face you and speak in quite short sentences, often quite monotone with little facial expression and often don #8217;t understand the facial expressions, gestures or can process verbally what the other person is saying and often need them to repeat it where as with text I can reread it. I did used to be able to mask a bit when I was in school but trauma has made me unable to mask anymore and has made me regress a lot but I definitely had autism before any trauma and a lot of my trauma was actually because of how people treated me because I was autistic and my poor social skills.</TEXT>

No matter how deep you go, when you are in that space, it will never be good enough. It is never ok to enable someone else to harm themselves. Self harm is self harm.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been involuntarily hospitalised many times (it #8217;s not called a 5150 where I live) and all of the times I have been forced to stay past the 72 hours, two of the 10 admissions I was forced to stay over 3 months (one was 3.5 months). It was incredibly traumatising. The staff didn #8217;t want to be there and they took it out on the patients and quite a few were emotionally abusive (There were some good ones but I had some terrible experiences). I would be threatened with things like injections simply for talking  #8220;too loud #8221; when I am autistic and struggle to regulate my volume when it was the afternoon and not even night and the nurses just decided they wanted everyone to be quiet and all I was doing was talking to patients which we were allowed to do - I was told that if I didn #8217;t take Valium to make me stop talking that they were going to get security to hold me down and inject me and being an involuntary patient I can #8217;t refuse anything and am completely their mercy. I saw incredibly traumatic things including medical emergencies (code blues) for things patients did to themselves things that would be too triggering for me to write down. I had staff mock a prior suicide attempt and tell me I was doing it all for attention. The ones I was at had terrible supervision and were negligent and I needed to be transferred to medical many times during my stays for things like cellulitis and skin grafts - you couldn #8217;t even go to staff if you had a problem or felt unsafe. I #8217;ve been diagnosed with CPTSD from the things I have been through in these wards and from another long trauma. Because of my experiences in these wards I don #8217;t trust medical or psychiatrist staff and still get flashbacks to things that happened and get nightmares about things. I panic around doctors surgeries and hospitals and refuse medical treatment unless I #8217;m pretty much forced because I have had a lot of terrible experiences in medical hospitals after being transferred from the psych ward and how medical doctors treat mental health patients. I #8217;m 22 and can #8217;t speak to a medical doctor and have to bring a parent in to speak for me. The only psychiatric professional I speak with is my psychiatrist and it took him a long time to earn my trust. I could be dead if I didn #8217;t go to a involuntary hospital - but that doesn #8217;t make them any less traumatic. In fact now my mental health is actually in a worse place from the trauma these involuntary hospitals have brought me. It is in my risk management plan never to threaten involuntary hospitals now that my psychiatrist wrote and even when I am suicidal they try and put me in the private voluntary ward that is run a lot better and my psychiatrist works there because I get worse in involuntary hospitals from the trauma they #8217;ve caused me and freak out as soon as anyone mentions or threatens it and then it would only be if I started acting on it that they would think about involuntary but I don #8217;t do that because I am terrified of involuntary.</TEXT>

It would be some sort of bump caused by irritation. And tea tree oil is way too harsh for piercings and is an outdated form of aftercare and is not recommended aftercare anymore by reputable piercers even for irritation bumps. Surgical steel should not be put in fresh piercings (or really used at all) it should be implant grade titanium. I would honestly seek the advice of another piercer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds so scripted. Usually in her streams she can barely string words together. To be honest I think someone wrote it for her, legal team maybe?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looks nice! Septum was my first piercing other than ears, I got it at 15 as well. I #8217;ve had it pierced twice. Still have it at 22 and love it. It started me down the road for a bunch of other facial piercings haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was the first piercing I could convince my parents to let me get because they had to sign parental consent where I live until 16 is the legal age here to consent to piercings and I managed to convince them because it was so easily hidden by flipping it up haha (my schools had pretty strict rules on piercings, only first and second lobes were allowed - they would even make you take out clear piercing retainers. I was at one school at around 15 for a term that was so strict that I saw a teacher tell a girl to take out her tongue piercing and he confiscated it with no gloves and put it in his pocket, it was nasty).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah the super strict one was a private school - only lasted a term there I hated it. But all the public schools I went to were pretty strict as well. I managed to hide at 16 a nose piercing retainer and two lip piercing retainers that I wasn #8217;t supposed to have at the last school before I left without getting caught. Ended up having to take the lip ones out for work for a while and have only recently in the last year been allowed to get more again because some jobs suck with them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Septums really shouldn #8217;t be flipped up and down during healing. You should pick whether to have it flipped up to heal or flipped down and keep it that way for the healing process otherwise it #8217;s going to cause the piercing trauma. If you can #8217;t get it down and want it down for the rest of your healing I recommend going back to your piercer if you are having trouble getting it down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At 2 months if you wanted it to be changed I would recommend going back to your piercer. It #8217;s still quite new and if you don #8217;t know how to get this style of jewellery out you are likely to cause the piercing site more trauma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I love having labret studs in. The first time I had my nose pierced I had the corkscrew ones and they just got pulled out all the time. Just had to scratch your face absentmindedly or dry your face and they would start to come out. It used to fall out in my sleep too and I would have to try and find the jewellery in my bed and push it back in the next day even when it was healing. A year or two later I got them both done and got labret studs and have had them since and now I forget they are there because they just don #8217;t come out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They can take 6-9 months to heal properly. Mine have been pierced over a month and I still have crusties too. A month is still very fresh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a decent sized clicker in and don #8217;t really have problems blowing my nose at all. I could only really think of it being really hard in the healing period, stretched septums or if your septum isn #8217;t pierced at the front of your nose where it is supposed to be but further back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends whether your piercer nicks any cartilage when they are doing the septum or not in my opinion. I #8217;ve have my septum pierced twice. The first time she just nicked some cartilage either at the top or bottom of my nose and that was the worst piercing I have ever had. It hurt so bad. It looked fine, it wasn #8217;t noticeably off but must have barely nicked some cartilage. Ended up taking it out for some reason after a while for a bit and got it repierced and this time it was completely in the sweet spot and was one of my least painful piercings. Nipples however were pretty painful for me but that first septum was worst. So for me my septum through the sweet spot hurt a lot lot less than my nipples. But if they nick any cartilage or pierce through cartilage and miss your sweet spot it could hurt more.</TEXT>
