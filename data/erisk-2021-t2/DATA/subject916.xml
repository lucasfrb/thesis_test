    <TITLE>very realistic and odd dreams after an LSD trip</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-18 02:20:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>i normally never remember my dreams and when i do, they are usually very outlandish and wild? After a 200ug LSD trip about a week ago, I started having intensely realistic and vivid dreams every night. These dreams almost always take place in my current and exact location. Sometimes these dreams are good, but most of the time they aren't. Are these types of dreams common after tripping?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. it #8217;ll be slightly longer of a trip but 1 tab of lsd was way less intense and underwhelming than a comparable dose of mushrooms 2. both are definitely intense, but strong visuals will be very enjoyable with the right set setting, and strong head spaces just make me feel tweaked out and insane 3. the only hallucinogenic drugs i #8217;ve done are lsd mushrooms and dxm so idk about all the research chemicals, but lsd is definitely the drug that  #8220;fucks you up #8221; the least. i was truly shocked at how much motor skill i had on a low dose of acid</TEXT>

    <TEXT>300 is a very big dose no matter how experience you are and everyone who says otherwise is either lying or binging on acid and need 300 just to trip also if you redosed after like an hour from the first tab, it probably didn #8217;t do anything, which is what i suspect you did since 300ug with no previous trips should blast your mind to mars and back as far as feeling cold and uncomfortable, eat well for a few days before the trip, and shower and change into fresh clothes before you drop the tabs. being cold happens you just gotta deal with that, for jaw clenching gum works great</TEXT>

    <TEXT>see a lot of hate for alcohol on this sub which i dont get 1. DRINK NICE STUFF. some shitty $5 handle of vodka is always going to be bad. Dont drink often and save up money for a nice bottle of scotch or some local craft beers and you'll see how much better it can be 2. PACE YOURSELF. seriously just drink responsibly, nurse a drink for 30-40 minutes and have a glass of water with you 3. DRINK WITH FRIENDS. talking to close friends or watching sports while staying in control is always a great time. dont drink alone and dont drink to escape alcohol is wonderful and i guarantee drinking responsibly leaves you with all your memories intact, no hangover, and no embarrassing moments</TEXT>

    <TITLE>my potentially controversial top 10 doors songs list</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-01 02:22:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think my favorite songs are very different than most peoples taste of the doors. I always thought The End was the most overrated song they made I love the doors, but personally enjoy listening to the early works of pink floyd and jimi hendrix a lot more \#10: People are Strange The first doors song I ever heard and will have a special place in my heart \#9: My Wild Love very very hypnotic song to listen to \#8: I Looked at You CAUSE ITS TOO LAAAAAAAAAAAATE and the false ending \#7: Strange Days the bassline on this song is incredible and I could listen to this on repeat for days \#6: Yes, The River Knows I really like the lyrics and the piano \#5: Love Me Two Times The organ part of this song plus its very fun to sing along to \#4: Five to One The aggressiveness of this song is really powerful to listen to \#3: Take it as it Comes I love the energy of this song, its really catchy and fun to sing a long to. The lyrics helped me get through my many month long existential crisis \#2: Spanish Caravan The flamenco guitar work here speaks for itself and the whole lifestyle of just wandering around Europe has always been a dream to me. This is one of the few songs where Krieger really shines on, a lot of doors songs arent very guitar heavy \#1: Universal Mind [Im the freedom man baby thats how lucky i am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYWz_9XktTA)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i just bought 10 20mg pellets of 4-ho-met, and I've never had any RC mushroom before One of my good friends wants to trip. I've read that 4-ho-met is similar to AL-LAD where it is mostly visual and doesnt give you as intense of a headspace. Is 20mg a good dose for a friend who's never tripped? I have experience with psychedelics, but mostly lsd. My only mushroom trip was 2 grams, but I've gone up to 400ug on LSD and my preferred dose is 200ug. Should I also start with 20mg? Or would it be underwhelming. Im looking for something around 200ug of lsd in intensity</TEXT>

    <TEXT>lsd = more dreamy, much more clarity, definitely easier to function or act sober, music is amazing on acid, you see really cool patterns and other distortions. it is a full day trip though mushrooms = more stoning, more lazy, can be confusing. lighter visuals but waaaaay brighter colors and vibrancy. more earthy, more introspective. music can sounds weird and creepy, or really really slow its easier to control a lsd trip. you can go hiking or for a walk if you want, you can look at trippy stuff on youtube and melt into pink floyd, you have a lot more energy</TEXT>
