    <TITLE>Advice needed...is it smart to transfer in the middle of a program?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-01 00:40:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I am currently going for my BSN at a university in NY. We start sophomore year with assessment/skills, but I am seriously starting to get concerned about the schools status. There has been multiple 'issues' since beginning, and I fear that things are going to get progressively worse as I further myself into the program. Kids are dropping like flies, and its just nuts. I know nursing is tough but when you're averaging a loss of 2-3 kids/week, its a tad concerning. So far, the program has been good, and most professors do CARE about you, but they have no idea what they're doing. Additionally, the school is operating on a very slim budget and just terminated a bunch of employees to 'mainstread' administration. I was just curious if anyone has experiencing with transferring out of a nursing program directly into another. If this is possible, would the school that accepts direct nursing transfers also be 'reputable'? Part of me just wants to get out here because Im worried about something bad happening in a few semesters, whereas the other part thinks just stay focused, stay on track, and keep your shit together to finish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a college student wrapping up my semester at a large, public institution. Our university has only one library dedicated to 'silent study' meaning no talking out loud, no eating, etc... A kid with loud and verbal ticks sat right next to me. He would shout random words out (sometimes inappropriate) but more often would slam the table/pens/papers etc really hard. A bunch of people would walk by or stare and were verbally frustrated. I asked the kid if he could consider going somewhere else and he did so without a problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recipe For the Chicken: In a large bag or bowl, combine the chicken and *seasoning along with 1 tablespoon oil. Marinate in the fridge for 20 minutes (or up to 48 hours). Heat chicken (3 large breast) for 45 minutes at 350 #176;F and chop into bite size pieces. If you #8217;d like to saut #233;, add a teaspoon of oil along with sliced bell peppers and onion. Saute for 3-4 minutes or until the veggies are tender. For the Rice: While the chicken is cooking, boil 2 cups water in a large pot over high heat. Once the water has boiled, add the rice and 1 teaspoon oil. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and reduce the heat to low and cook until the rice is tender and all the water is absorbed. Add in the cilantro and fluff rice with a fork. *seasoning; if you #8217;re running low on time you can just use taco seasoning. But if you want to make your own I used 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon sea salt ,1 teaspoon black pepper</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Ethical dilemma... RN treating prisoner on unit poorly.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-08 18:43:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I am a floor aide and a week or so ago we had a prisoner admitted to the unit. One RN is particular has been treating him very poorly. The PT will complain about being in pain, being very hungry, being cold, etc and she doesn #8217;t care. I try to do as much as I can like giving blankets, providing snacks, but as an aide there #8217;s only so much I can do. When I told the nurse the pt had 8/10 pain the RN said  #8220;and? #8221; And I said  #8220;he was wondering if he could get something for it #8221; and the she replies  #8220;if I can lower my morals to that of a criminals, then maybe, criminals typically don #8217;t need more drugs #8221;. And then when I gave him a few blankets she took 2 away (leaving him with one) citing safety concerns. Does anyone have any recommendations for what to do? I just feel so bad for this guy. I don #8217;t want any retaliation against me but I feel like I need to do something.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone have recommendations for a head lamp? One that last long (12 hr)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-19 12:23:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Our hospital has recently been audited by administration and the biggest complaint was noise and brightness at night. As a result, the hospital started a new initiative recently called  #8220;Code night #8221; (basically if a nurse calls  #8220;code night #8221; that means everyone needs to quiet down). To help with this the hospital turns of all lights from 11pm-7am with only the floor lights being on in the halls. All computers brightness must be turned down to the darkest setting and anything that generally emits light needs to be powered down or turned off. So, I thought maybe a head lamp would work while doing charting or med passes between that time. Any suggestions on what to purchase? Preferably long lasting (12 hr), LED, and comfortable bands for the head. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So... you need a root canal and you're freaking out. Well, I just got one, and let me tell you about my experience...</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-01 19:28:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>It. Is. Not. Nearly. As. Bad. As. People. Think. It. Is. Seriously. I am the biggest wimp when it comes to dentistry, but, my experience was not bad yesterday. So let me tell you about this 'procedure'. 99.5% was painless, and maybe 0.4% painful, and 0.1% excruciatingly bad. I used a dentist who did a very poor filling (per the words of my new dentist) in September. I complained to him three times between September to December about pain. He kept dismissing it as sensitivity and said not much could do, but if it was constantly causing discomfort I could have it extracted. Well, I didn't want that so I put up with it. This past weekend the pain became so unbearable I was basically crying. I got no sleep, I had to take a lot of pain killers to try and just mask it. It was possibility the worst pain I experienced in a long time (and I've had all four of my wisdom teeth removed + hernia surgery). So, this new dentist takes an X-ray and showed significant decay under the filling right along the nerves. He suggested RCT to save the tooth. Fortunately, I am covered by insurance so I did it. The initial novcaine shot to numb the tooth and tissue wasn't that bad (thats the 0.4% painful part). Then, it was just a lot of drilling and stuff. Once he reached the roots/nerves, he had to numb those, this is the 0.1% awful part. But novacaine has a **rapid onset** so before your dentist even removes the needle all your roots are numb. It will be a split second of horrible pain, after that, your entire tooth and nerves are numb and you will feel nothing at all. At that point they just file your roots destroying all the nerves turning them into empty canals and fill it with a cement/paste. This is all painless again, you'll feel nothing. They tell you what a great patient you are, take an x-ray, and you may be done. (Some will leave a temporary paste/filling and have you come back for a temp crown, others will just do the temp crown/core then. Typically it depends on patient stamina or the dentist schedule. Also, if you use an endodontist they typically will leave the temp crown/core for your general dentist). After the procedure, you will be numb so you're gonna feel okay. I was planning on skipping class (I am college student) but felt so fine I was able to go. By 8pm (novacaine is totally worn off at this point) I was also able to go to the gym and run for 2 miles. The only discomfort I had was biting down on my teeth (but it is not recommended you chew where your temp paste is, since it can break off-but if this happens they will simply just reapply it). Last night was the first time I was able to sleep throughout the night with no painkillers. Today it's like I'm a new person. I have zero pain in my tooth and couldn't be happier. SO, MY MAIN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS... Get the root canal!!!!!!!!!! For the amount of pain you are in now versus what a 'simple' 1- 1.5 hour procedure can do is astounding. Dentist are smart people, and medicine has progressed a looooooooooong way, so it truly isn't bad. If you have *any* questions I'd be happy to share my answers, just note I am not a dentist so it would be only my personal experience and recommendations from my dentist for my specific case. P.S. Novacaine is the numbing stuff they use, and an endodontist is a dentist whose specialty is in RCT (root canal therapy). Sometimes a general dentist will feel comfortable doing it, but others may recommend you to one. Use your best judgement when making this decision.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wait.. you find it offensive that OP would ask his patients if they #8217;re okay with a male provider when providing intimate care? That doesn #8217;t set male RNs to fail at all. If anything it makes them have a more humanistic outlook when providing care. If anything he #8217;s also following basic nursing protocols. You always ask a patient if you may touch them or examine them before actually doing so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He isn #8217;t starting a gender divide. He #8217;s literally following what he #8217;s taught in school. Like another commenter said, the RN probably didn #8217;t want to do it. From one nurse to another you should always be ensuring your patients comfort and that includes asking them things like if they #8217;re okay with an opposite sex provider. If you #8217;re a RN you #8217;ve been taught that many patients fear inconvenience the provider and will keep their mouth shut which they shouldn #8217;t have to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So our hospital recently  #8216;revamped #8217; our phone policy to absolutely no phones on the unit, they are only authorized in the break room. If you #8217;re caught with it, you #8217;re immediately suspended for two days. After a second time, it #8217;s termination without chance of rehire. The most crazy part (in my opinion) is that they said that if we were the  #8216;emergency contact #8217; for our kids/significant others/etc to give them the hospital main number, then it would be up to the discretion of the nurse manager to determine the severity of the situation and whether or not it would be brought to our attention. This floors me. If my kid or SO needs to get in contact with me I want them to know I #8217;ll always be there, not just some of the time. This seems borderline illegal too as the managers are not the legal guardian or parent of my child. Your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately I got screwed next semester and now have two clinicals: MedSurg I and OB/Peds. This is just how my school is doing it as the hospital only is offering the rotation in the fall now (and next fall is critical care). I #8217;m super super nervous about the workload (both are 6 credits). So any advice or prays are appreciated. Additionally I want to get started over the summer with just light reading / note taking and would love to see how some other students do it. So if you #8217;re willing to send a sample of notes (eg just a chapter) I would be so so thankful. If you #8217;re reluctant to give a free sample I #8217;m willing to pay if we can negotiate something fair. Thanks all!! #128156;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this probably common but I have to vent about a real horrible patient. This was a 89y old leaving our unit to go to rehab. From day 1 she had a real attitude (except the MD of course). Today she had an absolute meltdown. She wanted to get changed to leave (at 3pm - it was 11am). She called me four times in 15 minutes (pt are given the RN and tech #) and each time I explained I would be in just a few minutes and that I #8217;m helping another pt. When I got in there, she said  #8220;Hey you piece of shit. I told you to come in here right NOW. Jesus Christ, you fucking people. #8221; I calmly replied that I was busy and couldn #8217;t get to her and had other patients. She said  #8220;I don #8217;t care about them or you, I want to leave now, so go help me get my pants on, I don #8217;t want to have a conversation. #8221; So I just knelt next to her and started getting her changed. She said  #8220;Yea that #8217;s right. It #8217;s your job you bitch, don #8217;t ever make me wait again. #8221; Honestly this week was already SO stressful and I have a newborn at home and all this stuff so I just said  #8220;I #8217;ll be right back #8221; and sent a tech in (he was fine and knew he #8217;d be yelled at). But come on...this is the shit we have to put with and it #8217;s ridiculous. I don #8217;t care who or what you are, treat others with respect you miserable bully. Vent over</TEXT>

The pole went from under the armpit thru the back of the neck. Remarkably it missed the brachial plexus and subclavian artery! So in the end this was more a basic removal and bleeding control (or as basic as an injury like this can get). Source: medicaltalks</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having four rails up should not be considered a restraint</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-27 19:04:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is one the most annoying things ever. Having four rails up in a bed should not be considered a restraint. Having this determination prevents staff from truly protecting patients. Even if a patient is 1-on-1, they can quickly jump out of bed before the sitter stops them. Four rails is (in my experience) a very effective way to keep them in their bed while being the least invasive or drastic 'treatment'. Even the mittens seem more restrictive than four rails. Its just annoying that we give them the opportunity to jump out and trip/fall over some silly rule.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re right, but the approach is wrong. Most times people struggle with happiness due to mental illness. According to the NIMH, 17.3M people in the US report having major depression. Of that, 13.1% of 18-25 reported having major depression - the highest percentage of all groups surveyed. I think mental health issues are really set aside in college and were told to just do well in our classes, get good grades, and do internships. However, this is not possible most of the time for those with major depression. Perhaps we can make ourselves better off by focusing on mental health issues and figuring out a way to  #8216;open #8217; the discussion about. I guarantee if we do that, we #8217;ll see a general increase in happiness of college students.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; but seeing that I caused it FALSE. You did not cause it; your patient did. Your patient attacked you, that is NOT something anyone could've predicted or prevented. You have a right to defend yourself. I understand that when a patient injures themselves (accidentally or intentionally), we always ask "What could **I** have done to prevent that?" and 99% of the time the answer is nothing. You did what anyone else really could have. As others have said, safety first. As advice, if you really think your patient will be an immediate threat to your safety, leave him and call for help/security. If he falls, hurts himself, etc, then while that is unfortunate, its just one person being hurt rather than two. This happens, and will continue to happen, dont beat yourself up about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have an iPhone XS. It works really well for many reasons. 1) Maps with live traffic. If we have to get to a call in an unfamiliar place maps will take us the quickest route. 2) Storage. Can download many, many apps. 3) Battery. Unlike my old iPhone, the battery is phenomenal. It #8217;ll last all shift and get to maybe 40% by the end of 8-12 hours. 4) Phone/speaker. The speaker is great if I have to call the hospital or med control since half the time our radios don #8217;t work so we can either use a 2007 flip phone or personal one, so I use mine. It #8217;s also nice to just have the local ED/trauma center numbers in my phone so if I #8217;m busy with a code or trauma patient I can say  #8220;Siri, call xxx trauma center #8221; and work/talk. 5) Just overall a nice phone to play games on, watch videos, read, etc when you have a free minute. Certainly expensive but definitely worth the purchase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m sorry but I don #8217;t think medics (with only two years training) should be doing field amputations. There is a lot to consider when doing these (blood vessels, nerves, bone, surrounding trauma, etc) and are obviously always a last resort. A trained surgeon (with 8-10 years of education and training) is probably better equipped for this job. Plus god forbid you have a Ricky Rescue who does this and the person loses a salvageable limb.</TEXT>

I work in Manhattan for EMS. **Here #8217;s some info...** \-Potential cause began with a manhole fire occurred at 64th x West End impacting a transmission line. \-250+ jobs (911 calls) are being held in North Midtown. \-NYC just activated their EOC \-NYPD called for Level 1 Immobilization for crowd control at Columbus Circle \-There is approximately 42K without power (possible restoration of 10:30pm tonight) \-MTA advising public to avoid using subways, widespread service impacts \-FDNY units from Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn are being called into Manhattan. **EDIT (8:40pm):** \-Unfortunately the number of outages has increased to approximately 44.5K (because of this restoration has been pushed to approximately midnight tonight). \-FDNY Division 3 is setting up Field command and Unified Command Post at W 64 x West End **EDIT (10:30pm):** \-Uplifting news...so far our 911 calls have been mostly rescues for those trapped in elevators (thankfully, no injuries). \-ConEd continues to estimate all power will be restored by around midnight \-Subways will NOT run immediately after power is on; they will 'test run' with empty cars first. MTA service continues to be unaffected. \-ICYMI, approximately six sectors were knocked out, two were brought back, the next four will hopefully be brought on by midnight. **EDIT (11:15pm):** \-ConEd just reported to FDNY Field Command they lost another two sectors, number of outages around 70K at this time. Possible restoration 3am Sunday morning. **EDIT (11:45pm):** \-Both sectors from the 11:15pm update are brought back on. Total out is now approximately 24K, estimated restoration around 3am</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-08-08 15:33:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I #8217;m a tech on a MedSurg floor. Generally we try to make sure we #8217;re not in the room when the MD is there to avoid any distractions while the MD and PT talk. Anyway I was cleaning a patient and the MD came in (didn #8217;t even knock). She said (to me),  #8220;hurry up please I need to chat with Jane #8221; so I rushed and finished. As the doctor sat down she knocked her coffee all over the floor and as I was tossing away the soiled linen away and washing my hands she said  #8220;excuse me - clean this up #8221; (and pointed to the coffee). There was a lot off coffee, under the bed, chair, table, etc. So I asked  #8220;can you please help me? #8221; (as I #8217;m on all fours trying to wipe it up). She then said (with a snarky laugh)  #8220;Wait.. did you ask ME to clean it up? Honey, no, if you need help call EVS, that #8217;s not my job. #8221; So instead of calling them I just kept cleaning and left. I was super upset to be talked to that way but wasn #8217;t sure if it #8217;s reportable or not. I know MDs are busy but that seemed out of line to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA/Reminder: Never stick your finger into a patients mouth!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-12 15:17:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like this is obvious, but after last night I feel the need to reiterate it. Yesterday we had an aggressive patient (we work on a medical unit and of course get the occasional psych patient. Last night he began going crazy (and I don #8217;t want to sound insensitive), he was throwing things, screaming  #8220;theyre killing me! #8221;, etc. After cornering him back to his room he began trying to swallow various objects from the room (eg gauze pads, keyboard pieces, nystatin cream, etc). Anyway we called a code grey/security. Everyone comes and we #8217;re able to get him to the bed and have all limbs restrained. Unfortunately, here #8217;s where it goes down. A nurse said she learned the  #8220;finger-sweep method #8221; to remove objects from the oral cavity (despite this being old practice). She was given the false pretense he was under control bc all of us in the room but forgot his mouth was totally open. As soon as she tried to remove the stuff from his mouth he just bit, and would. not. let. go. Eventually he was able to bite her distal phalanx off of her index finger. This entire incident could #8217;ve been avoided and was traumatic for the RN, the staff, and of course the patient. The ER physician said it couldn #8217;t be attached due to the risk of infection so now this RN is left with a permanent reminder of this patient. Of course she #8217;s going to try and press charges and he was transferred to another facility but be careful please... NEVER put YOUR safety above anyone else #8217;s. I know we want to protect our patients but sometimes we just can #8217;t and that #8217;s okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This question has been asked probably fifty times in the last week. Here is the general consensus... **50% chance we WILL reopen and have normal classes** **50% chance we WILL NOT reopen and have online classes** For real though... it all depends on where things are in August. I know they are worried about a resurgence come late summer/early Fall (and no vaccine developed by then since that takes at *minimum* 12-18mo)... but this first wave will surely be done/under control by mid August.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am going to try and remain discrete but I work rural EMS with a bunch of vollies. I got my intermediate which allows for intubations. The EMT-B is not taught those skills. The call was for a 'sick person' c/o chest pain. Upon arrival was a 94yo male INTUBATED, CPR in progress. I look around and its the driver, EMT, and PD. I asked who intubated, the EMT said 'me'. When I asked why, he said "I had no choice, I needed to save his life." (mind you I arrived about 3-4 minutes after them). Also, we are being *extremely* cautious with intubating due to COVID. Needless to say, the 94YOM (who was also hx of COPD, CHF, Obese) died at the scene (we no longer transport cardiac arrest). I documented everything (since my card matters more to me than his). But I wanted your input, will this EMT be charged? The only thing he has going is that the intubation was done correctly but I really couldn't/can't defend him.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-22 22:31:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Over the last weeks there has been ***numerous*** discussions about what people would do if the Fall 2020 had to be delivered in a remote fashion. Many people on those discussions said; "I would drop out", "I would take the semester off", "I would withdraw for the year", "I'd take a gap year", and so on... and to be frank, I think most of you are making a big mistake. While online is of course much, *much* different than in person, we are still being delivered content. Several universities have announces *contingency* *plans* to move online **if needed.** That being said, the content delivery method and integrity of our work should be more structured. Many professors would likely be forced to use Zoom or BBB. Additionally, they may move to more writing-assignments than just T/F, MC, etc. Taking a gap year, semester off, etc can set you back from graduation and have a harsher economic impact than you think. For example, my major (nursing) has courses available only certain semesters. That being said, if my university were to switch to online-only and I took fall off, I #8217;d immediately become a fifth year #8230; thus delaying my chance a  #8216;real #8217; salary by a whole year. Also, if we're not able to open back up in the Fall 2020, that could mean there are still restrictions in place. So, truthfully, academics may keep you more grounded. Having to commit to a strict schedule of being on your laptop at your desk daily could help you structure your day more (e.g. get up, get dressed, eat something, and so on). I'm fortunate enough all my professors are using Zoom, so I have had great structure to my day. Lastly, depending on your institution, you may force them to close. While many aren #8217;t so hooked up on their college/university to the point of shelling tons of money, if they have a massive drop/decline in enrollment, many will close. This is not  #8216;prediction #8217; for many, either, this is a guarantee, especially for smaller, private liberal arts colleges. I think we all can agree things would be worse if we had to find a different college, niche, friends, and so on. Whether this post gave a new/fresh perspective or a good laugh from disagreement, let me know what you think, I love a good discussion (:</TEXT>

I wanted some insight from fellow nurses (especially NYC, where the video originated). * Anesthesiologist misplaced an ET tube... causing a pneumothhorax with unilateral rise/fall, refused a CXR.... pt dead * Nurse mistaken a long-acting insulin for short acting insulin, bottomed out their sugar... pt dead * Resident physician defibbed a patient with sinusbrady (40s) and pushed NE... pt dead * Nurse misplaced NG tube and filled pt lungs with feed... resident refused antibiotic tx and now pt has full blown pneumonia.... pt dead * Nurse fell asleep at nurses station and didn't give next prescribed pressor... pt now brain dead (same nurse now running a CCRT machine for first time and said she would figure out along the way) * Nobody cares and "everyone" is watching these patients die * All patients on tubes are automatically sedated on vents * Every time a day shift weans pt off vents, night shift puts them back and "maxes out" their vent settings (claims they are not synchronizing well) * Compares the situation to 'nazi-Germany' and putting them into gas chambers * No one knows when they die; she is often assigned pt who are already dead * Pt who was becoming acidotic was allowed to continue to detoeriate, at the last minute (after gaining 20lbs of water weight) was given 5L of bicarb.. went into HF... pt dead * "They are literally murdering these people" A lot of these claims highlight gross negligence and medical mismanagement. Every time the RN reaches out to advocacy groups, directors, etc.. her request fall on deaf ears. Part of me *wants* to believe there is no way this can all be true and some is either exaggerated or false. But her emotions and stories seem real. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-10 00:40:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>My class has four exams. The first two (grades 80  amp; 82) were taken in the classroom. The second two (82  amp; 90) were at home. I guess the professor thinks a 90 was way too far fetched for me to achieve on a unit exam and accused me of cheating... but I didn #8217;t. He emailed me and said that it seems unlikely for someone to score that (keep in mind exams are just 50 MC questions...) Anyway I can prove to him I wasn #8217;t? Is this even that big of a jump? I just genuinely studied a bit more for the fourth exam</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having some serious FOMO from my internship, any advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-29 22:08:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm fortunate enough to still have my internship this summer (working as a nurse extern in an ICU), but am having some bad FOMO from my friends): My hours vary 7am-3pm or 7am-7pm, and alternating weekends. It started June 3 and goes through August 15. I am not allowed more than two consecutive days off and no vacation. Because of the long shifts and strict scheduling, I keep missing out on stuff with my friends. This past weekend they all went to their lake house for a fun weekend and this upcoming holiday weekend theyre camping (but I cant attend since they leave late Thursday and I work Friday). While I am grateful to have a job and make experiences/money, it just sucks to wake up at 5:30am and see all your friends snaps at bonfires, parties, etc. Anyone else have FOMO?? How do you deal with it?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-14 19:12:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m currently a 21yr old guy living in NY. Last summer (from early June 2019 to mid August 2019) I worked as an intern in a hospital. My first check was a physical one (print out), all subsequent ones were direct deposit. A few weeks ago I was cleaning out my drawers and realized I never opened my first paycheck. It was still in the envelope and signed/sealed. I double checked my deposits from last year and it was never cashed (nor was the amount on that check in my deposit history because that was 1 week of pay, all other weeks included 2 weeks pay). I called payroll and they stated to send them the check. Yesterday I received a call and they told me it was  #8220;not outstanding #8221; and I wouldn #8217;t be getting a new one. I know for sure I did not cash this check. I even took it to my bank and they said because it wasn #8217;t signed/endorsed there #8217;s no way it was cashed. Any advice on what to do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Serious] Are colleges allowed to disable every water faucet/fountain around campus?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-30 18:44:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I go to a college in NY and literally *every* water fountain/faucet is disabled across campus. Every building that has academic instruction in it, the libraries, study areas, etc all do not have water fountains anymore due to COVID-19. Even in our residence halls they have taken apart the sinks within our kitchens. The only place to get water is from the sink tap in bathrooms which is unsanitary and disgusting. I feel like there has to be some type of alternative or solution to this. I understand the idea of disabling them, but all our water fountains are also 'water bottle fillers' which are touchless and rely on sensors to get water dispensed. Also, is it legal to not have any drinkable water supply in buildings?</TEXT>

I cannot make it back to my residence hall in that 30 minutes and since I do not have a meal plan cannot enter the dining hall to fill my bottle</TEXT>
