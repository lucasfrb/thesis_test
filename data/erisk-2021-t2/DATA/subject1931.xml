    <TITLE>Telling small white lies in a relationship and wondering about their past.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-03 14:57:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ask my boyfriend a question about his past and instead of telling the truth he tends to tell a small white lie. The truth, the real answer wouldn #8217;t even hurt me. I know he does this to stop my feelings getting hurt but it #8217;s the white lie that hurts/upsets me. Even though it #8217;s not a big lie the small ones build up even though they #8217;re not really bad lies. Why does he do this and is it a really bad thing? Should I be wondering/interested about his past (with other girls)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You just have to explain to her how much she means to you but of that #8217;s how she feels there not much I think you could do to persuade her. Usually those relationships don #8217;t work out as you go from being close friends to dating and those feeling are different. Rn you might want to save it but maybe you want to date a girl you can get to know because you guys basically skip the getting to know stage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m 18 and he is 20, my first boyfriend lied a lot and cheated so I do have trust issues. I think I #8217;m interested in his past because I want to make sure I won #8217;t be hurt again. I do overreact and overthink but lying is the only thing that makes me do so:(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Boyfriend being friendly with my mean friend.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 01:22:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a friend who I introduced to my boyfriend on a game. We played together for awhile with lots of other people. Recently this girl and my other friend have been quite mean to me and left me out and made me really upset when I #8217;m going through a really hard time. We #8217;ve not played on this game for awhile but one of my boyfriends friends invited her to this game today. I didn #8217;t speak to her the whole time but my boyfriend would answer her questions and if she did well in a game he #8217;d comment on it knowing she makes me cry a lot. Should I be upset? I know it #8217;s silly and it #8217;s a bit deeper than this but I tried to sum it up.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My boyfriend said he blocked this girl he used to be FWB with and I found out yesterday night he didn #8217;t actually block her</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-29 11:25:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>He used to be fwb with this girl but I always had suspicions they were more than that. It just made me feel uncomfortable so I asked him to block her on his phone and he did (after hesitation for awhile), he then got a new phone and she messaged him and he replied to her messages but then said he was going to block her after he replied. I found out she wasn #8217;t actually blocked and he #8217;d just deleted the messages between them. I know he #8217;d never cheat on me but can any one help me feel better about this situation?</TEXT>
