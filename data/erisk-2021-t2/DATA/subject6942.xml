    <TITLE>Evolution movesets, are they really random?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-02 17:47:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today I evolved Machamp and Honchkrow and both got the best movesets: Machamp Counter / Dynamic Punch Honchkrow Peck / Sky Attack  #8203; Is it I was very lucky, or some moves have bigger chance to roll than the others? Yes, 2006 paper states its 100% random, but maybe something changed?

    <TEXT>So if pokemon has 2 fast and 4 charge moves, your chance for ideal moveset (dark or fly) is 12.5%. So without having any TM #8217;s you have to evolve 8 pokemons. But from my experience i have about 50% chance on getting the right set. For example I evolved 4 Honch #8217;s, got two dark and two flying (had to use only one fast tm on dark one). From three machams, one got both bad moves, second two got counter / dynamic punch. Don #8217;t you think were is some pattern?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dialga, which I should max - attack vs IV</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-05 18:06:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today i cought IV98 Dialga and for a moment was super happy, until i saw these stats: IV98, A14, D15, S15. I have another Dialga with IV87, A15, D11, S13. I know, attack is the most important, but which of these two are better? IV98, right? Accoring to [pokebattler.com](https://pokebattler.com) IV87 Dialga with 15 attack beats IV98 Dialga with 14 attack every single time... Are other stats does not matter? Should in this case I max IV87 Dialga instead of nearly perfect IV98?  #8203; P.S. I will continue to raid, it's just a hypotetical questions about attacks importance in the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Scripts are in python. For example to create your own "Top Watched Movies of The Week" list you would need these scripts: trakt.top.watched.list.py - gt; main script movieinfo.py - gt; module for getting movie ratings trakt.py - gt; module for trakt.tv access config.py.example - gt; rename to config.py, and follow instruction for getting trakt client id and secret Install additional python modules required and change trakt.top.watched.list.py for different filtering options: if (movieinfo.local\_ratings\[imdb\]\['year'\]  gt; (datetime.today().year - 2) and movieinfo.local\_ratings\[imdb\]\['imdbRating'\]  gt;= 6 and movieinfo.local\_ratings\[imdb\]\['imdbVotes'\]  gt;= 5000 and metaRating  gt;= 50 and rottRating  gt;= 50): P.S. I propably should put these in config file for easier customization. If have more questions, PM me. P.S.

The only app witch I found to support this functionality is [ottplayer.es](https://ottplayer.es) But this app has very limited EPG functionality, you cannot add custom EPG xml files, and default support is very limited. Without EPG its very hard to use arhive (catch up) function. Any recommendations? Every app I tried has no ability to wach prerecorded archives. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The site collects ratings from IMDb, Trakt, TMDb, Letterboxd, RottenTomatoes, Audience, and Metacritic. It allows you to filter movies by any of those ratings or vote numbers with additional filters like genre, certification, and more. You can even filter movies by your favorite actor or director. After you are happy with a filtered list, you can create [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) list witch when be auto-updated every 24 hours. Any suggestions welcome. r/mdblist [https://mdblist.com](https://mdblist.com/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, thanx for your suggestion. Currently, I was unable to get any API access to get this info. Justwatch didn't answer to my request and reelgood asks money for API access. However, I'm trying to do my best and started some info scrapping. Currently, you can filter movies by streaming service for Netflix and Amazon in Additional Filters - gt; Streaming. Not all movies are scrapped atm it will take some time, so filtering will not include all movies. I will search for more ways to improve it and add more services over time.</TEXT>

If you exclude them, where is a chance you will never know about them being on streaming service at all.

    <TEXT>Hello. Yes, it's not a full replica of tmdb database. I do not include movies without matching trakt and imdb id's, since I need trakt ID for lists and IMDb id for ratings scrapping. I also ignore movies without any ratings/votes. But if you find some movie, which should be present, you can open URL: [https://mdblist.com/movie/tt0000000](https://mdblist.com/movie/tt7556122) with proper imdb id, and this movie will be scanned and added in next refresh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Added sorting by imdb votes. Will add some more in the future. Regarding random sorting, I tested, it works, but it will not work with lists and limit parameter, since every time a random list would be created. It would add more confusion than benefit. So I'm not adding this at least for now. Regarding grid view... ok, I added buttons to switch between detailed and grid view. Try it out and let me know if this looks ok (if grid view would have big spaces, you need to refresh cached css file. Open url, hit refresh, and it should fix it: [https://mdblist.com/static/style.css](https://mdblist.com/static/style.css) )</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it would be possible to go through the list and add Hallmark tags. But is it really so hard to filter them out? I imported your provided trakt list as an external list, and the best-rated movies have a score of 59. While most of the movie's score is below 40. This is because movies have good ratings, but too few votes, and the overall score is calculated exactly to counter low votes movies. So if you add just a score filter  gt;= 60, you eliminate all Hallmark movies in one go :) Please tell me if this is enough, and do we really need another tag job?</TEXT>
