    <TITLE>MDMA compared to pills?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-16 14:22:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>How would you guys describe the difference between the high achieved from MDMA crystal and the high from a pill? I always preferred pills as I found them to be a cleaner high, even though that doesn #8217;t make sense as pills are likely less pure than MDMA crystals. Anyways, just wondering what you guys thought of this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The grisly side of growing up on a farm.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-30 14:35:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are things that have to be done on a farm for the welfare of the animals and it can be unbelievably horrific and brutally necessary. One of the worst of these things is using a saw to remove twisted horns that are slowly growing into the head of the animal. This horn deformation thankfully only happens to a very small percentage of animals. It needs to be done, otherwise the cow will die a slow, painful death as the horn grows into her head more and more every day. To counter this, my dad uses a saw to remove the last couple of inches every few months. Today was the day that had to be done again. I have always been extremely sensitive towards animals, I have an overactive imagination and don #8217;t even kill flies. If the cat gets into my bed and wants to sleep in the middle, I let her, moving myself to the side of the bed. It #8217;s always been how I am and I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a bad thing but it has always made life on a farm extremely hard. I easily grow attached to animals, seeing them as equal to humans and hate to see them undergo any pain. I told my dad that I didn #8217;t want to do this job but I understood the necessity of it and the impossibility of him doing it alone and thought, it may as well be me to help so I can insure the cow goes through as little pain as possible. The cow had to be tied to the gate and held by the nose so that my dad could saw through the horn, not even 2 inches from her eye. I can #8217;t imagine how horrific it must #8217;ve been for the animal; screaming and bellowing, contracting every muscle, her mouth open and tongue elongated in utter terror. There were two cows to be treated and I couldn #8217;t even make it through one before I had to leave, our neighbors helped dad finish the cows, it probably took them less than 20 minutes and the cows will benefit from it for months, before it has to be done again. I #8217;m writing this from my bed, in tears, depressed and feeling guilty. I am a meat eater yet I see so much wrong with how we, as a species, treat animals. My dad is a really good person and an excellent role model, he understands my sensitivities and isn #8217;t angry at me for not being able to do it. He takes excellent care of his family and animals and is what I see as the idyllic farmer and father. But days like this put me in mind of all of the horrific factory farms around the world and the millions of animals suffering like this every day and it makes me physically sick. I needed to get this off of my chest today. Please treat animals with respect and hold no illusions to where your meat comes from. An animal had to live, suffer and die for your steak. Buy from your local butcher, not supermarkets whenever possible. Local butchers buy from local farmers, not big factory farms. Be kind to animals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That shit irks me so bad. And don #8217;t tell me to try it, I #8217;ve tried it. Multiple times. It completely ruins whatever tasty, baked confectionery you #8217;re eating. Biscuit goes all soggy, like baby food. It #8217;s as though someone chewed it up and then formed it back into the biscuit. Soggy, disgusting piece of biscuit shit. It also ruins the cup of tea/coffee or whatever beverage it may be. You #8217;ve not only got a soggy, shit biscuit but you #8217;ve got countless crumbs sitting in the cup. May as well chew up the biscuit and spit it into the tea. Fucking hell man. And I also won #8217;t accept that shit people do where they take a bite of the biscuit and then a cheeky sip of tea to accompany it in your mouth. Get in the fucking bin if you do that shit. Electric chair and I #8217;m not fucking around. Creating a slurry of disappointment in your infantile mouth. The only exception I have to this, and I mean the ONLY exception is Oreo #8217;s and milk. That shit is a classic and before you call me a hypocrite, that shit is a classic combination. It #8217;s like MDMA and house music, just better combined. It #8217;s made to be, it #8217;s a cookies and cream flavored biscuit. Cream and milk are basically the same thing. I #8217;m done for today, this raised my blood pressure too much, I need a cup of tea, maybe a biscuit on the side.</TEXT>

Like many of you, my family is not very weed tolerant and the way my house is set up it #8217;s basically impossible for me to have a smoke, which is shit because this is otherwise the perfect time to do so, when we have nothing to do but sit around watching Netflix and play video games.

    <TEXT>Yes, that #8217;s true that we are top of the food chain but we live in the 21st century and we have never had a larger abundance of alternative protein sources to meat. We just don #8217;t need to kill animals in their billions to survive. We can live perfectly healthy, (arguably healthier), lives off of plant based diets so I just don #8217;t see a need to eat meat. And I don #8217;t think that people not eating meat is altering natures greatest rule. It #8217;s not like vegans are out there preventing lions from eating antelope in the wild or anything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So we have to eat meat every single day because that #8217;s nature #8217;s rule and it can #8217;t possibly be broken? You say that so long as we are thankful to the spirit of the animal there is no wrongdoing. That is ridiculous. Factory farmer pigs live their entire lives in tiny unit cages barely big enough to stand, this is done on purpose so they don #8217;t waste energy. Calves are taken from their mothers the moment they are born. You are saying this is all completely fine so long as we are thankful to their spirit? You #8217;re literally saying that you think animals would be offended if we stopped eating them, this is literally the plot of the  #8220;Lisa the Vegetarian #8221; episode of The Simpson #8217;s. I #8217;m not saying you have to stop eating meat, people can do what they want. It is a fact that it is environmentally wreckless to eat meat multiple times a day every day of the week when it is entirely unnecessary. That is fact. I also personally believe that it #8217;s morally wrong but I don #8217;t think people should be banned from doing it as of now.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cutting the crusts off your sandwich is stupid and wasteful.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 13:45:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>People who don #8217;t eat the crust on their bread are immature and have the mental age of a 7 year old. It #8217;s all bread it #8217;s all edible and the crust tastes better than the doughy centre. You get more food if you eat the crust. When you cut it off you #8217;re reducing the size of your sandwich by like 20%. It #8217;s also idiotically wasteful. If you throw away the crust off of every sandwich you make that #8217;s just countless loaves of bread wasted. This issue is peak 21st century privileged consumerism.</TEXT>

Strong walls are essential and, by getting the most expensive thing done first you can spend the last couple days at this townhall saving up for your next set of walls because you #8217;ll already have em done.

THE WHOLE DEVELOPED WORLD HAS THE SAME FREEDOM YOU DO EXCEPT WE #8217;RE JUST NOT BRAINWASHED. The only way they have more freedom is in guns, because the rest of the world is smart enough to realize that more guns mean more gun deaths and American guns laws are made by the NRA who literally own the government.

    <TEXT>1. Yes, the reasons for school shootings isn #8217;t guns. But guns allow these people to commit far greater destruction than they could without guns. They #8217;re using things that were designed to kill as many people as efficiently as possible. 2. Yeah this is an issue. America is so insanely obsessed with guns that you have dug yourself a hole that is very hard to get out of. That doesn #8217;t mean you shouldn #8217;t try though. And it isn #8217;t that much money for the richest nation in the world considering how much you spend on military. 3. What are you even talking about here? If the chances of getting killed by guns are as low as you say, surely the chances of an anaesthesiologist fucking up are infinitely lower. Utterly ridiculous point that takes legitimacy from your whole argument. 4. If you #8217;re willing to bring your country to civil war over guns you have been entirely brainwashed by the NRA. Guns are not worth more than the lives of actually human people. The NRA have so much to gain from you thinking like this, literally billions to gain. 5. I don #8217;t even know what point your trying to make here. The UAE, UK and Australia are all better, more civilised countries than America? We already knew that.</TEXT>

The amount participants I #8217;m seeing is very inspirational but there #8217;s a few contradictory ideas in going around and a meeting platform would help alleviate this.

    <TEXT>Yes, I used to not like hunting before I learned more about it but I am in favour of hunting, it #8217;s much more humane than most farms. The animal lives it #8217;s life in the wild as it should. Animals like deer are often culled anyway due to population issues (mostly caused by human interference with predators) so at least when hunters kill them their meat is used. One deer could feed a family for months. Far more compassionate and environmentally responsible way to consume meat.</TEXT>

And slaughterhouses, animals like cows and pigs are intelligent, they know that slaughterhouses are not good places for them. They may spend days there before being killed. Hunting is preferable as the animal does not even know it #8217;s being stalked until it is shot and hopefully killed quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Humans are always invading animals territory. Every time forests are cut down and houses are built we are invading their territory. I #8217;ll give you an example, here in Ireland when the British colonized us they murdered all of our wolves as they were a symbol of Irish freedom, the lack of wolves lead to an overpopulation of deer. Too many deer = not enough food/space for said deer. We cull deer to protect the deer population as a whole, (it sounds contradictory but it #8217;s true), not to make life easier for humans. Humans should be making life easier for other animals, not ourselves. I grew up on a farm and many farmers treat their animals right, but it #8217;s still not the same as the animal living in the wild. It is almost always preferable for an animal to live in the habitat it was Naturally born to be in.</TEXT>

He also liked to eat about half of said pasta and then just leave it sitting in the kitchen getting nice and furry with mould until it stunk up the kitchen so bad one of us told him to clean it or just left it outside the back door. Dude also liked to boil whole chickens, for hours. That never smelled good and he didn #8217;t use extractor fan so the entire house stank of boiled chicken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Brits did it because they viewed the Irish as sub human. In ancient Irish folklore wolves were mystical creatures with almost supernatural powers (where do you think Game of Thrones got inspiration for their Dire Wolves?), and killing all the wolves was another way to crush the spirits of the Irish people during the 800 years the British oppressed us. In the imperialist British mind, it made sense, no matter how evil it was there was nothing too evil for the Brits. Look it up, you #8217;ll see that there has been a movement to start reintroducing Irish wolves into the wild here, although it likely won #8217;t happen due to the impact it could have on farming. It would take millions of years for foxes to evolve to the point where they #8217;d hunt deer. And they likely don #8217;t need to do it since they are hunting enough smaller creatures like rabbits to sustain their population.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes correct, and although it sounds like a small amount, in the global context that is extremely drastic, a change of even 3 degrees Celsius threatens the majority of ocean life. A change of 3 degrees Celsius can and will cause a massive extinction event. A change of a couple of degrees causes melting of ice caps, which means reduced salt levels in the oceans which changes the conditions needed for ocean life. [This is already happening.](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/58/with-a-pinch-of-salt/) Part of the reason we know this is because it #8217;s happened before. The last great temperature change that occurred millions of years ago was only an increase of 10 degrees Celsius, yet it caused Earth to lose 80% of its oceans. Part of the reason this anti-climate change argument annoys me is because it is funded by fossil fuel companies, meat production companies etc, companies who have massive amounts of money to lose if people start becoming more environmentally conscious. They have every economical reason to spread misinformation and that is precisely what they #8217;re doing. They are spreading lies to preserve their profits. This is not a theory one can subscribe to or a debatable topic, it is fact. [Source.](https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying)</TEXT>

Even the link you posted supports my point. And research you have done yourself by looking outside your window and seeing what weather it is is not credible and not information you should base your opinion on global warming on. Listen to the scientists who have spent decades performing field research and analysing data and soil and ocean samples to come to these conclusions. Listen to the scientists. A change of 3 degrees in *average global ocean temperature* absolutely does threaten ocean life. This is a fact, please check the sources I linked they have the facts listed.</TEXT>

I can understand why people might want to own a handgun, in a country where there #8217;s more guns than people you #8217;re kind of trapped into owning one.

When you vote for guns you are also voting for guns to be more accessible to people who want to commit massacres, that #8217;s how your wish to own a gun harms others. You can #8217;t use the mental health argument because so many other countries have mental health issues far worse than America. We watch the same movies, play the same video games, listen to the same music but we don #8217;t have mass shootings for the simple reason that we don #8217;t have guns.

    <TEXT>Fair point but it #8217;s far more necessary for most people to own a car than a gun, but that #8217;s not a strong argument since it #8217;s very situationally dependent. And I don #8217;t like the knife argument because knives are completely different since they are actually a tool that has a million uses. I think that what you #8217;re saying in the first paragraph is evident of part of the bigger problem in American media, and that #8217;s fear mongering. The news is constantly broadcasting murder and violence and gun crime and political extremism so people are (whether it #8217;s consciously or subconsciously) convinced that they need a gun for personal protection. But again, I don #8217;t know you so perhaps you do, but in general the home invasion argument is rather blown out of proportion. And you #8217;d have to be a pretty dumb criminal to break into a home while the homeowner is home, most criminals watch their targets and attack when no one is home because you #8217;re much less likely to be caught. Yes I agree that suicides push up the numbers but I think an important point to make is that someone is far more likely to succeed in their suicide attempt when guns are so widely available than when they aren #8217;t, so the gun control issue fits here too. I had a conversation with someone about this on r/progun before but he completely ignored this point when I made it and just kept calling me retarded when I was trying to have a conversation with him, (you are far more civil though so I #8217;d like to hear a pro gun persons perspective on this). Yes you #8217;re right that banning guns wouldn #8217;t stop people having guns, that #8217;s entirely correct. However, in my country (Ireland) it is very very rare to see a gun and if someone is caught with an illegal gun it is literally national news, as are shootings which are also very rare. The problem is that America #8217;s gun culture has gone so far that I don #8217;t think banning guns would work, the black market would just have far too many guns to redistribute.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Humans and animals are equal. Nobody has the right to take another life unnecessarily, whether it #8217;s human or animal.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-07 10:54:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Humans have no more of a right to life than any other creature on this planet. I don #8217;t know why we think that we can just kill things as we please. I think a lot of people would agree with me when saying this about dogs and cats and lions and tigers but I mean all kinds of animals even down to mice, cows and flies. People may make the argument that  #8220;animals kill one another all the time #8221;. But it #8217;s completely different because when we kill because we are fully aware of what we are doing, animals kill because it is how they survive. They can live no other way. What makes a dog or cat have any greater right to live than a cow or a pig? Both have feelings, both have things that make them happy, things that make them scared. They have emotions, attachment to family and offspring. Like they even have dreams when they go to sleep. What gives us the right to decide which animal deserves its place on Earth and which doesn #8217;t? It #8217;s sheer arrogance. We draw the line at killing dogs, but think it #8217;s ok to kill cows and pigs? It #8217;s the definition of hypocrisy. Especially since we don #8217;t need to. It #8217;s the year 2020 we do not need to eat meat to live, that is a [fact.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/amp/articles/320047) There have never been more alternatives to meat in human history. The thing is with veganism, for those who do it for compassionate reasons, it literally becomes life and death when you see animals as entirely equal to humans. Now, if you #8217;re life is threatened by all means defend yourself, population control is often needed, but needless killing is wrong. I will obviously save the life of a human over an animal, but I will still be sorry to see an animal die. This is probably a pretty unpopular opinion so at least I #8217;m in the right sub. EDIT: Okay so I don #8217;t think everyone should have to be vegan. Everyone should be have the choice to eat meat if they want to. I think people should eat less meat for environmental reasons but I don #8217;t think meat should be outlawed. If you cannot afford to be vegan or can #8217;t for health reasons, then eat meat. Do what you must to survive and be healthy. I think people should have the choice, whether I disagree or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, but the way humans exist now and the volume of meat we eat means that it #8217;s impossible to farm animals in a cruelty free way. I grew up on a farm and have been around them my whole life so I know this. So it #8217;s an oxymoron to say we can raise animals for meat in a cruelty free way. I think a compromise here would be for humans to reduce the amount of meat they eat, and maybe raise the price. This would help the environment massively and reduce the farming industry enough so that animals can truly be raised cruelty free until the point of slaughter. Farmers get a fair pay and people still get to eat meat so long as they have the money. It #8217;s wrong for a kilogram of beef to cost less than  #8364;5.</TEXT>

You won #8217;t have to worry about going into massive student debt just because you wanted education. The billionaires are hoarding all the money, the money exists to change this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The rich will not have all of their money taken. They will be taxed higher, but still be extremely wealthy. They just won #8217;t be allowed to hoard obscene amounts of money while people die of starvation. This is not an extreme opinion. Ronald Reagan, the poster boy for republicanism, preached this when he was running for election in the 80 #8217;s. Yet Sanders was vilified for having the same teachings this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Intelligence in the sense you are talking absolutely is linked to education. Through education you gain critical thinking skills and life experience. You are confusing socialism with Leninist communism, when they are not the same. And take a look at Cuba for this example, where doctors make very little money (which I don #8217;t believe is fair) yet they have the highest doctor to patient ratio on earth. They key idea behind capitalism is that money is the most important thing and that everybody should be doing nothing but focusing on money. This is an immature concept an most people grow out of this idea as they get older and realize there are more important things, family, happiness, meaning. Money is still essential but there is far less emphasis on it in a socialist system. People can still attain great sums of money, more than they would need. But they could not attain tens of billions. I don #8217;t see the issue with this. I apologize if I offended you but I am not wrong, a capitalist prioritises money and it is the key point of your argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The people he snitched on were people who were supposed to be his friends. Those people kidnapped him, beat him and stole millions from him. He had the choice to snitch on them and go free, or go to prison for 40+ years at age 24, leaving a daughter and a career behind. I think he definitely made the right choice, those people showed him no loyalty so why should he show them loyalty? I don #8217;t think snitching in itself is admirable but I think in his case it is, especially when there were so many people telling him not to. And no way would I want to be as famous as him hahah I do not want to be famous I just want to be happy and I don #8217;t think fame, money or clout would bring me that.

    <TEXT>I would disagree with the fact that most women are less attracted to sensitive men, some women definitely but i wouldn #8217;t say the majority. And yes people should have outlets for their emotions other than their partner but it would be weird to be with a woman for a long time and never express emotions because it might make her less attracted to you. If I can #8217;t show my vulnerable side to a woman for fear of her losing interest in me then her commitment to the relationship is far too fickle. It is worth more to be able to be yourself in a relationship than it is to hold back your feelings and keep the relationship.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-10 11:28:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I previously had Killing In The Name - Rage Against The Machine as my favourite protest song but since I found For What It #8217;s Worth I #8217;ve decided that that song just takes the cake. I found it on a [mountain biking video](https://youtu.be/oQDLAoPs-as) that just blew me away. That video is amazing, it #8217;s all one continuous shot of this dude mountain biking against this impossible green back drop, while For What It #8217;s Worth plays. The simplicity of the video matches perfectly with the song. I cannot get enough of it. The simple guitar chords are soothing and peaceful and the drums and bass are simple and catchy. The lyrics just speak to me, I don #8217;t know why, I particularly love the lyrics about paranoia. I feel like the line about a man with a gun is very fitting today too, the song as a whole is fitting for the 20th century, as simple as the writing is. The mood of the song captures me completely. I can #8217;t imagine what it would #8217;ve been like in the 60 #8217;s when that came out, with the Vietnam war going on. The song promoted peace and anti-establishment sentiments in a time when they were really needed. I just wanted to express this because I really fucking love this song.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He  #8220;earned #8221; it by monopolisation. He  #8220;earned #8221; it by taking 25%+ of the profits of the small companies who #8217;s products he sells. He  #8220;earned #8221; it by not paying his workers properly. He  #8220;earned #8221; it by working his employees half to death and not letting them take bathroom breaks. He  #8220;earned #8221; it by paying less tax than his bottom level employees. 138 billion cannot be earned. It can only be stolen off of the profits created by an exploited workforce who have no place else to turn but to work for him. If you pulled your head out of Bezos #8217; rectum long enough to give it some independent thought, you would see this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He did not earn it morally. He earned it by monopolisation. He earned it by taking 25%+ of the profits of the small companies who #8217;s products he sells. He earned it by not paying his workers properly. He earned it by working his employees half to death and not letting them take bathroom breaks. He earned it by paying less tax than his bottom level employees. That is completely immoral, just not illegal, yet. And before you say he donates to charity, the man has more money than he could spend in 5 lifetimes, he #8217;d fucking want to be giving it to charity to at least try make it seem like he #8217;s not the reptile he is. He does not deserve praise for doing what is morally right. It #8217;s the fucking least he could to give money to charity when he #8217;s hoarding that much and giving nothing in return via tax.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We absolutely should be blaming billionaires for the government not taxing them because they are one in the same. There are billionaires in government and there are countless other billionaires funding government officials via lobbying and campaign funding. The government is bought and sold by billionaires this is fact, so yes I will blame them for the state of the government because they are a huge factor in causing it. Yes, of course everyone pursues money to give their family a better life but he has gone so far beyond that, do you actually think anyone needs billions to give their family a good life? He stopped needing money about 6 zeros ago and yet he still keeps monopolising. He keeps hoarding money when he couldn #8217;t possible spend it, if he was a decent person he would improve working conditions and pay for his workers, what reason could he have not to do that? Can I ask, how does it benefit you to defend the billionaire class and the 0.1% when they do absolutely nothing to benefit you other than exploit your labour?</TEXT>

I don #8217;t know anything about how the Kardashians made money so I can #8217;t debate you on that. But all I will say is at least when Kim released a sex tape the only people she was exploiting was herself and Ray J. The same cannot be said for Bezos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. That absolutely isn #8217;t true, farm animals, especially cows and pigs are very intelligent and just as aware as cats and dogs. Pigs are famously smart. Cows, while not as smart as pigs, have a wide range of emotions and understanding and have a deep attachment to their young and a definitive social structure among their counterparts. They even have dreams when they go to sleep. 2. I grew up on a farm so I know this is usually not the case. Cattle can live for up to 15 years but unless they are used for breeding they will be killed at around 5 years old as that #8217;s when they #8217;re meat is in its prime condition. Pigs are also killed within the first 2 years of life and they can live for 12+ years. Sheep are almost always killed within first 2 years unless used for breeding as lambs meat is much more desirable than adult sheep meat, known as mutton. And in the majority of cases, the quality of life, especially for cows and pigs is quite low when they are raised for meat. Factory farms are infamously terrible places. Pigs sit in stalls that are only as big as they are for the majority of their lives so that they don #8217;t work their muscles too much and create tougher meat. Free range farming is not practiced much because it is expensive and there is a lower yield, profits are prioritised over animal welfare. I have seen this first hand. 3. I don #8217;t understand your point here.</TEXT>

This prevents childish issues of  #8216;his stuff is in my space. #8217; The dudes obviously wrong but maybe avoid getting into this kind of situation in the future by not dividing what are supposed to be common areas again.

All I am suggesting is that maybe she is capable of change, since she used to be much less religious, smoking weed, active sexual life.

If she is still too pushy about her faith and judges her friends for not being religious, then you have done all you can. It #8217;d just be a shame to lose an old friend like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>NTA. I disagree with tipping as a concept, it #8217;s just a way for scumbag employers to avoid paying their staff properly by putting the onus on the customer to pay more so that servers can afford to eat. However, making $2 an hour is a fucking crime and people should tip you when they know that you need it to survive. Coming from an Irishman I can say that whatever system is in place that allows an employer to pay somebody $2 an hour should be destroyed. Your employer deserves a guillotine and you deserve better for your labour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So a slug was crawling through the sliding door and I leant down to brush it away with my finger and immediately received a shock all the way up my right arm. My hand went numb for a couple of minutes and I #8217;m getting a really sharp pain in my right elbow that #8217;s still hurting 10 mins later. Does anyone know what the fuck just happened. Only other explanation is that there was electricity running through the metal rail the door slides along, but that makes no sense there wouldn #8217;t be any power in that. So what happened, the pain occurred the second I touched the slug and my arm was already fully extended so I don #8217;t think it was joint pain. Google was not helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t lie to them and try to pass off take out as your own cooking because a chef of his standard will absolutely be able to tell and that will leave a worse impression than a badly cooked meal. You have well over a month to prepare for this, that is loads of time to practice making a dish 10+ times and perfect it. Something simple like spaghetti with tomato sauce is perfect and very simple to cook. Just use some good ingredients, look at a few YouTube videos and follow a simple recipe and you #8217;ll be fine. Chefs love simple cooking done right and that is entirely achievable. I #8217;ve known chefs and it #8217;s fair to presume that this guy is coming over to meet his granddaughters boyfriend, not critique your cooking especially after you #8217;ve gone to the trouble of cooking him a meal. But whatever you do don #8217;t lie to him, in the time and effort it would take to execute the take out plan you would have been able to learn how to make a meal, and at age 21 it #8217;s about time! Also, you #8217;ll have learned a new life skill. Good luck, you #8217;ll be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Slavery wasn #8217;t the best thing #8221; for fucks sake man. The whole narrative of the Confederacy being about more than slavery is not true, it was a part of a massive white washing campaign undertaken by the United Daughters of the Confederacy as a way to change the legacy of their fathers/grandfathers. Research the role that the United Daughters had in changing the curriculum in schools across America, they changed how the history of the Confederacy was taught because they had the money to do so from slave ownership. The Confederacy fought solely to preserve the right to own slaves. In the decades after the Civil War the United Daughters spread the propaganda of the Confederacy as the  #8220;Lost Cause #8221;. It #8217;s all bollocks. Take this from someone with a Bachelors Degree in History.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand your frustration, the social media age we are living in can really take a toll on our patience. I do however doubt some of your motives here. The things you are complaining about here are a bit dodgy. Cat calling, while not rape, is most definitely a form of sexual degradation and misogyny. It #8217;s a part of rape culture and helps normalise degrading behaviour towards women. I don #8217;t understand why you would have a problem with people speaking against it. People should not have die of curable diseases simply because they don #8217;t have enough money. Healthcare is a human right and it should be accessible to all regardless of how much money they have in the bank. Poor people have a right to life. You don #8217;t have to have sex with anyone you don #8217;t want to, obviously. But the fact that you #8217;re referring to transgender people as  #8220;trannys #8221; hints that your feelings about transgender people may be nastier than just  #8220;I don #8217;t want to have sex with them #8221;. But that #8217;s just my assumption I may well be wrong. There are so many beautiful and attractive fat people, just because you don #8217;t see it that way doesn #8217;t mean you get to be a cunt and say they aren #8217;t beautiful and all fat people are ugly. This is just shitty. Look, I think you need to just avoid social media and politics as much as possible for a while. For your own mental wellbeing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We have far more daily cases now than we did when we instigated the lockdown back in March. I don #8217;t think we should wait any longer if we want to return to some normality next year. Lockdown the country for a couple of weeks. Lockdown the borders for a couple months. Coming in and out of different phases won #8217;t work we need a hardline approach to this such as the New Zealand or Vietnamese approach</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If we lockdown the country now and get cases as low as possible like we did in the summer, as well as locking down borders and enforcing 2 week quarantine then we are preventing a third wave in winter. I don #8217;t want to go in lockdown again but if it means saving peoples lives then absolutely lock this shit down. I want to be able to visit my grandparents again. Fuck the economy we will cross that bridge when we come to it we have had recessions before and they are not as bad as this virus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s an interesting point. I guess it #8217;s just the difference in drinking cultures. In Ireland people drink cans when they want a drink but aren #8217;t in a pub or restaurant. Seeing someone drinking cans in a pub would be an anomaly</TEXT>
