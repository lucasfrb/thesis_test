    <TEXT>I'm a relatively new fan, I started watching it maybe 6 months ago. I pretty much got introduced to it through Rick and morty. I would read the R amp;M sub and just other R amp;M related stuff online, and there were always people talking about community in very positive ways. Eventually I gave it a try and did not regret it lol</TEXT>

My brother suffers from delusions and I do understand how heartbreaking it is for everyone involved (especially the person suffering the delusions). I just want you to know that I think most people here are supportive and empathetic of people in your situation, and they aren't laughing at people like you who truly have no choice in what they believe.

I can agree that by going on Reddit or any website like this you are risking seeing spoilers, but I also don't think it's that big of a deal to just mark obvious spoilers (like character deaths) with the spoiler tag. Whatever tho, it seems you are very passionate about not marking spoilers, and that's fine lol</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not trying to be a know-it-all, but just thought this may interest you. REM sleep is actually one of the lightest sleep stages. Stages 3-4 are your slow wave sleep stages and the deepest stages of sleep. The brain cycles through different stages throughout the night, but after leaving stage 1 rather than returning back to stage 1 it goes into REM sleep. This is total speculation, but it could be that since REM is inhibited you spend more time in the slower wave sleep stages when smoking weed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh for sure it's important. Yeah in REM sleep you get brain waves similar to beta waves, which are the same waves you have when you are awake and somewhat alert. So it could stand to reason that if REM is inhibited then you'll stay in stages 2-4 longer and feel more rested. Who knows for sure tho, the brain is weird and as you said REM is definitely still important. Anyway hope I didn't come off as a know it all, I just find this stuff interesting and wanted to give my .02$</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long time lurker here, first time posting. Not really sure where else to ask about this besides Twitter. Here #8217;s the scoop: The day before yesterday my iPhone bricked when I was getting the new iOS, so I had to factory reset and my authenticator is no longer working. I #8217;ve tried to disable authenticator, but it always takes at least 30 min for the email to show up, and by then it says the request is expired. I have access to the current registered email as well as the email that was registered at first. I also have the password and I can still logon to my account through RuneLite on one of my computers. Is there anything I can do? I #8217;ve heard there is a way to submit a ticket for customer support via a web form, but I #8217;ve been tearing apart the support page and I haven #8217;t found any such web form to fill out. If anyone can help and they need more details I #8217;d be happy to provide them. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I was that age in Dallas we mostly did hood rat shit lol. But here #8217;s a few legal ideas. top golf is cool but kinda expensive, if u like gaming the cidercade is dope with lots of arcade machines. I think they only let minors play in the cidercade until 8:00pm tho then it #8217;s 21+ (10$ entry fee there). There are also lots of good parks, I #8217;ve been playing disc golf with friends for about a year and that #8217;s kinda entertaining. U can get a cheap set of discs for like 10-20$. Also comedy clubs if you are into that It can be tough finding cheap entertainment in Dallas especially with limited money as a teen. I remember how it always felt like there was nothing to go out and do that didn #8217;t cost a lot when I was younger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to like doing top golf in high school. U can rent a bay for 27$/hr, but it #8217;s up to 6 people so if u get 6 people to go it #8217;s more like 4.50$ per person per hr in the bay. They have good food there too. Idk y #8217;all could probably find go carts or some shit within your budget too, just search around online I guess. Should be able to find lots of things to do at a 50$ budget EDIT: top golf pricing depends on time, bay price is like 49$/hr between 5pm-close in fri/sat. For 27$/hr that #8217;s only from opening-noon. Sorry I #8217;m rusty on the pricing there</TEXT>

This isn #8217;t art school man, it #8217;s just a sub where people share whatever they want, even oftentimes extremely low effort posts (not that this one is low effort in the slightest). Not everyone is looking for critiquing here, and when he told you he wasn #8217;t you still felt the need to further insult the art style. And of course you can choose to criticize whatever you want, but be ready to get argued with because this is reddit. And it isn #8217;t just this sub where the downvotes thing happens, unfortunately everywhere on reddit once you get downvotes going it snowballs. You just kind of come off as an arrogant pedantic person here, and people don #8217;t like that. Maybe save it for art school? And my reasoning for your scene being unrelatable was because people won #8217;t keep joining a full world, and you #8217;ll never be pushed out.

    <TEXT>I worry that Bernie #8217;s wealth tax would get out of control. I know he says it will only tax wealth over 32 million, but once a tax is instituted historically it doesn #8217;t go away. And also the government tends to increase taxes. It #8217;ll be 25 million, then 20 million, then 10 million. I hope you can understand my concern. I also fear his willingness to tax Wall Street. That will destroy the market, and I #8217;m concerned it wouldn #8217;t be able to recover in my lifetime. I #8217;ll admit I was unaware that Bernie was opposed to taking firearms. Honestly I #8217;m still concerned he would do things to damage the 2nd amendment. Firearms are important to me. Certainly economic improvements may have already been in motion prior to Trump, but it doesn #8217;t take away from the fact that they #8217;ve steadily grown during his presidency. I appreciate that you are actually giving arguments now rather than dismissing mine as strawmen and trolling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I could be mistaken too, but my understanding is that the tax would be on wealth overall. So if you have over 32 million saved you would pay an additional tax on that money after income tax has already been taken. This is a lot of the issue I take with the policy, that money would already have been taxed from income taxes. I just read his policy again and I believe this is what he means. So it would affect my family #8217;s wealth, and when I inherit it it will continue to affect that wealth every year. An increase in income tax wouldn #8217;t bother me nearly as much, it #8217;s the institution of a new tax on already taxed money that scares me. And as I said above, I don #8217;t think it would end at 32 million. Give the government an inch and they take a fucking light year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The main reason is to help family members that are sick and can #8217;t provide for themselves. I #8217;m anti-natalist and don #8217;t intend to bring more people into this fucked up world, so providing for children and grand children isn #8217;t an issue to me. That said, as I mentioned we donate a lot to charities. I prefer to choose which charities we donate to rather than having the government decide for us, especially since the government has proven they are un-trustworthy about what they do with the money they take from us. I don #8217;t necessarily feel entitled to it, but my family intends to pass it on and I will use it wisely, assuming it isn #8217;t taken away by socialists. Maybe you should try rationalizing why Bernie Sanders has 4 houses and is a millionaire. We don #8217;t have 4 houses, and I #8217;ll never buy 4 houses. That seems totally pointless to me. I guess if I could give a simple answer, it is mostly to help my family. Those dying from diseases and can #8217;t provide for themselves. I want to help them.

I #8217;ve never used it to cheat a test, but if I #8217;m not clean in time I #8217;m gonna try it. Apparently some of them have built in temperature gauges so you can be sure you have it at the right temperature. You could definitely be clean by then tho. I #8217;ve heard some of the detox/masking chemicals work too, but I #8217;m dubious about this. I worry they are unhealthy, and I #8217;d want to do a test run with it before the official test.

These Biden policies aren #8217;t necessarily good or bad from my perspective, but I would think many democrats agree with them: free 2 years of community college education, give citizenship to dreamers, ban manufacture and sale of assault weapons, restrict number of firearms allowed to be bought, expand lgbtq civil rights... I don #8217;t feel like giving more examples, but Biden is very different from Trump. His policies generally align with democratic beliefs, and as someone else mentioned he will put a democrat in Supreme Court if RBG or another justice dies/retires. It makes no sense to me that many democrats are refusing to vote for Biden, but it #8217;s cool with me since it will help Trump get re-elected.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had a lot of dealers when I switched to just coke, all of the dealers now only request coke. I had someone hooked on molly and thought that might be an issue, but it didn #8217;t seem to be. It #8217;s possible my molly addicted client had already become a dealer when I switched entirely to coke, so maybe that had to do with why that wasn #8217;t a problem. Honestly you should just make a save and try switching over to what you wanna sell and see what happens. It really has been a lot easier to amass tons of money since I switched to just coke</TEXT>

I #8217;m sure they would go to jail for a little while, but they #8217;d get a cheap bail amount and then just pay a fine. Like I said in my first response to you, I agree with you a fine is the best penalty for this. Obviously they shouldn #8217;t get prison time, but jail is just kind of necessary so they can go to arraignment court. They #8217;d likely only spend one night in jail tho, so not a big deal</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What happens to all the animals in the meat/dairy industries if everyone were to go vegan?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-28 22:02:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is more of a question and less of a debate prompt, so apologies if this is the wrong place to post. It just seemed to be too heated to post on r/askvegans. So what I #8217;m wondering is if there are any achievable ideas on how to handle all these animals if they are no longer being slaughtered/milked for food. Obviously we couldn #8217;t just release them all as that would destroy ecosystems and their populations would likely explode. I also heavily doubt that a vegan would agree to just slaughtering all remaining animals in the industries for food and not breeding them anymore. Additionally, some of these animals are dependent on humans to prevent them from suffering. Holstein cows, for example, have been selectively bred to produce way more milk than their calves need, and are in pain when they are not milked regularly. Would we continue to milk them to reduce suffering but just not consume the milk, effectively wasting it? Would we just keep these animals alive and comfortable and prevent them from reproducing to phase out their variant? Would it even be ethical to phase out variants of cows that don #8217;t suffer like Holsteins, but are also no longer needed by humans and have no place in nature? To clarify I mean they were bred for captivity and they don #8217;t belong in any natural ecosystems, but is it right to prevent them from reproducing and just let them disappear when the last one dies? There is a staggering number of these animals in farms/slaughterhouses around the world, and many of them are dependent on humans. What would be the most possible and humane way to deal with them if they are no longer being eaten? TLDR: basically the title is what I #8217;m asking. Everything else is just points regarding the question that make it difficult for me to answer.</TEXT>

What is there to learn tho? download tor, go to the url, use pgp encryption when communicating with vendors, buy some bitcoins, use a PO Box and not ur home address. Fairly simple process.

Why is a PO Box worse than your home address?

I know it #8217;s not really secure, but the idea is that if you are using tor and u encrypt ur messages with PGP the feds won #8217;t bother gathering the evidence if you are just ordering a little weed or psychedelics or whatever.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get it, the negative utilitarian route. So using that philosophy some slaughter would be ok if it decreases suffering in the long term. In my hypothetical (which I admit is unrealistic) would the animals be eaten if they were all killed, or would the meat be wasted? Would it be fed to other predators? I think something I #8217;m taking away from this is that there really isn #8217;t a grand unifying solution to the problem that all vegans agree with. Not saying that #8217;s a bad thing, it #8217;s just interesting given how most vegan arguments are airtight and shared by most (if not all) vegans.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, I guess we just disagree about who the protesters are. I #8217;ve noticed that conservative media like Fox seems to almost support the protests, and liberal sources like MSNBC and CNN abhor the protests. Sometimes I think people decide which values are liberal/conservative based off of what the media says rather than what liberals/conservatives actually believe. My perception is that the protesters are doing it because they are desperate for money, and that issue doesn #8217;t seem inherently liberal or conservative. That #8217;s why I believe there is likely a mix in political beliefs among the protesters, but I #8217;m certainly not going to go to one of these protests to find out lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s refreshing to be able to talk politics on reddit without getting totally beat down for supporting Trump. I also don #8217;t consider myself a party loyalist, if there was a third party that leaned more towards libertarianism that would be where I #8217;d likely vote. If there was a democratic candidate that was better than Trump I would vote for them. There is a lot of Sander #8217;s policies that I agree with, but there are many I #8217;m heavily against. I don #8217;t like the wealth tax as I #8217;m sure the government will lower the threshold below $32m once he is out of office. I also don #8217;t trust him with the 2A because despite him being opposed to confiscation, he has supported assault weapon bans. That said, I agree he #8217;s a much better candidate than Biden. Bernie has been consistent with his political beliefs for years, you can #8217;t say that about almost any other politician.

I can understand wanting to improve America, but the way you were framing it seemed you are ungrateful to live here. It could be much much worse, and despite our problems we still live a luxurious life compared to most other countries. Edit: I didn #8217;t see you sneak in that little edit there. I agree some Western European countries are better in some ways, and a lot of Scandinavian countries. I #8217;m not sure what the balance should be as they pay large amounts on taxes to get healthcare education, but I do think they are closer to the mark than we are. The fact is most countries aren #8217;t even close to their standard of living, and America is a lot closer than China, or Uganda, or Venezuela for examples.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve never seen the horrors described by people living in parts of Africa or even South America. There is poverty, but at least there is infrastructure and a bit of social welfare in place (maybe not enough but that #8217;s another argument). My point is just that we are fortunate to live in a country like this, and too often people shit on it and say every other country is better. In reality they are almost always comparing us to Scandinavia, because they love the social programs there. If you were to compare our average standard of living to the average standards of living in all other countries, we would be very high on the list.</TEXT>

It seems like this always happens when I bring up arguments defending America, people just quit responding and assume they #8217;ve won an argument just because Reddit downvotes anyone defending the US and upvotes people attacking it. This isn #8217;t win or lose, I just want to talk about it. I didn #8217;t mean to offend you by telling you to just leave, as I said it was a knee-jerk reaction and I admit it was in poor taste. I believe the people living in shack-like houses as you describe still have a much higher standard of living compared to those in many other countries. At least many in those arrangements here have access to public transit, welfare programs, public schooling. There is poverty throughout the US, poor living arrangements in the north as well. It just isn #8217;t as widespread or as bad as what you would see in almost the entirety of Africa and a lot of South America.

That #8217;s why it wasn #8217;t portrayed as the terrible pandemic it has become. We didn #8217;t hide the pandemic, once it hit our shores it was reported very openly. China shut down travel to Wuhan in their own country but continued to allow international travel because they didn #8217;t want to be in a weakened state, so they allowed the whole world to go into a weakened state.

    <TEXT>The problem is that this was addressed in January. The WHO is corrupt as hell coming out of China, I don #8217;t blame Trump for not trusting them. I mean they gave us contaminated test kits. I think he did the best he could given that this is unprecedented. He shut down travel to China on Jan 31, and all the liberals cried that he was being racist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He downplayed the pandemic because this is unprecedented and no one expected it to be this bad. I don #8217;t think you can really blame him for thinking this would just be like SARS1 or H1N1 or any of the other epidemics we #8217;ve been through. He assumed it would be the same, this might be a mistake, but the entire world also felt this way for those first few uncertain weeks. No one saw this coming, why does trump get blamed for thinking this wouldn #8217;t be so bad when basically every other world leader held the same opinion? The emergency stockpiles were almost completely depleted after H1N1, and Obama didn #8217;t restock them. I #8217;m not blaming Obama, I #8217;m just pointing out that the fault doesn #8217;t fall on Trump alone. As I #8217;ve said, no one knew this would be as bad as it is. Trump was focusing on more immediate threats, and this came out of nowhere because China fucked up big time. He didn #8217;t tell people to inject bleach. I was watching that press conference and cringed when he was talking about using UV and disinfectants because I knew it would be taken out of context. He really needs to learn when to shut up. He was just theorizing on possible treatments. It isn #8217;t unreasonable to be looking at disinfectant like molecules (and he did say disinfectant-like) that don #8217;t damage human cells but do kill cells infected with a virus. This is how science progresses, trying new things in a lab and seeing what works. He was saying they are going to test things like this, he didn #8217;t say for people to inject it in themselves. I could quote his whole statement but that #8217;s too much effort, so I #8217;ll just link the video [here](https://youtu.be/n0M70_sB2YI) EDIT: just realized the video I linked has some woman giving her opinion on what he said. I really just intended to show what he said, I haven #8217;t watched what her take on it is so I can #8217;t say I agree with it and it doesn #8217;t reflect my argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I totally agree with you on that. The media was totally reporting that it was not a big deal, I remember for like 3 weeks sometime around January-February they were straight up saying that wearing masks does not help protect from the virus. And absolutely, the WHO was downplaying it too. I mean I #8217;m really not a huge Trump supporter, he #8217;s done a lot of things I don #8217;t like, but this isn #8217;t his fault. When the entire world is reporting that this isn #8217;t a big deal, and even the WHO is saying it #8217;s not a big deal (likely because they are based in China), then wtf do people expect the president to do? I really believe if China and the WHO hadn #8217;t lied about the severity of the problem early on then Trump likely would have responded with more force.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Imagine blaming a pandemic that originated in China on the president. If this happened under Obama #8217;s presidency all the dumbass conservatives would be blaming him. We have no control over viral infections of this magnitude. I #8217;d love to hear your reasoning for blaming this on Trump, but I #8217;m sure it #8217;s the same points that shitty propaganda channels like CNN and MSNBC have been repeating over and over. So rather than forcing you to spell them out, I #8217;ll just address some of them. First you #8217;d probably say that Trump downplayed the pandemic early on. Well guess what? So did everyone else in the initial uncertain weeks in January. No one knew how bad this would be, even liberal news was downplaying saying that this shouldn #8217;t be worse than the flu. It #8217;s unprecedented. The only people who could have said how bad it was are the Chinese communist party. But instead they hid it from the world and allowed the pandemic to happen. The WHO (run by the CCP) were also feeding out false intel like that masks don #8217;t protect against the virus. Surely you remember hearing that? There are people to blame, but Trump is definitely not the one. Xi Jinping is the real failure of a leader here. Next you #8217;ll probably say that Trump failed to renew funding for the PPE storages that Obama had established. The issue is, Obama also failed to renew those supplies after they were diminished in H1N1. Obviously this isn #8217;t Obama #8217;s fault either, I #8217;m just pointing out that as the leader of the free world there are so many things to deal with, and more pressing matters are taken care of first. No one predicted this would be so deadly, so of course without knowing this was going to happen why would people be focused on it? Trump wasn #8217;t, and neither was Obama. So if you want to blame that one on Trump make sure you blame Obama as well. Finally you might bring up the tired, bullshit line that Trump told people to inject disinfectants. This is just blatantly not true. If you watch the clip, he was just spitballing ideas. He said they are looking into testing disinfectant-like chemicals that could maybe be injected to kill the virus. It #8217;s not unreasonable to speculate there may be a molecule that acts like a disinfectant but only kills cells infected by the virus while leaving other healthy cells alive. This is how science progresses, trying new things in a lab setting. Never did he say for people to inject bleach, honestly how can people even think that he said that after seeing the clip? Now I totally think he shouldn #8217;t be spitballing ideas up there in public like that, he has real diarrhea of the mouth. I cringed when he said that because I knew it would be taken out of context, but the lengths libs have gone to make out that he said to inject bleach are staggering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, so first I want to say Trump really does a lot of things I don #8217;t like and he is far from my first choice to be president. I would #8217;ve preferred Ted Cruz or Gary Johnson in 2016, and if there was a large enough libertarian party that is where I would be voting most likely. First of all, I #8217;m more in favor of conservative fiscal values. I think Trump did a great job with the economy prior to this coronavirus crash (which I don #8217;t blame him for). You could argue that the economy was already on an uptick when he took office, but he consistently grew it during his first 3 years and I can #8217;t entirely discredit him from that success. Secondly, I #8217;m pro 2A. Biden has supported assault weapon bans and has even said he will put Beto in charge of that, and Beto straight up said he was in favor of confiscating all AR-15s. Once the AR-15 goes it is a slippery slope for all other rifles, as the AR-15 has a small caliber round 5.56 NATO (literally a modified .22 round). I #8217;m very opposed to the government seizing any property, and it seems Biden will allow that to happen. Third, the Chinese communist party must pay for unleashing this pandemic on the world. Trump has proved he is willing to take the fight to the CCP with his trade wars, and I believe him when he says he is going to get back at China for this. I don #8217;t believe Biden, as he has ties to China that would make him less likely to tariff the shit out of them. I #8217;ll admit I #8217;m not as familiar with Biden #8217;s policies as I am Bernie, so I #8217;m not sure if he plans to institute any sort of wealth tax, but that is also something I heavily disagree with. I don #8217;t want a new tax instituted on wealth because even if it has a high threshold like Bernie #8217;s ($32 million), I know the government will continue to lower that over time because they always take a mile when given an inch. There are likely more reasons, but I don #8217;t want to flood you with a novel here. if you have any specific questions on my opinions I #8217;d be glad to answer them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watched it again hoping it would be a different clip that I had missed. Nope same video of him saying the same thing. I explained further in my other reply to OP, but he very clearly was asking about trying to use something like disinfectants as a potential new treatment. He didn #8217;t say let #8217;s start injecting people and see what happens, he is just spitballing ideas. This is how science progresses, trying new things. It is not unreasonable to think there might be a molecule like a disinfectant that only targets cells invaded by the virus and doesn #8217;t attack cells that aren #8217;t infected. This could exist, and he was asking the doctor if she thought this could be a potential treatment method in the future. Not once did he say,  #8220;hey US public, you should try infecting bleach and see what happens #8221;. I fully admit he shouldn #8217;t have said that there, it #8217;s been terrible PR and is much more appropriate for discussion with his cohorts outside of a press conference. But to take what he said and claim he told everyone to inject disinfectants is just definitely a reach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh great, more disingenuous political ads. You can say a lot of bad things about Trump that are perfectly legitimate, but the pandemic related issues are not his fault. I guess there is an argument to be made about the nazi white supremacists supporting him, but the unemployment, stock market crash, and breadlines are not his fault. If we still had Obama as president all the dumb conservatives would be blaming these things on him too. The only world leader worth blaming for the pandemic is Xi Jinping for allowing this virus to infect the world. I #8217;ll take my downvotes, and I might get replies, but I #8217;m probably not going to be responding. I #8217;ve argued this before on Reddit and it #8217;s endless.

    <TEXT>As some people said, it refers to the unmasking of Flynn. To clarify, in this context unmasking refers to finding the identity of a CIA agent that was unidentified in an intelligence report. It appears that many members of Obama #8217;s administration attempted to unmask Flynn #8217;s communications with the Russian ambassador. The deeper implications that others haven #8217;t touched on as much are that the entire Russian collusion scandal and impeachment trials were based off of lies orchestrated by the Obama administration. Not saying I agree this is what happened, I #8217;m not really sure where I stand on the issue right now.

That is banana republic bullshit, it #8217;s like a coup. There has always been a relatively smooth transition of power between presidents, and if Obama #8217;s administration was really trying to do that I want to know. That said I #8217;m still not sure if it #8217;s real or not, but I #8217;m definitely interested in seeing if any evidence comes forward (more evidence than just the fact that people tried to unmask Flynn, that #8217;s just not nearly enough). How Trump has handled the virus is another issue all together, and I don #8217;t want to state my views on it because I don #8217;t feel like arguing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man I totally agree with you except that I feel even in a relatively peaceful society people should be able to arm themselves. There is no guarantee that the government won #8217;t screw up and create another toxic environment like the one African Americans are exposed to today. Even if things get better disarming ourselves is a bad move. Like you said, when the government knows they have the upper hand they will oppress, and giving up the 2A will give them a permanent massive upper hand. Not to mention, banning firearms is near impossible in America. Criminals don #8217;t care if they are illegal, and as someone else said there are more guns in North America than there are people. They simply can #8217;t all be collected. Not to mention, you can 3D print guns and fairly easily manufacture crude ones. Banning them in the US would only make the government and criminals more powerful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That experiment sounds really interesting, I #8217;m gonna have to look around for that. You make some good points there, I can see how online dating could be toxic for several reasons. I may be naive in thinking this, but it seems to me that ever sense tinder and other online dating sites got popular, hookup culture has increased a lot. I really don #8217;t like how promiscuous a lot of people seem to be now, mostly because I feel that if you are having sex you should be prepared to have a kid with that person. Condoms fail, so does birth control, so it just seems irresponsible to have a lot of casual sex. Not to mention STIs. Maybe it has always been like this and I just didn #8217;t notice because I was too young. I haven #8217;t seen the data regarding men having less sex on average per year than women. The implications of that are really kind of scary to think about, but I #8217;d like to see more data before I would be willing to claim that this is actually caused by online dating. There seem to be some confounds such as young people in general not getting married as often and choosing not to have kids due to anti-natalist philosophies spreading. You #8217;ve definitely given me something to think about though, thanks for your insight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I fully agree with strict background checks, although the checks aren #8217;t bad rn and a lot of guns used in crimes are unregistered. Biden has supported assault weapon bans in the past (source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/opinion/joe-biden-ban-assault-weapons.amp.html). It #8217;s a slow process to remove guns from the public, so they are targeting assault weapons first and will then target hunting rifles and large caliber handguns. It will be easy to convince people a pistol that fires .50 action express once a rifle firing a little 5.56 has been banned. Biden also said he would put Beto O #8217;Rourke in charge of gun control (source: https://billofrightsinstitute.org/events/joe-biden-promises-to-put-beto-orourke-in-charge-of-gun-control/). And if you don #8217;t know, Beto said he would absolutely take our AR-15s and AK-47s. (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/09/12/politics/beto-orourke-hell-yes-take-ar-15-ak-47/index.html). This is all just to say, Biden absolutely wants to take guns away despite his outspoken anti-confiscation policies. All of the left wants to disarm the public. Look at all our recent police killings on innocent people, doesn #8217;t it seem unreasonable to disarm these people if the government is actively killing them? And not to mention the criminals. I #8217;ll say it again, banning guns is near impossible in America and removing them will just increase the government #8217;s and the criminals #8217; power. Australia is a totally different story. Prior to the port Arthur massacre in 1996 when all the legislation was passed banning firearms, there were 3.2 million privately owned firearms (by civilians). In 2016 there are now 3.15m firearms privately owned by civilians. Not a large decrease but there are differences in the types of guns owned. But my point is mostly that trying to control 3.2 million firearms is completely different from controlling 393 million firearms in America. (Source for the figures: https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/australia) They are different issues and require different solutions, and honestly I #8217;m not sure what those solutions might be. Stricter background checks seems like the way to go, but they can only get so strict. Some people really are perfect on paper but crack and decide to kill people. Also there is the issue that the right to arm yourself is in our constitution, so any severe act of power from the government to remove guns from the public could spark a civil war. It #8217;s a complex issue and unfortunately I don #8217;t think copying Australia will fix it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Man you are like arguing with a brick wall. You are ignoring my point about assault weapons just being the first step, it #8217;s obvious they will go after more guns after assault weapons. For example, after banning the AK-47 they will definitely go after guns firing larger or the same round, such as the Ruger Mini-30. This gun is more of a hunting rifle, in fact lots of hunting rifles are chambered with .308 caliber which is a hell of a lot bigger than an AR-15s or AK-47s round. And then they will target large caliber pistols like a desert eagle that fires a .50 AE round. It #8217;s obvious why they are demonizing the AR-15 first, it has a small round. Once it #8217;s gone others will be easier to ban. To your second point, yes I do believe it is impossible to ban guns in America. I would go further to say it hasn #8217;t really worked anywhere, but that #8217;s a separate point. Sure you are more likely to die from a gun in the US, but are you more likely to die here than in other countries? People are violent everywhere whether they have guns or not, it #8217;s like how London has a high murder rate despite banning guns and most knives. And in Australia if you look into the laws after Port Arthur massacre, they redefined what qualifies as a massacre (now must be more than 6 people killed), which is largely responsible for the downtick in violence after  #8220;banning #8221; firearms. I already showed you the stats showing that there are nearly the same amount of privately owned guns in citizens #8217; hands in Australia now as there were in 1996. Everyone likes to cry that banning guns will fix everything, but it just isn #8217;t that simple. Guns are a permanent part of our reality now</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I usually just say I #8217;m from Texas since most people have heard of that state. Still though I think you have the wrong perspective, people aren #8217;t saying the name of their city based on some entitlement. It #8217;s likely more just ignorance. As people have pointed out America is huge and generally when people ask where you are from within the states people will answer with a city if it is a big one or the state if it #8217;s just a small town. They probably just don #8217;t think to change their response when people have different nationalities. Everyone seems to think us Americans feel super entitled about everything, sometimes there are just cultural differences that are misunderstood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This issue is absolutely not bigger than a pandemic that has killed over 100,000 people in the US alone. Police kill more white people on average and blacks commit significantly more crime. In fact a white man died in Dallas nearly the same way as Floyd a few years ago (Tony Timpa). Wake up, police brutality is an issue but it is towards everyone, not just blacks. Blacks may experience it a touch more on average given their population size since they commit more crimes, but that is kind of more on them for committing the crimes. This whole idea that blacks are targeted by police is a manufactured crisis. Police brutality however is a crisis, but let #8217;s maybe let the pandemic wind down first? This virus is dangerous and we are being fools for allowing it to kill so many of our own. And don #8217;t come back saying I was ok with protests when it was over reopening the country, I wasn #8217;t. I understood why people were protesting then just like I do now, but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s a good idea to protest now or then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What if there were some people who did bad things by today #8217;s standards but were also heroes in the past? I #8217;m from Texas, so I #8217;ll use Tx history as an example. Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie both promoted slavery. This was accepted back then and part of their norm. Despite them having messed up views about slavery, they still were still Texas heroes and that can #8217;t be taken away from them. Bowie was an absolute badass and his name is still important due to the creation of the Bowie knife. I like to see those statues of them when I visit Texas museums or the Alamo. Also, some American legends were complicit in slavery but also promoted abolition. Ulysses S Grant comes to mind. Grant was a freaking Union general, he fought for the emancipation proclamation. But since he owned slaves we shouldn #8217;t honor his history? And George Washington #8217;s amazing leadership and sharp brain kind of speak for themselves, we should still honor him despite him owning slaves. It #8217;s important to realize how normalized slavery was, it was terrible, but people like Washington held a totally different frame of mind than what we have today. I #8217;ll always respect people like George Washington even if they did own slaves, they are multifaceted. I don #8217;t respect him for owning slaves, but I do for everything else he did.</TEXT>

I also watched the live streams of the protesters and many of them were not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly. I #8217;m not sure why people say nearly everyone at the protests wore masks, that is just blatantly false. Anyway my point is that the protests are being brought up just to show that it isn #8217;t only republicans being uncooperative with mask laws/social distancing</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh so since I recognize that the CCP allowed a pandemic to happen it #8217;s my fault our leaders are failing us? Trump has made a mess of this in many ways, but so have a lot of liberals. Bill De Blasio killed a ton of elderly by moving covid patients to nursing homes. Joe Biden said that if he were president he would never consider closing our border off from China. Both sides of the media claimed wearing masks is pointless at first, and have since claimed they protect you and then later that they mostly just protect others from you. I #8217;m just annoyed that everyone blames all of this mess on Donald Trump. And that shit about him saying to inject disinfectant? He literally didn #8217;t say that. I #8217;ve seen that clip so many times, and I #8217;ve argued that he didn #8217;t say that. It should be an easy argument, because he didn #8217;t say it, but somehow people still believe he did. Did he ever actually even say not to wear masks? If he did I missed that one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair enough, people should be held responsible, but I #8217;m not sure voting everyone out will fix anything. I used the Biden example to point out that he likely would have done a terrible job too. And China fucking up isn #8217;t a probably. They very likely created this virus and let it get out, but even if they didn #8217;t make the virus they still allowed international travel into Wuhan after they cut off travel there within their country. What they did is literally evil, they knew they #8217;d be at a disadvantage if they were the only country impacted, so they let the whole world get infected. When it comes to this presidential election, both of our choices seem like they would have done a poor job in the pandemic. I think I #8217;d rather have Trump as president tho because he will be hard on China, I don #8217;t at all trust Biden to be. He thought Trump was wrong to close our border to China, in fact all the liberals were crying about that when he did it at the end of January.</TEXT>

Sorry to link a documentary and not an article, but I couldn #8217;t find one that had all the information regarding publications that came out of China about research with coronavirus. I just heavily disagree with you about Trump being incompetent with finances. The market was absolutely incredible before the virus, and it #8217;s actually bounced back really well. You can insult Trump for his failures in business, but it #8217;s irrefutable that he #8217;s had a ton of business success too. I don #8217;t get how so many people think he #8217;s such a bad businessman. The guy has built so many insanely successful buildings.

    <TEXT>To be fair I called all SJWs whiny bitches, including republicans lol. I admit that was a little harsh. I just meant that the systemic oppression that they claim whites are complicit in creating doesn #8217;t actually seem to be there, and I #8217;m tired of being accused of something that isn #8217;t happening. So separation seems the best option, and I would further this line of thought saying I don #8217;t think multicultural societies can ever truly live in harmony. I think humans are innately tribal, and nobody wants to assimilate completely. There will always be some people who cause conflict, and right now it #8217;s happening because they have accused whites of systemic oppression. I don #8217;t blame them, they legitimately might get reparations out of this when Biden is elected. Anyway, I #8217;ve probably gone on way longer than you care to read. I know my philosophy is very unpopular, but I really feel I was pushed into this mindset over the years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s just my perception of it. If I saw a lot of evidence of it I #8217;d believe it #8217;s real, but from where I #8217;m standing it looks like if anything blacks have more perks in this country. Affirmative action, scholarships specifically for blacks, and now of course the ability to garner mass sympathy from everyone in the nation at any time they want. Now there are of course negative things, but they aren #8217;t systemic oppression. Single parent households for example, I believe this contributes greatly to the wealth disparity as well as the increased crime in black communities. I #8217;m not sure how we fix this issue, but I #8217;m sure it #8217;s an important piece of the puzzle. Either way, my original argument remains. Even if we fixed their problems somehow today, I do believe we would descend into conflict again. In the past we perpetrated conflict and were legitimately oppressing them. Now it almost seems to be shifting, we give them all the positive benefits that whites don #8217;t get that I mentioned and yet they accuse us of being oppressors and play the Victim card. It #8217;s a great time to be a black person in America imo (pandemic aside..). If there is systemic oppression I #8217;m missing it</TEXT>

I #8217;m open minded on this issue to an extent, I still don #8217;t believe we could permanently live together in harmony, but if I saw true irrefutable evidence of oppression I would believe that they are at least oppressed. I just haven #8217;t seen it, like I said I see more positive benefits than negative for being a black person in America. But I guess I #8217;m just repeating myself at this point, it #8217;s clear we have very different opinions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well in a way whites are the victims in this instance, but they aren #8217;t trying to gain anything from it. I don #8217;t want them to give me anything or even treat me better. I just want to be separated from them because I believe we are incompatible. I believe humans are innately tribal, and since no one wants to assimilate conflict is inevitable. In the past we perpetrated conflict and legitimately oppressed them, but now they have many more perks than us such as affirmative action, access to exclusive scholarships, and the ability to manipulate the media and garner sympathy any time they play the victim. I can see why they are playing the victim, they might get reparations out of the deal. Although I don #8217;t believe there is oppression, I do believe there are issues in their communities. Such as single parent households, I can see this contributing to the wealth disparity and higher crime rates. But it isn #8217;t a result of systemic oppression. An ideal situation to me would be having the black community resolve their issues and live in a productive community, but it #8217;s segregated from the white community and we are also productive. That way everyone is happy and no more conflict. I mean since the beginning of time when different cultures met they often had conflict. It hasn #8217;t changed just because we attempted a multicultural society, in fact I believe the multicultural nature of America is responsible for its downfall Edit: misspelling</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neither am I, I just don #8217;t think races can peacefully live together. Nothing I said is that unreasonable or racist, you are being dramatic. And you don #8217;t have a rebuttal, which is fine. But don #8217;t pretend you aren #8217;t arguing due to some moral superiority, you just don #8217;t have an argument. Claiming there is no systemic oppression does not equal white supremacy. Ever seen Candace Owens? She is black and completely agrees about oppression not existing (she probably doesn #8217;t agree with segregation though). To be clear, I #8217;m not saying we segregate and whites live in a utopia while blacks live in a hellhole. Ideally we both live in wonderful, but separate societies. It #8217;s not like I want to segregate because I hate them or something (although they sure seem to hate white people these days), I just truly don #8217;t think we are compatible for the reasons I #8217;ve stated. Multiculturalism in a society was a good experiment, but it appears to have failed and that #8217;s why America is falling apart. I assumed you were liberal because you said to keep up the fight against right wing propaganda to me earlier, sorry to make assumptions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Trump would currently be a better leader than Biden. If you had asked me to choose a few years ago when Biden was sharper, maybe I would agree he would be better. I lean right on a lot of issues though, so even if Biden #8217;s mental state was better I might still vote for Trump. It #8217;s all hypothetical tho, I #8217;d have to see how Biden acted if his dementia was less severe.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve even seen some of these people say they want Ivanka to run for president later, we don #8217;t need to establish a monarchy.

    <TEXT>That #8217;s fine, but I didn #8217;t ask why people were downvoting me. I knew I would be downvoted when I posted that I will vote for trump again. This isn #8217;t the first time I #8217;ve posted conservative views on Reddit. I just wanted some debate, I really like debating people with opposing views to me. It sucks because the downvote system essentially works as a censor, so I don #8217;t get to engage in topics with that many people when I post right wing views. I would propose that you can dislike Trump worship (and any political figure worship) and still feel like Trump would be a better president than Biden.

    <TEXT>How so? The police reform bill that was proposed offered most of the changes BLM wants (short of abolishing police which is ridiculous). LGBTQ might not have gained many rights, but they also haven #8217;t lost many. At least they can still get married, that #8217;s progress that doesn #8217;t seem to be in danger of being rescinded. The only case I could see is that the current administration is largely pro life, so you could argue they are threatening women #8217;s rights. Abortion is a hard issue, for a long time I was pro life because I wanted to be philosophically consistent, and it #8217;s my belief that the government should try to protect lives. But I lean more towards pro choice now, because I realized I don #8217;t have to be philosophically consistent. If a woman is pregnant and knows she can #8217;t support the child and they will both suffer, then I agree abortion should be allowed. I #8217;m not a single issue voter though, I think many of Biden #8217;s policies would be more damaging to the country than having officials that are opposed to abortion. I still can #8217;t believe you retorted my last response by simply profiling my race,gender,orientation and Reddit upvoted you. The double standard is staggering. I #8217;d recommend you don #8217;t do that, if I was gender non binary I would #8217;ve gone full triggered mode when you said that.</TEXT>

You kind of confirmed my initial statement when you didn #8217;t know about Secoriea Turner (the 8 year old killed by BLM protesters). I #8217;m not saying all of BLM is bad, I #8217;m not saying all BLM protesters would kill an 8 year old. I am absolutely saying that BLM plays up certain deaths and is pretty quiet about others. Another example is Bernell Trammel, the black Trump supporter killed for expressing his political opinions. Where was his candle light vigil? Was his life less important than George Floyd #8217;s?

    <TEXT>I see your point, and it does make sense. But actions speak louder than words and that initial statement kind of foreshadowed the direction Facebook has gone. He has continued to exploit people #8217;s data, he is just mature enough to know that insulting his customers is stupid. To be fair, that conversation was never meant to be seen by the public, but it definitely wasn #8217;t taken out of context. He was telling one of his Harvard friends that he could get them any data they want about ~4000 students at Harvard and he called them dumb fucks for trusting him with their data. I see your logic, but I just don #8217;t see that he has changed much. He never stopped exploiting people #8217;s data, selling data is just too profitable. He knew data was valuable back then when he was 19 and now that he has made billions of dollars off of it I #8217;m sure he #8217;s more aware of its value than ever. I #8217;m not gonna think about my cringy teenager moments because I don #8217;t like to do that either lol. Sometimes I wish I could selectively delete things from my memory</TEXT>

Then suddenly he Biden flipped his opinion on the bans (right around the time liberal media did too). Recently Biden was asked what he would do differently to fight COVID if he were president. He named seven things. Seven things Trump had already done. The bottom line is, no one knew how to deal with this and many leaders made mistakes. You need to keep in mind when assessing the severity of COVID in the USA that we are a very large country with over 300 million people, and we are also doing far more testing than any other country.</TEXT>

If you actually listen to our president and Biden, you #8217;ll be able to see they are extremely different. Trump is a nationalist who has lowered taxes, strengthened our borders, stacked the Supreme Court with conservatives (although some seem like rhinos), enhanced our military, created the space force, maintained pro-life policies, defended our police during these riots, etc. etc. I get so tired of hearing foreigners criticize our politics when they are so uneducated about what is actually happening. It seems it #8217;s only America that almost every country has something to say about our politics, I dunno where you #8217;re from but I #8217;d bet I don #8217;t know enough about your politicians to make an educated observation.

I pay less taxes than under Obama #8217;s administration, I have made far more in the market then under Obama #8217;s administration. And you write off the hot topics as not affecting the average American? Guns are very important to our safety here. A lot of us consider abortion murder, how can you say that the average American wouldn #8217;t be affected by a regime normalizing murder? I can #8217;t tell you how frustrating it is being told how our politics work from foreigners that don #8217;t actually know what they #8217;re talking about.

Many aspects of the modern Democratic Party here are Marxist, with the spice of anarchy thrown in (which is paradoxical). Modern conservatism is morphing into more of what liberalism used to be here.

    <DATE>2020-09-01 00:29:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m just curious if any of you became vegan not necessarily due to the morality and ethics of it, but because you simply developed an aversion to animal products? This started happening to me around the beginning of the year, and it #8217;s getting worse and worse. I used to be happy that I was such a non-picky eater. But the thought of eating meat and cheese (and recently, increasingly eggs and butter) makes me gag these days. I #8217;m not sure what happened. I #8217;m slightly concerned it won #8217;t stop and I #8217;ll develop an aversion to non-animal based food too, as I #8217;m already feeling aversion to things like potatoes and mushrooms. Just wondering if anyone else has had this experience? I #8217;m worried it #8217;s a psychological problem EDIT: Thanks a lot for everyone's advice. I had a feeling this wasn't normal, but figured I'd seek advice in other avenues before seeing a doctor. I'll make an appointment soon to try to rule out any physical issues, and if that comes up clean I'll look at therapists. I hope I can come back and revisit veganism after I work this out, as I think it will be an easier diet for me to follow since animal products absolutely disgust me at this point. Very grateful for all of your advice, best of luck to everyone during the Pandemic.</TEXT>

It #8217;s like I #8217;m beginning to fixate on whether the food is  #8220;clean #8221; or not.

    <TEXT>Someone else suggested it might have a physical root. I guess I #8217;ll check there first. I think it #8217;s more psychological, because it #8217;s thinking about the food and I dwell on what it is and whether it #8217;s clean. Like with meat I dwell on how it #8217;s disgusting to eat the fat, sinew, etc. or with potatoes I dwell on that they were covered in dirt, or mushrooms growing in manure. That #8217;s why I #8217;m concerned it could get worse if it spreads to other vegetables since manure is used in a lot of compost. Idk, I would guess it #8217;s psychological in root. I guess from what you #8217;ve said this isn #8217;t a normal thought process for some vegans though, so I appreciate your insight</TEXT>

You could do more damage by just holding him accountable for mocking a disabled person, but leftists always go too far and say he was mocking the disability. I see this a lot, leftists hurt there credibility because they try to frame a narrative that isn #8217;t true when they could use facts and still make an argument against Trump. Injecting disinfectants for example, many leftists claim he straight up told people to inject disinfectants. This looks delusional to anyone who has seen the footage, because he simply didn #8217;t say that. You could use the argument that he suggested injecting something disinfectant like could be a potential treatment in a press briefing, and that resulted in some dumbasses ingesting disinfectants. That would be valid, but leftists always try to go too far and it really does hurt their credibility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ll answer since the others don #8217;t want to and I like arguing. I think some police reform would be good, currently many police have the attitude that they can treat everyone else like subhuman garbage and get away with it. Unnecessary force such as the choke hold on George Floyd or Tony Timpa (white man killed same way as Floyd) should probably be eliminated. With that said, I believe BLM has the wrong idea. Of course black lives matter, but they aren #8217;t targeted disproportionately by police. The fact is, blacks commit more crimes. Perhaps it #8217;s due to poverty, but it is a fact. There is this large misconception that whites people are treated significantly better by police, and it just isn #8217;t true. I can find you as many videos of police assaulting whites in terrible ways as you can blacks. Now, since we #8217;ve made it all about race rather than simply police reform, it has radicalized both sides with BLM rioters destroying businesses and radical conservatives dreaming about fighting back (you might be surprised, but many radical conservatives are ready for a war). Defunding the police is no way to fix it, that will just lower the quality of people joining the police even more. So in essence, I believe some BLM people have good intentions, but they are misguided and the movement as a whole is unhelpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s not really cancel culture imo. It #8217;s more when people make a movement in order to end the person #8217;s career. You just stopped reading his books because you disagree with him, you didn #8217;t do anything to make him lose his job. He #8217;s still writing books btw. I think this is how it should be handled, if you disagree with them don #8217;t use their products if it bothers you enough. But don #8217;t call for canceling their career based off a difference of opinion. It would be one thing if they murdered someone, but they would go to prison for that. Something as small as being homophobic shouldn #8217;t mean you lose everything, but it absolutely will distance you from the gay audience and hurt your career in that way EDIT: sorry, just noticed the other guy replying to you said similar things.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m in the mood to argue again, and you are very civil unlike most liberals I talk to, so I #8217;m glad to engage. First I #8217;d love to see the video about Trump saying he mislead about the pandemic. Not trying to be the annoying  #8220;source please #8221; person, but I #8217;d genuinely be interested to hear it. Regarding the other points, I #8217;d begin by saying masks becoming a political issue was never on Trump. He advocated for masks basically the entire time, tho early on even the media was confused. He didn #8217;t wear masks during his press conferences likely to speak more clearly. Never once did he say masks are bad and people shouldn #8217;t wear them. Now sure, some conservative Karen types decided it was a breach to their freedom, but you can #8217;t blame their opinions on Trump. Now regarding other countries responding better, Trump responded extremely early to the pandemic and went so far as to close off travel from China at the end of January. An action that Democrats vilified, and even in one of the debates every candidate said they wouldn #8217;t do it. As far as us doing worse than other countries, there are two key elements to look at. 1. We do far more testing than any other country, so of course our numbers will be higher. 2. We are a massive country with many more citizens than other countries. It would be more accurate to compare American infection numbers and death rates to the entirety of Europe rather than a single country like Germany. I #8217;m quite sure neither of us will convince the other of their viewpoint, but I like arguing when it doesn #8217;t devolve into ad hominems immediately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eh I don #8217;t think PMing is needed, as it doesn #8217;t really need to go further than this (unless you #8217;d really like to continue and PM me, I #8217;d feel rude not to reply). Despite our differences I think we can both agree the country is going backwards, though I don #8217;t blame it on Trump. The reasons for us coming to that conclusion are definitely different. It #8217;s my feeling that Trump has been the best president of my lifetime (not that I have a great, storied selection to choose from). I don #8217;t expect a reply, so don #8217;t feel obligated to give one. But one thing I wanted to mention is that when the BLM riots started, we got a lot of good data from them. Data that showed that the virus doesn #8217;t spread nearly as well when people congregate outside. Note that all of Trumps rallies and the RNC were held outside other than the first one. He isn #8217;t willingly putting people in danger, and people have learned that it doesn #8217;t spread nearly as well outside. Those attending that don #8217;t wear masks are doing it on their own accord. Anyway, I know you #8217;re done arguing, and I don #8217;t blame you. It #8217;s so tiring arguing with people who will never see it your way, I get that. Have a good night/morning</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks so much for your very in depth answer. I didn #8217;t mean to insult the wiki! There was a lot of great information there, and frankly it #8217;s on me for not catching Czes #8217;s motivation more than a lack of info on the wiki. Also I should #8217;ve checked the FAQ, I kind of just rushed here to grab an answer, again my bad. You #8217;ve answered both my questions very well. Thanks so much, I #8217;m absolutely in love with the anime and will probably read the light novels eventually. I was aware spoilers might be on the wiki, and I definitely got some lol. I don #8217;t think it will change my enjoyment at all, as I loved watching the anime a second time and will definitely be coming back for a 3rd watch (and maybe 4th, 5th lol). I never rewatch anime or any shows in general, but there is definitely something special about this one. I feel each scene is so riveting, and I will catch more each time I watch. Have a good night/morning/day</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your answer, I completely understand now from yours and others answers here. I should #8217;ve checked the FAQ first but just wanted an answer fast, so that #8217;s my bad! I absolutely love this anime, it #8217;s topped Monster as my number one favorite anime of all time. I definitely intend to check out the light novels eventually, but I really like anime due to the music primarily. I feel it adds a lot. I wish more of Narita #8217;s works were animated, from my understanding it #8217;s just Baccano! And Durarara, right? Well hope another one of his works is picked up by an animation studio, he #8217;s brilliant. Thanks again for the answer, best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hah so hard to choose a favorite character I love so many of them for so many reasons. If I had to pick one, it #8217;s probably Claire. But I also love firo, Maiza, Ladd, and jacuzzi so much. I just love Claire #8217;s mentality and his twisted love for the railroad so much. He #8217;s just so badass. I #8217;m sure this is a very watered down answer compared to what you would get from someone more familiar with the story, but at this point guess that #8217;s my answer. Oh and freaking Isaac and Miria. In some ways they are my favorite. I guess I really can #8217;t pick just one, but if I had to it #8217;s Claire at this point. I guess I #8217;ll have to read the light novels based on that response! Man I wish there was more of this anime, such a great story. Narita is truly a genius Edit: that #8217;s the great thing with narita I noticed in Durarara too, every character is fascinating. He writes some really unique characters, and I love most of them!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you #8217;re in actual pain there really is no good substitute for pain management. People conflate dangerous opioids like fentanyl analogues or research chemicals with the safer one. I would suggest you just let your doctor do his job, he #8217;s more knowledgeable than that random internet person that told you to get off them. This is a big gripe I have about the so called  #8220;opioid epidemic #8221; in America. The stuff killing people are not the things doctors prescribe, and they are essentially fear mongering and making people not take the medication their doctors prescribe. Plus it is making it harder for doctors to prescribe it to people who really are in chronic pain and need opioids. Sorry for the rant, this issue really annoys me since I have family in chronic pain that has had their pain meds essentially taken away.</TEXT>

There is no good substitute for opioids right now, otc painkillers just don #8217;t work well enough.

My mom was on dilaudid for a long time to treat severe chronic headaches. She no longer gets that, primarily due to red tape put up due to the opioid epidemic. Did she go to heroin? Nope, now she just lives in chronic pain and visibly gets frustrated more easily. And it #8217;s so obvious she #8217;s in pain.

    <TEXT>Oh no, I got that. I just see that what you are doing is fruitless. Howie won #8217;t win, and not voting Biden helps ensure a Trump victory. Idk, I #8217;m kind of hurting my choice by arguing here, but sometimes it #8217;s just too fun to argue and I #8217;m curious of your logic. Like I was opposed to Trump in the 2016 primaries, but at the end of the day his values were way more in line for me than Hillary, so I voted for him. And he #8217;s pleasantly surprised me. Like what if Trump can #8217;t get a Supreme Court justice in by the time he #8217;s out of office? If Biden wins it will be a liberal Justice, but if Trump wins due to people like you not voting it #8217;s guaranteed a conservative justice. Surely Biden is more in line with your ideas than Trump if you hate Trump so much, right? You gotta look at the big picture. I despised Trump in 2016, but Hillary would #8217;ve targeted gun rights, increased taxes on the middle to upper class, and done many other things to damage my quality of life. So the choice was obvious. I #8217;d love to hear a bit more nuance as to why you refuse to vote for Biden.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It wasn #8217;t really a comeback, I called you a dickhead because you are one. I can tell you are also an arrogant  #8220;I #8217;m very smart #8221; type by the way you jump to insulting someone #8217;s intelligence when they call you out for saying something stupid. All I said is that it was a weird use of hyperbole, which it was since usually it #8217;s used to exaggerate things that make sense. Then you jumped to saying I couldn #8217;t read. Maybe that #8217;s because you are a dickhead. I guess you were trying to make a point about her surviving against the odds over the years, but it was shittily phrased and clearly I #8217;m not the only one who thought it was stupid. Anyway, I #8217;m not sure why I bothered writing this out since you are probably a liberal cuck and idgaf what liberals have to say. Can #8217;t wait for Trump to fill RBGs seat with someone who cares about America and deserves to be there EDIT: my b, meant to post this reply to your last response.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No it #8217;s not, that #8217;s not how the immune system works. The placebo effect cannot cause the immune system to create antibodies against covid. Edit: I suppose it could happen, but it #8217;s insanely unlikely. From what we understand the immune response tries to create antibodies against the pathogen seemingly randomly. So it could be possible for it to create an antibody that would work on covid, without every detecting covid. This would be so unlikely though, it #8217;s nearly impossible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is that placebo could cause the body to work harder and could possibly get extremely lucky and generate an antibody that would work against covid. It #8217;s insanely unlikely, but It #8217;s just not good to use absolutes when discussing things like this that aren #8217;t understood. I mean the current model for immune response suggests that antibodies are produced seemingly randomly until one can defend against the pathogen (though I doubt it #8217;s really random). Your analogy of a placebo allowing you to draw a map of Europe is probably about as likely as a placebo creating an antibody against covid. I just didn #8217;t want to say it #8217;s impossible, because given enough cases (like a googol cases, or some other enormous number, it might happen) EDIT: I just want to say I pretty much only added that because I was sure someone would come in and try to correct me saying it could potentially be possible, but of course people will come in to try to correct me either way lol. Sometimes I hate the internet.</TEXT>

If you don #8217;t ask, you #8217;ve just knocked their drink all over them (I #8217;ve had this happen). I also had someone lean her chair all the way back (way more than 2 inches) and her headrest was basically in my lap. It was so uncomfortable, and it was a long flight.

    <TEXT>That isn #8217;t remotely comparable, and buying a front row ticket is not always an option (plus they are usually more expensive). Why would it be so unreasonable to ask the person behind you if you can lean back to avoid them getting their drink dumped on them? I #8217;m sure when you are on planes you get drinks and use the tray sometimes, and I #8217;m also sure you #8217;d be pissed if the person in front of you dumped it all over you by suddenly reclining. I can #8217;t believe the level of entitlement people have about this topic,  #8220;I care about my comfort, not anyone else #8217;s! #8221; I never recline because I know just how terrible it is for the person behind me. Can you seriously not understand why it #8217;s uncomfortable for someone to have their chair reclined all the way back and basically have their head in your lap in the already cramped plane seats?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol it was one of the short cups they provide that was dumped on me. There is literally a cup holder on the tray. It #8217;s intended to be used. And again, all US airlines have reclining seats on every chair, so it #8217;s not like the reclining people paid extra for the reclining privilege. Having someone sitting next to you is not nearly as bad as having some asshole #8217;s head in your lap and their chair compressing your legs. Plus they make it where you can #8217;t use your tray. It seems judging by upvotes and responses on this post, as well as the fact most people tend not to recline their chairs on planes, that most people hate this and there is just a group of vocal assholes that don #8217;t care about other people and recline anyway.</TEXT>

Then someone else said this isn #8217;t the cartoon universe and I can #8217;t make comparisons such as the professor having a lab and jack being in the future, and that person compared their appearances. Their point was that the cartoon universe and fictional irl universe here is different tho, which I refute since their premise is that the professor has the same lab and relationship with the powderpuff girls as the cartoon universe. Them having similar appearances was a side note Edit: the irl universe here and the cartoon universes are likely different, but to believe cartoon aspects like the professors lab and his relationship with the power puff girls, while ignoring others like jack being in the future seems inconsistent. This is all a long winded way to say, this was a very casual sketch they created that had no malevolent meanings. And the people trying to add negative meanings are really reaching</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No need to apologize! Seems it #8217;s my misunderstanding as I was just trying to explain my viewpoint and didn #8217;t catch you were pointing out a joke about their similar appearances. I remember these too, and enjoyed them as a kid. It irks me that some people (the ones shown in the OP post here) try to put negative meaning in children #8217;s shows, so I probably came off as overly defensive. All these shows were a big part of my childhood, and I get the subtle humor they were suggesting in this particular scene that #8217;s being scrutinized</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk, I #8217;m gen z and I really love watches with analogue clocks. They have such intricate and complex machinery in them, and a nice one looks really good when you #8217;re trying to look professional. Just because digital watches are a thing doesn #8217;t necessarily mean it #8217;s anachronistic to wear a classic watch. They look so much nicer than a fancy digital watch (think like the golden iwatches for example), and it really doesn #8217;t hurt anyone for people that like analogue watches to wear them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I know they joke about it, but some people legitimately want them to be together, which just sits wrong with me since they are straight and real people. I #8217;m not a huge fan of people shipping straight fictional characters into gay relationships in general, I think it #8217;s weird. Some people are way too invested, like when George was on love or host recently a lot of the chat was saying they were crying that dream wasn #8217;t in it lol. That #8217;s just unhealthy, they are friends, not gay lovers. Idk I just think it #8217;s weird and it makes me further want to distance myself from the fandom.</TEXT>

Edit: I admit tho, if I got it to like 30-40 min runs I #8217;d probably start recording, so I agree that most people wouldn #8217;t go for WR without recording, but there is the chance someone did it for fun and got super lucky.

    <TEXT>Yeah, the thing is nuclear power has a ton of great benefits, and I #8217;d never suggest we abandon the idea of using completely. But there are major issues that must be addressed, one being inability to deal with the waste products (containment is not a long term solution). Another being the potential danger of a failure in a nuclear power plant. And perhaps the most important, the difficulty of separating nuclear power from nuclear weapons. The main hurdle to creating nuclear weapons is obtaining the uranium/plutonium isotopes, so if a country is using nuclear power they can very quickly shift to creating nuclear weapons since they #8217;ll already be enriching the isotopes. I agree with OP that nuclear energy can be a game changer, but you #8217;ve gotta look at the potential dangers, including the danger of increasing nuclear weapons in the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are right, it #8217;s the same issue with a lot of mental diagnoses. We take a categorical approach, when a scaled approach is needed. This is why the psychology field has a replication crisis, they went off a categorical approach for years. If we used a scaled approach we could identify people who were physically abused much easier. This should be used as a guideline, NOT a diagnostic tool. Once the old people in charge of the DSM die, I #8217;m sure we will move to a scalar approach. That is more scientific. Currently almost all of psychology is pseudoscience, and if you disagree I #8217;d love a response rather than just a downvote. I can explain further</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just want to say, I live in Dallas, TX and urban fishing is very much a thing. It #8217;s kind of a fun hobby in and of itself to search around and find the small pockets of water that are fish able. You #8217;d probably be surprised how many you can find in the city. You can use google earth and look around to find various streams and ponds, and as long as they aren #8217;t on private land it #8217;s usually legal to fish there (this definitely varies by state/country so research first).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chess might not be a bad idea. It has the reputation of a game that requires a lot of intelligence, but it really is just a game. To be a grandmaster you pretty much need to be a genius, but anyone can play casually and enjoy the game. Definitely would fit the category of a hobby that makes you feel smart. There are several wonderful websites to play chess where you are matched up against people of similar skill, and they are mostly all free to use, although they do usually have a premium version (not really worth paying imo).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no issue calling out rapists and guys who are seriously disrespectful to women. I do take issue with lumping ideas like men not publicly showing emotions in with men who rape and disrespect women. They aren #8217;t related, and it #8217;s disgusting to lump them together. It only hurts your narrative to do that EDIT: calling me a dumb fuck isn #8217;t very helpful to your argument either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I got punished for being a crybaby and I have no intention of ever beating a woman. This is where your argument falls apart, you lump the no emotion part with being abusive to women. It #8217;s not so cut and dry. If I had a son, which I have no intention to for the record, I wouldn #8217;t punish him for crying. But it #8217;s a generational thing, I don #8217;t blame my dad for it and maybe I am stronger as a result. I feel like you are trying to educate me, but when you continually call me a dumbfuck it just makes me think you are a cruel bitch, and I have no intention listening to a cruel bitch. I won #8217;t listen to anyone who calls me a dumb fuck, even if they have reason. I see a lot of holes in your argument, but even if it was sound I wouldn #8217;t listen to you since you are such an insulting jerk.</TEXT>
