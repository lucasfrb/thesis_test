    <TEXT>When you turned away from the camera to show your glorious booty, I was waiting for you to bend over and pull at least one cheek aside. Not to be disappointed, though, because that water running down your crack was "fresh" (pun intended) and very sexy. (Not as sexy as your wonderful ass itself, of course.) Thanks for sharing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To mess with one of our party members (a wizard) who was always asking if items he found were magical, or rolling checks to *find* magical items, our DM gave him a Helm of Reckoning. When asked what it did, the DM's response was, after making a confused face (because he didn't HAVE a use in mind), "It makes you reckon...better?" With a shrug in his voice. Our wizard immediately put it on, but sadly never used it. :/</TEXT>

Different people say that once they see the process they'll never eat another one for as long as they live, but I have no qualms. I actually had never had one until I got the job, as they're so expensive at retail price. Jeez! Lol. Plus, the grinding/mixing room and the stuffing room are naturally cold rooms, so the meat doesn't get a chance to smell like MEAT, (and of course it's seasoned anyway), so that's not a turnoff. If the room smelled bad, I can see myself swearing them off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I work in the stuffing room. What we call "grind side" is right next door; the grinding/mixing room. The meat gets pushed over to us in big metal tubs. The tubs themselves weigh about 100lbs and the meat itself is about 700-800 per tub. We load it into our stuffing machine (think a giant version of what your mom or grandmother may have had in the kitchen), dump it into the hopper, and then the machine puts it into the casings. We hang the strands on metal rods that get hung on metal racks to go into the smokehouse to be cooked. I know that was more info than you probably were looking for, but I like to be thorough. You can check out the machines on Handtmann's website. They're all variations of the same design.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Omg. I found this website made by this family of crazies a few years ago. The wife was the content creator of everything (supposedly) and again, assuming that their story was true, here's what was going on: They were missionaries in (Africa? I can't remember but that is a good guess.) and her kids had a Pokemon book sort of like a hard copy Pokedex. One villager was over to their place one time and he told her that they were demons. She sat down with him with the book and went through it page by page and he told her what demon each one was and what they did. My favorite one was Diglett. He said that it burrows through the earth and sneaks around to do his evil that way. (As if the picture alone didn't give him a clue. Lol.) I smell BS in the story. But if it's true, obviously this dude was making shit up the whole time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. I hope that nothing of what I'm gonna say will come across as rude or angry. I just wanted to explain myself better. (however, even though I promise you I'm not angry, I do want to share that you should probably refrain from "wtf" in the future when he talking to someone else about their parenting choices, although if I was willfully giving him heroine or bragging about abusing him, or something, then BY ALL MEANS call a parent out!! Otherwise, that's a good way to start a fight in a YouTube comment section. Lol!) "man youre letting your kid kill ppl but sexual references or themes is where you draw the line? wtf" He understands full well that this is a fantasy realm (a game) and that OF COURSE this is not something that, by extension, is ok to do for real, NOR is he a kid who gets ramped up over shooters, or gets joy out of killing--unless it's a dick Arch-Vile from Doom II, amiright?! For an example of *adults* who have a hard time distinguishing fantasy from reality, you should do some heavy research sometime into Janet Reno and Desert Bus. Seriously. Good stuff. (And holy hell that woman was anti-fun!) That being said... he's 8. It's not even that sex bothers me and I don't want to talk about it or anything, but just that I don't want to it to be too much too soon. And throwing abortion into that dialogue? Oof. No thanks! As for the rest of it, my ex and I have a tumultuous relationship with religion. Long story short (that I'd be willing to flesh out irl via PM), we're not atheists, but I guess I'd classify myself as an agnostic humanist? So we're not trying to shelter him from religion, but just be on-guard against unnecessary indoctrination. I hope that helps. Feel free to pm me with any questions. Take care!</TEXT>

I really want to use a walkthrough the next time I play Infinite to get all the audio files. The ones from the twins were SO cool!

    <TEXT>I've been a Hotshots Gold elitist. Even though it's cartoony, I think the physics are MORE REALISTIC than in other games. What bugs me so much is that the prediction ribbon in most games shows you the distance your ball MIGHT roll to. Not helpful. In Hotshots, the ribbon shoes you where you where your ball will land, and roll is extra. SO much easier to plan for/predict where your shot will end up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What pissed me off about the Force unleashed is that it was marketed as this game where you're evil; you're killing good guys and to me that's always been a plus. Not just because it's more fun to murder indiscriminately, but because plot-wise I'm just sick of being a good guy and going through motions. And then when I play the Force unleashed, of course in the end you end up turning to the good side and fighting for the right doing all this tropey stuff. I was like "Ugh. I'm done." one thing I've always wanted is a game where you're Darth Vader and you're just murdering all the Jedi that're left over and that's it. no extra plot. I mean maybe some conflict between you and the emperor would be cool, but I don't need a big story with the good guys and stuff; just let me do the canon of him killing the last Jedi and be done with it. And that's what the Force unleashed seemed like. But unfortunately it had to trope the plot up. Sorry. Rant over. Lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I beat Infinite, one connection I was expecting the game to make is to reveal who the dead body was in the lighthouse at the beginning of the game. The (presumably) dude with the bag over his head and the sign around his neck that said ("Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt"? I could be wrong.) But the ending of the game never addressed who it was, and when you reentered the lighthouse, he was gone. Any guesses? It doesn't make sense to me for it to have been *nobody*. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ohhhh. Ok. That makes sense. When I played through the game, I took it as a message left for Booker, since he's embarking on a quest anyway. Thanks. And I don't think it's exactly an Occam's Razor type situation. In a game like this, I EXPECTED there to be some "aha!" moment where they reveal what that small detail was about. If they hadn't covered his head, yeah, I would have kept an eye out for that npc in the game, but I wouldn't have been quite as curious, not would have I expected a giant revelation in the end. Like, at one point playing the game, I hypothesized that dead dude was an alternate Booker who had positioned himself to stop YOU from going to Columbia in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to live with some friends, and it was the dead of Winter in rural Ohio. The house we rented was an old farmhouse that had some odd rooms connected to the outside of the house--sort of like an outdoor porch. (Hard to explain with a strange house structure.) Anyway, we had no trash pickup, so all winter long we would throw the trash bags into this room. Well, one warm late-spring day, me and my friend load up his full-sized van with bags and make not one, but 2 trips to the dump. It was horrendous. We were trying to describe it to each other on our first trip out, and I said "You know how in those old cartoons, the granny would bake an apple pie and set it in the windowsill to cool, and there would be this hand made of the smell that would like you in?" "Yeah" "It's like that, except that hand has a knife in it and it's stabbing you through nostrils into your brain." Tldr: an entire winter's worth of frozen garbage does NOT thaw well</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Final Fantasy VIII (8) is one of the best Final Fantasies</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-01 06:08:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think Final Fantasy VIII is one of the best games in the series. I would say "better than VII" but I don't know if that's necessarily true. But I do LIKE it better than VII. And I know that's enough to get beat up by fellow RPG fans. I like the realism of not only the graphics (the people look like people) but the plot itself is more believable to me as well. I like the time travel storyline (and I do NOT think that the main cast growing up together is cheap and convenient), and I think a lot of the characters are better fleshed out than in VII. Not everybody has their ONE trait that sets them apart. Yes, there are dialogue bits that are quite repetitive, but certain characters, Quistis, for example, are more rounded. I do have more points, but I can't pull them off the top of my head. Please ask me about other reasons, I would be happy to respond. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I bought the remaster on the switch. (I can only assume it's on PS as well.) They included an option to turn off all random encounters, and a speed X3 option. Makes drawing magic WAYYYY less tedious!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like the sphere/class system in X-2. I really do. But I can't get over how EVERYTHING in that game is a side quest. It's like the horror of Xenosaga II came back to haunt me. Maybe one day I'll slog through it, but I need more story in an RPG.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't downvote you, but I can't upvote you, either, lol! Personal complaint (and I've always felt this way, and I don't know why): anthromorphs (2 words?) Have always irritated me. It's why I've always hated Richard Scarry books. And I don't know why we have a whole city of Hippopotamus people and such. Also, the characters annoy the shit out of me, everybody's so, so stupid. The plot is minimal, Trance pisses me off because you're always forced to use it when it's least helpful, and having abilities linked to equipment means it takes FOREVER to get everybody where you want them to be. IX is perhaps my least favorite ever. (Though I've only played up to XII)</TEXT>

That's one of the biggest reasons I think this story would make a good live-action film. ....That my sister and I may or may not have casted when we were in high school. Lol.

    <TEXT>I highly recommend it. Plus, it's freaking hilarious to make people run around at 3X speed! Lol. And don't worry, when you hold Select to boost GFs, it forces the game to run at normal speed so you're not screwing yourself over. But other than that, the battles are fast. The victory animations are that much more ridiculous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your post got me wondering if each barcode number HAS to be for that one item only across all other products. I Googled just that, and I can't find a straight answer. Even though there are WAY more barcode possibilities than products in existence, it seems like they are sometimes dual-ly used for whatever reason. E.g. different companies/different product types, etc. Even the "U" stands for "universal", that only applies to THAT product. Do you know more than I do? I found it highly frustrating that I couldn't find definitive information.</TEXT>

Gillian Anderson and Piper Laurie are my 2 biggest all-time hotties for this reason. Piper's "S"s and the way that she says them through her teeth is SO sexy to me. Gillian uses her lips a lot when she talks, and it's her "D"s that get me the most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't. It hurts. (I do have a very low pain tolerance. Not a condition that makes my genitals experience pain for any particular reason.) Side note: my wife and I have 3 sons, and we chose not to circumcise them. One day, whilst sitting on the couch next to our oldest, then around 2 or 3, he was pulling his foreskin out as far as it would go. (An impressive inch or more). My wife was like "what you you doing?" To which he responded "I'm trying to streeeeeeeeetch it."  #129318; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>......why were you reading fanfics? (I ask half to make the joke, and half seriously. Was it out of curiosity and/or to mock the gay/lesbian ones? Or to find good stories? I don't know your age, but were they Harry Potter fanfics? I know they're SUPER popular.) And speaking of Harry Potter fanfics, every single person who reads this comment should check this out. It's hilarious and terrible and amazing. [Mortified reading of poorly-written gay Harry Potter fanfic](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RFfZjyMPYUp6zMT96L5kt?si=foRBwNQBS3mN3Gc_8RtorA)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On a scale of 1-10, how glad are you that you don't have to respond to EVERY. SINGLE. REQUEST. (Or even a freaking "thank you") with "my pleasure? I read your response that you are generally a nice person, and I am too, so I can relate to that. But I could NOT take only being able to say one thing to customers. It makes it so obviously disingenuine that it's off-putting, and it boggles my mind how the company thinks that customers can't see through that. (Sorry. Rant over. I have friends who worked there in college. And I was angry for their sake. Especially as one of them HATED having to say it all the time.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. I'm not saying you're wrong. And I'm a very empathetic person, don't get me wrong. But I'm just saying that's where my sadness goes. I guess it kind of IS empathetic. Like, I wish I could have been there for the people that died horrifically tragically and saved them. Not consciously, but my heart breaks for the person who died. Whether they had a disease that they knew was going to kill them, or died in a sudden car accident, or were shot, I feel for them in their final moments, and wish that I could have pulled them out of that horrible situation, and if it is a human at fault, I am angry at their killer for taking someone so powerfully influential away from us by force.

    <TEXT>Ohhhh, that's after she falls and you save her butt, and she gets all disheveled, right? And you're welcome! Unfortunately I don't know those games. I've always been behind the times in terms of gaming what's TLOU? The lord of Umbrellas? Torrential Lemurs often Upchuck? The Legend of Underwear? Lolz. I've seen a lot of girls/young ladies cosplay Elizabeth on this subreddit, and all their eyes match hers. I feel played if they were contacts, lol. However, I HAVE seen a few girls in my life with BRIGHT blue eyes, so I never think twice (hell, ONCE) about the fact that they could be not-natural. (The brightest blue eyes I've seen were cerulean. SUCH a gorgeous hue. nd I have seen two girls with SILVER eyes. I did research. It IS naturally possible. Omg they were so beautiful.) Sorry about the digression. It just reminded me of all that. You look great at any rate. Also, in your opinion, why was Elizabeth so into corsets? Was it because she enjoyed that style of dress? Honestly to me it seemed like it was a security thing for her. When you (booker) help her tighten hers it was such a tender moment. She looked so hurt and vulnerable. It broke my heart in that moment. What's your opinion?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right?! It probably influenced her role in the game, too. It's so beautifully crafted. The whole game. I loved how the plot is thicker than the first two games. NOT AT ALL that they were disappointing or flimsy! I'm just saying that the creators had gotten so amazing at their craft that every nuance in the game that seems innocuous is important. Elizabeth's character adds SO much depth to the game. I LOVED the chats with her in the game and how you looked at her as your charge to protect. And I myself am a Saver. I have somewhat of a Jesus complex. (I don't know if that's the term. That's just what I've always called it.) So I my heart went out to her through that entire game. I wanted to get her the hell out of her hell. When she decided to end everything and not just run away at the end I wanted to make her just leave and be happy. Ugh.</TEXT>

She looks at him half-suspiciously and replies "How do you know that?" Luke grins at her and says, "I felt his presents." Badum tss!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. It doesn't. It's not like your parents sat down and hand-picked everything about you. THEY got the luck of the draw too!

Just saying that I'm a nerd, (star trek, video games, etc.) who looks deeper into things. More analytically. Fir example, I was very much involved in the christian church when I wrote it (though the book is still a critique OF said christian church as a whole), and two of my chapters are comparing the Borg to the church.

    <TEXT>I had these two Indian (the country) women come through one day. Nice as can be, but had thick accents. Foreigners always were a challenge for me, not because of race or anything, but because I never wanted to mess up their order so I felt like a jerk asking them several times what they had said. And there was also a small fear of them not fully understanding what a particular item on the menu, or ingredient WAS. So, ok. One of the women ordered a chicken teriyaki salad. To me that's already freaking disgusting. I HATE the teriyaki chicken with a passion, and the idea of that on a salad grossed me out. She wasn't done, however. We had guacamole at the time. She had me put a scoop of guacamole on it, as well as a scoop of tuna. Whatever floats your boat, I guess?  #129335; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. That makes sense. (And I swear to God they made the voices and phrases on those machines as annoying as possible. They're so goddam loud. And the ammo bandito...omg. It almost feels racist, because I can't understand what it's saying to even look it up. I did research some of what it says and even after priming my brain with that information, I can't hear some of those words in-game. It just sounds like a Mexican person gargling Klingon.

    <TEXT>Au contraire. I'm ALL for sex ed at a relatively early age. But the mindset of the kids at which age you propose to teach them is a little early, and inappropriate. Also, what about rape?

    <TEXT>Eehhhhh. I'd agree if the pill didn't have such a horrible history of just fucking people's hormones up. I know a lot of people get on it to REGULATE their hormones/periods, but it has wreaked havoc on so many others. I wouldn't be comfortable putting my daughter (I don't have a girl; I'm speaking hypothetically) on the pill until she was older and was truly comfortable with the risks and physically matured enough. I wonder now that you mentioned it, actually, how early the pill is OKd for. What the medical recommendation is for hoe old you should be before you get on it. I have a friend who is a nurse. I can reply later. :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Complaining about somebody not giving two shits about who he endangers is whining? If you were forced to be in a car with someone who you KNEW had coronavirus, would you want to take that GIANT risk that you could get it? Give it to your wife? Your husband? Your kids?! AND you have to quarantine yourself for 2 weeks?! Trump's ridiculous actions shows ONCE AGAIN how selfish he is. He had zero concern for the well-being ok his staff who he forced to parade him in front of the hospital for no fucking reason. He placed his life ahead of everybody else's, giving absolutely no shits whether or not they caught it and how it would affect their lives with their spouses and their children. TRUMP is the one who throws tantrums like a 3-year-old, expecting the entire universe to bend to his will. Fuck Trump. Fuck him to hell.</TEXT>

Apparently it scarred everyone else, because pin college I came across one of the girls (hottest one in class, mind you) who had been sitting NEXT to me during the incident, and she remembered me BECAUSE of that. I was so embarassed. Mostly because she had grown up to be absolutely stunning. I also decided to sing a song to that same classroom one day. My teacher let me have the floor.

    <TEXT>So, I've been thinking about Lady Comstock the past few days. I forgot she had an established name in the game. So there goes me wondering if there could be a potential plot twist to where her identity would be plot twist of "Ohhhh!!! THAT'S who she is!!!" However, I am still interested in her backstory. How her and Bookerstock got together. Their arguments about children. The "prophecy" happening. Her death. Etc. Is that stuff in the Infinite novel? Thanks for all the info.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Which means that in the timeline in which you first play the game, she is alive and well somewhere and the story of her (statues, plaques, lore) is all BS? Or is the game before you jump dimensions yet another universe? (Jesus Christ. I can usually keep up with sci fi universe jumping stuff, but this game is beyond me. Lol.) Another question: did you or anybody else expect you and Elizabeth to return to the first universe you were in after the first or second jump to find chen lin? The fact that you KEPT jumping universes surprised me. It's almost like Booker and Elizabeth (we should come up with a short name for them, like Branjelina or something like that. I know they're not a couple, but it would be easier.) didn't expect the new dimensions to actually BE different. Like "Oh, this place has what we need! Let's get it and keep going on the exact same mission and everything we've set out to do will be exactly the same!" I'm sorry for the long explanation, and if I lost anybody, just let me know. I look forward to further discussion. Thanks!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting. I have always wondered if the "pH balanced" line has any truth to it. I feel like it has to be at least a LITTLE true. It seems like such a bold statement for a company to make and not risk pushback.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GET A CAT!! My wife and I split last year and I KNEW I was going to be depressed (she planned on moving out for months, but it took a bit for it to happen) so I planned to get a kitten the whole time. The bonding was incredible. He's so special to me, and he LOVES the affection I give him. I know cats have different personalities, but get a kitten so they can grow up knowing you. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would not be surprised if it was walmart. I used to work there. NO MATTER if it was on January First, they would not approve you to be off on Christmas. (I worked third shift, so we'd have to come in at 10pm on the 25th.) You had to work or call in. Period. Edit: these bastards would also cut hours after a holiday. They looked us IN THE FACE in our pre-shift meeting and told us "Well, we paid you guys holiday pay and we have to make that money back."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have literally never heard that term until this very moment. And already I agree with OP. A friend of mine says "suspish" ("suspicious" without saying the "ious" part.) I think THAT is a cool way to shorten it. Granted, you might as well say the whole word at that point, but it sounds good at the same time.  #129335; #127995; #8205; #9794; #65039; Just my 2 cents.</TEXT>
