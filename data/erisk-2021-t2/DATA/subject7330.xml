    <TEXT>So when I was 14 me and my mom moved to a new city. We moved in a flat and the storage was in a separate place in the building. Our storage space was just around a corner. 1 evening I went to the storage space around 11pm to get some old plushies and when I opened the door and went around the corner I saw an middle aged man dressed up as a clown just creepily standing there in the back, I swear he had this crazy look in his eyes. I bolted out there as fast as I could. I told my mom and she called the police. When they arrived the man was still standing in the corner and he didnt fight back when the police arrested him. Apparently he used a lot of drugs and was just spacing out, the never told me how he got in the storage space, but they changed the lock after that incident</TEXT>

There was this 1 night that a 35ish guy was playing darts with me and at the end of the game I won and he bought me a soda to congratulate me. But he kept asking if I wanted to go to the toilet with him and how it would be fun and he kept on moving closer and starting touching my shoulder etc. I was very creeped out so after he went to the toilet I just ran to my mom and told her we need to leave so we left before he could come back</TEXT>

Try to video call with your SO a lot. Your love is strong enough to get through everything. You will get through this i have no doubt about it. And if you can get through covid-19 the rest of your long distand journey would feel easier!

    <TITLE>Sending letters!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-27 22:28:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I love sending and receiving letters an my SO knows that and he is willing to send me letters as well so thats awesome! Here's the problem tho he lives in South Africa and I live in the Netherlands. The first letter he send ( in 2019) took 6 months to arrive which really sucked. Tbf he did use a more local quiet post office i think. He send a letter 2 months ago and it hasn't arrived yet. I get that due to covid19 shipping can take longer Does anyone has advice for sending letters? Should I maybe ask if he can send letter more frequently so it doesn't feel like i need to wait ages for a letter? I hate asking things of him especially when it involves money. But this is just something I really want. Thanks guys!</TEXT>

Im just shattered this was the only thing that kept me from being sad all the time because I thought I had something to look forward to eventhough it was naive to look forward to travel in the middle of a pandemic. I just dont know what to do. I feel sad and crushed and dont even want to get out of bed to do something for my bday. I feel like I want to lie in bed and cry all day.

Its a guarantee for us that we will spend once a week some quality time together. For us date night is mostly just watching anime together or sometimes play games. Do you guys have a date night planned every week? Or do you guys just sometimes have a date planned? I'm really curious what kind of dates you have as well! *lots of internet hugs*</TEXT>
