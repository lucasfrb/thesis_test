    <TEXT>I'm 15 and just started cycling at Christmas. My dad has brought me on a crash course on this particular topic and I bit it quite a few times. As ayhsmb has already mentioned, loosen the springs, when you feel confident tighten them a little bit more until you feel confident and repeat. It can be tricky at the start but it will become second nature, try to clip out a bit before you have to stop if your not confident, that helped me. I know I'm a little late posting to this thread but best of luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I had it for two years and have just gotten rid of it. Main Pros: 1. Compact 2. Lightweight 3. Good quality sound 4. Very easy set-up (get started in minutes) Main Cons: 1. Very beginner kit 2. Not to many sounds, cant add more 3. Not very much maneuverability with the toms and such. 4. Unable to add extra cymbals, toms etc. **TL;DR**: *Great for a beginner, or small apartment with the ability to hook it up to an amp or alternatively use it with headphones. Not so great for someone who has been playing for a while and wants the feel of a real Acoustic kit in front of you.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem here is not that they're making the game more technical and challenging, but that they're making the one gamemode that was a "Just for Fun" mode into one of the the other two more serious sim type gamemodes. I prefer to hop on after a long day, twist and turn, do mad shit and just have FUN. 1.29 has destroyed this. Why would you choose to play arcade now? After all, FRB and HB give more xp and lions. It's ruined a whole gamemode that for many people was the most enjoyable thing about the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rumour floating around is that a big, permanent, marquee style roof is going up over the current applemarket, down by the nightclub area of the town. I suppose they're trying to make it more attractive in shite weather. I'm not sure if that's going to fix much, but it's nice to hear that something's being done. Tis a positive shithole at the moment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is it possible that the backlash from the obviously late Weidman stoppage influenced Herb tonight? As a general rule, you have to be pretty mentally tough to be in that ref position in the first place, so it might not have made much of an impact, but they're not made out of stone either. Tough to call really. Maybe Cowboy could've hung on, but I'm pretty confident that RDA had that fight either way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My In-Ears keep getting suddenly and permanently quiet in one ear followed by the other. I keep good care of 'em most of the time. It's happened to 2 pairs in a row now - one pair of sennheiser 5.00 and another pair of 10 buck generic-o's. Only really use them with my Galaxy S7 Edge which I dont believe has any known issues with drivers? Afraid to buy another pair in case it is the phone and they break again straight away. I dont think my poor student budget is capable of that kind of disposable income. Any help or insight would be much appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;It's just a token gesture rather than they actually thought he was right for the role and someone who doesn't have down syndrome who worked really hard to try and get a job in this line of work missed out just by virtue of not having this condition which I think is kind of shitty. And why can't it be the case that this man worked hard to be chosen for this job as well? He shows off the clothes just as well as a model without down syndrome would, while also serving as inspiration for other young men and women with down syndrome. I can't believe you're claiming he doesn't deserve it just because a "normal" model might have missed out on a job. That's ludicrous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. There are hundreds of examples of athletes involved in doping - particularly blood doping - suffering tragic premature deaths due to exactly this type of thing (MI, stroke, DVT etc). I'd hate to cast aspersions on such a well respected player - especially in a time where they're clearly in need of support and have just had a scare like this - but the conversation is worth having. If for no other reason than to raise awareness of the dangers and attempt to dissuade young athletes from doing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mate, there is no bigger picture here. If there is, it's the challenging of the cruel and outdated practice of honouring white lads who did fuck all else other than exploit other less fortunate people for personal gain. Milligan's only notable achievements were being born into incredible wealth, owning slaves, perpetuating misery, and encouraging others to build the west India docks. He didn't do shit. And you're here defending the long overdue removal of his statue. Have a long hard think about what you want to stand for. This isnt a good hill to die on</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Essentially, Ireland is constitutionally committed to the pacific settlement of international disputes. Getting a seat on the UNSC puts us in a position where, maybe naively, some believe we may be able to lobby some of the... less pacific members towards more humane conflict resolution. If you believe in the UN, getting a seat on the UNSC is a pretty big nod from the international community.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the alternative is having your fate decided entirely by a member of a select, realtively homogenous group of white, upper-class, (usually) FF/FG-affiliated judges. Grand if you're also a white, middle/upper class person; not so grand if you're not. Jury trials are vital to a fair and impartial justice system.</TEXT>

Not to presume your knowledge of the judiciary, but I think you might be surprised at the open bias demonstrated by some of its members in this country. Judges determine questions of law, 12 of your peers determine questions of fact. It's the best way we've found to eliminate bias from the system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Three I believe. It adds a decent amount of impartiality and cancels out some of the stuff I mentioned. At the end of the day, the special criminal court exists to prosecute some very dangerous individuals and so is set up in the way it is to avoid jury tampering, intimidation, etc. I have some issues with it, but all in all I can forgive them for the task it carries out. I just think that eliminating jury trials altogether in all our courts is definitely a step too far.</TEXT>
