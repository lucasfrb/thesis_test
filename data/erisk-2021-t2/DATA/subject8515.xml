    <TEXT>This is a walking tour of the Golden Circle in Iceland. Some info for those who are interested in some facts: The Golden Circle consists of Iceland #8217;s three most popular attractions: Gullfoss waterfall, Geysir geothermal area and  #222;ingvellir national park. We start the tour in  #222;ingvellir. Heads up for the squeamish, many places in  #222;ingvellir were used for executing people in the past. Here you can see the Walk of Death, where people were hanged or decapitated, the drowning pool, where people were drowned in bags, and the location where they filmed the Bloody Gates for Game of Thrones. Almannagja canyon in  #222;ingvellir marks the boundary of the Mid-Atlantic rift, which is the space between the North American and Eurasion tectonic plates. After that we see Haukadalur valley, where we will be hiking to see the hot springs such as Strokkkur (The Churn), Blesi (Blaze) and Kongungshver (the Royal Spring). Finally to end the Golden circle tour we will see Gullfoss waterfall (Golden falls). This waterfall consists of two drops, the first 11 meters and the second 21 meters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are interested in Icelandic scenery in films there have been many in recent years. The walk of death in  #222;ingvellir was used for Game of thrones, as well as many other locations, Kirkjufell mountain, Sk #243;gafoss waterfall, Gj #225;in Valley for scenes north of the wall. Rouge one used Iceland for the planet where the empire found Galen Erso in hiding. Tom Cruise's Oblivion featured Iceland a lot. One of the fast and the furious films had a racing scene over frozen lake M #253;vatn. Bruce Wayne trained in Tibet before becoming Batman in Batman begins, but it was actually Iceland. The engineer who died in the beginning of Prometheus was standing at the edge of Dettifoss waterfall. These are just some I easily recall, there are many others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A sightseeing tour of Sk #243;gafoss waterfall and the surrounding area, including Kvernufoss and Sk #243;gar open air museum. As you can see in the video the paths and stairs in the area can freeze over in winter and can become extremely dangerous. I slipped several times while filming despite having good hiking boots and being careful. In retrospect, I should have avoided climbing the stairs up to Sk #243;gafoss, better yet the stairs should have been closed under these circumstances. Here are the highlights of the tour: [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=0s) \- We start the tour in a gorge where you can find Kvernufoss waterfall. Hidden in the gorge it is often forgotten by visitors to Sk #243;gafoss. To find it you can park close to Sk #243;gar museum and walk east of it. You should soon find a path that will lead you to a river and into the gorge. [01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=68s) \- First slip! [01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=76s) \- Second slip! [03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=183s) \- Notice the multitude of iceicles inside the gorge. [03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=195s) \- You might not notice it at first but there are two birds nested in a hole in the cliff straight ahead. This species of bird is called the Northern fulmar (also known as the arctic fulmar). It is quite abundant in the surrounding area. [04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=242s) \- Third slip! [05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=315s) \- I decided to slide down the hill. [06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=370s) \- After all the slipping and sliding I needed to adjust the camera. As beautiful as it is, the gorge felt like one big blooper reel but I decided to leave it in. [06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=410s) \- I hope you have good boots! [11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=690s) \- A rib bone from a whale. [11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=700s) \- This area belongs to the Sk #243;gar folk and open air museum. [13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=810s) \- Between Kvernufoss and Sk #243;gafoss is the Sk #243;gar village, with a population of roughly 25 people. [25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=1515s) \- To the right you can glimpse Sk #243;gafoss waterfall. [28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=1714s) \- We have arrived at Sk #243;gafoss waterfall. [33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2011s) \- The stairs didn't seem too bad at first. [37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2260s) \- That's one way. [39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2340s) \- This place was a bottleneck. [40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2436s) \- Fourth slip! [43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2637s) \- We have reached the top and are now at the Fimmv #246;r #240;uh #225;ls trailhead. [44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2670s) \- Hestva #240;sfoss waterfall. [46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMCXd-6cgg amp;t=2780s) \- There is no going further so I go to the top for one final view. Thank you for watching.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Walking tour in Selfoss, the largest town in South Iceland. Here are the highlights of the tour: [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=0s) \- Selfosskirkja church, built in 1956 and an iconic landmark for Selfoss along with the bridge and the river. [00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=53s) \-  #214;lfus #225; river. It has the highest water flow rate, or discharge, of all the rivers in Iceland. It is believed to be up to 9 meters deep. The bridge is  #214;lfus #225;rbr #250;, built in 1945. Another bridge built in 1891 used to stand over the river but it collapsed when two trucks crossed it at the same time, weighing more than the bridge could handle. The trucks fell into the river but both drivers survived. During World War 2 the bridge was strategically important. In 1941 the germans attacked a british camp, an air strike that killed one british soldier. [01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=97s) \- The Selfoss hotel. [03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=230s) \- Mi #240;gar #240;sormur, also known as J #246;rmundgandur. The Midgard serpent of norse mythology and nemesis of Thor. [12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=750s) \- B #243;kakaffi #240; book shop ahead. Highly recommended. Old books, new books and coffee. [12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=773s) \- The Old bank is the house on the right, the new bank the building on the left. The Old bank was originally build in 1899 and stood in B #250; #240;ardalur in West Iceland. It was disassembled and transported to Selfoss in 1919, where it was rebuilt to serve as a bank. In 1921 king Christian X of Denmark stayed a night while travelling in Iceland. The Bobby Fisher center, dedicated to chessplayer Bobby Fischer, can be visited on the second floor. [15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=920s) \- N #250;pur built in 1931. Kaffi Kr #250;s a local restaurant and coffee shop is located there. [15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=944s) \- To the right the local library and tourist information center. [17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1020s) \- Tryggvask #225;li restaurant. Originally built for the workers building the old bridge in 1890. [17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1050s) \- Notice the blue lines on the bridge. They represent the water level of floods in the past. [18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1080s) \- You can see cranes and buildings under construction. This is where the new town centre will rise. [18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1100s) \- We will now cross the bridge. [21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1294s) \- It is not often you get such clear snow. [22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1375s) \- Barracks built by the British in World War 2. Now a potato storage. [29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1740s) \- Swans on the river. [33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=1996s) \- We now enter Hellissk #243;gur forest (cave forest). [35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUFj_r13aE amp;t=2130s) \- A wild rabbit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Somebody named Death Stranding, very Icelandic scenery with moss grown lava fields. I'm not very familiar with Star Wars games but I believe the planet Sullust was in part based on Icelandic landscapes. There have been many GoT games, I haven't played any but a ton of the scenes that happened Behind the Wall were shot in Iceland so that might give you something to look for. The old retro game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis has a small episode set in Iceland, but of course it is pixilated and not very detailed. I'm sure I'm forgetting something but I hope this helps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suppose you are strictly talking about very immersive VR with environmental control, 360 degrees etc. But I have used immersive youtube videos for geriatric patients who are on exercise bikes. It really helps, they tolerate longer sessions and enjoy them more. There was a lack of immersive videos featuring my own country (Iceland) so I made my own on my YouTube channel (shameless self promotion sorry). It opens up conversations about local travel, people and stories here and there. Just better than staring at the time. I just cast it from my pc, very easy.</TEXT>
