    <TEXT>"Do you honestly think anyone gives a fuck? If you don't find it interesting, be a fucking adult and just move on with your life." Same applies to what you just said, only difference being I'm sharing an opinion while you're being a cunt. See, that's the difference between us, i'm genuenly asking a question because this is bad engineering, not efficient, and only doesn't have a purpose I can actually think off, on the other hand, you' re coming across insulting people for havinf a different view than yours. I'dd add to that that you might wanna take a look at the redditquette cause you sure don't know what it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing I have is that psychological pain isn't shown as a broken arm most of the time and it's therefore way harder in my opinion to see how hurt someone is in these kind of moments, especially on our societies where showing and asking for emotional support isnt always seen well especially in a public environment. For the question of safety there was really no reason to be scared, I wasn't inside the gallery yet but was on the museum already, and you know how well these are guarded. That + it was genuine emotion and tears on this people face, I've rarely saw someone expressing them in such an honest way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The issue of scams and so on wasn't really the issue, I wasn't inside the gallery yet but already inside the museum and you know how well these are guarded these days. Also it was really genuine emotion and tears on their face, not the kind of thing you can fake, the closest thing I could compare it to would be a kid crying for his/her mom out of sadness. Thanks for the reply, that's probably what I should have done, will take note of it if it ever happens again (kinda hope it won't but we never know), thank you very much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not taking into account the psychological aspect of killing someone with a gun (no contact between you and them) and rolling over someone with a car, and your whole point falls into pieces starting there. Study have shown this multiple times and with multiple examples, the most known one is the thing with the train who's about to roll on either 1 or 5 person, its going to kill 5 but you can change his direction so it's only going to kill one. Almost everyone will do it, on the other hand if you're asking them the same question, but to save 5 person they have to push on themselves and therefore killing them with a direct contact most won't. That's the same idea here, you can fire from a distance, with a truck or a car (and here you have to take into account that when you're driving a car you "become" the car, so it's almost the same as a direct impact from you to them on the psychological aspect of things). It was Nice, not Paris, and it was 80~ or something killed if I remember correctly, we're far from the thousands you're talking about. If you want a number at least equivalent to this one look around what happened on the island of utoya. One dude and a gun, around 80 killed as well. And to reply to your first question, there's more than a few states where you don't need a license, a registration or a permit to buy a gun what so ever.</TEXT>

You're asking for an example I gave you one, too bad you're too stuck in your head and just want to remove everything going against your pov. To reply, not a handgun but not an assault riffle either, was a shotgun. "What kind of gun did they had" nothing, yeah. But right after you're saying "you're talking about America ?? AH", so either we talk about America (standard when people talk about guns most of the time) where people have guns either we talk about other places where most people don't. Chose a side you're not making sense. Guns are made to kill in the first place, cars are not. That's a big difference you're, again, not taking into accounts. Most attacks are made with hand guns, not cars. Your ideas are coming one after the other contradicting the precedent, you're talking about opinions while I'm talking about straight up facts you can look up. Pick a side and start making sense, cause so far there's nothing we can do for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On that one i want to say that this is not only the media but everyone at this point. You also can't hold the media responsible for reporting what most scientists were saying at the time (expections to a few, but these were most of the time called out for being too pesimistic about it). In other words, what she's saying is a great way of switching the attention to something else, but not a great reply, medias were reporting what was the consensus back then, not personal views.

    <TEXT>No, it's not the same, no one, no scientists what so ever said that it wouldn't come to the us, but they were saying that it wasn't such a big deal at first. They reported what they were saying, what was the "facts" or what we thought they were at least. On the other end, she gave an opinion. That's two really different things.</TEXT>

Also no, it wasn't a hope, it was saying "it won't come here". That's what she said, nothing more, nothing less. But we have a prime example here, instead of saying you fucked up, you say other did as well, (even tho here it's questionable imo). It always the same, europe for example badly reacted to the coronavirus, and they're admitting it, saying they should have acted like they did in Korea and so on, trying to learn their lessons. On the other side you have the US who's saying "we didn't act that badly we're in a similar situation as eu. Just because someone did something badly, doesn't make it a reason for you to do something badly as well. That's not a valid excuse.</TEXT>

The fun part about this is probably that you don't seem to know that there's no proofs what so ever about what you're talking about from what I've read, and that they are only suppositions made by... Guess who ;) Anyway, if you have to believe people are dumb because they critic what ones do, maybe you're the dumb one. I'll just say something, read about the Dunning Kruger effect, you ain't as smart as you believe you are, and you're definitely making yourself look like a fool right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sir, I can understand you not doubting, but I won't make me change my mind, over two years of using reddit I've only managed to get into r/popular once, and it was this week. The odds of me going again into r/popular today are even lower than they should be usually. I won't force you to press x, but I really do think you should consider it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not dishonest, it's what it is, and if you had aknowledge the fact (yes, fact) that it doesn't have the same psychological implications to shoot someone or run over with them with a cat since the begining instead of pushing things further and further we wouldn't be there. I mean dude, you can't aknowledge a simple fact what do you want me to say to you at some point ? The checks in America can't be considered as actual checks, and that's not what's done, an actual check would require a psychological test showing if people have anger and control issues for example, here the check is just looking at "has he already shoot people or nah" in most cases and cannot and shouldn't be considered as an actual check (as well as wouldn't be consider as in most places hopefully). That's relevant, if an object is by nature made for violence, people are more likely going to use them for that purpose, it's always been that way. The cues of one space, object, influence greatly the way it's used and how having it/being there will impact the way you use them or will act, and that, is again, a fact that you can easily check. Your argument about cars doesn't make sense from the start if I may say so, think about it, what are cars made for, what are they used for most of the time ? What are guns made for, what are they used for most of the time ? It's two simple questions that should end this pointless discussion, if you had spend 10 minutes looking for papers you wouldn't have known by now that the psychological impact of killing someone with a car and with a gun is completely different and cannot be compared on the moment you kill or try to kill someone with one or the other. So, even if most attacks are made by guns since they don't kill many people it's okay ? What's your next move ? I love how you're just saying "no you're lying" while if you had spend ten minutes looking for it you would have found hundreds of papers talking about it. Why drugs now ? (Also you're saying reply to this while there's nothing to reply there ?) That's again taking the discussion on a completely another level, drugs are involving completely different things than everything we've talked about before. This discussion is honestly completely pointless, you're just pushing further and further getting away from that one simple thing we were talking at the beginning, it's getting ridiculous. I'll put an end to this now if you don't mind, it doesn't make any sense anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does load in 3 seconds because of compression, you have bad blacks, small changes in almost inanimated areas are not made or made more suddenly than they should be, the 4k we're getting is most of the time really bad 4k, a good 1080p would be better than this "4k" but our 1080p'id trash as well so the 4k version is better overall. Anyway, maybe it doesn't matter to you, but for people who pay attention to these kind of things, for content creators who pay attention to small details when they make their vids only for them to disappear due to compression afterwards, it does matter.</TEXT>

There's two types, Opticals and the ultrasonic one (that's him Samsung called it as least) For Opticals the idea is that there's a camera behind the screen (you can see through OLED pixels, that's why only OLED screens can have them) when you put your finger on the display, this camera, this camera takes a picture of the light reflected by your finger, and if it matches the picture it has saved as your finger the phone will unlock. For ultrasonic, there's a "pulse wave" that's send to your finger, and your finger reflect a part of this pulse wave, creating a 3d image of them. Again, if match the phone unlocks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt anyone think it's good that it's "mainstream". Completely disagree on the stigma part tho, back in the days if a relative killed themselves it was putting the whole family at shame while it was inherently their own decisions and not the family's ones. That's why we don't have great stats about suicides before not so long ago, when someone killed themselves people were doing everything they could to hide, make it so it looks like an accidental death, paying doctors way too much for them to change the cause of death and so on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, it's more a sociological problem than anything else. There's basically 4 types of suicides (or at least, for Durkheim), the fatalistic, altruistic, egoistic and anomic ones. Each revolve around diverse reasons, you can look into it if you want. I, personally, do believe that, as hard as it is for others, and, as brutal and violent of a solution it is, that suicide is a valid choice, as long as it is well thought and not impulsive. Some might agree, some might disagree, everyone's experience with life if different, and you can't force someone to live an existence of pain, the same way we euthanize dogs when they're in pain, forcing someone to live in a psychological pain for their whole life seems completely inhumane to me. I would even argue (and you can hate me for that one if you want), that suicide should be assisted in hospitals for the one's who wants it (after someone had seen a psychologist and psychiatrist for a while, and if their reasons are judged "valid").</TEXT>

It's not rocket science to understand that we do not, and cannot do anything about the heat death of the universe as we are right now (we literally cannot create enough energy from one planet to stop such a thing, even believing we could is absurd). And to reply to something you said after, it's not about dying today or tomorrow, one is close to us, the other is hundred of thousands years away.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends, some things change some don't really, personality and emotions are very closely linked to genes and biology as well. Do you know what's one the side effects of antidepressants ? Suicidal thoughts. Like, for real, that's not a joke. Antidepressants are probably one of the worst medication there is right now, the only reason people should get them is either if they're going to be dangerous for others or themselves. And they don't help the issue on the long term, they basically just make you numb to bad (well, and good) emotions. So people go from depression to depression for their whole life, some people never manage to get back on track from their 20s to the day they die. Benjamin Franklin (I think) said : Some people die at 25 and aren't burried until 75. That's the sad reality of things, I really don't care if you consider these people immature or whatever, I'm not here to judge people for their decisions or the way they are in the end. But the thing is some people never go out of that hole, and they should have the right to end things if that's what they want. I value freedom above anything else, and the freedom of death is one of them. Death is incredibly sad, don't get me wrong, but that's a hard choice to make, and if someone is ready to make it, they have the right to do so. Our current society has a really big problem with the notion of death imo and that's a shame, some people with brain cancers are kept alive instead of being euthanized for weeks while they're barely able to survive even if they mentioned that they didn't wanted to live such a life when they were still fully conscious. Sometimes nurses even have to give them way too many medications to end their suffering so they sleep for 3 days straight before dying because of it. For whatever reason euthanasia is still something people don't accept to do, not to say that's it's still illegal in way too many countries. Death is a thing of life, it's sad for a lot of people, but relieving for others. You said it was egoistic, but aren't we the ones being egoist thinking they shouldn't do it because we will feel bad afterwards ? Suicide is a vast question and there's a lot to say about it, what everyone thinks of it can be influenced by a lot of factors as well, and we might never manage to find a solution to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An isolated systems does not allow matter or energy transfer, a closed system allows energy transfers. It does make a quite big difference. That's honestly just some suppositions, we don't exactly know how fast the universe is expanding, we don't know if it'll expand forever or no etc etc. These are not things we're sure off We don't know right now if the "heat death of the universe" is something that will happen or not, I'm not the one saying it, here's a quote from Lee Smolin on the subject "It has long been known that gravity is important for keeping the universe out of thermal equilibrium. Gravitationally bound systems have negative specific heat #8212;that is, the velocities of their components increase when energy is removed. ... Such a system does not evolve toward a homogeneous equilibrium state. Instead it becomes increasingly structured and heterogeneous as it fragments into subsystems". And that's only one out of all people who disagree with this theory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I might just say the obvious here, but love is so much more than sexuality. Either you love her and you stay together, either you don't and it's probably the best to break up. Not giving away on a relationship because you've been invested into it for a long time isn't a good reason to keep it going as well in my opinion. Life is long and you have most of it ahead of you, if you don't love her anymore, being stuck with her for the rest of your life because you don't want to throw ten years away isn't a great solution. But again, the question is, do you still love her or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Incredible. Not everyone likes it, but I can say without a doubt that it's definitely in my top 3 personally. It's weird, deplesant sometimes, there's not an ounce of piece in it pretty much (k, doesn't sound like a great thing so far I'll admit it, but it's wanted and really well done + I like it), but the whole thing is well wrapped up and is more on the philosophical discussion side of things than on the story telling side of things. I could compare it to David Lynch in some ways if you've seen some from him. I'm bad at explaining things I'm sorry, but know it's great. X)</TEXT>

Also, you could say that to any socials, most of tiktok isn't that in the end, and there's extremism in every social. You're not only giving TikTok way too many credit, but it's also just another way of missing the issential while focusing on something that doesn't matter that much in the end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>K, let me explain to you how this works aight. This shit was made mostly from people coming from Reddit. Here Reddit is the endogroup of people, the group the are with. TikTok on the other end, is the exogroup, the group they don't "belong" to. That's what's called categorisation, and categorisation is basically where some day racism starts. Anyway, let's keep going. People tend to claim their own endogroup as better than the exogroups, why is that ? Because people tend to consider that they are better than the majority, and therefore their group is as well. Now, you can make it seems like your group is better in two ways, putting down the others, or bringing yourself up. First one being more easy than the second one. I think you can easily see where i'm going so i'm going to let this here, take into account the fact that Reddit, more than most websites have a really strong hive mind, and you got your answer of "why" people who don't use TikTok are coming to give bad reviews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe you should consider looking at yourself in the mirror, drinking a glass of cold water and going out for a walk man, you seem to be a bit salty and don't seem able to come back with anything else but personal attacks. If you're over highschool you probably know that ad-hos are used when you don't have anything to say, and that you shouldn't therefore use them. The starting point might have been from India but most of the reviews came from Reddit, that's the thing you're probably missing here. Someone going for revenge also doesn't mean a company being shit, it's called again, attacking the exogroup with your own endogroup (wow, how crazy, we're coming back to what I was talking about lmao) I'll add to that that you might not seem to understand what the downvote is for, and that you should probably take a look at the redditquette.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If anyone wants to use it as a pasta, here you go !  gt; When I started feeding my kids urine, I moved really slow as to not disrupt their body's natural fonctions. I would mix a couple of tablespoons in with their cereal or replace the milk/water in their smoothies with it. Gradually, I increased the amount of urine I was giving them until now, 2 years later, I can finally give them full glasses of urine (that they happily consume) and call it apple juice. If they complain that it tastes funny, I tell them that it's organic. They've hads no health concerns this whole time. As long as you take things slow, you'll be okay.</TEXT>

It can obviously work out really well for a lot of people, great examples would be zuckerberg or gates. I dont think it \*should\* reflect your abilities as an adult, but i hardly believe it can, and it does in most cases (or at least from the people i've met so far in life). I can see were you're coming from, but i wont ever endorse that way of thinking for one specific reason, for most people having a degree, or whatever else is what's assuring them of having a decent job and so on in life.

Fir Hispanics it's like 1.5 times more than for white people if I remember correctly. And there, the dude could have just been arrested and than justice would have been done. If people are getting that loud because of that black dude getting killed in circumstances he shouldn't have been killed on, even tho it does happen for every ethnicity, it's because it's way more frequent fir black people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These numbers are exactly what they are, every time a shot is fired by the police they have to register if the person was guilty, if they tried to do anything to get away, their ethnicity ages and so on, it's public data you can check it by yourself it's not being a sjw lmao. There's been multiple tests about that, reactivity to shoot from policeman's on a white or black person either having a can or gun in their hands. Guess what ? They shoot faster, and more often on black people with guns than white people who have some (more errors in the case of white people), and they shoot more often on black having cans on their hands than white people having cans on their hands (mistake on the black people side here). It's just a bias they overall have, it's not being a sjw or anything else. But you probably like to say it's the case instead of checking the studies that have been made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I literally mentioned Hispanics lol. And the reason why is because of the history of black and white people in America pretty much, asians represent a group that's too small as well. Also the white/black can be used as a gradient in some ways, from the people having the smallest amount of black characteristics (whites), from the ones having the biggest amount of them. Hispanics happen to be in the middle of these two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it can happen to everyone and everywhere no one said the opposite actually. And you really do seem like to call everything racist. The consensus is that, overall, racism starts where there's prejudice. It's fair to assume that in the American society, where most people are white, and if you take as granted that every ethnicity is equally racist towards the others, prejudices are more often happening to people of the minority. And this is not a political agenda, that's some things you would learn as the basics of a social psychology class for example.</TEXT>

And when I look at what people are protesting against and who they've been electing, would it be Trump or the democratic candidate, it just doesn't make sense to me. I really and truly do believe that the best way to make things change is to use the "usual" ways if your country isn't in an authoritarian regime.
