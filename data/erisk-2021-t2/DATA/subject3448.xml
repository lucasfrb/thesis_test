    <TITLE>So I just more or less finished Hanako's route, and I have no desire to restart.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-08 18:24:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>After the Hanako's #8203; route I have found myself with no desire to continue, the story was just so endearing and happy towards the end, the awkward sex was pretty funny because most of us have been in that first time awkwardness before, but seeing her open up more and more to Hisao warmed my cold dead heart, always had a thing for the shy girl architype, but what can I say this route in particular, I guess I don't want to continue playing this game for the same reasons I never did a Genocide in Undertale, it's that I don't want to, I don't want to throw away arguably the happiest ending to a game for the sake of completion, to see Hanako so happy at the end touched me and was the 3rd game to make me tear up (1st goes to MGS4, 2nd goes to Undertale), I'm glad I played this route to it's end, now what to do?, Let's see if I can reach 2000 hours on CIV 5, but yeah all and all heartwarming story, side note Hanako looked so pretty in her bar outfit. Edit: i want to kick Harry Potter in the teeth. Edit 2 Electric Boogaloo: Read sisterhood, muh heart, HisaoXHanako is the cutest shit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do people rag on this game?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-16 17:24:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's funny how you see more people complaining #8203; about the fanbase than you see the actual cringey and "bad" side, which also annoys me, if you've been on the internet for more than 5 femtoseconds you'd know that all fanbases have that kind of crap for the most part, maybe it's because I've been a sonic fan for so long that I'm desensitised towards things like that, or maybe it's just people joining a circlejerk because it's the cool thing to do. Edit: Main Point is that i don't get why people hate it from just assuming and not actually playing it. I still love this game to death and it's still my No 3 favorite game of all time (Behind MGS3  amp; Drakengard Trilogy).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does anyone know if Blizz have said anything more about transmogging the Druid Artifact Forms in BfA?. As it is currently you can't use them unless you have the correct weapon type I.E Fist/Daggers, which Guardian and Feral never use. I remember something in a Q amp;A a while ago about there will be a system, I sincerely hope this ain't the "System" they were talking about. There's apparently a post on one of the Druid Fourms regarding this, but I can't find the post.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>About DekuXUraraka</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-03 15:31:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen some posts here regarding it so I'll just give my  #163;2 1. Uraraka at the moment has put her feelings for Deku to the back of her mind so she can focus on becoming a Hero, but there's still underline feeling for him. 2. I've seen some people say Deku probably doesn't feel that way about her, while this has some basis people are a bit a blunt about it, looking at his character, he probably never even considered the mere concept of a girl feeling that way about him, rather than not having feelings outright. 3. Deku and Uraraka are likely to get together at some point in the future, If you think about it Uraraka was the first girl he saved, the first to believe in him and show any kind of positivity towards him, and probably most importantly #8203; she helped Deku have more confidence in himself, even going so far as to accept the Deku name which he previously hated. 4. Horikoshi more or less confirmed them by saying they'll be more scenes with them in the future, which is usually to set stuff for later. 5. Uraraka loves Deku unconditionally, be it rain or shine her admiration and feelings for him is very unlikely to change, Deku will probably realise this towards the end of MHA, she may have pushed her feelings to the back of her mind for Deku to focus on being a hero like a said, but those feelings aren't going away. That's just my take on it anyway.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Story from WoW</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-07 17:45:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Greetings!, just thought i'd share this intresting i have story from all the way back in MoP, hope ya'll enjoy. (feel free to share yours as well if you want  lt;3) It was the launch of MoP, My old guild from Cata fell apart due to burnout from DS 25HC so i was left naked and guildless, i was prepared to go full casual mode in MoP because i looked around for a decent guild on my server but there were none that had the same timetable as my old on. So i ordered Chinese takeout for the MoP launch (because it felt right at the time), I was questing through Jade Forest when suddenly i get a whisper from another player, who was asking me what i am doing Guildless in 25HC DS Gear, I told them that my guild fell apart from burnout, we decided to quest together to speed up leveling a bit because they played a lot of the MoP beta and knew where to get the best quests to get to 90 fast, we got chatting and after i'd like to say an hour or two he asked me if i wanted to join their, who was planning on doing HC content in MoP, they did say i would have to sign up via application and have the logs to back it up, i had some very good logs back in DS so after a smallinterview process i was invited to the guild.we had a night where we would go onto vent and get to know what would be our main raid team. That's where i met a Greek Rogue (Let's call him Leonidas), who i still raid with to this day!, and a few other really cool and relaxed people, but with any raid team you have THAT guy, you know the one, complaining about DPS and Loot while he himself never got to the top of Recount in his life, (Let's call this absolute yogurt of a Warrior, Jerry), now Jerry was a friend of the Raid Leader so he got onto the main raid team without much issue, fastfoward to Mogu'shan, we were progressing on Elegon and having a lot of fun doing it, taking bets on who will get the mount first, when Jerry starts complaining at the Healers that they aren't doing enough to help the raid. Leonidas defended this by saying that Jerry was not using any of his defensive cooldowns to help out the healers, when Leonidas pointed this out Jerry got defensive (Ironic......) about how using his defensives would stop him doing more DPS, Exfuckingcuseme, The Raid Leader rightly pointed out that he should be using them, So Jerry did.........for one pull, i'm pretty sure he was not doing his rotation correctly with intent so he could "Justify" his assbackwards reasoning for not using them, At some point during the raid he told off our Resto Druid (one of the 8 people from that guild who i still raid with to this day) that he should be using Symb on the Shaman to get Spiritwalkers, Our Resto liked to use it on the Shadow Priest so we had a nice raid wide heal as well as some great dps. We eventually killed Elegon after much wailing and nashing of teeth (And Jerry Dying), The.Mount.Fucking.Dropped, we all did a roll and I won the roll, but i didn't like the look of it all too much at the time so i gave it to Leonidas because it was his Birthday the day after, this triggered Jerry something fierce, like i have never seen someone so salty and toxic over a fucking SparkleBoi, he went on a rant on how he deserved it the most because he is a friend of the Raid Leader and he could have us kicked out if he wanted to (Also he went on about one good DPS pull he had), After a large arugment with jerry we all went off except for a few of us who were going to do ICC for a giggle, about 5 of us went in there to have a laugh and a chat, one of these people was the raid leader. So we talked about how we are sick of Jerry's bullshit during raids and how he was not a good asset to our raid team, after much back and forth the Raid Leader eventually agreed to remove Jerry for our roster, of course Jerry and our Raid Leader fell out over this but in Jerry's place we got a new Warrior who was one of the coolest people i've ever raided with personally, nice and calm, cracking puns at the bosses expense, and all that good stuff. Another fastfoward to Siege farm to get our lovely weapons for WoD, we do another ICC run after every other SoO raid, one of these nights we get to the topic of wrestling, and we talk about our favorite matches, Leonidas said his favorite was Kane's Debut, our Resto Druid said she liked any match with Randy Savage in it, our Raid Leader loved most Chris Jericho matches, i told them that my favorite match was in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Tale of Calamity Chad</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-12 01:22:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>M'goodboy I'll tell you a tale Long ago in the year 2012 I was but a 600lbs goodboy, with plenty of GBP to boot. I was a happy and bouncy boy. Everything changed when Calamity Chad attacked, he took mummy and made her move in with him. My healthy #8203; frame wasn't strong enough to defeat Calamity Chad. So I had to train in the mountains, leaving Waifu Hanako from Katawa Shoujo, Dewie, and Tendies behind. After 4 years of intense training I got stronger, but at a grave cost. I dropped from a healthy 600lbs to a malnourished 140lbs That was caused by eating off the land, vegetation, hunting and killing animals etc. But with that sacrifice my speed increased immensely. I was able to learn new techniques with my Katana Yamato. I assaulted Calamity Chads Fortress of Protein. I had the speed Advantage so I was able to avoid all his attacks. I defeated Calamity Chad and saved Mummy. But now I cannot go back home due to The Chad Forces seeking my death. I am still 140bs and cannot eat enough to get my healthy frame back due to all the running and guerilla tactic stuff I have to do just to save my own life from the chads. DO NOT, make the same mistake as I did M'goodboys</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Mage Tower equivalent" for BfA</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-22 10:49:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Since the Mage Tower went down really well in Legion, why not have an equivalent in BfA!, But make it a little different. Here's my idea, there are 12 "Scenarios" for each class, every single one is designed around knowledge of your class and it's 3-4 specs, one part you're tanking, another part you're healing, and one part you're DPSing etc. Why 12 Scenarios you ask?, Why not just have 1 or 2?, Because some classes work differently than others, it would require you to have great knowledge of all your classes abilities. For example, Warlocks could have swapping out pets to do different things, Rogues could have them be swapping in and out of their 3 specs to match the fight, Priests could have a healing part where you're preventing damage and another one you're healing damage. I think this would be good for whoever is doing the challenge, they'll learn new things with their class and be a better player for it. The reward since Tier sets are going away, is a set of armour that is specific to your class, think MoP Challenge Mode Armour. This was just an idea I had that I thought I would share.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How I think Warcraft could work as a TV Series</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-02 16:56:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me explain We all love Warcraft and it's lore, some of those moments have stuck with us for a very long time. We all know how the Warcraft Movie bombed at the Box Office sadly. But I am hopeful for a Warcraft TV Series, here's some ideas I have dun had Option 1: A Live action TV series, now with this you would need to get the casting right, but this would benefit a storyline more, we'd get more time to get to know the characters such as Lothar, Ladgar, Medivh etc assuming it would be first set in the 1st war, or you could start from the Arthas Saga which I think would go down a bit. Option 2: A "Western Animated Anime" similar to Avatar and Castlevania, now some of you are gonna say "Ew no anime" but this is a western style in the same vein as the previously mentioned 2 examples, this would be the absolute best option imo, you can do a lot more with Animation compared to live action, imagine the Siege of Stormwind or Assault on BlackRock done like this, you could do so much more with the backgrounds and shots, in terms of Artstyle I'd like it to be like the Castlevania Netflix series but with a less gritty OVERALL colour scheme and artstyle, while shifting into a darker colour scheme for those darker moments like the Culling and Lothar's death, this would be an amazing choice if you got a good director who understood what made those moments great in Warcraft, a more accurate telling would be nice too.

For food I don't recommend anything that will make you tired after eating it, try making some meals beforehand and putting them in a box, this is all of course subjective. 3. For drinks try water to keep you hydrated, and if you start dropping off get a mug of coffee to pick you up, but not too much coffee as not to completely burn out. 4. Some other advice if you're dropping off, try taking a coldish shower, or lick the roof of your mouth with your tongue, I learned this while at cadets and I'll be honest it really works. That's just some tips I thought I'd give</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Did you Reroll? If so why?.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-20 00:17:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Curious if anyone rerolled for whatever reason. I've been playing WoW since around Mid Vanilla or at least after 1.2 and ever since then I've been a Druid, I've experienced everything on my Druid, My first Rag Kill, my first Illidan kill, pretty much all the raiding content that has been released over the years (save for 1 or 2), I've experienced Guild Drama on this toon, made memories on it, even met most of my friends on it. If we can agree on one thing it's that Legion Druid was insanely fun to play, Balance was a laser light show when you had your legendaries, Feral was incredibly fun, Guardian was pretty good, and Resto was cool, this all changes in BfA with the removal of the artifact traits and ability, disabling of your legendaries, and class changes to the Druid that just made it feel hollow and empty compared to Legion Druids. This came as a surprise to some of my long time WoW friends and my SO, as they've always known me to be a Druid throughout WoW. I rerolled to a Demon Hunter because I neglected mine for the whole of Legion after completing her Mage Tower challenges, I've really been enjoying myself with her!, I'm actually kicking myself for not doing this sooner, it's just so fun with double jump, Fel rushing around, gliding off cliffs, and all the stuff that comes with the DH, only gripe I have though is Demon's Blades not proccing anywhere near enough, but I suspect that to change with Haste later on. Anyway enough rambling from me, what's your reason for rerolling?, I think this is an interesting topic to discuss because some people have connection to a certain class or spec. Druid will always be my favourite class of all time but just this expansion I'm not feeling it after being spoiled with Legion Druids</TEXT>

Sparda: "*Thinking*" i have the most aggravating of banter towards thine enemy Dante! Dante: okay let's hear it Sparda: "I would be most appreciative if thine would most kindly proceed to copulate with thineself!!!!" Dante: "*Trying to hold in barely contained laughter*" Sparda: "Thine Maiden Mother churned butter for her occupation!!!" *Vergil turning away with his hands on his head* Dante: *External loud laughter*</TEXT>

You have failed to maintain a steady supply of food and drink, and the female guest seem to have fled the premises as a result! #8221; Vergil: Ummmmm Dante?, I guess I'm sorry I couldn't prepare the party I guess? Sparda:  #8220;It matters not, brother. By the by, a full year has passed us by during which we have been displaced from each other #8217;s company! Would you enjoy a warm embrace from your youthful sibling? Or would it please your fancy to instead embrace my firearm? Vergil: Indee-wait a minute?, IS THAT YOU DAD!? #8221; Sparda: SKIDADDLING SKIDADDLING SKIDADDLING SKIDADDLING SKIDADDLING SKIDADDLING!!!!! *Dante with a camera recorded the whole thing* Dante: this is a prank Vergil, you're being recorded. Edit: **Vergil turns to Dante** *Vergil 2 starts playing at earrape volume*</TEXT>

In immaculate chorus... Down from the heavens... Descended Vivec... Who delivered a Spear Whack... Which could shatter bones... Into the crotch... Of Lucien Lachance... Who fell over on the ground... Writhing in pain... As Gray Fox changed back... Into Corvus Umbranox... But Vivec saw through... His clever disguise... And he crushed Corvus's head... In between his thighs Then Jyggalag the Grey, and Sheogorath the Mad, And Oblivon: Knights of the Nine's Whiestrake, And Indoril Nerevar, and the Nerevarine, And Fargoth, and Simplicia the Slow, Martin, Adamus Phillida, Dulfish Gro-Orum, and M'aiq the Liar, Mankar Camoran, Azura, every single Nine Divine, Molag Bal. Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, Hircine, Clavicus Vile., Lorkhan, and Hermaeus Mora All came out of nowhere lightning fast And they kicked Vivec in his CHIM filled ass It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw With civilians looking on in total awe The fight raged on for a century Many lives were claimed but eventually The champion stood the rest saw the better Micheal Kirkbride in a blood-stained sweater  #8203;  #8203; This is the ultimate showdown of Tarmriel's destiny Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see And only one will survive I wonder who it will be This is the ultimate showdown...

    <DATE>2018-12-19 02:09:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>I personally think he'd look somewhere in between Ging and  gt;!Gon-San! lt;  And he'd have long hair (about down to the middle of his back) in a swept back kind of fashion. Let's say he's 18-24 at this point Personality wise, He's picked up a bit of Ging's aloofness, but in a good way, but has a more matured personality than when we last saw him and his father, with a hint of PTSD from the events of the Chimera Ant arc. How would you imagine an Adult Gon?, Would be interested to hear your interpretation</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I had a Dream about DMCVs ending</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-13 21:24:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>It started with the 3 mains fighting against Urizen, throughout the fight you swapped out your characters during the fight, when the boss got to half health he did a roaring attack that knocked everyone back. trapping them in vines, Urizen said something along the lines of "So this is where Sparda's bloodline ends, how gutless", just as they were being heavily constricted, a slow motion shot of a man slashing across the vines appeared. the man then went into another slow mo shot of him slicing half of Urizen's hand off in a blue cut from a distance, the man said "Were it so easy....." and took off his hood revealing none other than Vergil. looking partially but not fully in his corrupted face, Dante made a snarky yet relieved remark which was "You finally showed up", to which Vergil smirked back and said "I couldn't let you kids have all the fun now could I?", Urizen bellowed out in a bloody rage "HOW, HOW DID YOU OVERCOME MY INFLUENCE". To which Vergil scowled and said "you should come to realise you cannot control a son of Sparda", after everyone got back up on their feet, Dante and Vergil looked at eachother, Dante said "Just like old times right bro?". vergil did a snarky laugh and said "I see you haven't gone senile yet", Dante laughed it off, Vergil and Nero look at eachother for a moment, Vergil realising who Nero really is, he gives a face that silently says "I'm sorry, know that I am very proud of you though", V said something along the lines of "Let's finish the job first shall we?". All looked towards Urizen in agreement, during this part of the fight the music changes from a more orchestral version of the DMC1 theme, transitioning into an orchestral version of Devils Never Cry to Never Surrender as the Urizen's HP gets lower and lower. upon reaching 0 HP a cutscene plays of Urizen grasping his wounds clearly battle damaged, all 4 walk up to Urizen until they're fairly close to him, Dante gets out his guns and gives one to Vergil, Vergil signals Nero to get in on the last kill. Vergil then says to Nero "Hey Nero, we have a saying in this family for situations like this, do you know what that would be?", Nero remarks "Heh, I already know", before a 4 way Jackpot happens with V shooting what appeared to be a lighting bolt, This hits Urizen dead on but with one last attack knocked out all but Vergil. with the demonic plane they were fighting in collapsing, Vergil got Nero on his back, Dante on one shoulder and V on the other, limping as fast as he could to the exit, which crumbled before him, seconds before the realm was about to completely fall apart, Vergil bellowed out "YOU'RE WASTING TIME" and with something like 2 seconds to spare managed to open up a portal back to the human realm. Lady and Trish were waiting for the gang to show up, they see a blue portal open not too far from them, from it they see V, Dante, Nero, and someone Trish doesn't recognize but Lady does, an acoustic of the peaceful part of Never Surrender plays. as Vergil is limping with them all on his back looking like he's about to collapse from exhaustion, to which he does, he didn't even have time to register the woman that looked like his mother before passing out, Dante, V, and Nero wake up after a day or two. to which everyone, especially Kirie, is overcome with joy, after regaining their footing a bit Dante looks and Lady and says "Where is he?", To which Lady points to the DMC main office, Dante who is in no condition to be walking right now, opens the door to see Vergil trying to not murder Trish on the spot. Dante and Vergil look at eachother for a moment, before Lady signals Trish to come into the room where the others are, after that, Vergil remarks "I detest her very existence, but I understand she's your ally so I will not act". Dante says "Thanks, I appreciate it", they go silent for a moment, then Dante begins walking towards to Vergil, Vergil who is weary of this, readies himself for a possible attack, but Dante just goes in and gives him a hug, Vergil both very surprised and slightly disgusted by this is about to push Dante off him before hugging him back, Dante says quietly "I missed you". Vergil is even more surprised by this, Dante then breaks off the hug before going back into the room, he says one last thing to Vergil before I woke up "No more power seeking okay?, I think you have enough", Vergil just Smirks and turns away, and says quietly pointing towards Nero, "I don't plan on it" I don't remember what happened after that</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did you perform a dick state? Are you ashamed of something you did? Or are you embarssed about something you did? Comment one of your WoW Confessions! When I was doing my Mage Towers and I got to my first ever healing tower (Resto Druid) I died a total of 200 times. After I lost all hope I went to a vendor site to do it for me, now I didn't just look on the site, or have the item in my basket, I was SECONDS, away from clicking *confirm purchase* after entering my card details, I quit out realising it could probably get me permanent banned, so I stuck on Blessed and Possessed by Powerwolf and beat it after around 20 more tries</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello Bretty Boop, I have a question for you my lord, after your Orphan of Kos video, a few people got the impression that you don't like the Souls series anymore, if this is true why?, (Though I understand you didn't like Bloodborne by the time the DLC came out) I also read a comment somewhere that raging isn't the only reason you quit the Souls series, Just wondering because you did so much Souls content in the past like friggin Ladel runs (you madman), what made you fall out of love with the game series?. Sorry to be a bother Mr Hart</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So we know Joker was at least 16/17 during P5. And Tae said the only reason they couldn't go 4th Base because of Tokyo's laws and Joker could be arrested for other reasons. Let's assume that he kept up his relationship with Tae by her visiting him and vice versa So also let's assume Joker went back to Tokyo for his 18th and spent the day with Tae, introducing her to his friends. So after they spent time with his friends and went home, Joker now being 18 means he's *legal* in Tokyo Tae has been waiting a LONG time for this. Poor Joker was probably up all night *Playing Doctor*, he probably couldn't walk for the next day or two. I don't know why I wrote this</TEXT>

I #8217;ll have you know I graduated top of my class in The Red Mage School, and I #8217;ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Garlond, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in Black and White Magic and I #8217;m the top Red Mage in Eorzea. You are nothing to me but just another Vertarget. I will wipe you the Verfuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this continent, mark my Verfucking words. You think you can get away with saying that Vershit to me over the Lodestone? Think again, Verfucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Ninjas across Eorzea and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, Vermaggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You #8217;re Verfucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that #8217;s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in Rapier Combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ul'Dah and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable Verass off the face of the continent, you little Vershit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little  #8220;clever #8221; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your Verfucking tongue. But you couldn #8217;t, you didn #8217;t, and now you #8217;re paying the price, you goddamn Veridiot. I will Vershit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

    <DATE>2019-06-27 16:57:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I am SICK and TIRED of all the undeserved HATE that Dark Souls 2 gets.  gt;:( Dark Souls 2 is essentially the Dark Souls of Crash Bandicoot Team Racing. Dark Souls 2 has graphics. Dark Souls 2 has gameplay. This is what makes it my favorite Dark Souls game. So why the FUCK do people hate this fucking game!? Probably because the game is too intelligent for the average IQ to fully process. Yeah! That's got to be it! All you fucking fuckers just hate this fucking game because you probably don't understand the lore and gameplay!!! Fucking you assholes. Ya'll just hate this game for no reason!!!! :'( And yes. I am black. But I don't fucking care!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>H500 Stock fan replacement question</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-29 10:00:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Good morning!, I plan to replace the stock rear and top fans in my H500 with the Corsair LL120 (yeknow for that RGB goodness), but I've heard that those fans aren't exhaust whilst the stock fans are, I'll be using a h115i pro rgb as my front and CPU cooler so I'm wondering if it's a good idea to replace the stock fans with LL120s or not. I plan to overclock the CPU and GPU (9700k and 2070 Ventus Super OC), as well as XMP. Any help or recommendations for RGB exhaust fans would be appreciated</TEXT>

They may look fine now, but it's a matter of time before they turn into the naughty Santa: What? Rudolph: This entire nice list must be purged. Santa: How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way Rudolph: Damn it, Santa. As your best reindeer, I order you to purge this city. Santa: You are not my best, boy. Nor would I obey that command if you were! Rudolph: Then I must consider this an act of treason. Santa: Treason? Have you lost your mind, Rudolph? Rudolph: Have I? Santa, by my right of Red and Shiny of my nose, I hereby relieve myself from command and suspend your lights from service. Blitzen: Rudolph, you can't just... Rudolph: It's done! Those of you who have the will to save this land, follow me. The rest of you... get out of my sight. Santa: You've just crossed a terrible threshold, Rudolph. Rudolph: Blitzen?

    <TEXT>*Beast Knight Leopold, or known before as Leopold The Stalwart was a great swordsman. Back when he defended Oarsmight fortress with Seleste, his wife, and his griffon riders as King Belric XII fled to preserve the Talen bloodline, he was fated to die a gruesome death at the hand of The Undoer. Yet he did not yield till he fell, his sword in hand, and The Undoer's arm grasped in the other. Sadly he was brought back to life by Grinweld The Blighted to guard the secrets of the Tamer's legacy. Give him and Seleste the peace they deserve.*</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-12 17:19:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>So we are deep within the Leopard Seals arc, and I #8217;ve noticed a few differences from the Manga  #8226; Robby doesn #8217;t have his scarred bloodshot eye from his fight with Tonio, I can #8217;t see why they just gave him an eyepatch because in the manga he looked way more badass  #8226; Leourem (The leader of the Leopard Seals) is noticeably less expressive than his manga counterpart, even the cute scenes with Penugi are strange because of it  #8226; Censoring Pinga what she says to the Leopard Seal Royal Guard Seapoof, her line during her fight with him was so visceral and savage, but no they had to censor her  #8226; Pingu sacrificing all the power he would ever have just to kill Sealitou, in the manga it #8217;s a much more scary transformation as he has reached his breaking point, and when Robby comes in to see his best friend without an arm and forced into an adult body, he is more quiet and doesn #8217;t look as shocked and sad, but I will say however that him screaming before Pingu does his final attack that drains him of almost all of his life force was gut wrenching Will this be fixed in the bluerayz?</TEXT>
