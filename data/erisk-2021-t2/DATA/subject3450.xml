    <TITLE>What if we hadn't "fixed" the hole in the Ozone layer?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-04-14 06:05:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>From what I understand it's still there, but due to the drastic cut in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons the hole in the ozone layer is gradually getting smaller. What would have been the ultimate consequences if, say, scientists never discovered the ozone hole or people just stuck their heads in the sand and kept using the ozone-depleting substances?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I lived in China for two years as a Peace Corps volunteer, so while I'm no expert I have a lot of experience with "dealing with" Chinese people in public. I'm sure just about everything I say here will have already been said since I'm so late so I'll try and keep it simple. 1. Population: there are people everywhere, so pushing and shoving becomes necessary a lot of the time to ensure your place in line, get on a bus or train or to just not get lost in a sea of people 2. The Cultural Revolution led to a lot of intellectuals being jailed or murdered. Spitting on the streets, shoving and talking loudly became signs that you were not a part of the problem, but an average Chinese person and part of the Revolution, which meant these traits became encouraged. 3. Family and friends, your in-group, are all that matters. So when your in public, especially on a vacation, you make sure everyone in your group is having a good time and this of course means that that good time often comes at the expense of most of the people around you who aren't in your group Edit: I'd also add, even though other people have already pointed this out as well, that there modernity and the opportunity to travel abroad is a new development for the vast majority of people, who are only one or two generations removed from thousands of years of being peasants, farmers. It's going to take awhile for these families to become what we would consider "fully modern."</TEXT>

But then the game comes out and its just ok, more of the same, just plain bad, etc. Well, this gaming site just spent the last half-year hyping this game, so they can't take it all back and say no actually it's a pretty fun game but nothing you haven't seen before, so they give it a better review than it deserves in order to justify the hype they gave the game prior to its release</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first is a classic adventure story that really couldn't be told any better. It has the hero everyone can relate to, the damsel in distress that is actually a strong, independent woman, the cool anti-hero women want and men want to be and his sidekick, and the villain who you knew was evil the second you saw him. Empire Strikes Back is intelligently written and really adds to the universe created in the first film. It went dark (it was the film that set the precedent that the second film in a trilogy should be the dark one) when most people expected just another fun adventure. Introduced Yoda, a brilliant character... your expecting this great warrior but instead get a wise hermit that just exemplifies how unique the force is and those who follow it. The third.... well that's george lucas taking over so you have some goofy stuff like ewoks and boba fett getting killed accidentally by a blind hon solo but the space battle at the end is still excellent and overall it's not a bad ending to what is in my opinion a trilogy of movies that more than hold up on their own</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Return of the Jedi is the beginning of Lucas taking over the star wars universe and making decisions based more on profit and marketing opportunities rather than quality story telling. Irvin Kershner (director of Episode V) and many other people involved wanted to see han solo die about half way through episode VI, but lucas insisted on having the happy ending with everyone dancing around the campfire to end the series. So with Lucas firmly in control, you get things like the ewoks, luke and leia being siblings, bobba fett dying in the lamest way possible, a climax that is essentially just a repeat of the first film's climax and a happy ending where all the characters basically just have a freeze frame high five. But yeah, some scenes are still great and I'd say overall the film is good, but really doesn't hold up too well under scrutiny or in comparison to the first two</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jurassic World. I went in definitely not expecting a masterpiece. The trailers had all left me pretty cold, but Jurassic Park was such a huge movie for me as a kid and it had been a long time since I got to see a dinosaur movie so basically I went to go see it for the same reasons most people in America did. I found it to be entertaining and not offensively stupid but I still feel like they should have treated the whole thing a little less like an amusement park ride. There wasn't a single tense or suspenseful moment, just 'epic' set piece after set piece, which were all entertaining but left me feeling like I had just seen a very forgettable movie, which Jurassic Park was the opposite of. I think if it had just been a dinosaur movie, and not a film connected to one I still love, I would have been able to accept it as the piece of light entertainment that it was rather than being disappointed in how badly it compares to the original.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since the new Terminator came out, I've seen a lot of discussion about how all the terminator movies since T2 have been bad, and while I agree that the first two are in a league of their own, I enjoyed T3, despite some corny parts, and felt it held its own, especially in comparison to Salvation and Genisys. I've seen a lot of articles/opinions that pointed out T3 as being especially bad, which I found surprising, so I'm curious what other Terminator fans think about that movie in particular.</TEXT>

I forget what year specifically, if it was '97 or 2017 or who the hell knows because that movie's story line was garbage, but it definitely wasn't 2003, which is obviously when shit hits the fan according to T3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Last of Us. For the story alone, specifically the ending. The game itself was fun, though nothing ground-breaking. But the ending was just so well done. I can't think of another game that has an ambiguous ending like that. Ellie's last line stuck with me for a long time and I still think about it from time to time. It could mean at least a few different things and left you with a totally different perspective on Joel, the character you played (almost) the entire game as and who for the most part came across as a somewhat 2-dimensional character with easily understood motivations, and gave you even greater sympathy for Ellie. The ending really stood out to me compared to most game endings that give a closing shot of the character walking off into the sunset or getting ready to take on the next challenge (read: getting you ready for a sequel) where as The Last of Us's ending forced you to really think about the character and everything you had done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Arnold says that whoever sent him back to protect Sarah as a child is classified information, and that's literally all they do to explain that. I knew I wouldn't like the movie after the first fight between old and young Arnold. Compare that cgi fest to the fight between Arnold and the liquid terminator in T2, where the action has real weight as they throw each other through walls. It feels incredibly realistic whereas the fight scenes in Genisys, to me, all looked and felt incredibly fake. But, hey, I'm glad someone enjoyed that movie</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So maybe this has been pointed out before somewhere, but I've never heard it mentioned. Any fan of Tarantino knows he has little things in his movies that call back to other movies he's made or connects them in some way. Well, the other day I re-watched Jackie Brown, and Sam Jackson is asked what he would do if it turns out Jackie is playing him as well as the cops, and he says (I might be paraphrasing here): "Well, then I'll shoot that nigga in both her knee caps." In Kill Bill 2, Bill explains that getting shot in the knee cap is one of the most painful places to get shot. In Django, Sam Jackson plays the head house slave, which Django explains is as low as it gets for a black person in America (in the eyes of other black people) except for being a free black person who takes part in the slave trade. So what happens to Sam Jackson? He gets shot in both knee caps. Nothing too crazy and there are cooler links between his films, but I thought it was a cool connection between the three films, especially between Sam Jackson's characters in Jackie Brown and Django Unchained.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're saying the controversy was a publicity stunt? Adam Sandler is getting paid the same amount whether I watch it on Netflix or not, so even if I do find it offensive it's not like I just put money directly in his pocket in the same way I would if I bought a ticket for it. I realize I'd still be supporting it by adding to the view count that Netflix could use to justify bankrolling Sandler, but honestly, I don't think this will be that huge of an issue that I should feel guilty about that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Glad to see Mel Gibson back in the director's chair. After the vikings and maccabees movies fell through, I thought that might be it for his career. I think Mel Gibson is best at directing violent movies, because they always come across as so realistic to me without just reveling in violence just for the sake of violence. So a movie about a conscientious objector seems to be the total opposite of the typical Gibson movie, like Braveheart and Apocalypto, which were both decidedly not about someone refusing to engage in violence. Still, it's a Gibson movie, so I'm sure I'll get around to seeing it sooner than later after it comes out.</TEXT>

David Foster Wallace is my favorite writer and nothing he writes could ever be called light reading, but The Pale King is intentionally boring, or maybe mundane is the better word, for a few very large parts of the book. I guess he said to a friend, while writing it and shortly before killing himself, that writing TPK was like wrestling a very large, light board to the ground in very heavy winds (paraphrasing) and it's the perfection description of the book and how it feels reading it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just saw the movie tonight and kept thinking how Tom Cruise just looked a little different, like his cheeks were puffier but it didn't seem like he had gained weight. I know he's gotten older, obviously, and people's appearances change as they age but it was just odd to me because it didn't look like natural aging. He didn't even look older, just different. Anyone else notice this or am I going crazy? Oh, also the movie was awesome.</TEXT>

To me, it was a great depiction not only of mental illness but also a totally separate topic: what it feels like to be incredibly anxious about the future, specifically in relation to climate change, and how you can feel like you're going insane at time for no reason because what you're worried about is totally out of control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IV: The Empire has destroyed any remnants of the republic, meaning the Emperor rules the galaxy as a dictator. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo rescue Princess Leia. Obi Wan Kenobi is killed by Darth Vador. The Rebellion (the side Luke Skywalker fights on in the final battle) is able to destroy the Death Star, the Empire's newest, greatest weapon. V: The Empire destroys the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke goes to Degobah to receive training in using the force from Master Yoda, Han Solo and Princess Leia are running from the Empire but are caught by Darth Vader (the Emperor's right hand man) in Cloud City. Han Solo is frozen in carbonite, Luke confronts Vador, finds out Vador is his father, and escapes with Leia. VII: Han and Leia lead an assault on a base on the moon of Endor that destroys the shield protecting the new Death Star the Empire is building. Luke confronts Vador again and just as the Emperor is about to kill Luke, Vador decides to save his son and kill the Emperor. With the shield down, the Rebel assault is able to destroy the Death Star and much of the Empires fleet of star destroyers (really big space ships) and Super star destroyer (Really, really big space ship). Luke escapes from the Death Star (where he fought Vador until the Emperor almost killed him before Vador kills the Emperor) but not before Vador dies from his injuries sustained in fighting luke and killing the Emperor. The Rebels celebrate their victory on Endor. Basically, while the rebels have won, there is still presumably a massive amount of Stormtroopers (soldiers of the Empire) and ships left so while the Empire has lost its leader it stands to reason they wouldn't all just give up. The new Star Wars will probably revolve around the discovery of individuals capable of using the Force and meeting Luke to receive training as well a the remains of the army of the Empire trying to reassert control and continuing to fight the Rebellion while we will also be introduced to new followers of the Dark Side (the Emperor and Darth Vader in the original trilogy) who will fight the new Jedi-in-training in the new trilogy. Hope this wasn't too confusing. Not much is known story-wise about the new trilogy other than that characters from the original trilogy will return and their will be new characters who will be Sith (the Dark Side) and Jedi (at least eventually)</TEXT>

Beyond the fact that he's pretty bland and looked nothing like the original actor, it really bothered me that this guy, who supposedly grew up in a nuclear apocalypse where every human is constantly running from/fighting killer robots, he apparently had time to hit the gym every day. Michael Biehne looked like he maybe weighed 140 lbs in Terminator. In the new one, Kyle Reese is played by a body builder, not an actor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Upvoted because you really put in time to explain and defend your argument, but I still disagree, at least to an extent. He doesn't have as much range as many other actors, but he's shown the ability to play different kinds of characters in movies that others here have pointed out, like Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July. But at the end of the day, I don't think it matters. Even when playing the usual role, that is, the type-A action hero, he's great at it, and it's always easy to buy in to his performance. So while he might not have the widest range as an actor it doesn't change my opinion that he's one of the best out there.</TEXT>

Something about the way she carries herself, the confidence, and the fact that she's not traditionally good looking according to Hollywood standards in that she isn't super skinny and doesn't have a particularly angular face. But it is partly that girl-next-door quality to her look that just really does it for me.</TEXT>

It's significant, in a way words can't really describe, or at least in ways I cannot describe. That's what makes Lost in Translation so terrific. The whole movie is about emotional develop gained from travel and connecting with another human that can be so hard to describe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I would agree, and I didn't like Salvation. It was ok, but pretty forgettable. But the overuse of cgi in Genisys bored me to tears. At least the T-100s in salvation weren't all cgi all the time. The one thing Salvation had to make up for it's inconsequential and forgettable plot was the great special effects. Genisys' plot isn't even forgettable, it's nonsensical, and to top it off the action, while at times good looking, used cgi to such an extreme degree that I wasn't ever invested in any of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Babadook and It Follows are two new movies in the last couple years that have gained a strong fan base. I'd go back and watch a classic like The Shining or The Exorcist first and then move on to slashers like Friday the Thirteenth and Halloween (which were big in the late 70s and 80s). The Fly was made in the 80s and is fantastic, but is body horror and not a slasher film. Then as for 90s you could check out Scream. Zombies became huge in the early 2000s, so you could check out The Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. Goodnight Mommy is another new one that I hear is great, though I haven't seen it yet.</TEXT>

I think it had a lot to do with where I was in life, struggling to find work or a purpose, just being depressed in general (it was also the middle of a brutal winter in Wisconsin), so seeing a movie where someone has a passion and real talent and yet is repeatedly rejected was not a story that particularly appealed to me at the time. While I respected how well made it was, it just put me in a really bad mood and I walked out of the theater wishing I hadn't seen it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eraserhead. I've tried multiple times and have always failed to get through it. The first time I saw it was at a film festival showing famous director's first films. When the ballerina starts dancing out of the heating vent, I just couldn't take the level of weird going on in that movie. Every time I try to watch it, I get so uncomfortable I just have to stop. I'm not offended by it, and I won't say it's bad (I'm a big Lynch fan), but I cannot for the life of me manage to sit through that whole movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, of course. Not speaking from experience, because I personally couldn't imagine only being with one person my whole life, but I know several people who have married high school sweethearts and are quite happy. One of my best friends is married to a girl he started dating at age 12, a girl he has known since kindergarten. He has at times expressed some regret over not getting to date other people, but he's still (and I'm guess always will be) crazy in love with his wife and doesn't regret marrying her. If you're in love with the person you're in a relationship with, it doesn't really matter who you have or haven't dated previously. While relationships do give experience, and I know I've learned a lot from failed relationships in the past, that doesn't mean you can't learn those same things from a single relationship and just working through the problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have gotten to the last part, protecting the ship, and have killed all the scavengers, but now nothing happens. Robots won't talk to me, its like we're all just waiting for more enemies to show up but that's not happening. My last two saves are from when the fighting already started and still ends with the same situation, or from a day ago, so I really don't feel like loosing hours of progress to do this and a bunch of other quests over again. Any one else have this experience? *I finally was able to beat it, so for anyone else having the same trouble, don't give up. I just had to wait it out, basically and keep retrying from the one save point I did have midway through the fight. For whatever reason, eventually it worked.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If you bring a small child movie to a movie theater, please don't think young age is an excuse for rude behavior.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-12-24 23:50:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I saw Star Wars this morning and the five year old next to me talked throughout the entire movie. I asked calmly for him to be quiet early in the film and the father half heartedly told him to quiet down once. After the movie I turned to the father and said he shouldn't bring his son to theaters if he can't be considerate of others to which the father just said repeatedly "He's five." I don't care who you are or how old, talking in theaters distracts the hell out of me and is incredibly inconsiderate. So rant in summary, you're kid's not special, don't be an asshole. Edit: Glad to see this get a strong response. For everyone saying not to complain on reddit but instead complain to theater management, I would like to point out it's possible to do both and that I have no expectation of this post changing many people's minds. But raising a little awareness can't hurt and at the end of the day I just felt like venting after talking to the father obviously went nowhere. Also, for those saying it's an early morning show so I should expect there to be a lot of children and for the children to be loud, I absolutely did expect there to be a lot of kids, and I'm not one to freak out about a kid talking every now and then during a movie. The point of this post is to point out that it's ridiculous for a parent to let their kid do whatever the hell they want in a theater, no matter the movie or showtime. I honestly don't get how any one can disagree with that but I guess I occasionally forget how many inconsiderate people are out there who raise their children to be the same way.</TEXT>

Oh, and by the way, you were the one who shared your opinion of me first, so why on earth are you complaining when I do the same to you?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We understand your comment perfectly. Believe it or not, you didn't make a complex argument that was difficult to grasp. Just because it's a time when parents take their children, doesn't mean the children can behave any way the want. I don't understand what's so hard to understand about this. When did I say I was "fucking pissed"? It's inconsiderate to let a child do whatever they want when in a public place. Not to mention that no matter the time, a PG-13 movie is not a movie intended for the 5 and under crowd. If you're going to take a child to a movie for people of all ages, they should be taught to be considerate of all people. It's called common decency.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The article addresses this point. It says that the use of 3D in movies is basically Avatar's only lasting contribution to cinema. The article is saying that culturally, though, it left no impact. People still quote A New Hope, but you rarely hear any one talk about Avatar anymore at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You could always, ya know, read the article, which states pretty explicitly that Avatar did create a huge wave of 3D movies. This isn't culture, this is production companies making the decision to convert movies to 3D in post production to make some extra money. Even if you want to call it culture, 3D is already a lot less popular than it was a few years ago so the idea that Avatar has not had a lasting cultural impact still stands.</TEXT>

As an adult, I see it through an entirely different lense (though I don't automatically switch to complete outrage like you). I posted it because I think it's interesting how much society's sensibilities have changed in the last decade, and having a joke like this go totally unremarked upon 20 years ago is a great example of that. I should have known though, that without first clarifying that I'm on the "right" side of the issue, I would get preached at in snarky tones on the Internet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No apologies necessary, and I get where you're coming from completely. If anything, it probably wouldn't have hurt for me to be a little bit more clear when posting this. I will say that while I find this scene in particular to be in bad taste, I don't find it particularly offensive either. The Einhorn plot as a whole, however, I do find problematic, as it definitely reinforced negative preconceptions of transgender people that were held at the time. Maybe this is bad, but despite all that, I'm still an ace Ventura fan; as a child of the 90s, I just can't help myself.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can I create drop-down lists in which you can select multiple answers?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-05 03:27:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know how to create drop-down lists, and how to create data validation drop-down lists where you can choose multiple answers. My issue is, I can't figure out how to create said lists where, if you accidentally choose a second answer, or the wrong second answer, it's possible to erase that second answer. Right now when I select a second (or third, or fourth, etc.) answer, I'm not able to delete it to go back to just having the single answer. So... if the drop-down list options are "a, b, c, and d," and I first choose "a," I currently have it set up so that I can then click back on the list, and choose another option so that I now have "a, b" in the cell (or a, d or a, c, etc). I can't delete "b" then, though, so I'm stuck with "a, b" in that cell. If I'm going to sell this to my coworkers as something they can use as a data tracking tool, it's got to be very user-friendly. Is there any way to get this to happen in a way that wouldn't require multiple steps and would just be as simple as deleting that second answer? Thanks much to anyone who can ~~help~~ assist this ignorant unpaid intern!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the first one holds up, mainly due to a tight, coherent script and minimal use of CGI, at least in comparison to the next two films. Ultimately, what I think The Matrix has that the next two don't is the strong philosophical undertones that makes it so compelling. There's a reason people still ask if you want the red pill or the blue pill but no one says anything about talking to the architect. The Matrix had easy to understand yet still heady philosophical undertones, while two and three were just a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas that were often there just to kind of pay lip service to the idea that there was some kind of deeper meaning behind the action on screen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like to gauge the community's opinion on hitting/demolishing opponents in ranked play. Lately, I've been playing aggressively, hitting and demolishing my opponents more often than I usually have. And lately, I've been getting a lot of comments telling me that my style of play is cheap and for female dogs. At first I was honestly surprised because I've always seen getting hit or blown up as just part of the game. Am I actually in the minority on this? Is it cheap to purposefully and repeatedly hit your opponents?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Office is a really bad show, even by mainstream sitcom standards.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-11 14:39:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know this is obviously a subjective opinion. I think Friends is good, Big Bang Theory is bad, etc, but usually get it when people disagree with me on which shows they like. But there's something about The Office, at least after the first two seasons, that makes me truly hate the show. It's overly sentimental to the point that characters' actions don't come anywhere close to how humans actually act. Jim and Pam are suppose to be adorable but come across as insufferably smug and often times creepy. Michael and Holly make me cringe to no end. They're suppose to be endearingly awkward but they're actually just completely socially retarded. Every character is "quirky but at the end of the day they're one big happy family" but the quirks are the only defining characteristic. It's like the episode of Sunny that makes fun of popular sitcoms, but that Sunny episode didn't actually go far enough in showing how emotionally manipulative The Office is. I can't stand watching it. It makes me physically uncomfortable. Every moment is suppose to show you how precious all the characters are but it's like it was written by aliens who are close to understanding what makes people attractive or likable but at the end of the day have no understanding of how people actually act in real life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA for not texting back friends, romantic interests, significant others?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-13 12:32:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>I hate texting. I hate how everyone seems to love texting. I've had friendships and relationships end because of this issue. It was a near-constant issue in the longest relationship I've been in, which lasted two years, and that ended partially because of it. I don't see a value in texting. It's not meaningful communication to me. It's not that I don't care how your day was, but texting "How was your day?" "Good. Yours?" just seems so trite and pointless to me. I recently set up Tinder and Bumble profiles and over the past month I matched with a few women and we would agree to go on a date, usually a few days later in the week. But then the next day, the texts would start. "Morning" at 7 am. "How's your day going" in the middle of the day while I'm at work. WTF! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because why on earth would I, or anyone, want to spend time staring at their phone texting small talk to someone they haven't even met yet? I get that you want to get to know a person at least a little bit before meeting, but it so often goes way beyond that to a degree that I feel is childish. How did any relationship ever last before cell phones? If a couple didn't see each other in person, they'd talk - as in real conversation - over the phone, or - god forbid - go a whole 24 hours without talking. I feel like so many people show real insecurity that I want no part of when they seem to need attention via texts every day. So I ignore the texts. I just don't respond. And then friends think I don't care. Women think I'm not interested. I think they're childish. But maybe ITA.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I def did make it sound like that but I do communicate to my friends and significant other that it's simply not something I'm comfortable doing, and that when they repeatedly text me I feel forced into communicating in a way that I do not derive any meaning from and struggle with. I really struggle with the messaging. So many people take it as me saying I don't care. But that's not it! I just don't feel that I can meaningfully engage through that particular mode of communication. It's especially tough in the dating app situation. How do you explain to someone you just met that if they text you small talk, you're simply not going to respond, without them taking offense? I have no idea. If there's a way, I'd love to know it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I definitely expected to have to, as you said, wade through some bs, but what's frustrating me now is a couple women I met I really liked! But then almost right away, from a communication standpoint, it became clear it wasn't going to work. If you need constant affirmation in the form of texts every day, I'm simply not the guy for you. But it's increasingly seeming like that's the vast majority of people so I'm frustrated that my stance on this topic, which I think is a reasonable one, puts me at odds with so many people.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Golden Age of television is dead.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-24 09:28:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>There isn't a single show left on air capable of bringing people together for a national conversation, like shows like Breaking Bad and GoT did. We've gone through dozens of iterations of the "anti-hero with a personal secret/problem" story line that was already perfected the first time with the show that issued in the Golden Age, The Sopranos, so we moved on to epic-scale storytelling or niche stories. Now shows are either so focused on being the next big thing that they focus on epic story lines that will start a hashtag trend, a la Westworld, which as far as I can tell most people already stopped caring about, or focus on catching a niche market, a la Divorce or, ugh, Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein. There are hundreds of pretty good shows, and every now and then almost-great one-season shows like The Terror or Chernobyl. But the age of truly great television, shows that captured an era or brought about a new trend in story telling, is gone. Maybe, probably, not for good, but with the proliferation of streaming services and over saturation of shows based on previous popular shows and trends, it's safe to say that the quality of shows has gone down considerably and likely won't return until networks stop chasing the next big thing and go back to just letting writers tell their own stories no matter what they think might make for the next big hit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would maybe move it up a little later, say around 2015. Breaking Bad didn't finish until 2013, Mad Men until 2015. I'd say right around then is also when GoT officially started going off the tracks, so you could put the Golden Age at beginning of The Sopranos, 1999 to 2015.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very much agree. The humor in particular really rubs me the wrong way. It's like they write a basic script and some kind of algorithm that determines where humor should be writes "insert joke here" and then a team of writers worked tirelessly to come up with the most easily understood, unoffensive joke possible to place there. But not just the humor, everything in the films seems market tested to the nth degree to ensure nothing goes over anyones head. I never get a sense of a singular creative vision or drive to try something new behind the films. They're all fine, and they all mostly bore me and I can't wait to not watch the movie again once it's over.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-23 10:52:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Everyone said that Jay Leno was an asshole for not giving up the Tonight Show to O #8217;Brien, but the fact of the matter is that it was his show and he didn #8217;t want to give it up, and he always got better ratings, so when NBC said they wanted to give it back to Jay Leno, Leno could either choose to say no and have all of his staff lose their jobs or he could take back the job he always wanted to keep in the first place. Conan was never right for the Tonight Show, had his shot, and failed. And he handled the rejection about as gracelessly as possible. He #8217;s been irrelevant ever since, and is always looking for validation like the kid who thought he should be prom king but couldn #8217;t even get a date.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I play the most basic version of the game. I can't get past Prince difficulty level and can only win by running out the clock while using military to keep other civs down. I try not to expand too soon too early but I always fall behind technologically. A few basic questions I think I'm totally missing the answers to: How do you make a city specialize in technology? As in, what geographic features help to get more science? What happens if your cities have more than one religion, is that bad? Any tips would be appreciated!! EDIT: Turns out I was as bad as I thought at this game! Really appreciate all the help. I wasn't expecting any answers so I really appreciate everyone's in-depth advice.</TEXT>
