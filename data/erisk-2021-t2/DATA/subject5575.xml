    <TITLE>[TOMT] [VIDEO GAME] that compares people in game going crazy like in  #8220;The Happening #8221;</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-09-11 14:50:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Watched someone play this on a random YT channel in 2017 or 2016 so it could #8217;ve been uploaded before then. But here #8217;s what I 100% remember: - Game starts off in first person pov with your character waking up in a house and as he #8217;s about to go downstairs, another male character comes up to you and mentions how everyone in town in going crazy like  #8220;that bad M. Night Shyamalan #8221; movie (he was talking about The Happening) Other things I vaguely remember: - Took place in a town and you could enter buildings and houses - It was a funny/weird game concept, not scary - Realistic graphics, not cartoonish - Everyone, including yourself, would die in weird dramatic ways - I feel like clowns and/or balloon swords were involved</TEXT>

I remember getting to 140 which scared me because it was my hw and then I got down to 112 just for me to binge for hmm over a damn year and then I went up to 146. which is super embarrassing because everyone noticed when I lost weight so for sure they noticed when I *gained* it all back. my point is this isn #8217;t the end, you can still get back to a healthy weight no matter how long it takes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you know, I think one of the hardest things to accept about myself if that I #8217;m never gonna have the body I had when I was 11 or 12. I have to understand that no 19 year old should have the body of someone who hasn #8217;t even gone through puberty. it #8217;s just not realistic. with saying that, the behaviors you are describing definitely aren #8217;t good eating habits and can end up to developing such disorder pretty soon (not to scare you) don #8217;t continue starving yourself or obsessing so much about calories you #8217;re eating and thinking of ways to punish yourself for overeating. it #8217;s easier to say than do but really looking back, I had a normal BMI in middle school and there was no need for me to start obsessing over my diet. all that led to was years of suffering and hating myself. nearly 7 years have gone by and I still hate my body more than anything and I #8217;m just constantly losing or gaining a lot of weight. I #8217;m not happy and this will probably stay with me for another 7 or more years. therefore, think to yourself: what led you to gain weight in the first place. did you just hit puberty and naturally gained some more weight? or are you constantly engorging yourself with food when you #8217;re bored and not hungry? either way focus on eating when you are hungry and maybe doing some light exercises if you don #8217;t already but really you #8217;re at a healthy weight and you deserve to eat food and enjoy it. not thinking of ways to starve yourself or lie to others about not eating. also i don #8217;t really know if this helped, but if you ever want to message me feel free to do so, wish you the best</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hi this was literally me a couple days ago (we #8217;re also the same height) I had been eating like shit for MONTHS and was terrified. finally I just grabbed the scale and stepped on it... and unfortunately it was bad and I cried lol but it somehow felt better knowing? But I think you should definitely wait till you #8217;re ready or make a set date, let #8217;s say in 5 days or whatever you choose. I know it #8217;s tough but no matter what the number says you #8217;re going to be okay, it #8217;s not permanent. also hey it #8217;s not a dumb crisis! we all have panics like this so don #8217;t feel silly. you #8217;re not alone in this and I #8217;m here if you ever want to talk</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel this 100%, on one hand I love that people noticed I #8217;ve lost weight but on the other hand that means that they are paying attention to MY body. If they noticed I lost weight then surely they #8217;ll notice when I gain it too... at the end I just wish people would keep their mouths shut :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me, I tend to lose my period after restricting for 3 months and if I continue doing what I #8217;m doing I don #8217;t see it the next month or the month after, etc. Then whenever I start eating normally again (+ gaining some weight) I always get it back the next month or two. Maybe we #8217;re the same but I know for me, my period is always on time and therefore if it doesn #8217;t show up I know it #8217;s not because I #8217;m late and instead due to my low intake :/</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[TOMT][POST/VIDEO] A funny post or video about OP trolling another troll by pretending their brother hacked them?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-23 06:04:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I probably saw this in 2019, and it was either a post here on Reddit or just a video on Youtube I can #8217;t exactly remember... But it was a bunch of screenshots of OP trolling someone who said they would hack them on a game (maybe Call of Duty? I #8217;m not familiar with games at all), it went something like this: **Guy: Stop talking so loud or I #8217;m gonna hack you** **OP (pretending to be a scared kid): No please don #8217;t!!** **Guy: Ok fine but don #8217;t do that again or I will hack for real** **OP (still pretending...): My brother is a hacker and he will hack you** **Guy: Haha sure kid** (*Then OP manages to find the guy #8217;s real name and other minor details through this guy #8217;s gamertag I believe*) **OP: Your name is XYZ right?** **Guy: Dude wtf** **OP: Told you my brother was a hacker** (*And the guy starts getting really freaked out and worried*)</TEXT>
