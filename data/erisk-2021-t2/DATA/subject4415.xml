    <TEXT>You have lvl1 pekkas. Looking at their defences, I would bet that they have lvl5 or 6 teslas. If they do, you will need heal and rage spells to have a chance. Lvl1 pekkas are so weak. I would just mass drag attack this base. Hit it from the south west and bring lvl6 loons in the cc if you can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This sub hates in gowipe, but it's what I use and I 3 stared bases like this all the time when I was th8. I would attack from the north west. Drop a golem by the de drill and another by the top left elixir collector. Drop some wizards behind them (but not between them). Drop 2 pekkas plus a cc pekka on the spell factory. Some wall breakers, then your Bking, then a few wizards you have left over. Rage, heal, heal. That's what I would do and I would be confident about it. However, I also think hogs would work too. I just have never preferred hogs myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a really good explanation. So simple, yet I never really understood this before. Why would someone care if a star wars character is black? Ah, because they're only comfortable picturing black people serving them in the drive through. Anything beyond that makes them uncomfortable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very simple explanation: You're externally rotating your shoulders when the weight is overhead. You're probably sticking your head out and forward as well. Doing so pinches on a nerve that makes your hands go numb. I'm sure there's a much more scientific explanation, but I don't know it. Not a doctor, but I know that this is pretty common. This exact thing happened to me. I did a wod that had a lot of overhead squats at a decent weight (115lbs). My hands were numb for a few days afterward. After this happened, I realized that my overhead form is shit. I've been working on it ever since. Next time you do work overhead, focus on internally rotating your shoulders. Show your armpits to the person in front of you, not the people beside you. If you have trouble overhead squatting, or snatching, with internally toting your shoulders, then you need to lower the weight and work on form. I had to swallow my pride and do the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you get lvl4 hogs? You could send 4 hogs to take out the air sweeper. Zap the AD on the left. Then funnel the drags from the right. I think you should be able to 3 star it that way. Otherwise, bring 2 rage and a heal, 10 drags and your lvl5 CC loons. Attack from the top left. Be patient in taking out the outer buildings with a few drags, then funnel the rest in the middle. Rage, heal rage. Drop the spells once the drags start to funnel. It's better to drop the spells too early than too late.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What has been your challenge with pull-ups? Are you just trying to get kipping pull-ups, or have you been training to do them strict? I recommend that you really focus on this for the next few weeks/months. Do a set of 10 jumping pull-ups every time you're in the gym. Make your decent really slow and controlled. Then do a set of 10 banded strict pull-ups, using a thinner band once you succeed with a set. You should be able to get pull-ups in a month or two at most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is that there would be no classes. The box would exist purely for competitions. No classes means no coaches, which means I don't need to pay anyone. Judges would all be fellow competitors, or volunteers. Another goal would be that the gym is open during the day for free use by anyone who is in the league. I've noticed that a lot of people want open gym times, but their boxes don't provide enough. My facility would fill that need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good suggestions, thank you! As for scaled, I know what you mean. It's tough. At the competition I just competed in, there was a guy who could do 30 unbroken butterfly pull-ups. He came second last in the scaled div because he couldn't handle the weights in the other workouts. There were also 2 guys who snatched 200+ lbs and C amp;J 265. They also both finished near the bottom because they got crushed in the other events.</TEXT>

People wouldn't need sponsors to compete in my crossfit league in the same way that people don't need sponsors to compete in rec softball, or beer league hockey. There would be a high level of competition in the RX div, but the scaled (and perhaps a "beginner" level) would be accessible to everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's something that will help at least a bit: Put 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts on a tray. Put some olive oil, salt (just a bit) and pepper on them. You can put some other seasoning if you want. Put them in an oven preheated to 350f for 30min. While they're cooking, cut up all of the vegetables. What vegetables you ask? I said ALL of them. Just go to the produce section of your grocery store and buy 1 of everything that you like. Cut them all up into bite size pieces. Put them in a mixing bowl and squeeze some lime juice in there (this is to preserve the veggies). Get out 3 reusable containers (like ziplock or glassware or whatever). Fill each 3/4 way with your veggie mix. Put a layer of plastic wrap over them, then pour in some salad dressing. Get something oil based, not creamy. Now fold the plastic wrap over the dressing and put the lid on the container. Take the chicken out of the oven after 30min. Cut 1 of them into 3 equal pieces. Wrap 3 servings of 1.3 chicken breasts in tinfoil. You now have 3 meals consisting of a salad and 1.3 chicken breasts. It will keep for about 3 days in the fridge. This only takes about 35min to cook and is very cheap. You can do this a bunch of different ways including different types of veggies, different seasoning on the chicken, different meat etc. If you want to add some carbs to the meal, just bake a small sweet potato and add it to the meal. Enjoy!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are the inferno towers set to single or multi? I'm a TH9 that hasn't had to attack too many TH10s, so I can't tell just by looking at them. If my clan only needed 2 stars from this base in the war, I would gowipe it and just rage, heal, rage, heal everything into the middle. Pretty sure you'd get the TH doing that. The walls and defences are so low lvl. If we needed 3 stars, I would probably use gowiwi, but only if the infernos are set to multi. If it's set to single, I'd try lavaloonion with 3 hounds. To be honest though, I wouldn't expect to 3 star it myself, and probably wouldn't try. I'd just gowipe it for 2 stars. I have very little experience hitting TH10s, so you'll probably get better advice from others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the future, please include a picture of your troops and spells in the comments of your post. A lot easier for us that way. Your only option is to mass drag. Bring 2 rage and a heal spell (assuming they're at least lvl3). Attack from 2oclock on the map. You need to funnel well. If you don't know what I mean by that, Google "dragon funnelling" and watch videos. Clear as many buildings as you can at 1oclock and 3oclock with 1 or 2 drags at each of those spots. Once you've created a good funnel, drop the rest of your drags at 2oclock. Use rage, heal, rage on them as they make their way to the middle. It's better to use your spells too early, rather than too late. You can't heal dragons that are dead. Just make sure to drop the spell on, but a bit ahead of the drags. Ask for a dragon in your CC. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My clan has grown significantly and we have now reached 50 users. We have a very solid war record (45-3-4), because we've always had great communication and strategy. During the cleanup round of attacks, I will send a clan mail with specific instructions for everyone who can have an impact on the war at that time. I tell them who to attack, in what order and who is in reserve for back attacks. As you can probably imagine, this is now very difficult to do with 50 members. It's mainly the character limit in the clan mail that makes things difficult. I actually really enjoy coming up with a detailed war plan and watching it get us the win (last night we beat a lvl7, 100+ win clan by a single star). What apps do people use, and what are some effective methods of using them? I would like to have a chat room for the whole clan, and a private room for leaders. Notification settings will be important as I don't want hundreds of notifications per day. Image sharing is also important. Does anyone have any tips on not only the app to use, but how to use it most effectively?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen this base a few times recently. I recommend GoWiWi. Bring a max golem in your CC if you have access to one. Bring lots of witches. I'd say 10. I recommend bringing 3 heals and 1 rage. You wanna use the rage to kill the drag that's probably in the CC, but only heals after that. You never want to rage witches as it can speed them up into the path of defences or giant bombs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My base looked very similar to yours when I upgraded to TH9. Hold off. Upgrade your walls. Trust me, it's very difficult to upgrade your walls when you have so many new defences to upgrade. Also, you should practice GoWiPe with lvl2 golems for a few weeks before you go to TH9. Get REALLY good at it. My clan has a max TH8 that can 3 star low level TH9s in war with his GoWiPe and it's incredibly valuable. Be patient.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First it seems like just a fun little game. You spend a few minutes playing now and then because it's a good time waster. After a while you find yourself enjoying it more and more. You've figured out how the attacks work and how to build a good base to defend your loot. "This is fun!" You think to yourself. A few weeks later and your base is coming along. You built your first air defence to take out those flying fairy things this people use to keep their Giants alive longer. You're determined to get one yourself. You start learning how to attack different types of bases and you love the rush you get from scoring some big loot. Then you find a clan. Maybe you found them in global chat. Maybe you found out that a bunch of guys at your work play too. You take part in your first clan war... And fail miserably. You're determined to pull your weight and do better next time. A few months later and you know everything there is to know about dragon attacks. You consistently get 3 stars, but it's getting boring. "I just wanna GoWiPe!!" You say to yourself and your clan. So you grind, day and night to get those pekkas. Then things start to get interesting. It's been a year, and you're a solid TH9. You use GoHo attacks when it suites you, but maybe you prefer LaLoon or even DragLoon, cause you just love those air attacks. Or maybe your a witch guy, and you prefer GoWiWi. You're in a solid clan and you're near the top. Everything is maxed but your walls and Royals. Things are getting stale again. You decide to go to TH10. You think you're ready, and your clan mates agree. Time to enter the big leagues. You set the TH to upgrade, and you're crazy excited. A few weeks pass and finally you've made it... TH10. You expected it to be a bit different at TH10. The TH8s are no longer goo options for loot. You can't get 2 stars in war to save your life. Every defence, wall, or royal upgrade takes weeks to grind for. You're getting frustrated, but you're don't want to give up. You've invested almost 2 years into this game. You notice yourself playing less. You login for war attacks, but can't be bothered to farm. You've just lost the spark. After a long period of contemplation, you decide that you've had enough. CoC was great for a while, and a blast while it lasted, but the fire has burned out. You open your base and let the loot out into the world. So long CoC, it's been a slice. A few weeks go by and things are well. You miss wars a bit, but you don't think about CoC nearly as much. You've even met a new girl and you think she likes you. It's Friday night and you have a date. You got ready too early cause you're so excited for the date. You have some time to kill so you open up Reddit. You keep forgetting to unsubscribe from /r/clashofclans, and so there it is, at the top of your front page... ClashCon is underway. You figure you might as well see what the big upgrade was. TH11! Wow, that's cool. You know how much of a grind it would be, and you kinda chuckle at all of the people clamouring to get it. Then you see the other upgrades: expanded map, new Royal, new DE troops, new DE spells, water troops?! Holy shit, water troops! "That's awesome!!" You think to yourself. You gotta login, just to check it out. A few hours later and you get an angry text from the date you forgot all about. Too bad, she was cute. Oh well, you only need 8,000,000 more elixir to get the new turtle rider tank troop. Maybe just a few more attacks...</TEXT>

My DGBs are between the AD and wiz tower at the top right, and I modified the sweepers on the bottom to fit DGBs there. This person hasn't done that.

    <TEXT>Well, it really depends on where you are in your progress, and where your clan is in its overall progress. My clan has several relatively new TH9s. We all maxed out at TH8 before upgrading. All of our TH8s have great troop levels, and are in various stages of non-rushed progression. Right now, we are matching up against a lot of clans with very high lvl TH9 bases (significantly higher than our top TH9s), but mixed in with a bunch of low lvl and rushed TH8s. In pretty much every war, we 3 star every TH8 easily. We 3 star a few TH9s, but have no possible hope of 3 staring the enemy's top TH9s. They are significantly higher lvl than we are. Therefore, our strategy is to get 2 stars on these bases. We use a lot of GoWiPe and GoWiWi for almost guaranteed 2 stars. This is results in us basically never losing. Our record is 51-6-5. It's not a perfect record, but it's a damn good one. The guy I replied to said that he's a TH9 that is "terrible in war". Maybe he should focus on consistently getting 2 stars for a while, until he gets his royals and troops up. But what do I know, I just go for 2 stars all the time. Such a losing strategy right? Not according to my clan's war record.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sure. I wouldn't gowipe attack a base that's already been 2 stared, because gowipe is a 2 star attack. We've been struggling recently at the top of the board because we've been trying to use more advanced attacks, but are failing because our royals aren't high enough yet. With lvl1 lavahounds and lvl11 royals, it's really tough to 3 star bases with defences that are maxed for TH9 and royals in the 20+ range. We often get matched up with clans that have maxed out bases at the top, and a mix of rushed and low lvl bases below. We pretty much always win, but I'm missing the satisfying feeling of getting 3 stars. I've realized that I can't expect to start getting 3 stars until I have golems, lavahounds, and witches that are maxed for TH9, along with royals that are at least lvl15+. Until then, I'll just need to be satisfied with gowiping for 2 stars.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yoda was a great Jedi trainer, but a terrible leader. I blame him for the fall of the Jedi, and the Republic. Not because he wasn't able to figure out Palpatine's plan though. I blame Yoda because of his absolutely colossal failure with Anakin. Regarding Palpatine, I've always been torn between Yoda being a blind fool, and Palpatine just being a master of manipulation, and of the force. I tend to lean towards the latter, because non of the other Jedi were able to figure it out either. Regarding Anakin, Yoda just completely screwed up. Here is this kid that was conceived by the force itself, who is immensely strong in the force, and who they all agree is the chosen one. Who do they have train him? Not Yoda, or Windu. Not Mundi or Fisto or any of the other masters. No, they get fresh faced Kenobi, who himself just lost his master and just graduated from Padawan to Knight. A line that always stuck with me from episode 3, "You were my brother Anakin!" Anakin didn't need a brother. He needed a master. When Padme needed protecting, why the hell would they choose Anakin? He's already shown to be emotional, brash and undisciplined. Also, he's clearly in love with her. They must have sensed that. Why would they send them off to Naboo to be alone together?! Anakin even goes to Yoda and tells him of his visions, of his fear of loss. Here is arguably the most powerful Jedi EVER, telling Yoda some pretty heavy shit, and Yoda just casually tells him to let it all go. Doesn't follow up, doesn't look to mentor him further or do anything else to help the clearly heavy emotional state of the chosen one. There are so many mistakes that Yoda made with Anakin, and without Anakin, Palpatine wouldn't have been able to accomplish his goals. I mean, Mace Windu did hand Palpatine his ass in that fight. I still love Yoda though. I just think he should have stuck with training the younglings.</TEXT>

Eventually they gain the courage to jump in, but it took a clear opening. I don't really blame them. They're fighting one of the most powerful force users in the galaxy, and arguably the best Lightsaber duelist alive.

The Emperor fully expected all of Luke's friends and the entire rebellion to be destroyed in front of his eyes. If this had happened, Luke would have had no choice other than to join the Emporer, or die. Of course he would have chosen death, and I agree that there wasn't much evidence to suggest he would have chosen differently, but just keep in mind that when the Emperor of orchestrated his plan, Luke having any kind of life to choose, other than the dark side, was not in the cards.</TEXT>

He manipulated the entire galaxy, and he did it right under the nose of the greatest Jedi master to ever live. He is brilliant, ruthless, and completely without mercy. He is the greatest villain in cinema history IMO, and I never would have fully understood that if it wasn't for the PT. -Understanding the sadness, regret, and shame that Yoda and obi-wan felt. Their failures directly resulted in the fall of the Jedi order, and of the Republic. In the OT, Yoda was this great and wise Jedi master with no faults. The PT allowed us to see his failures and makes episode V so much more powerful when you understand his regrets. When Luke leaves to confront Vader, you really see Yoda's disappointment, thinking that he had failed yet again. I have SO much more, but I gotta get back to work. Maybe I'll add more later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was fine with what happened, but really disappointed with how it was shown on screen. Sidious is one of the best Lightsaber fighters to ever live, and none of the Jedi had any idea. They had all spent a lot of time with Palpatine, and never sensed a thing. The Jedi are pretty proud of their ability to sense things. Sure, Anakin had told them that Palpatine was in fact a Sith Lord, but I don't think they really understood who they were dealing with. They probably thought that Sidious was the brains of the operation, and that Dooku was the muscle. They had no idea that Sidious was both. When he jumped from that chair and landed in front of them, he unleashed all of the dark side energy that he had been holding back for so long. The Jedi were probably completely shocked. They had no idea that they were about to take on the most powerful Sith Lord to exist in thousands of years. The thing that was weak was the terrible way they filmed the seen. All that intense shit I just described above, none of it was conveyed in that scene.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At first I thought that including Lando would be too much nostalgia. Too many actors from the originals. But then I though my about how cool it would be to see that Han and Lando are still fast friends, with a slight mistrust of each other, that's always overcome when the stakes are high. I would have loved to see an old Lando, either still a bachelor going after the ladies, or even settled down, married to a woman of another species. They should have put Lando in, even if he was only in it for a few minutes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Define "count". We know that a squadron of Vader's elite Stormtroopers boarded the rebel ship. That's canon. In previous Star Wars licensed games, we learned that it was the 501st. Do you think that the team at Disney has rewritten the squadron name? Like, did they actually take the time to go through every single piece of Star Wars material, find anything that overlaps with the movies, and write a statement making it no longer true? Do you think that JJ Abrams would say, "No, that wasn't the 501st. That's not canon anymore. No no, it was the 502nd." This whole argument about "canon" is so stupid. The idea behind making anything outside of the movies and animated shows uncanon was that anything that doesn't make sense with the new story, like the Yuzon Vong, or Palpatine's clones, is not official, so that Disney doesn't have to cater to it. I don't think anyone actually had the idea in mind to erase aspects of the story that make perfect sense, that were expanded upon in other mediums, but that's all I keep seeing people saying any time anything interesting outside of the movies is brought up. But yes, one could argue that you are technically correct. Since Battlefront 2 is no longer canon, we can't officially state that the 501st (Vader's Fist) was the squadron that boarded the rebel ship in ANH. Instead, we'll just assume that it was some nameless, insignificant group of Stormtroopers with no backstory, and nothing interesting about them at all. That's way more fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, you're very confused. The Lightsaber in Force Awakens is blue. It was Anakin's Lightsaber, and then became Luke's Lightsaber when it was given to him by Obi-Wan. It was dropped off the bridge on Cloud City when Luke's hand was cut off by Vader in episode 5. Nobody knows how it was recovered, or how Maz got her hands on it. The green Lightsaber that the above comments are talking about was constructed by Luke between episodes 5 and 6. As far as we know, he still has it, and we'll see it in the next movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is probably gonna get buried and you won't see it, but I'll comment anyways. We have tested many strategies and have decided on what we believe is the best one: Every TH10 and TH9 hits their mirror. The bottom 2 TH9s also hit their -2. Everyone below TH9 hits their -2. The bottom 2 bases hit their mirrors and try to push everyone else up. Round 2 is cleanup. For a while, that involved me sending out clan mail with specific attack instructions. Now, people have started to understand how to count available attacks above and below them, and make the correct cleanup attack. We very rarely ever lose. We've lost 1 war out of the last 10 or 15 wars, and we lost via the tie-break percentage to a much tougher clan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Anyone who doesn't train has no business criticizing any training method. So if someone can't tell you their what their max lifts are (or at least give an estimate based on their programming), then there's no point in even listening to what they have to say. People who do train, but repeat the criticisms about crossfit stated in this article either have a motive (remember that lady's article last year bashing crossfit, while promoting her own fitness program, that got millions of hits), or they're just willingly ignorant about what crossfit really is. Either way, I have no time for them if they're not a part of my life. I don't give a shit what people on the internet think about anything. I have some friends that lift in regular gyms. Strong dudes. When I started crossfit, they made fun of me relentlessly. It was pretty easy to shut them up. I just went to the gym with them, followed their program (with perfect form on the lifts), lifted about as much as them (more than some, less than others), and when we were done for the day, I challenged them to a max strict pull-up challenge. They never made fun of crossfit around me again. In fact, one of them converted after I cleaned his 5x10 deadlift weight.</TEXT>

I think 3 stars is a long shot with a ground attack because your heroes are a bit low. Most people won't agree with me, but I would go for 2 stars in your situation. I would bring 2 golems, 2 pekkas, 2 witches, 8 wiz, 4 WBs, 9 hogs and 1 archer, with max wiz in the CC. Bring 2 heals, a rage and a jump. Lure the CC with a hog and drop a couple poisons on whatever comes out. Attack from the queen side. Drop the golems and then the wiz to make a funnel. Drop the WBs once you know they'll get through. Next comes the pekkas, BK, queen, witches and CC wiz. Rage them all inside, but try to avoid raging the witches. Use the jump to get them in the core. Send the hogs last. Use 1 heal on the bulk of the troops, and the other on the hogs. I've never failed to get a high percentage 2 star with this attack, and have surprised myself with a few 3 stars on max bases when I was around your lvl.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You probably won't see this reply, amongst the many that you've probably received, but on the off chance that you will, I feel compelled. If you enjoy the standard lifts, like the deadlift, there is nothing more exciting than the Olympic lifts. Like you, I thought that lifting would feel like a chore. Then I discovered that squatting, deadlifting, and pressing were awesome. But there's nothing like the clean, jerk, and specially the snatch. There's simply nothing like completing a heavy olympic lift. Look into the Olympic lifts. You won't regret it. Just make sure to take them very seriously.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. After the Arya incident, I'm taking everything at face value. I've put my tinfoil away for good. The two armies will battle, Ramsey will destroy Jon's army, killing 1 or 2 main characters, Little Finger will show up with the Knights of the Vale to save the day, and Ramsey will be eaten by 4 legged animals (wolves or his own dogs). That's what's gonna happen. The possible death(s) could be Tormond, Wun Wun (definitely gonna die), Davos, Little Finger, Beric (he did say he was going to fight the cold winds in the north), Thoros, the Hound, Bronze Royce. Edit: I forgot to add the Tri-Pod to the list of possible deaths. Brienne will survive because her story with Jamie isn't over, but Pod-the cock that was promised-Payne may not live through this battle. I think he will though, and he'll use Bronn's techniques to survive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Melisandre is going to burn Shireen to resurrect Jon. Stannis the Mannis is about to fight his battle on the frozen lake, and he's going to win. Ramsey has been tricked into thinking that Stannis has been killed, leading him to write the pink letter. Jon was killed shortly after receiving the letter at Castle Black. Mel and Shireen are at the castle. Mel is going read the letter, believe it to be true, realize that Jon is her Azor Ahai, and decide that she needs to resurrect him. She's a bit obsessed with burning people with King's blood, and she'll figure the only way to bring him back will be to burn Shireen. We've been told that Shireen is going to burn in the books. How else could this happen? Stannis is near Winterfel, with Mel and Shireen are at the wall. How could they meetup, and with a need to burn Shireen? I didn't think that book Stannis would burn his own daughter, and Mel wouldn't do it if Stannis was alive, but if she thinks he's dead, as stated by a certain pink letter... If this happens, it will put an interesting spin on Jon's resurrection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing worse than an ant bite? I was stung by fire coral on about 1/4 of my belly and it was excruciating. My lymph nodes in my groin, neck and armpits swelled up like baseballs. It burned so bad that when the guides poured boiling hot coffee on me to kill the spores, the burn from the liquid was a relief. 5hrs later I finally got some morpheme, but it was a long 5hrs. Mine also took about 2 months to stop oozing and go back to normal. So, was that not normal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're a fan of Stephen King, I highly recommend ready The Dark Tower series. It's amazing, and it also gives you a glimpse into his life at a very low point. He weaves a near death experience that he had himself into the novels, and it works so well. The book series is also being translated on film in a very unique way. They're currently filming the first movie and will also develop a tv show that will exist in the same universe, the first time this has ever been done on such a major scale (I'm not counting the Marvel universe as I don't think the show is up to the quality the movies portray). The first movie will star Edris Elba and Mathew Mconahey. I don't like the casting, but damn do I love those actors, so I'm sure they'll pull it off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Jack Reacher was a solid movie. It helped that Jai Courtney (apologies if I spelled his name wrong, on mobile and too lazy to look it up) and Tom Cruise had such great chemistry together, but I also appreciated the simplicity of the plot. The movie allows for Tom to be a badass, without a bunch of baggage. I hope that they keep the Reacher movie series simple and grounded. MI is where they can push things. These are two movie series that compliment each other well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but it's much easier to get out of a 1 year lease, than it is to gout out of a 25yr+ mortgage. The laws depend on your location, but it's usually very easy to find a tenant to take over your lease. When you buy, you then need to sell, which means paying an agent commission, property taxes etc. If you don't intend on staying in a place for at least 5yrs (10yrs is ideal), renting is the better option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Dothraki. Daenerys made Yara promise that the Ironborn would stop pillaging, reaving, raping etc. What about the Dothraki? That's more than there way of life, it's what they are. This question has been asked many times, and many people, including myself, assumed that Euron would meet Dany's fleet at sea and destroy a large chunk of her armada, including all of the Dothraki. Now that we're seeing Dothraki on Dragonstone, does anyone have any theories as to how they will do with this? Will they just ignore it, and all of the Dothraki will play nice? Or will their unruly methods be a plot point in season 7?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you ski or snowboard, and if so, where do you ride? I completely agree with your points, but I appreciated the realism. When you gain a lot of speed (especially on a snowboard) it's very difficult to maintain control. Also, losing altitude in the game is really frustrating, just like in real life. There's been so so many occasions where I've tried to reach a point in the back country, only to find myself below the point I wanted to go. This was something that frustrates me in real life, and also the game. Ya, the controls could be better, but I appreciate the realism.</TEXT>

He has become a millionaire many times over because of the fans that have paid to read ASOIAF. He owes it to us to finish the next fucking book already. Stop working on side projects! I'm done with optimism. I've known for years that he will die before the series is finished. All I've ever hoped for was TWOW, so that all the cliffhangers we were left with can be resolved. Nope. He'll die before releasing it. Forget ADOS, we'll never read TWOW written by GRRM in full. No fucking way. This will go down in history as the most notorious unfinished series of all time. That will be your legacy George. Not the books, the world you built, or the show that will live on long after you're gone. You will be remembered as the man who couldn't complete his signature story. I'm sorry to say, but the death of ASOIF will be mourned more than GRRM himself, and it's coming soon, unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When Bronn named Lollys Stokeworth's bastard son after Tyrion, Cersei sent Ser Balman Byrch to kill him. Thinking that Bronn was an unskilled cut-throat, Balman challenged him to a duel and chose to joust, figuring that jousting is a knight's skill and it would be an easy win. Bronn was smart and took out Balman's horse with his lance, instead of fighting "honourably". Bronn has made a career out of killing knights who are foolish enough to fight honourably. Seeing Bronn fight Dothraki was awesome. You could tell that he knew what kind of savagery the Dothraki would bring when he told Jamie to gtfo of there. No sly tricks we're going to cut it against them. Even knowing that, the move the Dothraki pulled in his charge against Bronn was fucking awesome. Dropping down below Bronn's swipe and cutting hit horse's leg off. Damn. That was the highlight of the episode for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. There were so many awesome details in this episode. I've been kinda disappointed by this season so far but this episode was stellar, and not just because the battle was sweet. It's the little things that made it great. Edit: "No one" (Syrio Forel confirmed FM in my head canon) "Chaos is a ladder". Nice touch. "Fewer". Davos remembers the Mannis. "I'm not a !... Thanks Podrick". Nice little reference to Podrick's constant, "yes Ser? .. My Lady?" In the books. "King Snow, isn't it? No, that doesn't sound right...". Davos knows what's up. King Targaryen sounds a bit better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If that happens, it would kinda fit with his arc of becoming more brutal, more like Tywin.  gt;"Tywin Lannister himself could have done no more," he had insisted one night to Blackheart, during his first year of exile. "There is where you're wrong," Myles Toyne had replied. "Lord Tywin would not have bothered with a search. He would have burned that town and every living creature in it. Men and boys, babes at the breast, noble knights and holy septons, pigs and whores, rats and rebels, he would have burned them all. However, while I do think Connington is going to murder some children, I don't think it will be Tommen. I think he's going to kill his own family.  gt;Amongst the prisoners were Ronnet's younger brother Raymund, his sister Alynne, and his natural son, a fierce red-haired boy they called Ronald Storm. All would make for useful hostages if and when Red Ronnet should return to try and take back the castle that his father had stolen. Connington ordered them confined to the west tower, under guard. The girl began to cry at that, and the bastard boy tried to bite the spearman closest to him. "Stop it, the both of you," he snapped at them. "No harm will come to any of you unless Red Ronnet proves an utter fool." Red Ronnet IS going to prove an utter fool, and his family will pay for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There definitely are people out there who are against the concept of transgenderism, whether that #8217;s because they don #8217;t believe it exists, or they just don #8217;t like it. When I read your comment, that #8217;s who I imagine it #8217;s directed at. However, there are a lot of people out there who have no problem with trans people, but do have a problem with laws that can punish you for misgendering someone (like we have in Canada). Furthermore, saying something like,  #8220;I #8217;ll call you whatever pronoun you ask me to, but I #8217;m against any laws that require me to do so under threat of prosecution if I don #8217;t #8221;, is often met with the response of...  #8220;NAZI! #8221;. This makes any conversation on the topic impossible, and I think it #8217;s making things worse for trans people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it takes around 28days, as that is the waiting period before processing begins. Mine just showed up in the system on April 30. It was sent on March 14, arrived on March 17 (express mail), and was  #8220;received #8221; on March 28. So there was an 11 day delay before they opened the mail. The waiting period then kicked in which took about the suggested 28 days. Based on what I #8217;ve read, I #8217;m expecting about another month before I have the physical license. They should mention on their website that your application won #8217;t show up online until after the waiting period. That would probably reduce the calls they get.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The office in Mirimachi does the initial application processing, which I believe includes background checks and the scanning of the license picture. All of the information gets entered into their system, which is then sent to the CFO in your province. The CFO does a background check and final approval before your license is printed and mailed to you from there. That #8217;s what I was told by the CFP staff in Mirimachi, though I may be wrong about background checks being done in both places. The key part of this for BC residents right now is that the BC CFO is apparently very backlogged right now. So once it gets to them, there #8217;s about 4-6 weeks wait, instead of 2-4 weeks like usual.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s always the possibility that he #8217;s lying to them, but I doubt it. Regarding the publisher agreeing to hold off until season 8, I suppose that #8217;s possible now that it #8217;s close, but I think they would sell just as many (or more) copies by releasing it now with a massive Christmas marking campaign, and a second marketing push next year for the start of season 8. Nobody hits pause on that kind of cash if it #8217;s available immediately. I understand why people have this theory. We all want to believe we #8217;ll get this book in the next year or 2. However, I think if George had the book done, he would release it solely for the sake of shutting up the  #8220;FINISH THE BOOK #8221; twitter trolls.</TEXT>

You #8217;re right, the problems are probably exclusive to plot issues and rewrites of Winds. In fact, I believe that George is struggling with Winds because he knows it will be he last book, and needs to have some kind of  #8220;ending #8221;. I question the people that think there is even a slight possibility that ADOS will be released. I would be surprised if George writes even a single word of that book.

    <TEXT>The last paragraph of your comment is gonna have consequences in the time it takes to get your license. Most likely between 6-9 months for a decision, but it could be a year or more. A friend of mine in Ontario answered yes to a question for similar reasons, and his license took over a year. However, I #8217;ve heard Alberta typically has shorter wait times, so you may get lucky.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re only at 70 days. Many people who answered all  #8220;no #8221; have reported waiting a lot longer. There #8217;s no harm in continuing to call. Offer to send a doctors note.

Let #8217;s say that Brandon is Domeric #8217;s father. That isn #8217;t going to matter (based on my definition of the word) as it #8217;s never going to impact anyone or any event in the story. However, it does change our interpretation of events, and how we react to them, which is great. It just doesn #8217;t matter in terms of actual story direction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Call the Alberta CFO. You #8217;ll need to go through The main CFP line: 1-800-731-4000. Ask them about the status of your application. They will tell you that it #8217;s completed initial processing and is with the Alberta CFO. Ask to be transferred to the Alberta CFO. They #8217;ll do it no problem. Once you speak with the CFO, you #8217;ll find out if anything is amiss. Most likely they will tell you everything looks good, but the process of calling them will bump your application to the top of the pile and speed up the process. The CFP person I spoke with said it would be an additional 2-4 weeks. I got transferred to the CFO, spoke with them for 5min, and the next day my license was mailed out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I highly recommend a Canik TP9SF for your first pistol. https://www.cabelas.ca/product/110153/canik-tp9sf-semi-auto-9mm-pistol It #8217;s an incredibly high quality gun for the price. Also, it feels great. The size and weight is just right, and the trigger is fantastic for a stock trigger. I #8217;ve only put about 500 rounds through mine, so it #8217;s still new, but if you have any doubt about the reliability, watch this ridiculous video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mfUP75Je-IM Edit: I should mention that I am a new shooter, and have only fired about 10 handguns, and a total of about 2000 rounds, but I do love my Canik.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice is to be patient. Believe me, I understand why you #8217;re stoked. Once you register for the course, it #8217;s pretty much all you think about. I #8217;ve been there. Keep in mind, you have a lot of waiting to do. There #8217;s the waiting to do the course, then there #8217;s waiting to submit the application, then there #8217;s waiting to see it appear online, then there #8217;s waiting for approval, then there #8217;s waiting for the license to arrive. If everything goes perfectly, you have a few months to wait before you even get your license. Then you need to buy your first restricted, then there #8217;s more waiting for your transfer to be approved, then there #8217;s waiting for your ATT. By all means, do as much research and learning as makes you happy, but just remember that there #8217;s a lot of waiting involved. Go do some drop-ins at a local range in the meantime. It #8217;ll help to scratch the itch, and you #8217;ll develop preferences that will assist in those crucial first few purchases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I assume it #8217;s ok to pull the trigger on a snap cap? I remember when I bought my first .22LR, I asked for snap caps, but they gave me fake plastic rounds. I pulled the trigger on one and it broke apart in in the chamber/barrel of my gun. Took me an hour and some extra small tweezers to get all the debris out. Was not impressed. I enjoy practicing and teaching my girlfriend how to cycle actions with snap caps. Hope it #8217;s not detrimental to the gun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The description of  #8220;the workers control the means of production #8221; seems like it was written 100+ years ago (I assume it was?) because it just doesn #8217;t make sense to me in a modern world. It sounds like you #8217;re describing a farm or a factory where people are the primary source of energy to produce goods. With farming and factories being almost completely autonomous, what would the  #8220;workers #8221; actually do in a socialist society? Also, if everyone needs to be trained and educated on all of the more complex roles, in order to allow for informed  #8220;voting #8221; on company decisions, who does the shitty jobs? If you have 2 people at an engineering firm with equal knowledge of the industry they work in, who does the engineering work, and who cleans the toilettes? I can #8217;t wrap my mind around true socialism. I feel like a more realistic utopia would be Star Trek #8217;s society: everything is automated, everything is autonomous, all needs are provided for and nobody  #8220;works #8221;. We all just play the trombone and come up with cool ways to sit in chairs while wearing silk robes n shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What would be an example of a  #8220;fair #8221; distribution of stock amongst employees? Is it even, or would it be based on skills, experience, etc? I #8217;m assuming there would need to be a governing body that enforced the distribution to ensure that all companies adhere to the mandated percentages? What about the initial investment to start the business? Does that affect the distribution of ownership? For example, my friend owns a small wine touring company. It #8217;s basically a half dozen vans driving people from winery to winery. In order to start the business, she needed to take out a small business loan and combine it with her savings to buy the vans, build a website, buy some advertising and hire drivers. She put every dollar she had into the business. Do the drivers she hired get to own an equal share of the company? Furthermore, what happens when the company expands? She wants to buy 6 more vans and hire 6 more drivers. Does that mean that my friend and the first 6 drivers get their shares split in half to accommodate the new hires? In this system, why would anyone start a business? Why put up your own money or take out loans. Why take on the risk when you can just get a low skill job and still own part of the business? There are currently 28 million small business owners in the US. Can you imagine convincing them to give up ownership of their companies? That #8217;s why real socialism will never happen. You would need armed intervention to take the business by force. I like my Star Trek idea better.</TEXT>

Nothing specific in the footage swayed me, but I just needed a reminder that a 1911 should be in 45acp. Edit: unfortunately non of my local shops have a Norinco 1911 in anything other that 9mm or .22.</TEXT>

I #8217;m gonna order new magazines cause the stock ones don #8217;t seem very smooth. I thought that the magazine, or the way I loaded the rounds was the issue, until I had a guy watch me shoot it. He told me that the spring is so high tension, that it #8217;s actually bouncing back, and catching the casing before it ejects. It sounded unlikely, but it kinda makes sense, because the casings are ejecting all over the place. One flew straight back and hit me in the forehead. Apparently it #8217;s because the ones that do eject, get clipped by the slide on its way backX and throws it off course. Hopefully new magazines and a new spring will solve the issue.</TEXT>

If Illyrio #8217;s staff in his Manse is the only evidence we have of a slave trade in Pentos, I don #8217;t think it deserves to be yellow.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good to know. I wasn #8217;t sure if it was explicitly stated anywhere, or if all the info we had on slaving in Pentos came from Tyrion #8217;s time in Illyrio #8217;s Manse. I wonder how much Pentos will be involved in the story moving forward. The Tattered Prince has been promised Pentos by Barristan, which always seemed very strange to me.</TEXT>

If you even need to be asking this question, get the fuck out. It #8217;s not worth it. I would give almost anything to go back and not enter into the relationship that has destroyed my life.

    <TEXT>Not really. AFFC was released in 2005. At that time, much of ADWD had already been written. That #8217;s why George said it would be out the following year. So if we #8217;re being generous, and say he only wrote ADWD content for a year before releasing AFFC, that means that he was writing ADWD 14 years ago. Unfortunately, he never finished it. The first bit of TWOW is just the ending of ADWD, which is the same book as AFFC, considering the location split. Therefore, in the past 18 years since the release of ASOS, we #8217;ve gotten 3/4 of one book in the main story line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the record, I don #8217;t support Trump. I #8217;m Canadian and extremely left leaning. I support gender equality, trans rights, gay rights, aboriginal rights etc. I think the concept of free healthcare and free education is so insanely obvious that it literally hurts me physically to know that there are people out that who don #8217;t feel that way lol. But dude, just read your comment that I replied to, and your response to me. They don #8217;t add up! Your response to my comment states specific transgressions that upset you. Great! Fantastic! Those can be discussed and fact checked. They can be debated and dissected. I #8217;m not saying that every internet comment needs to be fucking perfect, and maybe nitpicking your comment is a mistake, cause maybe you were just being edgy online. However, taken literally, your comment is insane. Trump, and his supporters, are nothing like nazis. Frankly, I find it to be a pathetic suggestion. Like, are you fucking serious? Cause if you #8217;re not, ok, fine, make edgy internet comments. But if you actually believe that, and feel that it #8217;s a legit comparison, congratulations, you played yourself. There #8217;s a reason that the whole  #8220;libtard #8221; meme exists. People who are otherwise intelligent, thoughtful individuals get so caught up in hating trump that they make insane, asinine arguments, and guess what? It fuels the far right #8217;s claims that they #8217;re detractors are complete idiots. So make a choice: stop saying stupid shit, and in turn, supporting the very people you oppose by validating their preconceived notions of the idiocy of the left. Or, make legit arguments to support your beliefs. Edit: sorry if that came across as aggressive. I shouldn #8217;t be such a dick. I just really think that the people who are against trump in the US are doing a bad job of making their point. I just wish somebody could come along to take the reigns, and lead the opposition effectively, cause unfortunately, the current talking points of the opposition aren #8217;t going to work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I #8217;ve read and heard, it seems like Greg Glassman (founder of CrossFit) decided that he doesn #8217;t want CrossFit to be an event company, or a media company. So they are no longer producing the coverage of the open or hosting regionals. They are now opening the ability for 3rd party companies to host  #8220;sanctioned #8221; CrossFit events, which they have been very aggressively against in the last. Think about it like the opposite of RedBull, which was a drink manufacturer that sponsored sporting events, until one day, they woke up and realized that they are in fact a media company. CrossFit, on the other hand, makes a bunch of money from affiliates and courses, but hasn #8217;t been able to find profit in its media arm. So, they gave up and are gonna let other people take over that portion. Overall, it probably a good idea, but if this open announcement is any indication, they don #8217;t really have a plan in place. Another good comparison is UFC, which is now on ESPN. This is HUGE for that sport. They don #8217;t need to focus on PPV for all their main events, and instead can rely on the worlds biggest sporting media company. CrossFit better pray that somebody comes along and picks up the pieces of their media and event wings, cause if nobody does, we may see the end of CrossFit as a competition.</TEXT>

I #8217;m really hoping that maybe they will resolve the White Walker story line within 3 episodes, and the rest of the season will be about the characters fighting to pick up the pieces and sit on the thrown of ashes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would agree with that assessment. I think part of the reason is that the night king and white walkers have no character at all. We don #8217;t know their motivations, their strategy, their fears. Think back to the battle of the blackwater. Part of the reason it was amazing was that we had vested interest in both sides. I wanted to see Stanis take the thrown, but that would mean death for Tyrion. I still couldn #8217;t tell you for certain who I wanted to win. This epic battle for Winterfell may be the biggest battle ever filmed, but it will just the standard  #8216;good vs evil #8217; trope. The heroes are all teaming up to fight a mindless horde of zombies. It #8217;s unfortunate in my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really? Think back to the battle of the blackwater, when we were fully vested in the interests of both sides. We knew the motivations and fears of both sides. We understood what drove Stanis and what drove Tyrion. We got to see these complex characters challenge themselves and others. Would you rather see that? Or a standard  #8216;good vs evil #8217; trope with mindless villains who have zero character?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely disagree. How many pages in the books are devoted to the White Walkers? How many pages are devoted to magic or dragon battles? Maybe 0.1%? Just because these things exist in the world that the story takes place in doesn #8217;t mean that they represent the main theme. Edit: Also,  #8220;a disjointed narrative of random events #8221; is probably the most inaccurate description of ASOIAF I #8217;ve ever read. The White Walkers have had zero impact on the rest of the story in the books so far. They are definitely not the theme connecting all of the plot points together.</TEXT>

Suggesting that perhaps some experience between being a waitress and a congresswomen is a good idea is different than mocking someone for having been a waitress at all. Though, like I said in my reply to the other comment, it does substantiate the claim. You can call this  #8220;concern trolling #8221; if you want, and it #8217;s actually the first time I #8217;ve ever engaged in a discussion on this topic, and will likely be the last.

    <TEXT>I found a toonie ($2 coin in Canada) on the road that had been flattened by something. Not sure what could have done that to a coin, but it was about half the thickness of a normal toonie. Brought it to school and tried to spend it in the cafeteria, but they wouldn #8217;t take it. I saw my 9th grade science teacher and offered him a deal.  #8220;I #8217;ll trade you a toonie for a loonie ($1 coin) #8221;, I said, but didn #8217;t show him the coin. He agreed and I grabbed his loonie, gave him the thin toonie, and walked away. The next day I get called into the principal #8217;s office where my 9th grade science teacher and the principal accuse me of money forgery. They said that I obviously had sawed the toonie in half, length wise. In other words, 2 adults, including a science teacher, claimed that I was in possession of some sort of laser saw capable of cutting a toonie clean in half, and my grand scheme to make money from this, was to saw toonies in half, and trade each half... for a loonie. They threatened to call the police. I called their bluff and ended up getting detention for  #8220;lying #8221;. I still get mad thinking about this. Screw you Mr. Plus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely an interesting thought. I actually see a lot of what I would consider to be physical therapy happening at the affiliate I workout at. Coaches are helping people with mobility issues and nagging injuries all the time. However, they are not licensed physical therapists. They #8217;re fit people who did a $1K weekend course and now teach people how to squat. Insurance companies care about the accreditation of the therapist more so than where they work. I think getting enough licensed therapists into a box would be difficult, and not likely as a brand direction. Yes, I think that if insurance companies started paying for CrossFit memberships, more people would join, which would lead to more boxes. I just don #8217;t see insurance companies agreeing to that, especially with CrossFit #8217;s reputation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t care what colour they are (I #8217;m not saying you do), but I would bet anything that there are no father figures in the lives of these young men. When a young man has a stable father figure in their life, who is responsible, reliable, and a an active participant in their upbringing, this type of garbage doesn #8217;t happen. My father never hit me, but I know for sure, if I ever did something this horrible, he would have smacked the shit out of me. It #8217;s not the fear of that consequence that builds character. It #8217;s the respect a young man has for the man that raised him. Edit: There are countless people in this world who have been raised by single mothers, or female couples, who are great people. Perhaps my language was a bit too strict. That being said, having a respectable male role model is statistically a significant benefit to young men. There are countless studies that prove this. I #8217;ve linked one below, but I #8217;m happy to provide more. Look, I #8217;m not trying to say that women can #8217;t raise wonderful men. There #8217;s a LOT of evidence to the contrary. There are countless men in this world who were raised by single mothers who turned out great. All I #8217;m saying is that young men do significantly benefit from having a strong male role model. We just do. There is nothing sexist about stating that young men do better with positive male role models. It #8217;s the truth, and it #8217;s a GOOD thing. I #8217;m actually quite surprised by how many messages I #8217;ve received calling me sexist, racist, nazi, bigot, etc. Just because I stated that young men who have positive father figures in their lives typically don #8217;t act like horrible people. Is that such a crazy statement when every study and every bit of data ever collected backs it up? https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php?option=com_dailyplanetblog amp;view=entry amp;category=industry%20news amp;id=54:father-absent-homes-implications-for-criminal-justice-and-mental-health-professionals</TEXT>

However, he did teach me to treat people with respect. He taught me to respect myself as well. Multiple times growing up I was able to witness him defuse tense situations with reason, respect, and empathy. I learned that violence is not the answer, but I also understand the importance of strength, when necessary. These are lessons that a young man MUST learn from a male role model. It doesn #8217;t need to be his dad, or even a single man, but it must be learned from elder male role model(s). Edit: evil like this is never common, when fathers are present.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t say it was an excuse. Also, the comment I replied to mentioned race, but my comment, the one you replied to, literally dismisses race as a factor. I was taking about a lack of father figures in young men #8217;s upbringings. If you connect race to that comment (especially when I specifically dismissed it), I think YOU are the one who #8217;s racist here. Why do you assume absent fathers is a race issue? Racist much? Back to the original point, no, the cause of an action does not excuse the action. Drug addiction is also a cause of violent crime. Stating that fact doesn #8217;t excuse the crime. It #8217;s just stating a cause.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, there are good people with bad/no fathers, and there are bad people with good fathers. Furthermore, father figures, or a lack thereof, are not a direct indication of a child #8217;s likelihood to participate in shitty behaviour. There are a lot of really great people raised by singles moms in this world. However, every study ever done, every bit of data ever collected, has concluded that a lack of a father figure increases the likelihood of criminal and violent behaviour by a significant percentage. It #8217;s irrefutable. Perhaps it #8217;s not a good idea to jump to a conclusion, like I did with this case, but, the sad fact remains: I #8217;m probably right. The odds are drastically in my favour, unfortunately. Less fathers = more crime committed by young men. Fact. https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php?option=com_dailyplanetblog amp;view=entry amp;category=industry%20news amp;id=54:father-absent-homes-implications-for-criminal-justice-and-mental-health-professionals</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are countless people in this world who have been raised by single mothers, or female couples, who are great people. Perhaps my language was a bit too strict. That being said, having a respectable male role model is statistically a significant benefit to young men. There are countless studies that prove this. I #8217;ve linked one below, but I #8217;m happy to provide more. Look, I #8217;m not trying to say that women can #8217;t raise wonderful men. There #8217;s a LOT of evidence to the contrary. All I #8217;m saying is that young men do significantly benefit from having a strong male role model. We just do. There is nothing sexist about stating that young men do better with positive male role models. It #8217;s the truth, and it #8217;s a GOOD thing. https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php?option=com_dailyplanetblog amp;view=entry amp;category=industry%20news amp;id=54:father-absent-homes-implications-for-criminal-justice-and-mental-health-professionals</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Many other people have messaged me saying something similar, and I completely understand. There are countless men in this world, raised by 1 or more women, who are wonderful people. There are also many men in this world who had wonderful fathers, who turned out to be shitty people. There #8217;s no perfect formula to raising young men who are empathetic, intelligent, and compassionate (traits that clearly the young men in the video do not possess). However, studies have shown, time and time again, that there is no better indicator to determine a young man #8217;s trajectory in life than the presence of a strong male role model. I #8217;ve linked one such study below, but I #8217;m happy to provide more, if you would like. Young men do better when they have positive male role models in their lives. That shouldn #8217;t be either surprising, or controversial. It #8217;s just common sense. https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php?option=com_dailyplanetblog amp;view=entry amp;category=industry%20news amp;id=54:father-absent-homes-implications-for-criminal-justice-and-mental-health-professionals</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All of that hard work that you do means that your son gets to go to a good school, where he very likely interacts with positive male role models. Studies show that male teachers are much more common at private schools than public (article linked below, but it #8217;s about the UK, because that data is more closely tracked in the UK and Canada than the US, though I would wager that the difference is bigger in the US). Young men benefit IMMENSELY from positive male role models, just like young women benefit from positive female role models. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/oct/21/independent-schools-men-women-teachers-career-options</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m typically very pessimistic when it comes to his progress, however, I think there at a lot of signs that we may be getting some very good news very soon. Possibly around the series finale. I #8217;ve noticed that George #8217;s language has recently changed. He used to say,  #8220;I #8217;m working on TWOW #8221;. Now he says,  #8220;I #8217;m working on the books #8221;. He #8217;s stated in the past that once he finished TWOW, he would jump immediately into ADOS. The recent headshot he posted on Twitter is a perfect author photo for the jacket of a hardcover. He seems to be in a much better mood these days. He #8217;s booking Cons again. He #8217;s at TitanCon (I think that #8217;s what it #8217;s called) this summer. There #8217;s talk of him appearing on football podcasts. I think he #8217;s done.

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t understand why they don #8217;t give her a badass suit of armour. It must have come up in conversation in the writers room. It would make a lot of sense in the story as well. Since there #8217;s arrows being shot at her when she rides into battle. Imagine if she was wearing a badass suit of white and red armour (black and red wouldn #8217;t show well against drogon). Fans would freak out! Everyone would love it. I just don #8217;t understand why they don #8217;t give her armour! I know they want to show her hair, but I think it would be so cool I they gave her a sleek dragon half helm as well. It just seems so obvious to me. I don #8217;t get it. Edit: I understand that there are plausible plot justifications for her not wearing armour: her arrogance, her pride, etc. What I #8217;m questioning is the producers, writers, and costume designers #8217; decision. Option A: Give her a badass suit of white and red battle armour. Everyone loves it, nobody questions it (cause it makes sense), and it makes for AMAZING marketing pics. Option B: Put her in a fur coat. It doesn #8217;t make sense (unless people insert plot arguments unstated by the actual show), it looks kinda blah, and gets nobody excited.

They just as easily could have put a badass suite of armour on her at the start of season 7, and everyone would have loved it. Let #8217;s go with the justification that she was arrogant. Is she still arrogant? Two of her dragons have been hit with projectiles, and one of them died. Drogon also had to make a tight turn to shield her from arrows in the field of fire battle. How arrogant could she be to still not wear armour? Literally everyone else is lol. That justification won #8217;t work anymore. Now, if she flys into battle in a fur coat, we #8217;ll have to accept that it #8217;s just a very strange writers decision.</TEXT>

With all that being said, if Danny is flying around a few hundred feet above the ground, at like 30mphr, and she #8217;s just wearing her white fur coat, with her face and ears exposed, she should be ready to have those ears and nose cut off when the battle #8217;s done.

    <TEXT>The most interesting thing about Midway to me is the often ignored Japanese perspective. Most documentaries present the events in a way that make the Japanese look insanely incompetent and stupid, because the audience has the benefit of hindsight. I would love a Midway movie that shows the Japanese perspective, but looking at the cast and director, I doubt that wi happen. It #8217;ll probably just be a standard Good vs Evil story with lots of explosions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Almost non of them would qualify for refugee status. They are not fleeing war, they are seeking economic improvement (as would I in their shoes). So the question then is, do you change the refugee requirements to be basically anyone who wants to live in a  #8220;better #8221; country? If you don #8217;t do that, what would you do with 130,000 people per month who don #8217;t qualify as refugees? Send them back to Mexico? They #8217;ll end up in mass camps in boarder towns. Eventually they #8217;ll storm the border. Edit: this is already happening. This has to stop. I don #8217;t care who the president is, this has got to stop. 140,000 per month (and that #8217;s just who they caught) is absolutely impossible to manage. https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/arrests-along-mexico-border-surged-again-in-may-blowing-past-breaking-point/2019/06/05/6d21585e-87a7-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know what the answer is, but I do know that processing them, in some way, is an absolute must. Just letting 140K+ per month (and that #8217;s just who they caught) over the boarder to live on the street will cause complete chaos. What would happen to the US boarder towns? Every single humanitarian service would collapse, almost immediately. You could be looking at an actual collapse of the US economy. It #8217;s impossible to just let that many people in with no plan on what to do with them. So yes, then need to be kept somewhere and processed, which is what is happening. https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/arrests-along-mexico-border-surged-again-in-may-blowing-past-breaking-point/2019/06/05/6d21585e-87a7-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html The most annoying this about all of this is that any other president would be doing the EXACT same thing, and none of you would care. Obama did it. Did you care then? Every single president has said that the boarder needs to be secure. Why do you care now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So what do you do with the 140,000+ people per month? Do you not process them in some way? Collect data, process their refugee claim? Make a plan for where they should go and where they should live? Or do you just let 140,000+ people flood into the streets of border towns, with no processing? I assume the answer to that is no, so then where do you put them while you process that insane amount of people? You can call it a  #8220;concentration camp #8221; if you want, but it doesn #8217;t change the fact that they need to go somewhere while they are processed, and a plan is made for where to put them. Also, there is a LOT of human trafficking happening at the US border. Recent studies showed that 25% of children weren #8217;t actually the children of the people claiming to be their parents.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This happened a few years ago, but I thought it would be perfect for this sub. My girlfriend was helping to organize a local charity walk, and asked me if I would volunteer to be a route guide. All I had to do was stand on a street corner and make sure that people doing the walk turned right at that intersection. They gave me a yellow vest and left me at the corner. It was 8am on a Saturday and the first charity walkers would take about 30min to get to my corner. So I got a coffee, and stood there, waiting. Unfortunately I didn #8217;t think ahead and bring a chair. I was standing on the corner for maybe 5min when this guy comes out of his house and walks over to me. Guy:  #8220;Are you here about the intersection?! #8221; Me:  #8220;No, I #8217;m volunteering for a charity walk #8221; Guy:  #8220;You #8217;re with the city. You need to tell them to put in a roundabout! #8221; Me:  #8220;Sorry but I don #8217;t work for the city, I #8217;m just volunteering for a... #8221; Guy:  #8220;You #8217;re wearing a vest. You work for the city. You #8217;re here to investigate the intersection. #8221; (He didn #8217;t say any of this like it was a question, he was stating it like a fact) Me:  #8220;Dude, I don #8217;t know what to tell you but I don #8217;t work for the city and I #8217;m just here to help with the charity walk. #8221; Guy (angry now):  #8220;What charity walk?! #8221; He says as he spreads his arms out, showing how there are no people around.  #8220;I know you #8217;re here for the intersection, and it #8217;s about damn time! I get cars on my lawn every week. We need a roundabout! #8221; Me:  #8220;The charity walk that will be here in 20min. I #8217;m a route guide for a charity. I don #8217;t work for the city. Im just making sure that people turn right here. #8221; Guy:  #8220;You wouldn #8217;t need a vest for that! Why would you be wearing a vest if you #8217;re not with the city?! You need to tell them to put in a roundabout. That #8217;s your job! #8221; Me:  #8220;Alright dude, I #8217;ll tell them. No problem. #8221; Guy:  #8220;There, was that so hard? #8221; He storms off back into his house. 20min later the charity walkers start arriving. One thing I should mention is that this charity walk was for children with pretty severe disabilities, so mixed in with the crowd were a lot of wheelchairs and walkers and other mobility assistance vehicles. I give a few high fives and tell a few people to turn right before this guy comes storming back out. Guy:  #8220;You can #8217;t let these kids cross here! They #8217;re disabled and with no roundabout, it #8217;s dangerous! How could the city allow this?! #8221; A few of the parents and volunteers were caught off guard and give this guy a weird look. Also, in the 45min I #8217;d been there, maybe 10 cars had gone down his residential street. Me:  #8220;I don #8217;t work for the city, and the kids seem to be doing just fine crossing the street. #8221; Guy:  #8220;I don #8217;t care, you need to tell the city that we need a roundabout here! #8221; One of the people on the walk:  #8220;Why don #8217;t you write the city a letter then? #8221; The guy storms off and I figured that would be the end of it, but nope, 10min later he comes back with a letter in hand, signed by him and his wife (I assume). Guy:  #8220;Here! Give this to your boss. #8221; Me:  #8220;Okay, no problem, will do. #8221; I don #8217;t remember what I did with the letter. I probably threw it out, but the best part is that about 6 months later, that intersection had a roundabout. Sometimes I wonder if that guy thinks it was my doing. TLDR: Wore a vest at a street corner. Couldn #8217;t convince a guy that I didn #8217;t work for the city.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think anyone here disagrees with your points. You said,  #8220;In addition to normal gun safety rules... #8221; and then went on to state very normal gun safety rules. Not crossing the firing line, and not letting beginners freely handle multiple guns are very normal rules that are probably obvious to 99% of this sub. The reason that nobody else pointed these things out is because they probably didn #8217;t think such obvious statements were necessary. I found your  #8220;multiple people with guns #8221; comment to be very strange, because how else would you introduce people to the sport and teach them basic safety rules. We want this sport/hobby to grow in Canada, and I doubt that #8217;s going to happen if having a license is a prerequisite to even being introduced to it. Most people go shooting with friends. That #8217;s how I got into this, and I bet that #8217;s how most people in this sub did. Nothing wrong with reminding people of safety procedures, so you #8217;re all good dude. Just wanted to point out why you were probably the only person doing it. I still think the  #8220;multiple people #8221; comment is probably why you caught that downvote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear what you #8217;re saying, but it still doesn #8217;t seem to make sense to me. I feel like I must be missing something. Some crucial aspect of the game that I #8217;ve overlooked by skipping the cinematics maybe? For example, one of, if not the very first challenge in the game is  #8220;destroy 30 flood lights #8221;. I would assume that the first challenge is achievable pretty quickly. However, I #8217;ve dropped 20+ hours into this game and I can #8217;t even come close to completing that challenge. Not even remotely close. I may find 1 or 2 abandoned ships in a run and destroy maybe 10 lights. If I try to go for more, the only way is to shoot a light on a ship. As soon as I do that, I #8217;m instantly killed. I must be missing something. I #8217;m making 0 progress. It #8217;s embarrassing to admit, but I can #8217;t figure it out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you actually believe that 33% of Americans are as bad as Nazis? Even if you do, which is insane, where does this go? What #8217;s the end goal here? If you just write off 1/3 of the country as not worthy of discussion, what #8217;s gonna happen to them? They #8217;ll never change their minds to whatever you want them to believe if you don #8217;t talk to them, so do they just get cast out? It seems like a recipe for conflict. Also, you #8217;ll never be able to control the definition of nazi, or  #8220;red cap #8221; or whatever you call these people. I #8217;ve seen people called nazis because they support lower taxes. It doesn #8217;t matter if you agree with that or not, all it takes is one person to label someone a nazi, and boom, they #8217;re unpersoned. Have you heard of the black guy who converted a bunch of KKK members by sitting down and talking to them? Don #8217;t you think that #8217;s a better path forward than this road to conflict we seem to be on?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Feast was released in 2005, and at the time, it was the 4th book in a popular, but mostly unknown series. I doubt that the concept of pre-buying domain names was even a thought at the time for publishers, never mind fora book that would be not much more anticipated than the average release at the time. Now it's 2020, and Winds may be the most anticipated book of all time. It will probably outsell everything but maybe the bible. The publisher will definitely be buying up domain names.</TEXT>

I don #8217;t agree, since I think that Spanish isn #8217;t the only accent people are aware of, but it would have been a logical answer. Instead, you called me ignorant af (in a sub literally called NoStupidQuestion) and claimed I said that Indian, Chinese, and African are languages, which I didn #8217;t even say. Once it was clear that you were wrong in that point, you switched it up and claimed that I called Africa a country, which I also didn #8217;t say.

    <TEXT>Nothing in your comment is incorrect, which makes it even more sad that it was all a complete waste of time. This kata focused style of Kenjutsu has been proven to have literally zero benefit to actual combat, and even a beginner level fencer with a few weeks of training could beat him without breaking a sweat. Yoshio was big into aikido as well. It #8217;s all very sad, but it was only a matter of time before it was all exposed to be completely and utterly useless.

Not every comment on reddit is an argument. I was really into Kung fu movies when I was a kid. I also thought Aikido was awesome and even did a few classes. For that reason, it broke my heart when I learned it was all fake. So when I see videos like this, it makes me sad. Most people who see these types of videos actually believe that there is some practical usage to these traditional, mostly kata focused martial arts. Unfortunately there isn #8217;t. As an visual art form or a type of dance, sure, but there is no practical combat application, even though many people think there is. It makes me sad is all. It #8217;s like learning that Santa Clause isn #8217;t real.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wasn #8217;t sad because movie martial arts is choreographed, I was sad because I didn #8217;t know that most traditional martial arts are completely fake. Most people still don #8217;t realize this. Even Bruce Lee, who did a lot of great things for Asian film representation and bringing martial arts to the west, wasn #8217;t a real fighter. It was all fake. The 1 inch punch was a trick he choreographed with his students. The one time he was challenged to do it with a real person, it had zero effect. He had 1 real fight than happened behind closed doors with only his students and his opponent #8217;s students to witness. It was a mess. There is footage of him hitting a punching bag, and it #8217;s sad, because it #8217;s clear he #8217;s never actually punched someone before. It #8217;s all fake and when I learned that, it made me sad, just like seeing this fake sword kata makes me sad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on a lot of factors; how busy Mirimachi is, how busy the provincial CFO is, how efficient the CFO is (some provinces are better than others, if they can get a hold of your references, etc. Mine took about 3 months. I have a friend who has been waiting for 4 months. With the current situation, and especially since they just shut down applications at Mirimachi, I honestly think that if you started today, you would be lucky to have a PAL in your hands before 2021.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Is this true? Was trump against closing the boarder between Canada and the US? I watched the press conference where trump was asked about this before the decision was made, and he clearly stated that it was was Canada #8217;s decision to make, and he didn #8217;t say anything to imply otherwise. Also, keeping the boarders open is significantly more important to Canada #8217;s economy that America #8217;s, and they #8217;re not at risk of us bringing the virus to them, based on the numbers. So did you just make this up? Was it intended as a joke, and if so, what was the punchline? If you #8217;re just flat out misrepresenting reality, or lying, about Trump, or this situation that we #8217;re in, how does that help anyone? It #8217;s shit like this that drives people to support trump. I heard that Trump likes oxygen. Are you gonna start holding your breath?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The worst part about this decision is that the main story arcs weren #8217;t even concluded in Dance. The Battle of Fire and the Battle of Ice were written many, many years ago, and were intended to be the climax of the Feast/Dance book. George left them out, along with other climaxes, such as Cersie #8217;s trial, because Dance was getting to be too many pages, and he figured that since he already had so much of Winds written, he could just cut it out, because Winds would be released very shortly after Dance. When you look at it this way, George hasn #8217;t released an actual completed book in the ASOIAF series since Storm was released in the year 2000.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;d have to do some digging, but George has stated that he intended to include the battles in Dance, and cut them last minute. However, knowing George, he #8217;s probably scrapped, and re-written them many times. They might not even be done right now lol. Regarding the Asha fragment, it #8217;s possible that George just opened WordStar for that clip, and that #8217;s the segment he happened to have open and was last working on. Based on his writing style, that #8217;s not an indication of whether that chapter had been written that week, or years earlier. I actually think that he had that part open on purpose, as he thought it would be a juicy bit for the fandom to theorize on.</TEXT>

It would be very annoying to see posts with titles like, GRRM #8217;s EDITOR ANNOUNCED THEY WILL HAVE THE BOOK PUBLISHED IN 3 MONTHS! Then, when you open the post, it #8217;s about a comment made in 2015, when GRRM #8217;s editor said that it would take 3 months to publish the book, once she had her hands on it. This sub is a place of pain and suffering. No reason to add to that pain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe there should be a higher authority? Like, what if the people in CHAZ voted for a leader, and then that leader could appoint a group of people to have the authority to enforce the rules? They could wear a uniform so that people would know who they are, and if people keep breaking the rules, these uniformed authorities could detain them and put them in a secluded place as punishment, and so that they couldn #8217;t break the rules and ruin things for everyone else. That sounds like a good system to me. It #8217;s amazing that nobody has tried it yet!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m so curious as to why George went from saying that he #8217;d be done Winds in 3 months back in October 2015, to now, when he says we might get it in 2021. I wonder if he realized that the only way to wrap this up in 7 books is to reintroduce the 5 year gap, but put it between Winds and Dream. A lot of the problems that were caused by the initial scrap of the 5 year gap could be resolved, and potentially allow for Dream to be the final book, instead of requiring book 8. Who knows what causes George to scrap content and rewrite, but its an interesting thought I had that I felt like sharing. Edit: said Dance when I meant Dream</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These people need to be taken off the streets. There needs to be a middle ground between jail, and free reign to terrorize large sections of our city. I know this would never happen, but I think they need to do an entire full sweep of the DTE. Send a task force in every day, and ANYONE caught carrying or using drugs is taken to a facility where they are processed to determine their history, mental health, level of addiction, etc. They are then forced into a detox program in a well funded, clean, safe, and fully staffed mental health facility before being released. This would cost a fortune, but I can't think of any other solution. Also, dealers should receive a minimum 25yr jail sentence.</TEXT>
