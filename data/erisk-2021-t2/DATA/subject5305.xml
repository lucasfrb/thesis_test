    <TEXT>I have bad anxiety and depression and cut myself for a long time. There was an old guy, a social worker who told me: "you should stop cutting yourself.

    <TEXT>Virginty. People (especially in america) still think that sex is an adult thing. No it's not. Teenagers have the desire and thats totally normal. Don't ignore it. Talk to them, tell them how to have save sex. Show them how to handle relationships which involves sex. And don't shame them if something goes wrong. Teenagers are sexual beings and are going to have sex if you like it or not</TEXT>

During the naziperiod a lot of her elders were nazis and very racist. They also shamed her for her non-german looks. My mother told me that. But my grandmother is a very modern woman for her time: she divorced my grandfather, raised my mother on her own and went with her friends to gay bars, when they came up in germany. And you'd expect an old german woman, who was born while war, would be racist but my mother married a english, mixed-race soldier (my father) and she loved him very much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello guys. I have 4 litle ratgirls and one of them, an albino, has clearly difficulties with her vision. Today i gave them some treats (this liquide-ish thing for cats, i don't know the english word) and i think she has mistaken my finger for food. She bit quite hard and i was bleeding. I'm not mad, of course but what can i do to let her understand, that it's my finger and not some food?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feeding snakes as a ratmum</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-12 11:34:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i just got the snakes from my brother due to problems in his living situation. We always help each other especially, when it's for the sake of our animals and it was clear, that i'll take them, if something unexpected happens, because we want to make sure, that all of our animals are fine. But as you may know, snakes are fed with rats and mice. I also have rats (of course they aren't in danger and are kept in a seperate room). So i don't know how to feel about this situation and how to handle it. Of course i know, that i have to feed the snakes at one point or another and they have the right to be fed, as any other of my animals and that they have this in their nature. My problems are my emotions. Is there somebody who was in this situation before? How would you handle that. Please keep in mind, that i'm a very emotional person, who loves all their animals, so comments like "just give them away" won't help. I need some serious advice</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay. We have a very nice person, from whom we get the mice and rats, who knows a lot about snakes. He breeds the mice and rats himself and puts them to sleep as well. We have 4 snakes. Two corn snakes (i don't know, if it's the correct english term), where i don't know the exact age but they are adults and 2 boa c.i, whom are not even a year. I am absolute new with snakes and have a lot to learn because it was very spontanious but i usually inform myself before i get a new pet, which i couldn't do much this time. I usually have mamals as pets. But thank you for the advice. I'll try to stay calm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i've seen a lot of animalvideos recently, where an animal is harmed. From the outside it seems cute but if you are informed properly, you know that they are in distress and as soon as someone points that out everybody is like: "Let people enjoy things! It's cute okay?!" Examples are: Rodens put into water or washed with soap or small animals like hamsters on a leash. And of course giving dangerous food, which humans can eat but are bad for those animals. It's okay if your first think, that it's cute and that the animal seems to enjoy it but why defend and support something after being told, that the situation is bad and harmful for the animal?</TEXT>

People gave already a lot of amazing advice but i don't think that anyone will judge you after exlpaining it. Maybe looking trough old history can give you more ideas. A lot of men wore long skirts and dress-like clothing in the old days. Japanese kimonos are a great example and can look very nice! I hope you stay strong even when people make bad comments</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For everyone who needs to cool their rats spontaneously: put a plate or tile in the fridge, wait until it has a good temperature (not to warm or to cold) than place it in the cage. It's perfect because your rat's can't get frostbite from ice or chew trough it, which makes it reusable. Or let them fish for food in a tub with belly high water, don't put too much water in it, that could lead to health problems. Anyways this idea is amazing.</TEXT>

The hardest part for me was accepting the fact that I gained 30 kilos due to depression and medication and that I became what people truly call fat. I always weighted around 67 kilos and thought that I was fat due to my social surroundings, which meant I never felt normal before. Anyways I lost 10 kilos am still going.

    <TEXT>My father left me as a very young girl and rejected me many times after that. Now I'm having the consequences as a young woman and I almost killed myself while battling depression and anxiety. I am currently experiencing a relapse and I just realised that I never met a woman or a person in general who got out of it and only people who have died because of it. Female advise would be very appreciated (because being rejected by the own father can have different affects depending on the sex) but feel free to comment anyways!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can tell her that she should and can get help and that you would support her. Don't pressure her. Say what ways there are to get better and tell her that she can talk to you. Go to a hospital and get it checked (infections can get dangerous and some of the cuts might have to be glued with some gluestrips). Search for some number you can call if she cuts herself too deep by accident and try to get professional advice. Stay calm! If you get nervous it won't help and could make the situation worse. Tell her she doesn't have to be afraid or ashamed. And if she cuts herself you may need at least some disinfectant or sterile natriumchloride (to wash out dirt from the wounds) for cleaing wounds and surfaces. The truth is: there is a high chance this will go on for a while so she should at least get the chance to do it as safely as possible. But remember: if you think she got worse, call an ambulance. It's not your responsibility and there are professionals out there</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some theories: Homosexuality has some benefits for society. For example: Homosexuals often raise children who don't have parents or parents who can't take care. That could mean that homosexual people took care of the family and children in the past because they weren't occupied with raising their own children, which means the whole family had a better chance of survival. Humans survived because we are social creatures and homosexuals could have helped with that. Studies also showed that homosexual men have a higher emotional intelligence than heterosexual men, which means they could act as social support for the group. Natural doesn't always mean reproduce but surviving and homosexuals could have helped with that and still do. There is a tedtalk that covers this topic and theories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's normal to have a phase where you question your sexuality. That doesn't mean you are gay. You say that you are attracted to girls so it's clear that you are not gay. Maybe a little bit bisexual or pansexual which most people are. Don't think about that dream too much. Some people had sex with a pet or family member in their dreams before. That doesn't mean they are attracted to them. Sometimes our brain just mixes our emotions together and creates random stuff. I can understand that you are afraid because you are questioning your identity and that normal and good. Maybe you feel weird by looking at men because you realised for the first time that they can be attractive but that also doesn't mean you have to be gay or attracted to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you enjoy it it's fine. Don't feel pressured to be attracted to somebody. That doesn't work. It might developed into a friendship and if you feel like you are attracted then maybe even a relationship. If you feel like you are leading them on say it. Say how you feel and tell them that you might need time so you don't have to worry. Your feelings are absolutely normal. There are people who need some time to get attracted to somebody because they find attractiveness more in the personality just like you said. That doesn't change the fact that you are bisexual because the situation you describe seems to be about timing not gender/sex of the other person. I hope I could help you a little bit</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Guys I'm really conflicted. I know that you shouldn't bathe rats for health reasons (like lunginfections) even when they might enjoy it. And nobody is calling that out. Don't people know this? I'm not trying to offend anyone. If your rat wants to bathe you should use a tub and fill is with warm (not hot) water until it reaches the underside of the belly without any shampoo. I also see some rats in emotional distress (not like this one) and nobody talks about it. We all love rats and I really want to talk about this topic without hate!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rats clean themselves and usually don't need a bath. You can wash them with a damp cloth so that they aren't wet if they are old or ill. Or a tub with belly high water and some noodles to fish for. Edit: normal ratpoo isn't very soft so normally it doesn't get caught in the fur in unhealthy amounts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends on the animals natural eating habits. Horses, for example, eat mostly weeds and are used to having a monotone diet. Dogs eat different things (not only meat) so you should try to mix it up from time to time. Cats eat small rodents like mice a lot so they should get something that resembles it like wet food with fitting nutrients (dry food can be dehydrating and not very healthy because they normally eat meat, not grain! Be careful) and don't need a big variety. So I guess you dog can get tired of their food but maybe because wet food has a lot of ingredients it's not like "only pasta for a month" and maybe like bread. We also give them treats and that makes maybe a difference</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think there is a big problem with racism on every side. Everyone against everyone. There where the offenders and the damage is obvious but I also think a big part of the problem is that minorities (not all of course!!!) often don't want to leave their roles as victims behind. You can see it with the n-word. It is a rude word, everybody knows that but to forbid if in every context is dumb. If I read a book out loud with the n-word I didn't meant to offend anyone, I'm reading a book. I am a woman but I don't tell you to stop saying bitch or whore even though woman were and are (for example India and africa) an oppressed and abused part of society. But the n-word is also more of an American thing. Also very funny when some unfriendly African American complains about white people even though americans and europeans, for example, have totally different cultures and europeans within have different cultures. It's totally ridiculous to put everybody in the same place. That's how racism is made. People in general need to befriend each other, meet each other and help each other. I'm mixes race, African American, German and native American and even I could be racist. But I don't want to put any race above or under one another. I also want to say that native Americans are still extremely oppressed in their own country and nobody talks about it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We were together for 2 1/2 years and he was/is a wonderful person and I always thought I would be too weak to go through breaking up with him. There were a lot if things that came together that lead me into ending our relationship. I don't hate him, he did nothing wrong but I guess he hasn't matured a lot in the last few years unlike me and things started to get difficult. But he was always there for me and sadly I also became dependent on him. I thought I would never be alone again with him by my side. I decided I don't want this in a relationship and just do it even when I have to suffer. And I did it. And I don't feel sad. I don't know if those feelings will arrive some day. I don't know if I will suffer but right now I'm okay. I really am. And I enjoy the attention of other potential partners. I enjoy that other people think I'm attractive and nice. I'll always love him, he is great but I think i made the right decision. And I'm glad depression didn't take over my life because of that. I think I am a grown-up now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-05 18:53:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I have a hard time with depression I get really bad dreams. Last Saturday I had one of them. Short description: I was in a "game" and the only thing it did was to make you panic until you realise it's a game but nobody tells you that so you struggle for eternity if you are unlucky. So I was trapped in this dream and then I woke up because my rat blue, who always gets out of her cage at night somehow, was eating my roasted sunflower seeds I left at my bed. Every time she gets out of the cage she climbes into my bed and wakes me up to cuddle. This time it saved me from my dream. I can't describe how terrifying it was, the feeling that I was trapped in this panic for what feels like eternity. Waking up to her was the best thing that could have happened at that moment. And she'll never know what she did for me that night.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though it's cute please be reminded that you shouldn't bathe a rat until it's really necessary. That's because they are prone to infections and have sensitive lungs. They also clean themselves actually. The best way to clean a rat is to put on some coconut oil and let them lick it off their fur, cleaning themselves in the process or putting belly high water in a tub with peas and cooked noodles to fish for. Rats are amazing but their lungs are often very fragile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Was asked to mention this here: Rats clean themselves. You shouldn't bathe them exept if it's really necessary. They have fragile lungs and are prone to lunginfections. You can clean them by putting belly high water in a plastic container and put some cooked peas and noodles in to fish for. You can also put coconut oil on the fur. They will clean themselves while licking it off. You can also use a damp,soft cloth if something is really sticky. Old rats are usually cleaned by the other group members. If they are very smelly you should consider changing your cage cleaning routine and be sure that they are healthy. Rats are amazing and sweet but due to our breeding they have a high chance of getting respiratory disease.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cats like all animals have a smell. It's natural. The bad smell is often caused by the toilets if they aren't cleaned regularly. You don't need to bathe or clean them if they are healthy. Only if they have a dirty behind or illness which causes them to have puss or blood or other illness related fluids on them. Still, animals smell like animals and you shouldn't change that because you can't deal with it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best thing that worked for me after my break up was working on myself, going to clubs, meeting new people. Flirting is an awesome way to boost your confidence. But in general I would say that you shouldn't be too hard on yourself. You'll get partners that are better than her, you'll get partners that will think you are better than anyone else and you'll get into relationships which make you better in bed because you'll get to practise. And you can always read and talk about sex, learn about it and try new stuff with someone you trust. Sex is weird and it doesn't have to be perfect and your worth isn't based on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am pretty new with rope play and I have a big question regarding safety. I am always very careful and don't want the rope to be too tight, always checking with two fingers and looking if the skin is getting blue. I heard that if it turns blue you should undo it but I often see blue skin, very tight ropes and stuff like that here on Reddit and elsewhere and there are no comments asking if it is safe or saying that it isn't safe. It confuses me because I don't know if those ropes only look tight or if mine are just very loose... I just want to be careful and follow the safety advice from people with lots of experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You already received some good advice here but I just want to throw in that it can be absolutely normal to smell down there after a day or exercise. Keep in mind that there is sweat and moisture that builds up and that vaginas just smell a bit in general. Just like your armpits it gets smelly after a while, you clean yourself and that's it (if you are healthy). And if you are very conscious about it you might notice it even more. So it's very important to talk to a doctor and if everything is okay, it's just your body and that's totally normal and fine. Don't think that everybody smells nice down there after a day of school or work. We all are smelly animals in the end of the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can see your point but I think that in the USA especially, racism is often addressed as a problem between black and white people. Racism goes a lot further. As a European I see a lot of racism against other white people, from white people, which is based on which country you come from. I also think that "white people" is too generalised just like "black people" in the USA. People can have a light skin colour but still experience racism due to the fact that they are from a different country or have a different culture. Same goes with dark skin. People can also have a light skin colour and be mixed and experience racism. Racism is not exclusive to the black community in the USA or to dark skin. Every community needs to work on it's racist behaviours and thoughts and acknowledge them. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't fight to be treated without racism, more specifically, they SHOULD and I stand with them because you can't make a change while saying everyone is bad so they shouldn't say anything against it. Fight for your rights while working on giving others their rights!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kids stare because they are interested. It's really us adults who consider it unfriendly but from the perspective of a child this is the only time they can observe a person who maybe is different from what the kid is used to. And children need the chance to look at new things and people. Even better when they have a chance to talk. A lot of children stare at me and I've never once talked to one that was unfriendly while asking me about my piercings, tattoos and self harm scars. People forget that it's special for them to see different people because you might be the first or second person who is androgynous or has piercings or is very tall or has a differnt skin colour that the child has ever seen! We should use those chances and make it into a good experience so the child feels positive about different people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh man are you me? These kind of situations grew into a full blown anxiety disorder for me. I almost killed myself because of it. I took my finals this year and my therapist helped me to get into a room where i was alone and they checked on me every few minutes. When i am nervous it's much worse and sitting is also very difficult for me. So from the bottom of my heart: Go to a therapist and talk to you uni/college. Talk about it and ask what your options are. Maybe you have a good friend there that will be your moral support when you go. That helped me. I am still not over it but i have a great support system and that helps to handle it better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, I am better now (just graduated so no painful schooltime). I feel better when i tell people about it and they reassure me that they have empathie for my situation but that's my way to deal with it. My teachers were very understanding and they kept the information from the rest of the class. And my therapist helps me with talking about the embarrassment i feel and i had a special paper, where i could go home if i needed to and that was also a big helper and a form of support. Try to check your options, so that you can be in a comfortable situation in the long run. I wish you all the best and also hope that there will be more online class options when i start with college this year. If you ever feel the need to talkt to someone about this specific problem, just write a message.</TEXT>

But it's still a traumatic experience for most of the parents and a lot of the people, who had the physical miscarriage, feel gulity about it. You can help actively with braking the taboo around the topic trough talking and seeking help for the ones affected, if needed. And if you need help dealing with this emotional trauma, you should reach out to professionals (doctors, therapists) and people you trust.</TEXT>

But there is this one teacher we all actually loved and he doesn't accept it and gets very bitter when the class calls him out on it. But the principal says: As long as *female name* is on the paper, you can call them *female name*. We are all very shocked and sad and don't know what to do. My friend was so brave with telling everyone and this reaction from the teacher is so painful and disappointing. What can I do to support my friend and what can the class do support his rights?

    <TEXT>I don't think so. I mean parents hurt their children physically by accident. The zipper caught the skin, you stepped on their toe... And to be a person who never lashes out or has so much control that they handle situations well is extremly hard. But I think a big problem is that a lot of them don't even try. Love is the most important thing because it's easier to live with a toe that hurts when mum gives you kisses and says sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's true. I think a lot of parents feel left alone. And I think there needs to be more education for them. But I think western society, in general, isn't really kidfriendly.

    <TEXT>I think it's normal. Everyone has a scar or two. But the fact that it's the norm makes it weird for me. It's the norm that most parents make major mistakes while raising their child and it's normal. And with the suicide rates: I think mental health doesn't really have a place in society yet. We are getting there slowly but, with our lifestyle and how most of us are missing a community with enough security social wise, I think it's a long way to go. And it's a big taboo in a lot of families when someone they know is mentally ill. It's this thing that can happen to everyone, except for you and your family. Like a car accident. It only happens to everyone else and that's acceptable. But when you or your daughter are the one that have the problem, it's much harder to speak out. Because: why me? It's a difficult topic and I can talk a lot about it, if I want to but I'll stop here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you think so, I would recommend talking about it. They need a chance to adapt to it. He deserves the best chance he can get and there are more possibilities now than 10 years ago. I've been in a home for mentally ill kids and a lot of them had so much potential but they just stamped them off as disabled after being diagnosed with autism and one of them couldn't even tie his shoes when he came to us because nobody taught him. He is capable of everything normal and is living his best life now but you really have to look out for them so they don't fall trough the system. I wish the best of luck for you, the kid and the parents. It's nice how how you care about them.</TEXT>
