Of course it'd be very ambitious but I'd also like to try and be a scenarist.

    <TEXT>I recently got into watching movies and I loved these. Duel 1972, Reservoir Dogs, Hateful8, Django, 7,silence of the lambs, gangster squad, Ronin, from Dawn to dusk, Hitcher , The shining, American sniper, sandcastle, Full metal jacket, American gangster and probably a few more i don't have on my mind right now. I loved the duel, Ronin and for sure all madmaxes for car pursuits, I'm also searching for any non futuristic car chases Overall I like grim climate with action, i like thrillers and horrors without overly supernatural stuff. Thanks in advance! Edit: I'm getting here the best recommendations Ive ever had, so on point! Thanks again!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't need any help, these are just my loose thoughts i started thinking about this watching breaking bad and they mentioned suicide its not even related to it they just mentioned it and it got me thinking. So if someone is tired of this world, don't enjoy life and don't see themselves want to work to change it, is it a sign of weakness to commit suicide? Like it requires strong will to do so, but also its running from problems which you (probably) could fix if you worked on them. And Im not even thinking of any specific situation it may be just normal teen problems with school or being broke or something much worse, just can't stop thinking about it since an hour or so It's not all I got but I won't write whole essay and I'm probably not so original on this i just want to see what you think</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would it be a good idea to take a few boxing classes just to learn how to take or throw a punch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-18 12:58:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tl;dr can 1 boxing class teach me how to throw a decent punch, is it worth it? I don't meet a lot of people and when I do I don't get in any conflicts and I'm not looking for any, I workout and I'm doing pretty well but I'm not buff by any means. I'm confident enough and I don't need any ego boosts. Its just that at some point I might have to fight for whatever reasons, when I see movies or watch posts on r/fightporn I always ask myself if I could throw even one punch, like an amateur punch. I'm pretty sure I'd take a fight if I had to but I always doubt myself winning with anyone my size it's just that I want to be able to throw a hit and maybe take a few because I'm a guy and I should be able to right? would one boxing class be a good idea? How committed would I need to be to get on i can throw a few hands but probably will get beat by anyone who know what they're doing level? I was trying some martial arts when I was young and I remember that I didn't learn anything useful. are boxing classes anything different than staying on the mat and waving your hands yelling?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I haven't eat meat for 4 years, I still ate fish, milk and eggs but I never liked most of the meat and read a little about veganism and decided to try it. I never quit eating fish or milk but I didn't eat meat and I didn't miss it at all. Recently I started working out so I consume a lot of diary and fish but some chicken would also help, I don't lack or struggle with protein it's just so hypocritical that I don't eat meat but get 80% of my daily protein intake from diary The thing is that sometimes I am a problem at parties or dinners, I don't eat kebabs or tacos and I'm not even vegan i just don't eat *these* animal products but I'm fine with other which is just dumb. So I want to start eating meat again since I eat other animal products and fish and I'm not vegan but I psysically can't and don't really want to eat any particular meat. Never liked ham, sausages, pate or bacon altho chicken was my thing. but as I said I cant enjoy chicken knowing how it's killed and breed. Oh and I know it's dumb but when I started I was emotional 13 yo boy who really liked animals and didn't do anything besides clash Royale so please don't mock me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously noob here, for now I'm copying builds from people who can play but when I get to know mechanics I'll definitely try some innovative stuff myself. Like I wonder why noones going with miss fortune on top? You could outrange tanks and shit, or if you would go with like double mid to overwhelm mid and leave some chunky hero on bot to freeze the lane... you get the idea. Why is it always tank on top, supp with adc something on bot, some yasuo mid+jg? Obviously it seems like the simplest effective strategy but if you tried hard enough you could make some shenanigans work, I think. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That may be a strange question but when I lost my belly, went from noodle arms to quite decent ones, got a wider chest and stuff, and Im not even jacked, hell I don't even think I'm muscular. I'm just in a pretty good form for a 17 yo, it's nothing impressive just 8 months of progress. Anyway I became very self aware. I realised how unfunny and embarassing I was and I think it's because I lost the mindset of "I need to make up for my body by being funny/smart" and just shut up... Anyone?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How wouldn't you hate yourself? She's an *adult* I barely got over cringey things I did *not on camera* in highschool as a dumb 14 yo. I only got over them by drawing the line between my past and present self by getting in shape. I'd hate every single thing about myself after doing that, it's terrible in every way I don't care how much balls it takes to embarrass yourself this badly on TV, but Id rather have none than do this</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My point is that the balls here aren't a positive thing, or dont make it any less bad. I had the 'balls' in highschool and I hate everyfuckingthing I did because I thought its good to have balls this way. Maybe I make it sound worse than it was, never recorded myself or posted anything dumb but I did stupid shit, a lot of it and I didn't think twice about it until the end of highachool. I wish I was one of those quiet kids who didn't do literally anything they could regret. It's not about being secure, I was definitely secure as fuck, like a girl I liked told me I'm not funny and I didn't give a shit, I just moved on. And I did many embarassing things, maybe my confidence made them less bad and I was like 14. also there were kids, even in my class of 30 that did way worse, but I still hate myself for many things I said while this lady is way above 14 and is on TV</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I won't have a debt, in Europe most education is free or very affordable and even before I thought of job I'd like to have my parents said I have to go to college and study *something* I want and they'll pay for it. I study towards the direction of humanistics so law, writing, psychology and that's probably it. Im more into psychology than law, whether it's serial killers, ego, self worth, depression or whatever. I just find it fascinating but don't think there are many jobs after psychology. Psychologists are more needed recently, i also could profile criminals but I just feel like it's aiming way to high, or is it? Thought lawyer is a quite hard but good and real job to aim for Also I'm not from a rich family, studies are just affordable in Europe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nowhere near fat. Just counted, it's 11 (always said 8 and lost track of time during quarantine, anyway) first 3 i was figuring out how to workout, routine nutrition etc. But yeah it's 11,of course it's not 18 kg of pure muscle but Im just 20% body fat so I didn't get fat at all. And for numbers I went from 0 to 14 Pullups, i don't even remember my first Curls I didn't measure because i didn't belive in myself but it was about 4 kg, now I do 3 setsx10 reps of 12. I can do 20 reps of Incline Bench with 20 kg in each hand, when I started i barely could do a pushup. Also noobie gains help a lot, and when I started I was 50 kg and struggled to open a water bottle i was way below my potential which might have helped me gain this much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm playing since quarantine, I play just kalista, karthus and sion. Those are pretty versatile champs and I can go pretty much everywhere with these, it's just that it's ranked and I'm good enough for ranked only on bot, I can do top but I'm gonna get fucked by people who *really* can do top. Also this game seems try hard enough to let people wait for the lane they want, especially on ranked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do, but it's ranked. And I'm one of those silver win or lose players on other lanes, I either go 11/1 or 0/13. Its just bot where I got the feel when to not engage and reliably go even stats and farma or steamroll with ridiculous amount of kills but my sion top or karthus jg is very reliant on matchups. I can do 3 lanes tho</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a relatively new player, I love rogue and shaman class. I have plenty of rogue cards as its my fav and Id like to do some burgle rogue shananigas I love playing for value and including niche cards in my deck, would burgle rogue be a good craft? I want to run furnace fire colossus, spirit of the shark with meat wagon and cards like whirlkick master and togg scheme, eventually grizzled wizard+finlley. It seems to me like a perfect fit but I don't have a lot of dust to spare and want to make sure that's a good decision and I won't just be disappointed I can't do a semi controll burgle rogue after spending 2k dust on cut lasses, furnace fire collosus or even heistabron if I can afford it.</TEXT>

Another idea was to pull the spirit with a wagon and draw spells, and maybe some murlocs if I can fit any so it'd be rather slow but I'd draw my deck by turn 12 or earlier</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do this, you can consitently draw shuffle and you got patches every game. Throw in some cannon barrage, sea giants and even frost wolf commanders or this 2 mana 1/1 rush pirate and ur sett. I love this deck. Deck is very consistent and you can make it so you always have patches in the deck for more Pulls and shuffle</TEXT>

It's basically a movie stitched from all generic scary things you see like nurses, wheelchairs, scary security footages with kids following u, psychiatric hospital in the woods, some strange thing trying to kill you, WW2 something something, strange old guy etc etc and it's as bad as it sounds but Hillarious</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I thought about it and I'd either need to run some other weapons so I don't lose value of 6/7 weapon synergy cards. I could run jadr claws for their battle cry and other jade cards along with them, it would synergie with quest and mildly aggressive game plan. I also could run spirit of the frog with some burst damege spells and meat wagon for constency that would greatly increase my chances of drawing stuff while smorcing my opponnent face, I'd run unlock your overloaded mana crystals cards and frost giants with this. I have a few more ideas but I won't write and essay about a deck I haven't even played yet. Im not crafting a few crucial epics I need for this deck yet because meta is too weapon hate heave right now, waiting for more convenient time to try this deck out. Wish me luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also most of the cards Ive seen in this game seem to be pretty aggressive, is it possible to build a controll value deck maybe? With like [[back alley barkeep]] and [[fading memories]] for tons of value? Cards from shadow Isles would make me stay alive and on foot with the opponnent and piltover stuff would keep creating value... Or do I just fully commit to make tokens and kill my stuff</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New player here, just dropped heimedinger. Is it possible to scrap together some catastrophe deck with it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-22 16:49:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm playing this game for 2 days so far. Obviously I'm waiting until tommorrow for balance changes, I have some dust and wild cards to craft my heime catastrophe semi combo/controll deck. I'm open and grateful for card suggestions! I feel like its nowhere near strong card but I never enjoyed playing meta in any game so I'm more than OK with dropping heime, altho I have to ask, do you think it's worth crafting as my first deck ever? I really want to play semi controll stuff in this game, I love generating cards too. but if I'll miss too much this way I think I should consider crafting such off meta stuff. Also what time will balance changes launch in EU? thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't like playing what other people are playing in any games, even in starcraft I have my own home brew buildorders. i always build strategies and decks by myself because winning with *my* strategy feels amazing, and playing against other people like me is even better I know it's getting long, hope you don't mind, but I havent quite figured lor yet so im just asking for some off meta decks to have fun with. I feel like the game doesn't have enough cards to really make something mine, you know what I mean? It's great and all but if you wanna play kalista you basically have whole deck autoincluded and all synergies are planned by riot, you don't get to do too much funky stuff yet Now I was thinking to make a teemo+shuffle more teemos semi controll deck but I'm probably nowhere near original with that, seems fun tho, I'm gonna craft it as my 1st deck and wait for some new stuff to be added. this game definitely has a great potential for my kind of playstyle but I'm waiting for more stuff</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's like saying all drunk driving accidents are Darwin awards, driving drunk is dumb but it's not a darvin award. Also you said it, they panicked, and in my opinion it totay justifies not so smart moves, you'd panic too if your kid and then it's grandpa we're drowning, and not drowning in a sea, drowning in a *pool*, pool doesn't seem like this much of a challenge even if you can't swim and especially if you're panicking. im not saying that it wasn't something that could've been prevented, my point is that this is nowhere near comparable to real Darwin awards. like would you rather see this or a post about a man that died while recording a video on forklift usage safety because he didn't fasten his seatbelt</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Darwin awards are not about comedy but about really dumb deaths, and really dumb deaths are often funny. that is not a stupid death, it's just a tragedy, and people that died here were panicking. I bet you wouldn't even care if someone who can't swim had a filled pool near their house, maybe they want to learn or use only the shallow part who the fuck cares but you sure act like everyone is a fucking idiot when they drown in it trying to save their kid. Its so easy to predict that if you fill the pool your kid, that's 8 years old, its not like it still crawls on the floor and bumps into walls will fall into it, and then his mother and granddad will drown trying to save the kid from a goddamn pool. I'm not in a mood for shitting on strangers on the Internet, so fuck off if you're gonna try and insult me because we don't agree</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Plate breaker makes it so cards like tekhal won't ever be in meta again while eater of secrets doesnt hurt secret decks too much. Im not saying plate breaker is OP, I just don't like the card. tech cards shouldnt be stronger to compete with zephrys, zephrys is bullshit and shouldn't exist imo but many people disagree so yeah, that's just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just watched a Scarlett vs nerchio match where she got carapace, and then missile upgrade early on and it made a huge difference as roaches 2 shot instead of 3 shot zerglings and zerglings aren't blown by 1 baneling.

    <TEXT>Not exactly what I was looking for but the 'flat amount' part was very helpful, thanks! What I am looking for is that tanks 2 shot zerglings, but +1 tanks 1 shot them. And I know that upgrading +1 for my tanks would depend if my opponnent is making zergilngs, how much tanks I'm planning to have or if 1 shooting zergglings does much for me, I know there are no consistent timings for upgrades, just to be clear. But I'm not the best at wording my questions so yeah</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I apologise in advance for writing this much I'm back after a few months break, I'm high platinium (and I hit high platinium after a month of playing 2-3 hours a day) but so far I wasn't really trying to climb and just did my thor rush (not all In) and most of my matches were 2v2, or 3v3 where I'm also high platinium. Anyway, now I wanna try to climb, probably to high diamond but gotta get back my 180 apm on unrankeds Most of the games I win are because of my great macro unitil late game, shifting drops and liberators, attacking multiple locations producing units while fighting, getting upgrades as early as possible and pretty good controll of my harass and drops Altho at late game i can't manage my workers, my army composition is very sketchy, I don't know what to do with my main army, I don't know where to rally, I don't use locations in late game, I over produce workers, i can't split my marines against protoss, i can't build good sim cities, Im shit against cannon rushes, my medavacs are always somewhere else than main army unless I'm dropping, I don't have scans cause I mule too much and many more. so yeah, Im now looking to learn how to controll my army because my macro is good enough i think. I watch a lot of pro games so I know how it's supposed to look like, now I'm gonna focus on how they macro too cause I macro great until late game, then I kinda run out of minerals even tho I have 8 ccs...maybe I should get myself a coach but first I need to learn generals and get to diamond by myself.</TEXT>

I know everything built up to this scene, and maybe I watched this show to fast cause of quarantine and I wasn't prepared but damn this is so fucking traumatising.

I just can't stand weak characters in such movies, I'm not some badass or anything i don't imagine myself as daryl during the apocalypse but I like to think that in such situation I'd either have the balls to suicide or just go through it. like I couldn't stand this doctor in alexandria she was just unbearable, same with the kid that started yelling while surrounded by walkers like thank god he's gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all the deathrattle and beast synergies along with [[scavengers ingen]] [[dire frenzy]] you could make it relatively consistent. Also all the trackings and shit The idea would be to outvalue the opponnent with deathknight cards, id run some big minions for army of the dead, this [[archivist elisiana]] since hunter doesn't have a lot of shuffle and death pacts could be problematic. I'd run [[furnace fire colossus]] if the deck would give me too much frostmournes. Also I'd put in some good spells, maybe even crushing walls. Im a poor almost f2p player that looks to homebrew some decent but realy funky deck that i could climb to diamond maybe If you got cards and wouldnt mind trying out the deck for me, dm me and I'll give full idea for the list and invite you to friends so I can watch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi! I know one guy replied she is bad at mid *but* she can be amazing. I play kalista bot and mid, and I tell you, on mid half of my matchups are auto win, yasuo or irelia literally can't farm against you. take barrier, ward good bond with ur jg and bully the shit out of midlaners. If you're good with kalista mid seems very easy compared to bot. Also just a small tip from me, if you're going lethal tempo and building zerkers into Bork into runaans, buy elixir of wrath as soon as you get runaans for extreme amount of heals, you are a beast with runaans and elixir. if you can hit either multiple minions or champs. Hope that helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Tl;dr is kalista balanced? Yeah but what do you think of her? Too OP, Balanced or too weak? I feel like she's balanced altho sometimes it feels too easy altho some things just destroy her (caitlyn, good tristana, brand or respectful malphite etc). I often get into the front line and expose myself for stuns but asides stuns it's easy to do with runaans, lethal tempo, elixir of wrath and tons of lifesteal. I just want to know if I'm playing an OP Champ, cause I hate seeing ekkos or zeds and always think that if theyre good it's just the Champ, and I like to think that I'm doing good with kalista which (I like to think) is balanced but skill requiring Champ and I'm just good</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What's wrong with luck included in a card game. I just don't get it, that's the whole point of card games. I agree that hearthstone is wayyy 2 p2w (thank god we have cards like oger) and that aggro is a little too popular but I can't understand why would you want hearthstone to have limited luck. This whole game is based around luck, like most of the card games. f2p btw</TEXT>

Like tell me if im wrong but the union were from the part of america with lots of cities and fought against slavery and confederates were the rich ones exploiting black slaves in not so industrial parts of america with lots of cotton fields and such so why were they lacking money and the union wasnt? Is that because confederates were against the US country? Sorry if these are dumb questions but we dont learn much about it in europe, i got curious about it tho</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I havent really dicovered my style i dont think, playing for 2 weeks so far maybe so anything that makes money really. I like to play agressive with tank destroyers so after some thinking i decided to go french TDs and im at tier 7 but lack silver for stuff like crew transfer so havent even played one game in it. Im also getting myself soviet mediums after A44, good gun and mobility and i was told theyre good at ramming stuff so fuck yeah. They said its great at sidescraping too but i have no clue how to sidescrape.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for such elaborate advice! Im going into a44 line since as a kid i always wanted to get them rear mounted turret tanks but everyone told me not to so i didnt and i really regretted that... I sucked at the game anyway but maybe id do better if played tanks i wanted to and not the tanks my friends told me were 'best'. I gave up and didnt play it for like a 5 years until now. I still like them rear turrets so i treat myself and go into them because i just really want to and so far i really enjoy it. Right now with every session all my statistics go up and im having fun so its all good, and maybe the fact that im not 12 years old anymore helps too You convinced me to soviet TDS and german mediums tho! ill definitely go with german mediums, i love ramming and german mediums just seem good overall. If you got this far i got 1 more question, how good are those tanks for credits? Which ones should i consider buying? Are some of them premium?</TEXT>

Yeah i dont lile pew pew guns, thanks for telling me about those id probably go panthers without that, so you say medium leopard lane? Seems good to me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If it was balanced and fun then it wouldn't be too hard to get enough players to not make it a 20 minute waiting time, (how does it work with current arena tho?? Arent 11 win players matched against other 11win players? So its the same thing here, some 2/2 is matched against some 11/1 preist with dqa and zephrys, its not fair, its a card game) But lets say it has to be 20 minute waiting time, maybe make the 12 win reward worth it, but thats not like blizzard (activision  #128557;) Maybe let us play an adventure/casual or even ranked while we wait? Set a times when 11 win players can play so more people would do it at the same time? theres many solutions and these are from the top of my head activision just doesnt want to put too much effort into this</TEXT>

Not everything weights the same, and *about* 15 grams isnt good enough. if a tablespoon of something would weigh 5 grams less or more, these 5 grams more per tablespoon would make 7 tablespoons which would make *about* 105 grams by this logic were really a 140 grams and so on. Just make it 100 grams not a fucking table spoon. Its like that thing with feathers and steel, its not about volume its about weight. idk if u dont get it i give up.

    <TEXT>It will make a big difference if u want to use more than a tablespoon, also for what fucking reason cant it be 100 grams? What makes measuring stuff in tablespoons so much better? I just dont get it its fucking annoying, i dont even count macros i just eat low calorie dense foods and i cant tell if something is low calorie dense if i compare 100 grams of something to 2 tablespoons of something to a 'serving' of some other shit. It absolutely does make a difference</TEXT>

Approach velocity is insane with e-- gt;q and you can try to do some shenanigas with spellbook switching for smite or tp to teleport top and push the tower when enemy toplaner is down. You can get a second heal, a flash into ignite into exhaust or something. Its insanely fun you should try it, i build various items, i also love frozen hearth and adaptive helmet. One of my favourite items are also deadmans plate and warmogs but its all situational. Anyway if you've made it this far, i also main kalista, im just silver (its my first season) but i got over 400k on kalista and im pretty good, at least for silver standards, would you mind playing sion supp with me?
