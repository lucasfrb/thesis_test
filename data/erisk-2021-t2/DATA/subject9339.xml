So I was talking to a Muslim and that he was getting annoyed that people say religions deny science. Then I started talking about thinks like carbon dating. Eventually I got onto the topic of trans people to which he instantly denied and brought up religious reasons to deny their existence. So I told him about where science proves that trans people do in fact exist and should get help to transition. It enrages me that they deny denying science. Then they went on to talk about chromosomes and other regular transphobic stuff. This topic then brought the whole server alive and in full transphobic homophobic rage you know as loving people do. The hypocrisy just radiates from them and being stuffed into a book that was written centuries ago that makes them deny everything else. Sorry if punctuation or grammar is wrong I #8217;m just annoyed. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

I should say that I thought I loved this country but maybe I loved a version of it that doesn't actually exist. I figure that the country has spoken and what I'm hearing is that it's a theocratic oligarchy. People are increasingly unable to see other views because what their religion says is the right thing meanwhile those that are rich and powerful are exploiting this for their benefit. Other themes that I believe are too strong for the country to shake are misinformation, racism, xenophobia, etc. I'm seeing all branches of government become entrenched with this breed of conservatives and what is that but the reflection of what the people want and what is the country if not the government and the people? I want my view changed on the following: * The US government is too entrenched with radical conservative politicians. * The above is because the people of the US want this. * I love a version of this country that doesn't exist as is evident * One should move to a different country if they don't feel represented and have incompatible views with too much of the government even if they can vote and are comfortable. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

Or be pissed that Bernie wasn #8217;t elected the nominee and not vote at all. However, this isn #8217;t the time to make your stand. If Trump wins, your freedom to choose your religion, or lack thereof, will be gone. Unfortunately, the religious are a very strong voting block and they stand behind Trump. Please get out the vote and tell your atheist friends to vote. Thanks! ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Disliking Wendy doesn #8217;t give you the right to post xenophobic essays about Nigerians](https://reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/j1gvlc/disliking_wendy_doesnt_give_you_the_right_to_post/) Body: The mods may delete this but as a Nigerian woman I have to speak up. Reading some of the comments on that post made me feel sick at how xenophobic and bigoted it was. You can hate on housewives and talk your shit about them without posting bigoted remarks about their ethnic heritage/nationality. I can #8217;t believe a post titled  #8220;Nigerian Arrogance #8221; is up on this sub, with almost 500 upvotes. Even worse I saw several women saying  #8220;I #8217;m a white woman, thanks for teaching me this #8221;. Teaching what? Hateful anti-african/nigerian sentiment? That #8217;s an attack on me and every single Nigerian. It #8217;s hard enough being a black African woman in the world, I don #8217;t need to read bigoted suit about us in a housewives sub! I #8217;m really just trying to survive the pandemic like everyone else. Oh and disclaimer I don #8217;t even like Wendy at all. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

The 44th District is entirely within Allegheny County, and if you have flown into the Pittsburgh International Airport you #8217;ve visited PA44. This district has been a long held Republican seat in the State Legislature but only by a small margin. I ran in 2018 I fell short by just a mere 1,000 votes and our current sitting State Senator and Congressman have recently flipped seats blue. We learned in 2018 that if we can flip 15 votes per precinct we can take this seat back. I have been an Educator for over 30 years in Pennsylvania and I #8217;ve been determined to to live a life of service. I #8217;ve served as a traditional classroom teacher and now am a Developmental Therapist. I #8217;ve served as a School Board Director for our local public schools, started a Non-Profit to help deliver books to underprivileged children and I #8217;ve raised my family here. I am committed to serving our community and ensuring a bright future for all. As an Early Interventionist Educator for children with delays and disabilities, I have visited families in their homes to help work one on one with a child that may be facing development milestones. During these visits over the last ten years, I #8217;ve worked with families in the district that have experienced threats of homelessness, food insecurity and are facing educational inequities no family should have to endure. We need an advocate in Harrisburg that understands the life long impacts that a quality education can have on a child. Pennsylvania has the most unequally funded education in the United States. We need a Representative in Harrisburg that ensures all children in Pennsylvania receive a quality education. I promise when I am sent to Harrisburg to serve, I will be that voice. ______________________________________________ [Click HERE to ask Michele Knoll Questions!](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/j2oi43/hi_i_am_michele_knoll_candidate_for_pennsylvanias/) ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Live in a rental for over a year without paying rent? Good luck in jail.](https://reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/j3ey0t/live_in_a_rental_for_over_a_year_without_paying/) Body: This has all be finalized so I decided to post it, for obvious reasons I didn #8217;t want to post it while it was ongoing. last summer I bought a house trailer and decided to rent it out. It needed some work so I posted 2 months free rent for putting carpet down in the living room, hooking up the hot water heater and putting in a toilet. got a nice couple with a newborn willing to do it. Great. No lease, month to month. No security deposit and the rent was $450 a month. So they did the work so I didn #8217;t ask for rent for 2 months. Everything was fine. Side note: there are a few little state laws that come into play. If you don #8217;t pay rent for 3 consecutive months You are considered a squatter, which means the landlord doesn #8217;t have to fix the property and can actually padlock it and deny you entry. If your on house arrest and get formally evicted, you could be violated for it. Also you can be formally evicted even if you have already moved out so the landlord can get rent due. also even though there are eviction bans, if it happened before the ban then it can still go through. Plus a few other conditions that still allow someone to be evicted. It #8217;s up to the judge really. fast forward 5 months and still no rent money. Yes they had a newborn and they were young and didn #8217;t have a lot of money, but the husband can spend $1,500 on a new engine for his project car. They can afford to go out to eat and spend money on electronics, but no rent. So after that third month I did nothing. The weather was turning cold. I didn #8217;t put in the furnace like I promised and if they hadn #8217;t had a newborn I would have padlocked the house. They were bragging about their tax refund, I gave them a shot to catch up and they basically said that they knew their rights and were in a rent strike (illegally I might add. You will see later) covid happened, husband got laid off so I gave them a break. When he went back to work I asked for back rent again and was told to fuck off. I finally had enough. I told them they had 14 days to get out or I was doing a formal eviction and seeing he was on house arrest he knew what that meant. i honestly was trying to keep him from having to go back to jail and keep an eviction off of their record. I was trying to be nice and civi so they left and I cut my losses, until I checked the property. Everything they put in the removed. Everything they got free rent for was gone. I got pissed and filed for a formal eviction. it didn #8217;t go as they hoped. They said I didn #8217;t provide heat so they went on a rent strike. Only they didn #8217;t file that with the courts or hold the money aside. They just thought they could stop paying rent. what they put into the trailer was less than the rent. The judge agreed with me that seeing they took everything I was due those 2 months rent. And the biggest. he started slamming my character so I said  #8220;Well you didn #8217;t tell me you were going to be going on house arrest when you rented the property #8221; before then the judge looked bored, but he perked up. He asked them if that was true, they responded that it was and he was ready to make his ruling. i received 15 months back rent at $450 a month and $2,000 in damages because the way they removed the stuff they damaged a lot of things. As for him, the judge said he had no choice but to turn the eviction over to his parol officer. fast forward to this month. His house arrest was violated and he was arrested. They actually had the nerve to ask me to speak on his behalf. I didn #8217;t. Ruling was his remaining 6 months are now being spent in jail, they have a bad eviction on their record and they owe me money. know the law before you play the game. tldr. Squatters lived over a year rent free. Husband ends up in jail. update: I forgot to add that social media blasted my like I was the scum of the earth. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Today marks the 3 year anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting. Yesterday a judge approved an $800M settlement lawsuit against the Mandalay Bay Resort for the victims in the shooting. To this day there has been no definitive motive discovered regarding the shooter.](https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/j3hpng/today_marks_the_3_year_anniversary_of_the_las/) Body: A bit of a preface: This isn #8217;t your typical r/UnresolvedMysteries case, but it still baffles me. It didn #8217;t receive enough media coverage as it should have, and people outside of Las Vegas have frankly forgotten it occurred even though it was the deadliest maas shooting in modern US history. The way the shooter prepared and carried out his plan is fascinating in a terrifying way. A judge approved a $800 million settlement on Wednesday September 30 for victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting, which is considered the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Sixty people were killed and over 700 were injured. Up until two days ago, 58 people were counted in the death count, but two individuals recently died from health complications related to their shooting injuries. After months of negotiations, all sides in a class action lawsuit against the owner of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas agreed to the settlement, plaintiffs' attorney Robert Eglet told CNN by phone. The settlement will be divided among more than 4,000 claimants in the class action suit. The exact amounts going to each victim will be determined independently by a pair of retired judges agreed to by both sides. To this day there is still no motive found regarding the shooting. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said in an interview that the FBI, LVMPD, and CCSO were unable to  #8220;answer definitively on why Stephen Paddock committed this act #8221;. The shooter, or domestic terrorist as he should be called, was a 64 year old avid gambler, named Steven Paddock. He spent a whole week preparing an arsenal of semi automatic weapons in his hotel room. He used a bump stock when he opened fire, which allows a semi automatic weapon to fire at a higher rate. This is shooting alone actually caused President Trump to completely ban bump stocks in the US. Stephen Paddock actually had visited multiple other hotels near music festivals. This terrifyingly supports the fact that he had been planning this for at least a year, and was wanting to make sure he could kill the most amount of people before he was found by law enforcement. It was found that he had shot at jet fuel tanks across Las Vegas Blvd, under the assumption that it would distract people on the ground from the shooting if the tanks were to explode. The amount of premeditation is what terrifies me the most. The Mandalay Bay is owned by MGM Resorts International. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, MGM indicated that only $49 million of the settlement would come from the company's funds, with the remaining $751 million being covered by liability insurance. **EDIT**: I won't remove this from my original submission just to keep comment context in place, but I would like to take back what I said about the media not generating this enough coverage. I meant to say that it was baffling how no one was able to come up with an official motive that could be backed by LE. I completely forgot about the media cycle and should have remembered that.

    <TEXT>Original post: [Moratorium on questions related to US Politics](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j44ppb/moratorium_on_questions_related_to_us_politics/) Body: Effective immediately until a further notice, there will be a moratorium on all questions related to US politics, including but not limited to: the election, political parties, the candidates  amp; their running mates, any of the branches of government. We have understandably been getting a heavy increase in political posts, but they #8217;ve been slowly overloading the sub. We want to give users a break from such posts, especially since multiple people have reached out to us about this issue. While there have been civil discussions around these and other similar topics, we as a mod team have found that most discussions around US politics devolve into slapfights and insults. Therefore, we are placing this ban on such questions for the stated time to help ensure that r/AskReddit remains a welcoming environment for all. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [UPDATE: my ex boyfriend uploaded videos of me to pornhub without my consent and I found out two months later](https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j3u0ud/update_my_ex_boyfriend_uploaded_videos_of_me_to/) Body: Hi everyone!! It #8217;s been quite a while since my post that kind of blew up which I was surprised but super thankful for. I don #8217;t know how to add links to the previous post but if you look at my profile you #8217;ll be able to see the previous one. If you don #8217;t want to read all of that, the most you need to know is that my ex put videos of me on pornhub without my consent after we broke up and I found out two months later. Some good stuff has happened, and I was so thankful for all the comments that I wanted to update in case anyone really wanted to know. So before I called the police, I gathered all evidence I could. I was too scared to even open the videos that I don #8217;t have a screen recording of them up, just a screenshot of the title and thumbnail of the videos + his account name. As soon as I saw the acc name I knew it was him. I #8217;m out text conversations I was able to find some stuff that would point back to the fact that it was probably him, I have text evidence of him saying the video was just for us and him saying he already deleted the videos after we broke up. When I called the police after recording a statement they assigned a detective to my case who was really nice and told me I had a good chance of things!! Because he has no previous record, he probably won #8217;t end up in jail, which I #8217;m fine with. As much as I completely despise him now, I would #8217;ve always felt guilty if I sent him to jail. Things have been moving pretty smoothly since then, he has his first court hearing in a couple of weeks, and I #8217;ll see more about what direction the case is going in after that. For now I just wanted to let everyone know that on that side of everything, it all went super smoothly. There #8217;s no saying what #8217;s gonna happen in the future, but for now everything is good. In terms of my mental health, it was really shit when I found out and after that. I was having a difficult time getting over it and realizing that he didn #8217;t care for me to do something like that and that was hard. Because even after we broke up I still held him in a good light, not always, but there were a lot of times where I missed him and considered getting back together. But I #8217;m so much better now. I started seeing someone else who has been really good to me and supportive. Im doing a lot better. Thank you to everyone who messaged me directly for support and sending me information and links. You guys are truly amazing fucking people. To take time out of your day to send that just like, it meant so much so thank you.  lt;3 ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [[Vent] Little dog breeds are still dogs and still need to be trained as such.](https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/j59al8/vent_little_dog_breeds_are_still_dogs_and_still/) Body: Nothing grinds my gears more then seeing a small breed of dog getting away with attacking/harassing or showing aggression towards humans, children and other animals. It is not okay, it's size is not an excuse for being an a\*\*hole. It's still a dog and it's still capable of biting and hurting someone. I can't tell you how many times I've seen little dogs, bullying and being aggressive, biting their owners, biting children for that matter as well and the owner just laughs or thinks it's hilarious that her Chihuahua thinks it's some sort of Boxer. For the love of god people, teach your dogs that it's behaviour is not okay, not just for other's safety, but for it's own. Anytime I've seen a bigger dog turn around and is like "You know what, not today you little hairball. \*Chomp\*" and it's always the bigger dog's fault. The bigger dog is always punished or removed from the room, yet the instigator still stands and has gotten away with the behaviour. Another thing that I can't tolerate, people not obeying the little dogs/big dogs section at the dog park. They exist for a reason people, just because nobody is in the little dog section, does not mean you should put your small dogs in with bigger dogs to play. IF they get hurt, y'all get on your Karen personas and immediately play the "Your dogs aggressive" card because your dog is a snapping ball of anxiety picking fights with dinosaurs. Little dogs are still dogs and need to be socialised and trained just like bigger dogs, that being said you still shouldn't let them in with bigger dogs at dog parks, the play is very different between the sizes and not all dogs will understand how fragile small dogs can be. Use the small dog pen, if you don't then you as a negligent owner are putting your dog at risk. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [I have been reading the HP books every few years since I was a child, and they have never hit me as hard as they are right now, at 29 years old.](https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/j7not6/i_have_been_reading_the_hp_books_every_few_years/) Body: Albeit, this is my first time listening to the audio books, which adds a lot more emotion to me, but still. I just finished the chapter where Sirius dies, and I'm crying again. But, I'm realizing, I'm crying for a different reason this time. When I was child, I cried for Harry. I cried for the loss he felt, how he'd wished to live with Sirius and have a real family. I was also abused as a child by a step parent and I clung so strongly onto the books of a child that was in a similar situation to me, but could still make friends and practice magic and go on adventures. I was often left in a closet with a flashlight and 1 book of my choice for hours at a time, and I always chose a HP book. Today, I'm crying for Sirius, and for Remus. I'm crying for the intense isolation they both struggled with after Lily and James died. For the couple short years they got to see each other again. I'm crying for Sirius and how much he struggled to stay in one place, alone in the house where he was abused by his mother. How depressed and lonely he was, and how deeply he wished to have a home to share with Harry. I cried for Sirius, because for one jubilant moment, he felt like he was fighting alongside his best friend again after 15 years. And then, in the same moment, he was gone, falling behind a veil of death. I cried for Remus, who the next moment *needed* to be strong for Harry and to talk some sense into the teenager that would have mindlessly followed into the veil. I'm still deeply attached to these books and am currently considering how much I have changed as from a girl to a woman, and how this has changed my perspective of these books. The characters I relate to, the situations they're in, etc. I just wanted to share this small moment of vulnerability with this sub. Edit: To all the folks telling me to read another book, why are assuming I am not? I only reread these every few years. I'm also reading Dune, and 1984 right now. But sometimes I need to go to something more comforting from my past. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [I (30m) was unknowingly involved in my girlfriend (30f) and her ex-husbands fetish-play back when they were together and we were just friends. Now I feel our entire relationship is built on demeaning lies.](https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j7ojdj/i_30m_was_unknowingly_involved_in_my_girlfriend/) Body: I was friends with my girlfriend for years when we were children. Our families were friends and we spent a lot of time together as children. As we got older I developed a bit of a unrequited childish crush on her that ended when we went off to different colleges at 16, and then later university. We drifted apart at this point and didn't speak for nearly a decade. During this decade she met and started a relationship with a passing acquaintance of mine. They fell in love and got married. About 4 years ago I got a facebook message from her out of the blue, we sparked up a conversation and became friends again. We never physically met, never flirted and I honestly felt I respected her marriage. The talking was superficial and kinda infrequent. About 18 months ago she somewhat suddenly got a divorce. She never mentioned any sort of relationship problems and when asked she just said he was controlling and she wanted out. 6 months went by, give or take, and I asked her out on a date. Thing progressed quickly with us ultimately moving in together during the lockdowns. About a fortnight ago I got an abusive message from her ex-husband. He had tracked down my work email and laid out how I was scum who stole his wife and that she would cheat on me like she did him. I didn't engage with him because ultimately I didn't actually believe him. Nothing I had done with my girlfriend when we were friends crossed any lines. I never did anything to hurt his marriage and they were divorced 6 months before I asked her out. When I brought this up with my partner a whole mess of shit came to light. I'm not knowledgeable on the precise terms but basically her ex-husband had a very specific fetish about exposing his wife to other men and "winning" her back. The idea of other men coveting his wife but her ultimately being "his" was his thing. He never actively wanted her to cheat on him (at worst he let her kiss other men she was encouraged to seduce when out drinking in the early parts of their relationship) he just enjoyed the thrill of risking someone else taking her but him ultimately making her his. Writing this out makes it sound incredibly sexist, I'm not privy to his exact motivations but that's how she described it. As they got older and stopped clubbing this game took a new form that inexplicably focused on me. Now her ex-husband apparently hated me with a burning passion. Just everything about me, how I was as a kid when he vaguely knew me and how I was as an adult on social media. My girlfriend also said it didn't help that I was working in a field he had dreamed of working in but couldn't due to dropping out of university. Their little game started with him encouraging her to reach out to me after she told him I had a crush on her. He quickly fixated on this idea he had won something I desperately wanted. From there he would encourage her to flirt with me, to lead me on, but also remind me she was with him... now she did none of this, she just texted with me periodically and claims we were genuinely friends. Yes, the initial trigger to reach out was forced by him but she had no interest in this bullshit game to make me feel bad for his sexual gratification. Instead choosing to lie to him about what was being said. I was never told the full extent of this but she said she would usually just claim I was desperately trying to get her to come see me in our hometown, to meet up for coffee or whatever and she was constantly reminding me she loved and respected her husband too much to do that. I then asked for an explanation why he thought I broke them up and after no small amount of trickle truthing I demanded to read some of the emails he had been sending her recently or she could just tell me herself. I regret this ultimatum but she was being extraordinarily evasive about why her marriage ended but I felt since we were involved and I was being blamed for it ending I deserved to know what happened. She gave in and told me how over the years the "game" she was playing with her ex-husband escalated. At first it was at his request, he sought more and more emotional highs and got more into the "winning back" part of the game than the bit where someone coveted his wife. He encouraged her to walk the line of an emotional affair that she feigned for his sexual gratification. Later their relationship took a turn (the controlling behaviour did occur) and she would use the fictional relationship he encouraged to punish him. Feigning an even more serious relationship than he encouraged and not letting him "win her back". In the last year of their marriage things took an almost self-fulfilling prophecy turn in that him being distant because he thought she was cheating lead to her talking with me more and in turn she developed genuine feelings for me. Eventually she ended things and said she was entirely honest with him that she wasn't cheating on him but their behaviour had caused her to develop genuine feelings and it wasn't fair to him or her for the marriage to continue. I did question this narrative but she showed me his emails which largely supported her version of events. At this point I was just exhausted by the whole thing and said I needed time apart to process this. At the end of the day she's described some severely toxic behaviour on her part where she basically used me as a pawn to punish her husband. She maintains he used a fictitious version of me for the sex games and as punishment but I don't see that as a significant distinction. It's shitty, toxic behaviour either way. Knowingly making him feel like she was cheating above and beyond what he consented to. Also, there was years of this game where her ex-husband thought I was pining for his wife. God knows who he told, who believes what about me. It just seems disrespectful to use, what was at the time, a friend She maintains when she genuinely fell in love with me she did the honourable thing and ended her marriage within a month or so. I just can't trust her the way I did. My version of things was 6 months after her marriage ended I asked her out and we fell in love. Her version (the truth) is just full of dishonesty. She maintains she didn't cheat on anyone, she couldn't help how she felt for me and she actively ended things in a timely manner. We were genuinely friends for all the years I was the focus of her ex-husbands sexual jealousy and she lied to him, not me. I just can't quite form the right questions to see her side of things. If there even are any... I think the fact I'm looking to move out speaks to where I am with this. I do love her, I really do, but all this fuckery in our history is tainting things. I cant see how to move forward from this realistically. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

Abs that are incredibly defined not just like a skinny person. And along with it girls on the muscular side is where its at. Ive recently found out that none of my friends share this opinion with me. And I know that it is much harder for women to obtain the ripped ab look but man when they do. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Breast cancer took my mother away from me today.](https://reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8wjjr/breast_cancer_took_my_mother_away_from_me_today/) Body: As the title says, my mom has been taken away from me by breast cancer. She has been in the hospital for the past and last two weeks of her life and I wasn #8217;t allowed to visit her because of the COVID restrictions and she never answered her phone because she was too weak to. The last time I saw her was when the paramedics put her in an ambulance. I was already aware that she cannot be saved anymore because of the multiple complications this disease brought, but knowing that she can pass away at anytime while she was at the hospital and that I couldn #8217;t do anything to be there for her just fucked me up more than I can put into words. All I wanted to say is that I am BEGGING you to never take any moment you have with your parents for granted. I don #8217;t want anyone to see what it is like to be deprived of visiting their sick/dying relatives because of the pandemic. I am 21 years old so I am technically not a teenager anymore but I chose this subreddit because I know teenage years are that period of your life when you don #8217;t really get along with your parents so I want all of you to cherish every moment you spend with your loved ones because you will never know when it can be the last time you see them. WEAR A MASK to help stop the spreading of the virus so people can be allowed to be there for their loved ones in the last moments of their life. edit: spelling ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Reason for deleting my RH situation story](https://reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/j8z2ct/reason_for_deleting_my_rh_situation_story/) Body: Hello all. For those of you who have been keeping up with this whole situation this week, you probably saw my story that I posted on here a few days ago. After receiving so many hateful comments and messages on many different platforms, I had to delete the posts from here and the AH subreddit. My mental health has taken a massive hit from all this hate and all these new developments so I needed to "disappear" so to speak for a bit. My story still stands as truth and I do have some verified pieces of evidence (which as my original post stated, at least one mod of this subreddit verified that I shared evidence with them). I want to thank everyone who have commented or sent me messages with kind words and support. Just know they did not fall on deaf ears and I really really do appreciate it in this extremely hard time in my life. For those of you who are still defending this manipulative piece of garbage, do your research and put the pieces together. This was not a one off incident and more of us have come forward to speak up, all with very similar stories and situations of grooming, manipulation, and abuse of power (amongst other things I want to vomit at just thinking about it). And in case the person we speak of is actually reading this (yeah, you know who you are and are probably reading this), fuck you for all you've done to us and I hope you rot in prison. And I genuinely hope your wonderful wife and kids can move on from this. Lastly, for the AH crew, I dont blame you at all for not knowing what this person did and please don't blame yourselves for not knowing. He tricked us all and we were all blind to it. We still love you all.  #128154; #128420; #128154; #128420; ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Not my job to clean your patient](https://reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/j9aojs/not_my_job_to_clean_your_patient/) Body: 1st time posting on mobile so please forgive for typos and Grammar. This was a few years ago but it is still very satisfying thinking about it. Back story: I was a 24 year old guy working as a Mental Health Technician at a county hospital in Arizona. I was specifically trained and certified to work with teens, youth, adults and elderly who were a danger to themselves or others. This included those that were brought in by the police for being violent and needed 1 on 1 supervision 24 hours a day. It #8217;s generally VERY boring and easy, because the patient is sedated and strapped to the bed. This story is about one of these guys. A patient had been brought into the ER by the police for whatever reason and had been extremely dangerous and violent with the police and hospital staff. I had been requested to go to their wing of the hospital (We normally only work in the mental health ward) and monitor and restrain if needed for the hospital staff. I was stilling in the corner of his room on my phone probably playing games when a nurse came in to check on him. The conversation went something like this: Nurse: I #8217;m going to need you to do something more than sitting there in the corner on your phone. Me: Excuse me? Nurse: I need you to clean him and empty his urine bag. Me: Nope... I #8217;m not trained to do that. Nurse: Listen, I don #8217;t have time to deal with this, you #8217;re going to do this or I #8217;m going to get the doctor. Me: Do you see CNA (Certified Nurses Aid) on my badge anywhere? It says MHT (Mental Health Tech) I am not certified to do a CNAs job. If I did clean him and change his urine bag but did something wrong it would be your job and not mine. Go ahead you can get the doctor and ask him yourself. Nurse: You have no right to tell me what your JOB is, I will have your job for this! She storms out of the room and looks for the Doctor. After a few minutes I can hear her voice just outside the room. I go just to the doorway (I #8217;m still able to see my patient) to hear her and see the doctor. Nurse to the Doctor: He (pointing at me) is telling me that he won #8217;t do what I asked him just because he isn #8217;t a CNA. Me to the Doctor: She is telling me I have to clean him and change his urine bag, but I have told her that it would be her job if I did something wrong. Doctor to Nurse: He #8217;s right, he has no responsibility nor is he certified to do it. He is supposed to sit with him and watch him, to keep you safe. Do your job and stop trying to find someone to do your job. It turns out there was no CNA for her area that night. She was trying to push her work off on other people, and I was her last attempt until the Doctor lost his patience. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

Here #8217;s a list of the excuses I #8217;ve gotten: - but you #8217;re on the pill, we don #8217;t need one - I can pull out - no really, I can pull out - I just got tested, don #8217;t you trust me? - please I just want to fuck you - I drank too much, I can #8217;t cum with it on Especially pissed off that each of the 3 men that pulled this shit waited until we were in the moment to bring up the conversation. It #8217;s disrespectful as fuck. Your orgasm is not as important as my health and safety. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

This is what you get with nonsecular government. Religious fanatics and Fascists gaslighting the world and making us all feel bad that we would even think to test the most fundamental beliefs that will go on to effect every decision made by this **LIFELONG** appointment to SCOTUS. Anyone who doesn't see through this by now is exactly the type of sheep these false Shepherds love to take for all they've got.

    <TEXT>Original post: [Being manipulated is not a good excuse.](https://reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/jadxm7/being_manipulated_is_not_a_good_excuse/) Body: (Im not saying manipulation is good just that it can be easily avoided)If you are not blackmailed or something similiar. If you were manipulated its because you failed to look at the event from all directions and logically. If the manipulator antagonized someone and made you do something because of that its still because you decided to believe whats in front of you and didnt look from all angles.  #304; have seen a lot of people get manipulated from miles away and couldnt understand how they didnt see this coming the point is emphasize try to gather detailed information about the event. I know that manipulation comes in a lot of shapes and sizes but in the end its just someone getting themselves infulenced too much. Just think for yourself before listening to anyone. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [CMV: Religion has absolutely no place in a modern society.](https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcv6rl/cmv_religion_has_absolutely_no_place_in_a_modern/) Body: Religion has had some good in the past, when people where absolutely ignorant about the world. It used to be a great tool to answer unsolvable mysteries and guide people who had no idea what the fuck life was about. However, it has also ALWAYS been about controlling the masses and brainwashing. These poor people constantly living in fear of chastisement by some infinitely powerful being. You better act nice now, or (insert your divinity here) will fuck you up for eternity! Oh what's that? You guys believe in a different god than us? Looks like it's time for a god damn blood bath! But sure, religions are about peace and kindness, unless you don't believe in the right one. Also I already see you guys coming with the "oh but don't put all the apples in the same basket, there's some bad religious people, but there are some good ones too!!" Fuck that bro. The actions of those bad apples far outweigh the positive aspects of the good ones. Yes some religious people contribute to charity and stuff, but do you really need religion for that? Can't you just be a good person without it? Also, how is no one calling them cults? It's the same fucking thing. If some nutjob claims to be the son of a god today, everyone laughs at him and calls him crazy, cause he is, but sometimes he gets a following and we're all like "well clearly this is a cult. These people are fucking stupid to believe that this guy is any kind of divinity whatsoever". How many of the ones who laugh at cults are actually religious? I'd bet it's a fuckton of'em, but sure, fuck introspection and let's all be hypocrites. My final point now, some of you may argue that religion is also about spirituality and trying to better yourself as a person, it's a moral compass. Again, fuck that shit! You don't need a fucking cult leader who's been dead for thousands of years to tell you how to act. We have social norms and things that are acceptable and things that aren't. Just be a fucking adult and reflect on your actions and thoughts and better yourself that way. Most religious people, as I said earlier, only follow that "moral compass" to escape an imminent doom when they die, not to actually be good people. They do it out of fear, and I don't think that makes you a good person, that makes you a coward who's scared of something nonexistent. Religion should and needs to be abolished, but of course that'll never happen. Oh well. Tl/Dr : Religions are about controlling people, have been and always will be a source of violence and hatred. They are cults and need to be abolished. Edit: Just to clarify, I do not wish any harm or hatred towards any religious people and I am for letting people belive what they want to, live and let live. However I just think religion shouldn't be a part of our society ANYMORE. I am against religion as a CONCEPT in a MODERN society. Not against religious PEOPLE. I know religion was a pillar of humanity IN THE PAST. I do not think it is still required TODAY. Thank you for your time everyone, there are some insghtful comments that made me reflect and I did soften my view on the subject. "Abolishing" religion was a poor choice of words, it should just die out slowly while only keeping the positive morals of it, through education. However, my view is not changed. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Original post: [Hey y #8217;all, it #8217;s geoff](https://reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/jdku3x/hey_yall_its_geoff/) Body: Well now there #8217;s allegations about me, so I guess I need to issue a statement. First off, hello. It #8217;s been a while since we #8217;ve talked. I #8217;ve been pretty quiet and absent from social media and content for a good bit now (since early June to be exact - there #8217;s reasons and I will get into them through the course of this letter, since I guess I can #8217;t seem to avoid it). Let me be clear, I am not happy about sharing all of this. I #8217;ve shared most of my life with you, successes, failures, embarrassing moments, painful ones, lots and lots of stuff. You know when I shit my pants, you know when about my issues with impotence. But I #8217;d like to have some level of privacy in my life. Some line where I am allowed to keep parts to myself. It #8217;s an issue I #8217;ve had with this relationship with y #8217;all (the audience for a long time). I have trouble finding the line, but for my sanity I need to. There #8217;s an allegation out there that I sexted with a member of the community in the past. This is partially true, but I need to clear some things up. Until these last few weeks, I had no idea about the Ryan stuff. None. None of us did. We found out when you did. The accusation this person made about me knowing, is just not true. I #8217;ve kept silent on the subject of him and Adam, not out of some sort of guilt or complacency, but out of horror and pain. It also hits very close to home for me and the reasons I #8217;ve been absent these last few months. I don #8217;t have a well-documented list of events, hence my timelines are by memory, so forgive me if they are a little foggy. I #8217;ll start by saying that I #8217;m not sharing any of this to disparage anyone. Griffon and I were headed toward divorce years ago. Without getting too far into it, as it #8217;s really no one's business but ours, we recognized it and did everything in our power to stop it. We tried multiple therapists, and many other things. One of our last attempts to right the ship was polyamory. For the last year or so we were together, we opened the relationship up. We didn #8217;t do this lightly. We read multiple books about it, talked to people from that community, and even proactively got and started seeing a poly therapist to help us navigate (and when that wasn #8217;t a good fit, we got a different poly therapist). We tried to be as ethical and fair and kind to each other as possible in the process. That meant total communication, even when painful. This is another thing I need to refute from that report. When Griffon and I were together, I never kept things secret from her, nor she from me, and I always communicated that with the people I saw, as did she. In that process we dated new people, and we both learned a lot about social media. I #8217;d been married for about 22 years at that point (across two marriages obv), and had never dated with social media before. Tinder, snapchat, instagram, bumble, these were all ways people now met and expressed interest to each other, and in ways I #8217;d never experienced before. I was told this is how people dated now in the modern era, so I gave it a shot. Ultimately I found it to be an unbalanced and unrewarding way to meet and date. I never set out to date people from the community, but I did meet a few. People would approach me constantly, from inside and outside of the community. I met and dated a few women during this time. I definitely talked with women who were familiar with Rooster Teeth. I did have a lot of insomnia in those days, and I definitely remember talking to a kind woman from Australia who approached me, and flirted with her, as she did with me. I saw this as nothing more than two consenting adults who were getting to know each other. In the process, but not because of it, Griffon and I decided to separate and eventually divorce. I met and dated people in that time as well. I was newly single and extremely lonely and heartbroken and was pretty receptive to kind attention. Ultimately, in the process I decided that dating people from the community wasn #8217;t for me. I felt at a huge disadvantage spending time with someone who already knew so much about me, and I so little about them. It left me feeling pretty exposed and uncomfortable, so I started hiding the Rooster Teeth part of my life, and only dating women from sites like Tinder and Bumble, where we met on equal footing. Eventually I met my current girlfriend who knew nothing about RT or the community. And that #8217;s it. I never groomed anyone, I never approached anyone or manipulated them. I never did any of the unacceptable shit others have done. At every step I tried to be ethical and communicative and honest with people. When someone approached me out of interest, and I was interested in them, I got to know them. I thought I was being a single, consenting adult, getting to know others. I was just trying to navigate dating with a bunch of scary and exciting new social media platforms, and ultimately I hated them, and stopped. None of this is why I #8217;ve been silent, but I recognize that my silence will be interpreted as such, so here we go. I had a complete and total nervous breakdown in June. My battle with alcohol addiction (still not drinking btw, still haven #8217;t fucked that up), divorce, rebuilding my life from the ground up, taking the new role in the company, the (what felt like weekly) new controversies at RT, the political climate, the BLM stuff, all left me in a really raw and diminished state. Then, in June (and I #8217;m not going to talk about it in detail probably ever - I just fucking can #8217;t), there was a family tragedy that was more than I could bear. I took an immediate leave of absence from RT (Luis and Jordan were very kind and supportive of this, and everyone at RT has been incredibly patient with me, - I cannot thank them enough). With a lot of help from therapy and close friends and family I #8217;m trying to put myself back together. It #8217;s slow, and often feels impossible, but I #8217;m working at it every day. I #8217;m not sure how to end this other than to say, I #8217;ve never tried to be anything but ethical and honest with people, and I #8217;ve never tried to take advantage of them or my status. If I missed that mark, I can only apologize and continue to try and grow and be better than I was. If you do view me as a villain, take it out on me. Not my daughter, girlfriend, ex-wife, or co-workers. And regardless of how you feel about me, I love y #8217;all. ---- ^[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNoLockedThreads)</TEXT>
