    <TEXT>You raise in austere, repressive atmosphere of communism. You trade on black market just to get potato for family. One day, get immigration to come Canada. You want America, but is okay. Work many hard to give little Kripp opportunity. He is go to college on road to become Ph.D. like mother and father. But then drop out. You is worry, but is fine. Canada many welfare, he will not starve. He get dead-end job fixing computer while play game all night. Then, he say he is vegarino now, and you watch son starve into skellington. He quit his job to play computer more, tells you he make money. You watch him make many clicks with mouse and types many with keyboard. He seem to be very attentive. If he make money, you think, what problem is? But then something change. You go in room to bring lentil soup, he is at computer, but no more furious click and clack. He is stare at colorful square on screen while mutter, "Yeah, alright bro." and "I played that perfectly." You are confuse but continue watch. Each day his liveliness seem to diminish. His speech become more and more limited, and you worry brain damage from screen-light. Then one day, you go into room and he is gone. You think, "Where is?" You find out he is abduct by Succubus to Greek. You call and think at least he will have recover now from colorful square game. But when he answer phone, you ask how his day and reply,  #9745;  #8220;This guy's deck is CRAZY! #8221;  #9745;  #8220;My deck can't win against a deck like that #8221;  #9745; "He NEEDED precisely those two cards to win"  #9745;  #8220;He topdecked the only card that could beat me #8221;  #9745; "He had the perfect cards"  #9745;  #8220;There was nothing I could do #8221;  #9745;  #8220;I played that perfectly." You hang up phone and weep.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Presenting: GvG Ultra-Cancer Beastmaster Hunter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-09 12:48:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>So in Reynad's new Salty Town or whatever show he did a few days ago, Frodan mentioned that in internal play-testing, Blizzard had discovered that beast synergy in GvG was insane. Thus, I decided to make a beast deck and try it out on ladder. Currently I'm 8-0 with this deck, but I started at like 18 or something, so bear in mind results will probably not hold out. Still it's really fun and I think the concept has potential. But with everyone trying random crap, all-beast seems to be extremely effective. The opponents are trying all this fancy mech shit and they end up dead by turn 7. Secrets and weapons are useless. Mulligan hard for Call Pet and drop 2 mana High Manes or 0 mana other shit. It's really fun to play too. Here's the [decklist](https://i.imgur.com/6mkNSyd.jpg).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is the continent south of the current Draenor continent going to be added in a content patch?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-17 17:48:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just noticed off the south coast of the current Draenor continent there's another one. WoWPedia seems to indicate that's the Ogre homeland. It'd be pretty cool if there's still some of them giant Colossals there whose skeletons are in Gorgrond and Frostfire. It'd be a really cool world-boss. Was anything said at BlizzCon about that place?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How does EU4 decide a save is corrupted?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-25 03:48:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm playing a CK2-EU4 game and a bunch of my recent saves won't load because the game considers the save corrupted. But comparing them to saves from the same conversion that work in Notepad++, I can't find anything glaringly obvious, they seem fine. It's also deciding they're corrupted very quick, as soon as I click one, it instantly fails to load. Is it something with the checksum? edit: Found the solution in [this thread](http://steamcommunity.com/app/236850/discussions/0/626329186974386671/):  gt;That happens if description of one of the provinces is missing something, like "discovered_by=" or "add_core=" arguments. Then all the following (with higher ID number) provinces don't load. Basically you can look at what provinces were loaded, look up their IDs and see after which ID provinces were not loaded (takes a bit of searching in notepad++). Last loaded province will probably have something missing. Find the broken line, delete it or add something after =, save file, load game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Blizzard has Arena Rankings and Hafu knows them? (From Reynad-Hafu stream)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-25 09:00:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't know if this is something that's secret that Reynad and Hafu let slip or whether it's something that Hafu has discussed on her stream before, since I usually don't watch her. But apparently Blizzard has Arena Rankings and Hafu got to see them when she visited Blizzard and only 1 known Arena streamer is in the top 20, and Hafu bets "Reynad is lower ranked than Kripp." From the context, that means Kripp is the lowest ranked of the famous Arena streamers?</TEXT>
