    <TEXT>Basically, the movement is gone to a variety of reasons, at least in developed countries. Countries like Africa still have Anonymous, just far more loose compared to a few years back, based on my research.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But the fanbase left, because notice how it says "reddit" on the old person giving the kid, who is labeled "Phineas and Ferb" attention. it think it means that the OP doesn't think this show will ever have a fanbase again.

    <TEXT>We aren't saying DID isn't a legitimate concern, we're trying to say that not everyone with DID has a murderous alter. We're trying to say that the way media portrays us as, is false. You even said that " when \[the\] narrative dictates \[that the\] bad white men \[has\] cause\[d\] all \[the\] evil", but then you say "anyone whose dysfunction bothers 'normal' people should be viewed as \[the\] pariah" It's completely obvious what you're mad at. You're mad at the media for portraying white people as murders for some reason. Then, you turn around and say that anything that bothers "normal people" is viewed at as "the pariah." Not true, especially if you look at the media. For mental illnesses in media, there's [either romanticization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCWRQpfo4Q4), or the [mental illness in question being shown as a ticking-time bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFBbxvHWe_A).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, the image shows the group was founded, like, 8 years ago. Also, it's the internet. You should expect people to do this, mainly because trolls exist.</TEXT>
