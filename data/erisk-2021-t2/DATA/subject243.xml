    <TEXT>[.](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/cross_of_christ/) Has sin and lusts left a stain on and guilt in your life? Do you feel distant from God or aware that you are lost, that you have drifted away from Him? Have you had your sins forgiven and felt anew and clean again? Are you unsure of your destiny after death? Despite many people's familiarity with Christianity, few outside the faith understand the Gospel and mankind's need for salvation. I don't know who you are, or your background; maybe you don't have a Church background and have been sceptical of religion your entire life but you are searching to see if there is more to life. You may have even left the mainstream Churches and lived life your own way because of *Churchianity*, disagreements, a lack of spirituality or perhaps burdensome legalism. Whatever your reason(s), I believe that God brought you here to draw you to Himself and Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. We are in an age of confusion. We have more knowledge than ever but despite our knowledge, many are missing something in their lives. Outside of our relationships, life at times seems somewhat meaningless and cold, especially as we age and draw closer to death. Those that have taken an interest in religion in the past, may have found confusion, unable to ascertain who is right. Instead, I would like to contend that one can know if Christianity is true, if the Holy Spirit, a person of the Trinity, opens their eyes and heart by removing the blindfold of deception that has been wrapped around our eyes as a result of living in this world and in sin. Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)).  #8203; John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - **8** #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; **9** #160;not by works , so that no one can boast. Romans 3:21-26 - **21** #160;But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it #8212; **22** #160;the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: **23** #160;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, **24** #160;and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, **25** #160;whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. **26** #160;It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

    <DATE>2019-12-29 18:37:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Welcome to r/MotivatedChristians. We are a community of born-again Protestants (faith in Christ alone) who are seeking to honour God with our lives. Slothfulness and discouragement are not helping the advancement of the kingdom of heaven, and we seek individually to put off the distractions of the world and to get busy for Christ. Diligence and productivity are a requirement of the mature believer, and we as a community seek to inculcate these beliefs in our lives, so Christ may be known to unbelievers through us. Our partner sub-reddits are r/LivingChristianity and r/ChristianManliness. **Scriptures:**  #8203; * John 9:4 **4** #160;We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.  #8203; * 1 Corinthians 3:8-9 **8** #160;The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labour. **9** #160;For we are co-workers in God #8217;s service; you are God #8217;s field, God #8217;s building.  #8203; * 1 Thessalonians 5:12-14 **12** #160;Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. **13** #160;Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. **14** #160;And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.  #8203; * 1 Peter 3:16 **16** #160;keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.  #8203; * Proverbs 15:19 **19** #160;The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a level highway.  #8203; * Philippians 3:14 **14** #160;I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi folks. As many of you know, we live in strange and inverted times: western countries seem to be determined to undermine tradition and conservatism in society and in our churches. Gender relations have suffered immensely at the hands of gender deconstructionism and feminism. CMGTOW as an expedient life choice is becoming more popular as a reaction to the folly, but our development as men does not cease with temporary/permanent singleness: we have a duty to ourselves to become the man that God wants us to be and to resist any further increases in rot in society and in our churches. If you are interested in the wider and growing Christian manosphere, r/ChristianManliness may be a good point of contact, as well as some of the other subs suggested in the sidebar. We would be delighted if more join us so that we can improve and in a small way, drive a counter narrative. Many thanks and God bless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This community is dedicated to the learning of science and the advancement of the compatibility between science and Christian faith, with emphasis on Scripture. Nature is the handiwork of God the creator and a deeper knowledge of His creation will bring man closer to Him. It is through nature that we perceive the 'invisible attributes' of God, that leaves us without excuse.

    <TEXT> gt;The notion that the only rational beliefs are those that can be confirmed by scientific observation, experiment and measurement is yet another self-refuting proposition, since it is a statement that itself cannot be confirmed by scientific observation, experiment and measurement." **A Biblical Perspective on the Philosophy of Science**: [https://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Biblical%20Perspective%20on%20Philosophy%20of%20Science.pdf](https://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Biblical%20Perspective%20on%20Philosophy%20of%20Science.pdf) **A Christian Physicist Examines the Age of the Earth:** Dr. Steven Ball, [https://www.letu.edu/academics/arts-and-sciences/files/age-of-earth.pdf](https://www.letu.edu/academics/arts-and-sciences/files/age-of-earth.pdf) **The Perspectives of Individual Scientists and Commentators**: Francis Bacon: "Man by the Fall fell at the same time from the state of innocence and from his dominion over Creation.

    <TITLE>Historic British Protestantism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-03 12:58:27</DATE>
    <TEXT># Historic British Protestantism: * Freedom of the church from government authority and influence * Christians should be allowed to hold and practice their beliefs, with liberty of conscience, in positions of authority and power. * A belief in the compatibility of Christianity and liberty (liberty of conscience, labour, religion, speech, data etc.) and free enterprise (low taxation, small-scale capitalism, abolition of slavery and usury etc.) * The education of the clergy and the common man are vital pursuits. * The teaching of Protestant history and values in schools * Reformation of the Church and society should be sought after diligently * A nation under God, independent of foreign influence and secularism # Historic Protestant Doctrines: * The Holy Bible as the highest source of authority and truth * All men have sinned and require salvation * Sinful man is justified by faith in Christ alone. No works or sacraments can make a man righteous before God. Works are a fruit of salvation, not a pre-requisite. * Salvation is not found in a denomination, institution or church (e.g. RCC). It is found in Christ alone. * God hates idolatry and only He should be worshipped. Prayers are to God alone, in Christ's name. * The condemnation of man-made traditions that are apart from scripture. Jesus in Matthew 15:1-20, condemned the Pharisees for their man-made traditions that 'made void the word of God.' * God institutes authority and is above all earthly authority. Men submit to authority but answer to God alone. * The finality of Christ's atonement * There are only two sacraments: baptism and communion (Eucharist) * Men are called to be elders and ministers * Sexual expression is within marriage only, a life-long covenant before God * The church doesn't conform to this world but instead pursues the truth in God's word. The church cannot and will not submit to worldly ideologies and sinful doctrines. # A Defence of Protestantism and Simplified Apologetic of the Faith **Existence of God (apart from the Bible):** 1. The fine-tuning of the universe 2. The complexity of plant and animal life on earth ([response to evolution](https://wessexprotestant.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-false-dichotomy-and-reification-of.html)) 3. The sentience and consciousness of human beings 4. The 'initial singularity' and the origin of the universe **Faith (apart from the Bible):** 1. Experiential knowledge of God in nature - the 'invisible attributes' 2. Faith in a person or idea - the history and present reality of mankind is one of faith: faith in leaders, kings, politicians, philosophers, theories, celebrities etc. The limitation of reason and knowledge require us to have faith. 3. Experiential knowledge of God in Christ i.e. the regeneration of a soul upon faith in Christ and the fruits of salvation (peace, restored sensitivity of conscience, love for the brethren and lost, self-control etc.) 4. Spiritual instincts - the majority of people today either believe in God (Yahweh, Allah, Supreme Being), gods/deities/spirits (Hinduism, Paganism, Shamanism etc.) or an undetermined spiritual force in the universe (Ietsism). Individuals seek truth and meaning, often without being told to do so. 5. Experiential knowledge in death - believers see light and often have peace whereas unbelievers describe darkness and pain. **The Existence of the Supernatural:** 1. A blasphemous and anti-Christ spirit 2. A spirit of lawlessness (i.e. rebellion against God's commandments) 3. OBEs and NDEs 4. Reported demonology, occultism, and satanism **The Contents of the Bible:** 1. Scripture acknowledges and explains the existence of natural conscience - 'the law written onto our hearts' (Rom. 2:15) 2. Scripture accurately records historical events, even prophetically e.g. Daniel (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome), Gospels (Roman Empire) etc. 3. Scripture reveals accurately the path of descent of a nation e.g. St Paul in Romans 1 list the stages as unbelief, idolatry, sexual revolution, homosexual revolution, futile thinking, destruction 4. Scripture accurately lists the signs and fruit of salvation in the epistles of Paul and John 5. The authors of the gospels appeal to eye-witnesses 6. St Paul references many names, places, events that could have been fact-checked by many at the time and still serve as accuracies. 7. The fulfilment of hundreds of OT prophecies in the first coming of Christ and the fulfilment of many NT prophecies in Christ's ministry and since the ascension (Pentecost, destruction of the temple, persecution of the church, emergence of false messiahs, increase in multitude and magnitude of famines and earthquakes etc.) 8. The harmony and internal consistency of scripture despite the existence of trivial difficulties 9. Self-attestation - 2 Tim. 3:16 10. The limited variation in the gospel accounts 11. The feasibility of miracles if God exists 12. The feasibility and strong case for the resurrection of Christ #160; **The Translation of the Bible:** 1. Universal human experience, habitat and phenomena that language describes 2. The similarities between Koine Greek and English 3. Approximately only \~1% of NT 'words' remain in doubt - these are trivial matters such as punctation marks, capitalised letters, the ordering of words etc. 4. The similarity between the Byzantine and Alexandrian text-types - the similarity is estimated at \~85-92% 5. Access to a greater number of manuscripts and scrolls further gives cause for confidence. **The Formation of the Canon and the Norm of "scriptures":** 1. Everybody holds to "scriptures" - humans believe oral or written maxims despite the obvious fallibility of the authors 2. Written revelation makes sense - it is more efficient and reliable than oral tradition and if recorded once for all time, there is little need to repeat truth. 3. The earliest NT manuscripts are from the 2nd-century AD 4. Much of the NT can be reconstructed from the writings of the ECFs. 5. 21 of the 27 books of the NT were widely known and circulated by the mid-2nd century, even if the canon was finalised later (Michael Kruger). 6. The NT is the same for all major Christian traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox etc) 7. The NT canon was debated rigorously and due to the abundance of false letters, epistles were suspected rather than blindly admitted into the canon. The OT had the Great Assembly that finalised it for the dominant sects of Judaism. **Protestantism:** 1. *Prima Scriptura* ("scripture first). The Bible is the rule of faith and a plain reading of scripture informs tradition, practice and experience. 2 Tim. 3:15-16, John 17:17, Mark 7:9, 2. The doctrine of justification by faith alone e.g. John 3:16, Eph. 2:8-9, Rom. 3:22, Rom. 3:26, Rom. 3:28-30, Rom. 4:5, Heb. 2:4, Gal. 2:16 etc. 3. The existence of only two sacraments in scripture, baptism and communion e.g. Matt. 28:19, 1 Cor. 11:17-34 4. The Protestant OT is identical to the Hebrew Bible (i.e. the tanakh). No books are added in or taken away. 5. Jesus condemned man-made traditions. In Matthew 15:1-20, Jesus condemned the Pharisees saying; "so for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God." Protestantism has no popes, indulgences, idolatry of relics, claims of apostolic succession (except a minority of denominations), gospel of faith and works, merited grace, priestly forgiveness, purgatory, prayers to Mary and the saints, forced clerical celibacy, denial of assurance of salvation etc. 6. Protestantism has a good track record of righteousness and its social impact has been great. 7. The 'Body of Christ' is immaterial, invisible and not contained within any earthly institution. 8. The occurrence of revivals and great awakenings [Apologetic Materials](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingChristianity/comments/icxwby/apologetic_materials/) # What a Healthy Society Looks Like * Low levels of anxiety and depression * Low levels of adultery, relationship breakup and divorce. * Sex restrained and reserved for monogamous marriage. * High rates of literacy * Strong community and togetherness. A healthy and reasoned patriotism. * Respect for the elderly and dead * Healthy, informed, polite discourse between partisan groups. Low levels of internal strife. * Positive and constructive energy among the youth. * Relatively free speech and press * A flourishing non-state regulated religion and morality * A strong free-market private sector, unfettered by government regulations * Honesty and high-standards among politicians and leaders. * A creative and philanthropic  #233;lite class * The individual is valued in spite of the collective</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Personal Salvation by Grace through Faith in Christ</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-03 13:08:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>[.](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/cross_of_christ/) Has sin and lusts left a stain on and guilt in your life? Do you feel distant from God or aware that you are lost, that you have drifted away from Him? Have you had your sins forgiven and felt anew and clean again? Are you unsure of your destiny after death? Despite many people's familiarity with Christianity, few outside the faith understand the Gospel and mankind's need for salvation. I don't know who you are, or your background; maybe you don't have a Church background and have been sceptical of religion your entire life but you are searching to see if there is more to life. You may have even left the mainstream Churches and lived life your own way because of *Churchianity*, disagreements, a lack of spirituality or perhaps burdensome legalism. Whatever your reason(s), I believe that God brought you here to draw you to Himself and Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. We are in an age of confusion. We have more knowledge than ever but despite our knowledge, many are missing something in their lives. Outside of our relationships, life at times seems somewhat meaningless and cold, especially as we age and draw closer to death. Those that have taken an interest in religion in the past, may have found confusion, unable to ascertain who is right. Instead, I would like to contend that one can know if Christianity is true, if the Holy Spirit, a person of the Trinity, opens their eyes and heart by removing the blindfold of deception that has been wrapped around our eyes as a result of living in this world and in sin. Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)).  #8203; John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - 8 #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; 9 #160;not by works , so that no one can boast.</TEXT>

Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)).  #8203; John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - 8 #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; 9 #160;not by works , so that no one can boast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Although they knew God, they did not honour Him as God:** Romans 1:20-21 - **20** #160;For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. **21** #160;For although they knew God, they did not honour him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. **No one is righteous and all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God:** Romans 3:23 - **23** #160;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3:10-18 - **10** #160;as it is written:  #8220;None is righteous, no, not one; **11** #160; no one understands; no one seeks for God. **12** #160;All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. #8221; **13** #160; #8220;Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive. #8221;  #8220;The venom of asps is under their lips. #8221; **14** #160;  #8220;Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. #8221; **15** #160; #8220;Their feet are swift to shed blood; **16** #160; in their paths are ruin and misery, **17** #160;and the way of peace they have not known. #8221; **18** #160;  #8220;There is no fear of God before their eyes. #8221; **'All of us have become like one who is unclean':** Isaiah 64:6-7 - **6** We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. **7** #160;There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities. **'The wages of sin is death':** Romans 6:23 - **23** #160;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. **'It is the gift of God':** Ephesians 2:8-9 - **8** #160;For by grace you have been saved through faith.

God shows love to that individual at certain points in his lifetime. * TULIP and Calvinism * Total depravity - all men are sinful such that they cannot save themselves * Unconditional election - God *chooses* to give some people eternal life, *without* looking for anything good in them *as a condition* for loving and saving them. * Limited atonement - God died for the elect only (possibly the most controversial tenet of Calvinism) * Irresistible grace - an individual cannot resist God's saving grace administered through the gospel * Perseverance/preservation of the saints - God preserves His people so they can never be lost. * Triune God. God is one God in three persons: Father, Son and Spirit. They are co-eternal and of the same substance. * One must be 'born from above' (John 3) to gain eternal life and salvation. Rebirth happens when an individual repents (forsakes and hates their sin) and believes Christ died for their sins on the cross, confessing Him as Lord and Saviour. Salvation is found in in the person of Christ alone. * Works and deeds cannot save us from our sins. Nor is the combination of faith *plus* works satisfactory, for if salvation is partly of works, grace is diminished and made void (Rom.11:6). Rather, works are to be understood as the result of true saving faith, for saving faith always leads to good works (Eph. 2:10, James 2:14-26) * Sanctification as distinct from justification. God makes His elect more like His Son by removing the power of sin in their lives. * Communion and baptism as the only two sacraments * Prayers are to God alone, in Christ's name. * Sexual expression is within marriage only, a life-long covenant before God * Freedom of the church from state intervention. * Gymnobiblism -  #8216;God's Word should be freely accessible to every reader or hearer of ordinary intelligence, without requiring any special education * Scriptura sui ipsius interpres #160; #8211;  #8216;scripture interprets scripture #8217;, also called the  #8220;analogy of faith #8221; or the "law of non-contradiction." * Divine illumination * #8211;* #160;the Holy Spirit opens our eyes to the truth of Scripture * Christocentricism - the placing of Christ at the center of one's thought, actions, or theological system. * Perspicuity of Scripture - "...those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them" * Principle of Internal Consistency #160; #8211;  #8216;if God cannot lie, scripture cannot contradict scripture (when understood in its proper context) #8217; * Principle of Single Meaning #160; #8211; the belief that the author had one meaning in mind when writing a verse of scripture * Literalism #160; #8211; allegories are treated as allegories, analogies as analogies, history as history. * The Wax Nose - the idea that an interpreter of scripture can twist it (like a nose) to fit their agenda * Historical-grammatical hermeneutic - interpretation must be based on the author's intention of meaning and not the reader, historical context (author's life, culture, locality, religion etc.) and grammatical structure (verbs, adjectives, nouns), literary forms * Literary sensitivity #160;- be sensitive to the type of literature you are in e.g. law, narrative, wisdom, poetry, parable, epistle, apocalyptic etc. * The Laws of Logic and Evidence *-* #160;"What is the control we use to weed out false theological speculation? Certainly the control is logic and evidence #8230; interpreters who have not had the sharpening experience of logic #8230;may have improper notions of implication and evidence. Too frequently such a person uses a basis of appeal that is a notorious violation of the laws of logic and evidence."

    <TEXT>*VERSE 11. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.* The Apostle draws into his argument the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk: "The just shall live by his faith." This passage carries much weight because it eliminates the Law and the deeds of the Law as factors in the process of our justification. The scholastics misconstrue this passage by saying: "The just shall live by faith, if it is a working faith, or a faith formed and performed by charitable works." Their annotation is a forgery. To speak of formed or unformed faith, a sort of double faith, is contrary to the Scriptures. If charitable works can form and perfect faith I am forced to say eventually that charitable deeds constitute the essential factor in the Christian religion. Christ and His benefits would be lost to us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MANSFIELD'S #3 MAXIM:  gt;We are changed. We craft a contagious culture. People feed on this culture and change the world. "I believe it is exactly the same with the making of men. We can inspire and teach men with study #8212;with words, books, and classes. We can only make men, though, in the contagious culture created by other genuine men. The good news is this happens naturally. Put a young, unformed man in the presence of older men, and the process automatically begins. It is simply the outworking of the way men are made. The young man watches. He listens. He ponders. Soon, he becomes what he beholds. He starts patterning himself, almost without intending to, after these impressive older men. This can happen without the older men intentionally teaching a lesson or addressing the younger man directly. It is a result of the contagious power of genuine manhood and the way men intuitively absorb the manly culture."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Personal Salvation in Christ - A Spiritual Birth from Above</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-06 13:23:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>[.](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/cross_of_christ/) Has sin and lusts left a stain on and guilt in your life? Do you feel distant from God or aware that you are lost, that you have drifted away from Him? Have you had your sins forgiven and felt anew and clean again? Are you unsure of your destiny after death? Despite many people's familiarity with Christianity, few outside the faith understand the Gospel and mankind's need for salvation. I don't know who you are, or your background; maybe you don't have a Church background and have been sceptical of religion your entire life but you are searching to see if there is more to life. You may have even left the mainstream Churches and lived life your own way because of *Churchianity*, disagreements, a lack of spirituality or perhaps burdensome legalism. Whatever your reason(s), I believe that God brought you here to draw you to Himself and Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. We are in an age of confusion. We have more knowledge than ever but despite our knowledge, many are missing something in their lives. Outside of our relationships, life at times seems somewhat meaningless and cold, especially as we age and draw closer to death. Those that have taken an interest in religion in the past, may have found confusion, unable to ascertain who is right. Instead, I would like to contend that one can know if Christianity is true, if the Holy Spirit, a person of the Trinity, opens their eyes and heart by removing the blindfold of deception that has been wrapped around our eyes as a result of living in this world and in sin. Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)).  #8203; John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - **8** #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; **9** #160;not by works , so that no one can boast. Romans 3:21-26 - **21** #160;But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it #8212; **22** #160;the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: **23** #160;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, **24** #160;and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, **25** #160;whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. **26** #160;It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

    <TEXT>**A REAL MAN** Men are of two kinds, and he Was of the kind I #8217;d like to be. Some preach their virtues, and a few Express their lives by what they do. That sort was he. No flowery phrase Or glibly spoken words of praise Won friends for him. He wasn #8217;t cheap Or shallow, but his course ran deep, And it was pure. You know the kind. Not many in a life you find Whose deeds outrun their words so far That more than what they seem they are.  #8203; There are two kinds of lies as well: The kind you live, the ones you tell. Back through his years from age to youth He never acted one untruth. Out in the open light he fought And didn #8217;t care what others thought Nor what they said about his fight If he believed that he was right. The only deeds he ever hid Were acts of kindness that he did.  #8203; What speech he had was plain and blunt. His was an unattractive front. Yet children loved him; babe and boy Played with the strength he could employ, Without one fear, and they are fleet To sense injustice and deceit. No back door gossip linked his name With any shady tale of shame. He did not have to compromise With evil-doers, shrewd and wise, And let them ply their vicious trade Because of some past escapade.  #8203; Men are of two kinds, and he Was of the kind I #8217;d like to be. No door at which he ever knocked Against his manly form was locked. If ever man on earth was free And independent, it was he. No broken pledge lost him respect, He met all men with head erect, And when he passed, I think there went A soul to yonder firmament So white, so splendid and so fine It came almost to God #8217;s design. ** #8212;EDGAR A.

There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"I have come to the conclusion; may God give me strength to keep it! *Stop all newspapers*. It is no use mincing the matter; as the disease is dire, so also must be the remedy. These are the words which have done this: "My son, unglue thyself from the world and its vanities. Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, find Him thy wisdom, righteousness, redemption, thy riches, thy strength, thy glory" (*Christ Mystical*). Somehow I thought it must come to this ere long. If I ever need to know, or give my opinion on any subject, then Christ will give me the necessary wisdom. Newspapers feed a passion I have for giving my opinion; therefore, as we have no right to judge and have nothing to do with this world (of which we are not), this feeding must be cut short."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Protestantism is the belief that God saves us through faith in Christ, and in that respect is a 'soft conservatism': there is a moral Law but there is forgiveness for transgressors. I would argue that the Protestants were traditional in that they 'got back' to Scripture and did away with new traditions that have invaded society in the 16th century. It is true that without the Reformation, the Enlightenment and subsequent philosophies, could have have happened, but one cannot hold the Reformers responsible for men deciding to later rebel against Holy Writ. No-one can create a perfect system that prevents trouble later on. Just look at the Founding Fathers of America. I like your thinking, but I conclude differently.</TEXT>

Enough for the day is its evil. Let us lift up those who mourn to look beyond the grave and this world to that home where there will be no sorrow.

A great thing with merchants is to make a good investment, and so we ought to act with God; if we venture little we shall gain little, and the reverse if we venture much. It is true that after a time one gets quite accustomed to trust God, to get experience that He is trustworthy; but if we do not try Him, we shall never know it. How full the world is of religious talk, and how little is known of truly trusting Him! It is a gift; but we ought to exercise it so as to strengthen it. The events of life have less to do with us than we imagine; you may say this or that, but its effect will depend on God; whatever we say is overruled by Him.

    <TEXT>You have no cause to apologise, and I am extremely grateful for your insight, an insight that many people share I'm sure. For the sake of Christ and His world in which we are placed, one way or another we need to find a way out of this situation in which we are now in. The first stage is identifying the problem, which many in the churches refuse to do, and part of identifying it is to understand how it came to be. I'm curious as to what core distorted teachings were responsible, and certainly the subjects of "order" and "submission" are included in that. If we can correctly identify the rest, I'm hopeful for a resurgence of faith. God bless you.</TEXT>

Hurrah for the manly man who comes with sunlight on his face, And the strength to do and the will to dare and the courage to find his place! The world delights in the manly man, and the weak and evil flee When the manly man goes forth to hold his own on land or sea!  #8212;AUTHOR UNKNOWN</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Q. How do you come to know your misery?** A. The law of God tells me.^(1) ^(1 #160;Rom. 3:20; 7:7-25) **Q. What does God's law require of us?** A. Christ teaches us this in summary in Matthew 22:37-40:  #8220; #8216;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. #8217; ^(1) This is the greatest and first commandment.  #8220;And a second is like it:  #8216;You shall love your neighbor as yourself. #8217;^(2) #8220;On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. #8221; ^(1 Deut. 6:5) ^(2 Lev. 19:18) **Q. Can you live up to all this perfectly?** A. No.^(1) I have a natural tendency to hate God and my neighbour.^(2) ^(1 Rom. 3:9-20, 23; 1 John 1:8, 10) ^(2 Gen. 6:5; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:23-24; 8:7; Eph. 2:1-3; Tit. 3:3) **Q. Did God create people so wicked and perverse?** A. No. God created them good^(1) and in his image,^(2) that is, in true righteousness and holiness,^(3) so that they might truly know God their creator,^(4) love him with all their heart, and live with God in eternal happiness, to praise and glorify him.^(5) ^(1 Gen. 1:31) ^(2 Gen. 1:26-27) ^(3 Eph. 4:24) ^(4 Col. 3:10) ^(5 Ps. 8) **Q. Then where does this corrupt human nature come from?** A. The fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise.^(1) This fall has so poisoned our nature^(2) that we are all conceived and born in a sinful condition.^(3) ^(1 Gen. 3) ^(2 Rom. 5:12, 18-19) ^(3 Ps. 51:5) **Q. But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined toward all evil?** A. Yes,^(1) unless we are born again by the Spirit of God.^(2) ^(1 Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Job 14:4; Isa. 53:6) ^(2 John 3:3-5) #160; **Q. Does God permit such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?** A. #160;Certainly not. God is terribly angry with the sin we are born with as well as the sins we personally commit. As a just judge, God will punish them both now and in eternity,^(1) having declared:  #8220;Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law. #8221;^(2) ^(1 Ex. 34:7; Ps. 5:4-6; Nah. 1:2; Rom. 1:18; Eph. 5:6; Heb. 9:27) ^(2 Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26) **Q. But isn't God also merciful?** A. #160;God is certainly merciful,^(1) but also just. ^(2) God #8217;s justice demands that sin, committed against his supreme majesty, be punished with the supreme penalty #8212; eternal punishment of body and soul.^(3) ^(1 Ex. 34:6-7; Ps. 103:8-9) ^(2 Ex. 34:7; Deut. 7:9-11; Ps. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:30-31) ^(3 Matt. 25:35-46) **Q. #160;According to God #8217;s righteous judgement #160;we deserve punishment both now and in eternity: how then can we escape this punishment and return to God #8217;s favour?** A. #160;God requires that his justice be satisfied.^(1) Therefore the claims of this justice must be paid in full, either by ourselves or by another.^(2) ^(1 Ex. 23:7; Rom. 2:1-11) ^(2 Isa. 53:11; Rom. 8:3-4) **Q. Can we make this payment ourselves?** A. #160;Certainly not. Actually, we increase our debt every day.^(1) ^(1 Matt. 6:12; Rom. 2:4-5) **Q. #160;Can another creature #8212;any at all #8212; pay this debt for us?** A. #160;No. To begin with, God will not punish any other creature for what a human is guilty of.^(1)Furthermore, no mere creature can bear the weight of God #8217;s eternal wrath against sin and deliver others from it.^(2) ^(1 Ezek. 18:4, 20; Heb. 2:14-18) ^(2 Ps. 49:7-9; 130:3) **Q. What kind of mediator and deliverer should we look for then?** A. One who is a true^(1) and righteous^(2) human, yet more powerful than all creatures, that is, one who is also true God.3 ^(1 Rom. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:17) ^(2 Isa. 53:9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26) ^(3 Isa. 7:14; 9:6; Jer. 23:6; John 1:1) **Q. #160;Why must the mediator be a true and righteous human?** A. #160;God #8217;s justice demands that human nature, which has sinned, must pay for sin;^(1) but a sinful human could never pay for others.^(2) ^(1 Rom. 5:12, 15; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:14-16) ^(2 Heb. 7:26-27; 1 Pet. 3:18) **Q. #160;Why must the mediator also be true God?** #160; A. #160;So that the mediator, by the power of his divinity, might bear the weight of God #8217;s wrath in his humanity and earn for us and restore to us righteousness and life.^(1) ^(1 Isa. 53; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:21) **Q. #160;Then who is this mediator #8212; true God and at the same time a true and righteous human?** A. #160;Our Lord Jesus Christ,^(1) who was given to us to completely deliver us and make us right with God.^(2) ^(1 Matt. 1:21-23; Luke 2:11; 1 Tim. 2:5) ^(2 1 Cor. 1:30) **Q. How do you come to know this?** A. #160;The holy gospel tells me. God began to reveal the gospel already in Paradise;^(1) later God proclaimed it by the holy patriarchs^(2) and prophets^(3) #160;and foreshadowed it by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law;^(4) and finally God fulfilled it through his own beloved Son.^(5) ^(1 Gen. 3:15) ^(2 Gen. 22:18; 49:10) ^(3 Isa. 53; Jer. 23:5-6; Mic. 7:18-20; Acts 10:43; Heb. 1:1-2) ^(4 Lev. 1-7; John 5:46; Heb. 10:1-10) ^(5 Rom. 10:4; Gal. 4:4-5; Col. 2:17) **Q. #160;Are all people then saved through Christ just as they were lost through Adam?** A. #160;No. Only those are saved who through true faith are grafted into Christ and accept all his benefits.^(1) ^(1 Matt. 7:14; John 3:16, 18, 36; Rom. 11:16-21) #160; **Q. What is true faith?** A. #160;True faith is not only a sure knowledge by which I hold as true all that God has revealed to us in Scripture;^(1) it is also a wholehearted trust,^(2) which the Holy Spirit creates in me^(3) by the gospel,^(4) that God has freely granted, not only to others but to me also,^(5) forgiveness of sins, eternal righteousness, and salvation.^(6) These are gifts of sheer grace, granted solely by Christ #8217;s merit.^(7) ^(1 John 17:3, 17; Heb. 11:1-3; James 2:19) ^(2 Rom. 4:18-21; 5:1; 10:10; Heb. 4:14-16) ^(3 Matt. 16:15-17; John 3:5; Acts 16:14) ^(4 Rom. 1:16; 10:17; 1 Cor. 1:21) ^(5 Gal. 2:20) ^(6 Rom. 1:17; Heb. 10:10) ^(7 Rom. 3:21-26; Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8-10) **Q. What then must a Christian believe?** A. #160;All that is promised us in the gospel,^(1) a summary of which is taught us in the articles of our universal and undisputed Christian faith. ^(1 Matt. 28:18-20; John 20:30-31) **Q. What are these articles?** A. #160; #160;I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.</TEXT>

No.^(1) I have a natural tendency to hate God and my neighbour.^(2) ^(1 Rom. 3:9-20, 23; 1 John 1:8, 10) ^(2 Gen. 6:5; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:23-24; 8:7; Eph. 2:1-3; Tit. 3:3) **Q. Did God create people so wicked and perverse?** A. No. God created them good^(1) and in his image,^(2) that is, in true righteousness and holiness,^(3) so that they might truly know God their creator,^(4) love him with all their heart, and live with God in eternal happiness, to praise and glorify him.^(5) ^(1 Gen. 1:31) ^(2 Gen. 1:26-27) ^(3 Eph. 4:24) ^(4 Col. 3:10) ^(5 Ps. 8) **Q. Then where does this corrupt human nature come from?** A. The fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise.^(1) This fall has so poisoned our nature^(2) that we are all conceived and born in a sinful condition.^(3) ^(1 Gen. 3) ^(2 Rom. 5:12, 18-19) ^(3 Ps. 51:5) **Q. But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined toward all evil?** A. Yes,^(1) unless we are born again by the Spirit of God.^(2) ^(1 Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Job 14:4; Isa. 53:6) ^(2 John 3:3-5) #160; **Q. Does God permit such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?** A. #160;Certainly not. God is terribly angry with the sin we are born with as well as the sins we personally commit. As a just judge, God will punish them both now and in eternity,^(1) having declared:  #8220;Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of the law. #8221;^(2) ^(1 Ex. 34:7; Ps. 5:4-6; Nah. 1:2; Rom. 1:18; Eph. 5:6; Heb. 9:27) ^(2 Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26) **Q. But isn't God also merciful?** A. #160;God is certainly merciful,^(1) but also just. ^(2) God #8217;s justice demands that sin, committed against his supreme majesty, be punished with the supreme penalty #8212; eternal punishment of body and soul.^(3) ^(1 Ex. 34:6-7; Ps. 103:8-9) ^(2 Ex. 34:7; Deut. 7:9-11; Ps. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:30-31) ^(3 Matt. 25:35-46) **Q. #160;According to God #8217;s righteous judgement #160;we deserve punishment both now and in eternity: how then can we escape this punishment and return to God #8217;s favour?** A. #160;God requires that his justice be satisfied.^(1) Therefore the claims of this justice must be paid in full, either by ourselves or by another.^(2) ^(1 Ex. 23:7; Rom. 2:1-11) ^(2 Isa. 53:11; Rom. 8:3-4) **Q. Can we make this payment ourselves?** A. #160;Certainly not. Actually, we increase our debt every day.^(1) ^(1 Matt. 6:12; Rom. 2:4-5) **Q. #160;Can another creature #8212;any at all #8212; pay this debt for us?** A. #160;No. To begin with, God will not punish any other creature for what a human is guilty of.^(1)Furthermore, no mere creature can bear the weight of God #8217;s eternal wrath against sin and deliver others from it.^(2) ^(1 Ezek. 18:4, 20; Heb. 2:14-18) ^(2 Ps. 49:7-9; 130:3) **Q. What kind of mediator and deliverer should we look for then?** A. One who is a true^(1) and righteous^(2) human, yet more powerful than all creatures, that is, one who is also true God.3 ^(1 Rom. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:17) ^(2 Isa. 53:9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26) ^(3 Isa. 7:14; 9:6; Jer. 23:6; John 1:1) **Q. #160;Why must the mediator be a true and righteous human?** A. #160;God #8217;s justice demands that human nature, which has sinned, must pay for sin;^(1) but a sinful human could never pay for others.^(2) ^(1 Rom. 5:12, 15; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:14-16) ^(2 Heb. 7:26-27; 1 Pet. 3:18) **Q. #160;Why must the mediator also be true God?** #160; A. #160;So that the mediator, by the power of his divinity, might bear the weight of God #8217;s wrath in his humanity and earn for us and restore to us righteousness and life.^(1) ^(1 Isa. 53; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:21) **Q. #160;Then who is this mediator #8212; true God and at the same time a true and righteous human?** A. #160;Our Lord Jesus Christ,^(1) who was given to us to completely deliver us and make us right with God.^(2) ^(1 Matt. 1:21-23; Luke 2:11; 1 Tim. 2:5) ^(2 1 Cor. 1:30) **Q. How do you come to know this?** A. #160;The holy gospel tells me. God began to reveal the gospel already in Paradise;^(1) later God proclaimed it by the holy patriarchs^(2) and prophets^(3) #160;and foreshadowed it by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law;^(4) and finally God fulfilled it through his own beloved Son.^(5) ^(1 Gen. 3:15) ^(2 Gen. 22:18; 49:10) ^(3 Isa. 53; Jer. 23:5-6; Mic. 7:18-20; Acts 10:43; Heb. 1:1-2) ^(4 Lev. 1-7; John 5:46; Heb. 10:1-10) ^(5 Rom. 10:4; Gal. 4:4-5; Col. 2:17) **Q. #160;Are all people then saved through Christ just as they were lost through Adam?** A. #160;No. Only those are saved who through true faith are grafted into Christ and accept all his benefits.^(1) ^(1 Matt. 7:14; John 3:16, 18, 36; Rom. 11:16-21) #160; **Q. What is true faith?** A. #160;True faith is not only a sure knowledge by which I hold as true all that God has revealed to us in Scripture;^(1) it is also a wholehearted trust,^(2) which the Holy Spirit creates in me^(3) by the gospel,^(4) that God has freely granted, not only to others but to me also,^(5) forgiveness of sins, eternal righteousness, and salvation.^(6) These are gifts of sheer grace, granted solely by Christ #8217;s merit.^(7) ^(1 John 17:3, 17; Heb. 11:1-3; James 2:19) ^(2 Rom. 4:18-21; 5:1; 10:10; Heb. 4:14-16) ^(3 Matt. 16:15-17; John 3:5; Acts 16:14) ^(4 Rom. 1:16; 10:17; 1 Cor. 1:21) ^(5 Gal. 2:20) ^(6 Rom. 1:17; Heb. 10:10) ^(7 Rom. 3:21-26; Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8-10) **Q. What then must a Christian believe?** A. #160;All that is promised us in the gospel,^(1) a summary of which is taught us in the articles of our universal and undisputed Christian faith. ^(1 Matt. 28:18-20; John 20:30-31) **Q. What are these articles?** A. #160; #160;I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Born from Above through Repentance and Faith in Christ</TITLE>

    <TEXT>[.](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/cross_of_christ/) Has sin and lusts left a stain on and guilt in your life? Do you feel distant from God or aware that you are lost, that you have drifted away from Him? Have you had your sins forgiven and felt anew and clean again? Are you unsure of your destiny after death? Despite many people's familiarity with Christianity, few outside the faith understand the Gospel and mankind's need for salvation. I don't know who you are, or your background; maybe you don't have a Church background and have been sceptical of religion your entire life but you are searching to see if there is more to life. You may have even left the mainstream Churches and lived life your own way because of *Churchianity*, disagreements, a lack of spirituality or perhaps burdensome legalism. Whatever your reason(s), I believe that God brought you here to draw you to Himself and Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. We are in an age of confusion. We have more knowledge than ever but despite our knowledge, many are missing something in their lives. Outside of our relationships, life at times seems somewhat meaningless and cold, especially as we age and draw closer to death. Those that have taken an interest in religion in the past, may have found confusion, unable to ascertain who is right. Instead, I would like to contend that one can know if Christianity is true, if the Holy Spirit, a person of the Trinity, opens their eyes and heart by removing the blindfold of deception that has been wrapped around our eyes as a result of living in this world and in sin. Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)). This piece is nothing more than a sign-posting towards Christ. See Him as the focus and those who seek Him, He will know Him. John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - 8 #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; 9 #160;not by works , so that no one can boast.  #8203; Salvation is: * from sin * after and during repentance * by grace * through faith * with assurance * to holiness * for eternity</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Beginning of the 1859 Revival (Answers to Prayer, by George M #252;ller)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-08 19:33:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>**THE BEGINNING OF THE 1859 REVIVAL. (*****Answers to Prayer*****, by George M #252;ller)** "In November, 1856, a young Irishman, Mr. James McQuilkin, was brought to the knowledge of the Lord. Soon after his conversion he saw my Narrative advertised, viz.: the first two volumes of this book. He had a great desire to read it, and procured it accordingly, about January, 1857. God blessed it greatly to his soul, especially in showing to him, what could be obtained by prayer. He said to himself something like this: 'See what Mr. M #252;ller obtains simply by prayer. Thus I may obtain blessing by prayer.' He now set himself to pray, that the Lord would give him a spiritual companion, one who knew the Lord. Soon after he became acquainted with a young man who was a believer. These two began a prayer-meeting in one of the Sunday Schools in the parish of Connor. Having his prayer answered in obtaining a spiritual companion, Mr. James McQuilkin asked the Lord to lead him to become acquainted with some more of His hidden ones. Soon after the Lord gave him two more young men, who were believers previously, as far as he could judge. In Autumn, 1857, Mr. James McQuilkin stated to these three\[Pg 78\] young men, given him in answer to believing prayer, what blessing he had derived from my Narrative, how it had led him to see the power of believing prayer; and he proposed that they should meet for prayer to seek the Lord's blessing upon their various labours in the Sunday Schools, prayer-meetings, and preaching of the Gospel. Accordingly in Autumn, 1857, these four young men met together for prayer in a small school-house near the village of Kells, in the parish of Connor, every Friday evening. By this time the great and mighty working of the Spirit, in 1857, in the United States, had become known, and Mr. James McQuilkin said to himself, 'Why may not we have such a blessed work here, seeing that God did such great things for Mr. M #252;ller, simply in answer to prayer.' On January 1, 1858, the Lord gave them the first remarkable answer to prayer in the conversion of a farm servant. He was taken into the number, and thus there were five who gave themselves to prayer. Shortly after, another young man, about 20 years old, was converted; there were now six. This greatly encouraged the other three who first had met with Mr. James McQuilkin. Others now were converted, who were also taken into the number; but only believers were admitted to these fellowship meetings, in which they read, prayed, and offered to each other a few thoughts from the Scriptures. These meetings and others for the preaching of the Gospel were held in the parish of Connor, Antrim, Ireland. Up to this time all was going on\[Pg 79\] most quietly, though many souls were converted, There were no physical prostrations, as afterwards. "About Christmas, 1858, a young man, from Ahoghill, who had come to live at Connor, and who had been converted through this little company of believers, went to see his friends at Ahoghill, and spoke to them about their own souls, and the work of God at Connor. His friends desired to see some of these converts. Accordingly Mr. James McQuilkin, with two of the first who met for prayer, went on February 2, 1859, and held a meeting at Ahoghill in one of the Presbyterian Churches. Some believed, some mocked, and others thought there was a great deal of presumption in these young converts; yet many wished to have another meeting. This was held by the same three young men on February 16th, 1859; and now the Spirit of God began to work, and to work mightily. Souls were converted, and from that time conversions multiplied rapidly. Some of these converts went to other places, and carried the spiritual fire, so to speak, with them. The blessed work of the spirit of God spread in *many places*. #8212;On April 5th, 1859, Mr. James McQuilkin went to Ballymena, held a meeting there in one of the Presbyterian Churches; and on April 11th held another meeting in another of the Presbyterian churches. Several were convinced of sin and the work of the Spirit of God went forward in Ballymena. #8212;On May 28th, 1859, he went to Belfast. During the first week there were meetings held in five different Presbyterian\[Pg 80\] Churches, and from that time the blessed work commenced at Belfast. In all these visits he was accompanied and helped by Mr. Jeremiah Meneely, one of the three young men who first met with him, after the reading of my Narrative. From this time the work of the Holy Ghost spread further and further; for the young converts were used by the Lord to carry the truth from one place to another. "Such was the *beginning* of that mighty work of the Holy Spirit, which has led to the conversion of hundreds of thousands; for some of my readers will remember how in 1859 this fire was kindled in England, Wales and Scotland; how it spread through Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland; how the Continent of Europe was more or less partaking of this mighty working of the Holy Spirit; how it led thousands to give themselves to the work of Evangelists; and how up to the year 1874 not only the effects of this work, first begun in Ireland, are felt, but that still more or less this blessed work is going on in Europe generally. It is almost needless to add, that in no degree the honour is due to the instruments, but to the Holy Spirit alone; yet these facts are stated, in order that it may be seen, what delight God has in answering abundantly the believing prayer of His children."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Works and deeds cannot save us from our sins: they contribute nothing to our salvation. Salvation is a gift of grace in spite of our misdeeds, for if salvation was of works or partly of works, grace would be made void (Rom.11:6). Salvation is through faith alone: it is by belief that one receives the forgiveness found in Christ, and this faith itself is a 'gift of God, thereby not a work of man. However, this faith that saves is not alone, this faith, a living faith, will certainly yield good works and good 'fruit'. As John Wesley wrote, "faith that does not begin alone does not begin, but faith that ends alone ends."</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The statesman debating in Parliament; the conqueror changing the fate of nations on bloody battle-fields; these all do their work; and are needful, doubtless, in a sinful, piecemeal world like this. #160; But there are those of whom the noisy world never hears, who have chosen the better part which shall not be taken from them; who enter into a higher glory than that of statesmen, or conquerors, or the successful and famous of the earth. #160; Many a man #8212;clergyman or layman #8212;struggling in poverty and obscurity, with daily toil of body and mind, to make his fellow-creatures better and happier; many a poor woman, bearing children in pain and sorrow, and bringing them up with pain and sorrow, but in industry, too, and piety; or submitting without complaint to a brutal husband; or sacrificing all her own hopes in life to feed and educate her brothers and sisters; or enduring for years the peevishness and troublesomeness of some relation; #8212;all these (and the world which God sees is full of such, though the world which man sees takes no note of them) #8212;gentle souls, humble souls, uncomplaining souls, suffering souls, pious souls #8212;these are God #8217;s elect; these are Christ #8217;s sheep; these are the salt of the earth, who, by doing each their little duty as unto God, not unto men, keep society from decaying more than do all the constitutions and acts of parliament which statesmen ever invented. #160; These are they #8212;though they little dream of any such honour #8212;who copy the likeness of the old martyrs, who did well and suffered for it; and the likeness of Christ, of whom it was said,  #8216;He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall his voice be heard in the streets. #8217; Charles Kingsley, *Discipline*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>N. B. If this post is still pinned, then the opportunity is still open. If you would like to become a mod and want to help create a better sense of community here, then feel free to privately message u/subject243. Pre-conditions for Prospective Mods: 1. Been a Christian for some time 2. Holds to scripture as the 'rule of faith' 3. Have some manful interests (literature, sports, DIY, dating, films etc.) and life experience worth sharing 4. Have some ideas about the community's aims, focuses and resources 5. We would particularly like you if you have extensive knowledge of the muscular Christian movement. If you know and have read literature by some of the Victorian era such as Kingsley, Emerson, Arnold or Moody, then we would value your input greatly. Because we are a Protestant community, devoted to scripture, the following positions (meant to be as accommodating as possible) may serve as some theological expectations if you will: 1. Doctrine of a spiritual birth and justification by faith alone through faith in Christ 2. Scriptural sexual conservatism 3. Belief that Churches need to reengage men 4. Doesn't divide over Calvinism or Arminianism: these are secondary issues to the gospel and manfulness. 5. Opposition to divisive ideologies e.g. (Cultural) Marxism, racialism, gender politics etc. All the best.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Salvation by Grace through Faith in Christ</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 20:34:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>[.](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/cross_of_christ/) Has sin and lusts left a stain on and guilt in your life? Do you feel distant from God or aware that you are lost, that you have drifted away from Him? Have you had your sins forgiven and felt anew and clean again? Are you unsure of your destiny after death? Despite many people's familiarity with Christianity, few outside the faith understand the Gospel and mankind's need for salvation. I don't know who you are, or your background; maybe you don't have a Church background and have been sceptical of religion your entire life but you are searching to see if there is more to life. You may have even left the mainstream Churches and lived life your own way because of *Churchianity*, disagreements, a lack of spirituality or perhaps burdensome legalism. Whatever your reason(s), I believe that God brought you here to draw you to Himself and Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. We are in an age of confusion. We have more knowledge than ever but despite our knowledge, many are missing something in their lives. Outside of our relationships, life at times seems somewhat meaningless and cold, especially as we age and draw closer to death. Those that have taken an interest in religion in the past, may have found confusion, unable to ascertain who is right. Instead, I would like to contend that one can know if Christianity is true, if the Holy Spirit, a person of the Trinity, opens their eyes and heart by removing the blindfold of deception that has been wrapped around our eyes as a result of living in this world and in sin. Millions of people down the centuries have come to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, who really did die for our sins. If I can, I would like to offer you the chance to hear the 'old story', of Jesus and His love. By way of personal testimony, I too was lost in sin and under guilt. Because of my deeds, I felt real emptiness inside and didn't really feel like I had any reason to be happy or joyful. This guilt I carried around with me for many months before I finally realised that God had made a way for me, a sinner, to be at peace with Him, and this was through what Christ achieved on the cross. In the moment of realisation, I felt the guilt lift instantly, and happiness like no other, filled me inside. Since then I have been able to make the changes that I needed and wanted to make, but never could because I was a slave to my desires and unbelief. This experiential knowledge, the revelation of Jesus Christ in scripture, archaeological evidence and reason all compel me to communicate the same message to you so that you can come to believe that Jesus Christ died even for your sins. # Christ Today in the West, despite many centuries of Christian influence, little is actually known about Jesus, who He was and what he taught, even in mainstream Christianity. Jesus taught that he was the embodiment of all truth (John 14:6), that He was the predicted Messiah (not just of Israel but of the whole world) and that He was God in the 'flesh'. Jesus revealed the truth of God often in short stories (parables) to the crowds and to His disciples. However, despite the brilliance of His parables, His primary objective was to come to Earth to save sinners: save them from their sins and eternal punishment. Jesus is what the Bible is all pointing to, Old Testament (sometimes called 'the Law') and New Testament. Roughly two thousand years ago, Christ came to us, mankind. God in human form. # Mankind Mankind (every human) has a spiritual infection. We intuitively know that there is something within all of us that compels us to rebel against the commands of God: to hate, to quarrel, to lie, to steal, to engage in sexual immorality. We sin against God, all of us ([Rom. 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23 amp;version=NIV)). We justify it to ourselves: "its only a white lie", "they deserved it" or "I just couldn't help myself." Everyday we trade the glory of God and the result is spiritual dissatisfaction. We can act as if we are complete, but we know we aren't, we know we are restless and we feel alone. Our dissatisfaction is troubling, but our destiny confounds us. Everyone asks what the future may hold for them, but often we neglect the possibility of future beyond the grave. According to Christ, the soul within us continues beyond the grave, and since God exists and is holy, we have a dilemma; will God accept us and show forgiveness? Where we might stand before Him should press our consciences. This meeting we will have is inevitable and cannot be missed. The truth is, God created man perfect. Man enjoyed peace, joy, love and wholeness. He was lacking in nothing. He walked with God and was at peace with God. Yet man in his foolishness rebelled against God. Adam chose to break the commandment of God ("thou shalt not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"), and sin and death entered the human race ([Rom. 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12 amp;version=NIV)), and everyone born after is guilty, not because of Adam's deed, but because of each person's individual rebellion. We all have all broken the commandments of God, and the Law which He gave us through Moses, is mocked and ridiculed. But "God is not mocked." God must expel and punish lawbreakers unless He compromise His own holiness. This is the most awful prospect, to be cast out of the presence of God for our deeds and actions because we failed to live up to His expectations. Every verdict will be just and there will be no repeal. Who can stand before Him and remain? (Psa. 76) In ourselves, this judgement is unavoidable. We cannot undo our sins. The solution must come from outside, eternal help from without. Yet, there needs to be signs of repentance (attempts to stop practices of sin). Truly, unless repentance comes first, one cannot inherit God's eternal life. # Nicodemus - Born Again of the Spirit Before moving onto the scriptural text in question, let us have some background information. Nicodemus was a Jew who studied the Scriptures and strived to be good. He was a Pharisee (a dominant religious sect of Judaism), fasted twice a week, gave money to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) and studied and followed the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Yet, despite all this, he visited Jesus one night, unsure of his eternal destiny, spiritual understanding and very conscious of his shortcomings. We read about this meeting in John 3:1-21. Let us read reverently for "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" ([Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A17 amp;version=NIV)) **John 3:1-15 (ESV)** **3** Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. **2** He came to Jesus at night and said,  #8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him. #8221; **3** Jesus replied,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, **no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again**. #8221; **4**  #8220;How can someone be born when they are old? #8221; Nicodemus asked.  #8220;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother #8217;s womb to be born! #8221; **5** Jesus answered,  #8220;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are **born of water and the Spirit**. **6** Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. **7** You should not be surprised at my saying,  #8216;**You must be born again**. #8217; **8** The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit. #8221; **9**  #8220;How can this be? #8221; Nicodemus asked. **10**  #8220;You are Israel #8217;s teacher, #8221; said Jesus,  #8220;and do you not understand these things? **11** Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. **12** I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? **13** No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven #8212;the Son of Man. **14** Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, **15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him**. #8221;  #8203; Even Nicodemus, a humanly-speaking good man, was told to be born anew. He was told that his deeds were not enough to appease God. He could not work his way to Heaven. Jesus says that to be cleansed from sin and unrighteousness, one *must* be born again. This doesn't refer to a second physical birth ('born of water', the rupture of the amniotic membrane) but rather to a unique *spiritual* birth: a Divine act of God, a miraculous intervention. # A Description of the New Birth How does one experience such a birth? What does it look and feel like? The second birth is NOT: * **A matter of heredity**. You can't inherit eternal life from your parents (who may be Christians) * **A result of a sinner's will or effort**. One's will is alienated from God and naturally pursues sin. * **The fruit of a preacher's persuasive powers** * **A process of reformation.** Self-improvement will not wipe away the record of sin. * **Of works.** No amount of deeds or effort committed in a sinful body can make up for sin. * **The result of sacraments.** Being christened as a child, or baptised as a teenager, or taking communion cannot wipe away guilt. * **Just the recitation of a sinner's prayer.** Something also must happen in the heart, in the inner part of the soul. * **Just the** ***intellectual assertion*** **of Christ and God's existence.** Knowledge is important but knowledge alone falls short. * **The belonging to a certain denomination or church.** The second birth IS: * **A necessity**. "You *must* be born again." * **The impartation of a new nature**. * **Of God and from God**. * **One-time**. It can only happen once. * **Instantaneous**. * **Permanent**. In light of all this, let us pay careful attention to the following. # The Gospel As stated above, we were created perfect. But because of man's rebellious condition ([Mark 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207%3A21-23 amp;version=NIV)), we sin consciously and sometimes with pleasure. It is this that separates us from God and invites His righteous displeasure. However, because God loves mankind, He devised a plan (even before Adam and Eve), to restore you and me to a right relationship with Him (proving His might and power beyond all doubt). God the Father sent God the Son, Jesus Christ (the 'Word'), down to Earth, to live as a man ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14 amp;version=NIV)). He grew up in Nazareth in Israel and trained as a carpenter before starting his mission. During His ministry, He performed miracles, such as turning water into wine ([John 2:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-11 amp;version=NIV)), healing the crippled and blind ([Matthew 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A14 amp;version=NIV)), raising the dead ([John 11:38-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A38-44 amp;version=NIV)) and calming the stormy seas ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41 amp;version=NIV)). He taught man how to live a life that God had originally intended for man. All that Jesus did, fulfilled the ancient prophecies found in the Old Testament. However, despite the many miracles Jesus did, His own people, the Jews, rejected Him and plotted to have Him killed. They falsely accused Him and by the help of the Romans, Jesus was crucified on a cross publicly. Despite being innocent and having never sinned, He was executed like a common criminal ([Matthew 27:32-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A32-56 amp;version=NIV)) But it was when He was on the cross that Jesus bore our sins, in other words, He took our wicked deeds and sin upon himself ([2 Cor. 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21 amp;version=NIV)), and became despised so that all those that believed in Him would not have to suffer punishment for their sins, but rather would be forgiven and accepted by God. Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of God **in our place**. "Whilst we were still sinners, Christ died for us" ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8 amp;version=NIV)) and shed His blood. Jesus was then buried, as the prophets foretold, and for 3 days His body lay in a tomb. But on the third day, He was resurrected back to life ([Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024 amp;version=NIV)). He appeared to hundreds of people and His disciples. The transformation in the disposition of His disciples was so radical that all but John were martyred for refusing to deny that Jesus was the Son of God and had risen from the grave. Previously they had been downcast and depressed, but by the truth of Christ, they were transformed. Jesus kept the Law perfectly, and by faith in Him, His righteousness through perfect obedience to the Law (that we could not keep), is accredited to us, meaning God no longer looks at us as lawbreakers but as His children ([Rom. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1 amp;version=NIV)) Jesus is the only way to God the Father ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6 amp;version=NIV)). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The Law makes us "conscious of our sin" ([Rom. 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+3%3A20 amp;version=NIV)) and our conscience "bears witness" to this Law ([Rom. 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+2%3A15 amp;version=NIV)), yet the Law brings us no life but "kills" but the "Spirit gives life." If you will repent of your wrongdoing, confess your sins to God and accept the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, a payment of a debt that you could not pay yourself, then you will be saved. Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, confess Him with your mouth, for today is the day of your salvation ([Rom. 10:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-10 amp;version=NIV), [Rom. 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A13 amp;version=NIV)).  #8203; John 3:16-17 - **16** #160; #8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. **17** #160;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Ephesians 2:8-9 - **8** #160;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  #8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God #8212; **9** #160;not by works , so that no one can boast. Romans 3:21-26 - **21** #160;But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it #8212; **22** #160;the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: **23** #160;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, **24** #160;and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, **25** #160;whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. **26** #160;It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Problems with Atheism</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 18:51:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are both practical and theological challenges with Christianity in the West. Firstly, due to decades of decline, congregation numbers are poor, especially for the younger demographics. This makes one feel isolated, especially in a majority-unbelieving society. Secondly, people have raised the challenges of eternal judgement, Christian particularism, and the ethics of the Bible in our age, as done in previous ages. As Christians we do need to engage in dialogue and under the power of the Holy Spirit, deploy reason and argument to understand our faith. However, on the flip side, there are giant problems with atheism/unbelief in God. The culture at large fails to attempt to ask or answer these questions, and the few intellectuals that do, invoke *ad hoc* evolutionary postulations, convinced of materialism. **The Problems with Atheism or Unbelief:** 1. The origin of life 2. Fine-tuning of the Universe 3. Human sentience 4. Human conscience 5. Human bondage to vice 6. Human's religious instinct and the short-lived life of atheism 7. Atheistic fanaticism precedes barbaric regimes (French Revolution, USSR, Nazi Germany, Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia etc.) 8. Reported paranormal activity worldwide and throughout human history 9. The issue of meaning 10. Despair for the environment, one's mortality, and the human race generally From the perspective of reason (as opposed to faith), the options both have challenges. From the position of having experienced forgiveness, regeneration and new life through faith in Christ (and the subsequent ministerial submission of reason to personal faith), the problems of Christianity pale in comparison with the unanswered problems of atheism. A society and world ruled by authentic Christians, or even Christ Himself, would be a good deal better than the current situation, and the last two thousand years of history show that nations that honour God, His laws, and Son, prosper. **The Folly of Modern Day Unbelieving Man:** 1. The belief that God and a spiritual reality do not exist 2. The belief that sinful man can *save the planet* 3. The belief that sinful man can *create lasting global peace* 4. The belief that we can overcome the *scarcity problem* 5. The belief that collectivism is the solution to humanity's ills 6. The belief that the synthesis between man and technology will "complete man" and not lead to malconsequences 7. The belief that surveillance and technology will not be used against and to control humanity 8. The belief that death can be overcome and an inability and refusal to discourse about it 9. The belief in the inevitable progression of man **The Societal Consequences of (proselytizing) Atheism:** 1.

    <TEXT>2 Corinthians 4 (ESV) **1** Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. **2** #160;But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. **3** #160;And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. **4** #160;In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. **5** #160;For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. **6** #160;For God, who said,  #8220;Let light shine out of darkness, #8221; has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. **7** #160;But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. **8** #160;We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; **9** #160;persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; **10** #160;always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. **11** #160;For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. **12** #160;So death is at work in us, but life in you. **13** #160;Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written,  #8220;I believed, and so I spoke, #8221; we also believe, and so we also speak, **14** #160;knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. **15** #160;For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God. **16** #160;So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. **17** #160;For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, **18** #160;as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</TEXT>
