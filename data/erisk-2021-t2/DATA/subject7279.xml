    <TEXT>I always tried the best I could Even in the dark I lit the spark to keep us both afloat I never thought I was enough I would stand behind And watch the sky Hoping you would never go I #8217;ll always have you in my heart Even when i cry Remembering times Of what we used to be You left and it was all my fault With my shallow thoughts And king despair I knew you didn #8217;t care I know that I should just move on My mind would try But my heart would cry And lead the way So I #8217;d rather stay and mope I #8217;d wish to die Stay and cry I was losing all my hope Life is never what it seems I #8217;d try and try But in the end It wouldn #8217;t mean a thing So here I lie Hoping to die In pain and misery I #8217;d cry and cry Wondering why You might do this to me I could always see the truth But I was blind And thought I #8217;d find Completeness inside you You would throw it all away And in my mind I wondered why I meant nothing to you I close my eyes and start to think of you I don #8217;t know why And it makes me cry Because I know I #8217;m still in love You have brought me so much pain I know it #8217;s wrong That I should just move on And leave this day But something seems to hold me down My hands are bound I won #8217;t be found Just end my suffering and here I lie Hoping to die In pain and misery I cry and cry Wondering why You might do this to me I don #8217;t think i #8217;ll continue on Admit you #8217;ve won Then go and run To find my sweet escape After I gave all my love I was left alone My heart to stone And discover my new home I feel it wrap around my neck I pull it tight I say goodnight You won #8217;t be seeing me The darkness is a sweet embrace I fade to black No turning back There's nothing left of me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"All right Mr. Donovan, you're free to go, enjoy the outside." You step out side into a world so different from the one you knew it almost causes an overload of information. "Mr. Donovan, are you okay?" "Huh? Oh, I'm fine... I've just been incarcerated for 4,000 years for a crime I didn't commit." "Well, we cannot change the past sir. Enjoy your new life." You begin your way to a halfway house set up for you by the state, and on your way you see cars flying above you along with men and women flying around seemingly by magic. When you get to the address the building in front of you is sliced into segments each one floating independently of the foundation. Your jaw is on the floor, the floating segments are moving! Swapping from building to building! As you enter the building, there is nobody around except for one "person" if you can call them that, waiting for you at the counter. She is what looked like a hybrid between human and machine, but barely any human left. "Welcome, John Donovan. We received notification of your arrival and your room is set to arrive in 5 minutes feel free to enjoy our reading list while you wait." She said with a gritty metallic voice. You look over to see a pad projecting digital magazines one particular catching your eye. *Should Octo-People be allowed to vote?* A shudder goes down your spine. "Thanks, but no thanks..." When your room finally arrives you look into it and everything is hovering... The chairs sofas and even the refrigerator. You sit down and begin to think... "My whole life... 4,000 years... Wasted, and for no reason... Why am I even here?" You look around and see a rope tied to your fridge, seemingly to keep it from floating about. You go to untie it and retie it around a chandelier. You stand up on a chair and place the rope around your neck. "I wish it was all over..." You kick the chair out from underneath you and everything goes black. You think its all over and you manage a slight grin... Until you wake up 3 days later in a hospital bed. "What happened? Why am I alive?" You ask frantically to the nurse at your bedside. "You've been unconscious for three whole days a maid found you hanging by a rope this morning." "But why am I alive? Shouldn't I be dead?" "Well, technically yes, but by some miracle here you are!" Great, you think to yourself, I can't even kill myself to escape this hell... Then a thought crosses your mind. What they did to me was unjust, it was so incredibly cruel it should be illegal. They should be forced to pay, and who better to make them pay than someone who can't die. Their reckoning will be delivered by you and your vengeance. You will destroy the government piece by piece. To be continued...  #8203;  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As an agnostic atheist, I was raised Christian but honestly it was probably my environment that made me who I am today. I guess that's the case for most things as we are products of our environment. Most likely it was my peers a fascination with the universe and my father passing away at a young age. However I dont regret a bit of it and had a lot of fun during my time at my churches youth group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I very much agree with you. It seems most people haven't read the second amendment. It does not guarantee a right to guns and weapons. It simply says that's should a government become corrupt we have the right to form an organized militia to overthrow it. And why shouldn't we make liscences for something that's soul purpose us to injure and kill? That's why we need drivers liscenses. To ensure the safety of others and ourselves. Also why would anyone be apposed to it? That just means fewer background checks for you per purchase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But isnt it more unconstitutional to be removing from people three basic rights because some guy can just go up to a counter and buy a gun then waste 20 people within a minute? Dont we all have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Shouldn't our priorities be ensuring those things for everyone before anything else? If people are dying because of your amendment right, maybe we should just take a step back and look at our priorities. If those three unalienable rights are violated then the rest of the constitution doesnt matter to those who they are taken from. It seems like everyone's priorities are out of wack.</TEXT>

The entire purpose of the second ammendment is to ensure the security of a free state. To reduce the number of accidents can apply directly to firearms.

    <DATE>2019-12-29 07:29:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>So first, I love this subreddit and pretty much everything about it along with some of its sister subreddits. I was looking through it an saw that there is a large quantity of people who share similar ideas here (what a surprise i know) but it got me wondering, we are all complaining about the same stuff but complaining will only get you so far ( maybe complaining isn't the right word) So I come back, what are we actually supposed to do to fight against capitalism? I know that the United States has the 2020 election coming up and Bernie Sanders is likely the most wanted candidate, but what about elsewhere? Capitalism is a pandemic, and back to the U.S, what if Bernie loses? Perhaps I am being a tad cynical, but I want to know what I can do to make a difference and what needs to be done as well. What should we all be doing to dismantle the bourgeoisie and give power back to the proletariat?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Opinions on famous marxists</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-10 23:58:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all! I was wondering what some of your opinions on a couple of famous marxist figures where. Specifically Lenin, Che, Castro, and Mao. As far as I know, Lenin was a great revolutionary removing the rule of a tyrannical Tsar, and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Che was a great revolutionary who was absolutely necessary in the liberation of Cuba with maybe some misguided views on race and sex when he was younger. Fidel was much of the same and pushed further in Cuba than Che, mostly because Che wanted to continue fighting revolution in other countries like Chile and Boliva and Fidel was focused on Cuba. Mao industrialized China and ended a famine with his Great Leap Forward. Let me know if I'm off on any of this and please share your opinions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I came to realize that while it works at the small business level, it almost immediately fails at a big business level. That's because at the small business level owners truly have to compete but at the corporate level oligopolies will form and competition will be replace with a pseudo competition where the "competitors" control the market entirely. Even worse would be monopolies both of these are inevitable in a free market. What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just get depressed and anxious when im alone and its starting to seem like people that used to be able to lift me up are no longer able to. At least not as effectively. Right now i just dont know what to do. My family doesnt help, my best friend is the only one to consistently help me, but i cant hangout with him as much as id like to as he also has a life, i just dont know what to do and its getting worse. Though i have tried to hurt myself in the past im not planning on doing it now, though the idea of cutting again does cros my mind from time to time. Im considering talking to my doctor about my antidepressant but im just so scared.</TEXT>

Its not just I've always wanted to be a garbage man, some people just want to make sure things run smoothly so they will be willing to do it, like how you don't necessarily want to do the dishes or vacuum the house but you do it anyway. People would be like that for jobs that most people would not want to do. Also there are people who already volunteer their time to pick up trash in capitalist societies with no financial incentive.</TEXT>

I think we need to be more "aggressive" with it and begin a movement similar to that of the civil rights movement or womens suffrage. We all need to double down on these ideologies if we want the change to happen and put power back into the hands of the working class.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now is the time for us to begin a Political Revolution. Bernie has have given us a voice, and now has dropped out of this race passing the reigns to us. So what should we do? We NEED to take action and we NEED to do it NOW. Rent Strikes, General Strikes, Public Protesting, and more. We need to do these things now and together because if we don't what was the last year for? If we don't show the establishment that we are not going away, then they will only become stronger. We can achieve what we've been fighting for but we need to fight now harder than ever because our last glimpse of hope to do this gradually from the inside is gone, but that does not mean we should stop fighting. It won't be easy but united we have power, and we need to begin. A unifying symbol for all of us to share will be the best way to let them know during our strikes and protests that we are most definitely not gone, and we're not going anywhere. Let me know what you think. Are you with me, ready to begin the revolution?</TEXT>

So please do blame us so finally you might realize that we are important if you want to win and we arent gonna just fall in line, we have issues that are important to us, and unless biden (or anyone else in the DNC) represents us you wont get our vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So just because Its a toy, I cant point it at something unless I intend to destroy it? I'm pretty sure if you have knowledge of how guns work even airsoft ones you can point them at yourself without putting yourself in danger. That logic is also a fallacy as that would mean actors using props would be immoral and unknowlagable about guns solely because they pointed a fake gun at something they "didnt intend to destroy."</TEXT>

I guess you're right though dont want people with toys to play with them unless they know how the real thing works. Toy car? Gotta get your license. Dont want you committing vehicular manslaughter with that toy. Toy train? Better become a conductor, dont want that toy train going off the rails, because just because it wont kill you doesnt make it right.</TEXT>

We may not be explicitly a dictatorship but we are not the pinnacle of democracy. If you really think that's the case you are delusional.</TEXT>

I'm pretty geeky, love Naruto, Death Note, and FMA:Brotherhood, ATLA is an Anime fight me if you disagree ;P. I'm also very vocal about politics and am very left leaning (VERY LEFT) So if that turns you off, sorry. If any of this rings with you PLEASE HMU Edit: Also I'm an epileptic</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice would be to give the character a motive. A clear one, and have that be the main driving force behind what they do. For instance say their motive is to find out who their parents are or something. They could be like a mercenary doing anything for information. Kill this guy and I'll tell you what I know. Protect this nobleman and I'll tell you everything. Another way is to make them more inwardly focused than most heroes. Say they were exploring a cave with someone and there was a cave in and their friend needed help to get out but at the risk of both of you not making it. Your main character could instead of being selfless and trying to save them just look back and leave to save their on life. Thats what I would do anyways.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm just a dude who wants his better half, someone in my age range preferably (within two years) and in the same country. Other than that I try to keep an open mind, but I'm sure you want to know about me. I'm a geek even though that's a cliche that's been done to death now, but I am. I love like everything digital and I love board games and table top card games (kinda just MTG, but still) to I'm big into politics and like talking about it and am pretty far left, if that's important to you. I'm also really into metal music along with classical and classic rock. Favorite band is metallica, composer Chopin, and classic rock band Pink Floyd. I also like to go rock climbing but haven't really been able to because of covid and a knee injury. My appearance, I'm a 5'9" white guy with an average build (a little overweight) brown hair and blue eyes with glasses. I have general anxiety and depression and am also an epileptic. Shouldn't be much of an issue if I take my meds though. Finally, I am a cat person but do like dogs too. I own a snake and like to try new things. I'd like to be a teacher soon (soon=4 years+ :/) and just want to make my mark on society. If any of this rings with you please hit me up. DMs are always open, but this post is honestly I feel in vein because this place is flooded with guys and it's late in the US but whatever. Let's see if it works.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-04 03:20:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm about to turn 20 in Idaho, and I feel like I can't do anything to help with the state of the country. I supported Bernie up until he dropped out voting for him in the primary here, but I feel like there is so much more to be done; I just don't know how to even get started. The issues are so much broader than just what can I do for my community, and it feels like nothing is getting done anywhere because so many local governments are just putting their foots down or conceding symbolic victories but not substantive victories. Idaho I feel has had some of the fewest protests and is a very red state. In that sense I feel very trapped and unable to aid in the crises sweeping the nation. I'm doing the small things like social distancing and wearing a mask if I do go out, but there is so much more to be done that just feels so much bigger than just me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is my opinion. Racism sucks in America there is no doubt about that, but it really is a symptom of a larger problem. MASSIVE class inequality, with the 1% basically being above the law and in control of the country via Super-Pacs and campaign donations. The rich want cheap labor, hence the prison industrial complex and a phony war on drugs that disproportionately affects the lower class compared to everyone else. The 13th amendment abolished slavery except as a punishment for crime, so there you go. Its all about money and how to keep it in the pockets of the rich and out of the pockets of the poor, because money is power and power decides.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Holy shit which one do I choose. Well literally the way we met is pretty great, first grade went up to a random kid in a suit (not kidding) and just asked if he wanted to be my friend. He said yes and we've been friends for almost 15 years. A more reasonable response might be we both act like fucking retards when were with each other and laugh our dicks off all the time. We agree on most everything and are always there for each other when we need it. It's pretty great honestly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is what I think. The universe started from a singularity of infinite mass and infinite density, then in a massive explosion begun expanding at an incredible rate. We call this the big bang. I think that singularity in concept resembles black holes, and what do black holes come from? Massive things that exceed the schwartzield radius and collapse back in on themselves creating a singularity of incredible mass and density. I think that our universe will behave similarly and will collapse back into that singularity and perhaps is just another super black holes (metaphorically) at the center of an even larger super galaxy, like the super massive black holes at the center of galaxies in our universe? Perhaps. But will we ever know for sure? Likely not for you cannot see the forest through the trees, but I think its an interesting way to look at it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like the adrenaline rush and it oddly enough helps me sleep sounder at night. just one problem, I kind of don't get scared by most things. Like media typically doesn't scare me and jump scares have lost their effect. I have social anxiety and separation anxiety, but I can't think of a way to make that scare me when I'm alone in my room with instant access to the person I hate being separated from. Horror movies, books, short stories, creepypasta don't frighten me. I truly do not know how I can give myself a good lasting scare. Please give any suggestions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, you misunderstand. It's not just Trump. It's not just Biden. It's everybody in Congress. It is not a broken system it is doing exactly what they want it to. A plutocracy disguised as democracy. Has been for a long time and can't change from with in. I have no doubt that Biden will beat Trump and when that happens the protests will die because there is practically no class conciseness in the US. Protest is great, but don't protest a symptom of a greater problem. Yes racism sucks, but it is also rooted in things like greed. Yes, really. We still have slavery today. It all comes from how can the rich make more money, because money is power and the rich have all of it, and have made it so we really can't remove their power without a revolution in its most literal sense, which is unlikely to happen because many people don't actually care about politics. It's like a game, they just want their guy to beat your guy to feed their ego. They won't listen to us, but the "officials" who speak on behalf of our billionaire overlords, their word is law. It's not about race or religion or policy. It's about control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am a fractured soul with a fractured mind, so if thats an issue, I'm sorry. I'm 5'8 and a little heavy. I am also an epileptic, and have severe anxiety and depression :/. I like to go rock climbing but cant currently due to an injury, I play music, Magic the Gathering, Chess, videogames, and occasionally read. Looking for someone that is open minded, patient, and willing to try new things and no more than a 5 year age gap. Politics are a big part of my life and I am very left, sometimes I come off as abrasive because of it, so you have been warned. I love trying new things, am very introverted and patient, went skydiving when I turned 18 and want to try mountain biking. I can work with people though I don't particularly like it much I'd like to teach 4th or 5th grade and want to one day climb El Capitan in Yosemite. I can be a lot to handle sometimes but it is worth it I swear because I will always be there for you, and help in any way I can if you ever need it, though I can get a bit clingy, I try my best to stop that though. I don't really get jealous unless you have given a reason for me to not trust you which hopefully won't happen. Please HMU if any of this rings with you DMs open all the time and I use discord too if you prefer to talk off of reddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like the title says I have a lot of mental health problems, Bipolar 2, BPD, Dependent personality disorder, just to name a few. But if I get comfortable I'm fun I swear. I like to go bouldering, play chess, EDH, and videogames. I occasionally write and read. I like to try new things and am very open minded. I love learning and would like to be a teacher some day. I am getting treated btw. I really do have a hard time opening up but the work will be worth it because I will never abandon a friend let alone an SO. So I will be there for you. I'm also very empathetic and caring.</TEXT>

Asking them to if they are pure, pure in what sense? They can be pure to themselves, while being a degenerate in the eyes of the rest of the world (maybe not the best example but look at Aladdin) So my peak for both would be Donald Trump.

In some form it is always going to be a part of change, because change doesn't come from the people on the bottom, but the people on top and they never bring change willingly.

    <TITLE>America is as much a two party state as Stalinist Russia was</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-12 13:52:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Americans are represented by a single party, the capitalist party. Democrats and Republicans may as well be one party as they are both neo-liberals with one party being more socially liberal than the other (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism)) but the "two-party system" is excellent at keeping Americans divided because it develops a "Me Vs Them" mentality and often encourages enough people not to vote due to a lack of representation often via the electoral college and states being specific "colors" or not living in a swing state (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party\_system#Disadvantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system#Disadvantages)) which does an incredible job of keeping the single party in charge and out of check. I think it is misleading to label America anything but a one-party state if we are willing to label soviet Russia a one-party state solely because of the CP of Russia. (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party\_state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state)) The biggest flaw of a one-party state being of course a lack of representation for the people that live there. So perhaps there is only one solution, forcibly put the power back into the hands of the people that live there, be it through electing valid representatives (which I think at this point is impossible due to election rigging, we saw this when Biden became the Democratic nominee. Too much money corrupting this system), revolution (which I know is scary to think about but I think this is the most realistic chance we have at giving power back to the people) or just removing all money from politics (which is also, in my opinion, impossible since our president is Donald Trump). We've seen these circumstances appear in the past and our response was intense civil unrest, which unfortunately in the long run doesn't typically accomplish much as seen when you look at the 1960s protests and how the long term solution was to just create a system that would target African Americans in a less obvious way (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial\_complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex)) America is long past the days of being the peak of democracy (arguably never was) and a strong solution in my opinion is to take a more direct approach as far as our government, laws, and economy are concerned. I think a constitutional democracy with more aspects of a direct-democracy is the way to go, that way the majority of people's needs are being met but the 51% can't just completely nullify any needs of the 49% as they would be protected by a constitution. I also think there should be cases where a 2/3 majority is required. How do we get to this though? Well, unfortunately, it seems the only way to achieve permanent change is to make it happen by force as people in power never give it up willingly. I know this is a long post but props to you if you made it this far. Tell me, what do you think the solution is?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What horror movie should I watch to get scared? I can't seem to find one</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-14 02:00:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I like being scared, but it doesn't happen often because I have faced all my phobias and have a solid grip on reality (or a poor suspension of disbelief however you want to put it) the only fear I can't overcome is the fear of abandonment. Horror movies I liked but didn't get scared by: Texas Chainsaw Massacre (og) August Underground, and Misery. Slasher flicks don't really do it nor do paranormal things (sorry exorcist) I also don't really get scared by jumpscares because I can always see them coming. Gore never bothered me, but I am deep into psychological manipulation. Any suggestions?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't say I didn't like them, they just weren't scary. They were above the rest of what I've seen though. I've been watching horror since I was 6 so about 14 years. I went by recommendation. If they were recommended together I assume they're similar. You want some other movies I've seen? All the Friday the 13th movies all the Halloween movies, paranormal activity, a glass house (which was pretty interesting ngl) all the child's play movies, nightmare on elm street, alien, the evil dead series, the purge, final destination. Now I've also seen the strangers which was interesting. Does that help? Those are all the horror movies I've seen and none of them were very scary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, there is a distinction to be made between the two. Theism is the belief that not only a for exists, actively plays a role and the day to day activities of the people in the universe he created. In deism he takes no role after creating the universe, infact there is an argument to be made that if you believe in the big bang, you are a deist. What we call the big bang they call god, that's it. So it's not as black an white as you're making it out to be, and these are important distinctions to make or else you sound ignorant.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is incorrect take some time and look up the definitions of what you're talking about, here I'll even help you https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theism Theism: belief in the existence of a god or gods specifically : belief in the existence of one God viewed as the creative source of the human race and the world who transcends yet is immanent in the world https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deism Deism: a movement or system of thought advocating natural (see NATURAL entry 1 sense 8b) religion, emphasizing morality, and in the 18th century denying the interference of the Creator with the laws of the universe With these definitions you can see the deism and theism aren't the same, and to call deists theists would be ignorant.</TEXT>

Insulting someone will not change their mind you know. Providing answers with substance will. If you want to deny reality go ahead, but I've given all the proof anyone should need.

    <TITLE>Which horror game should I start out with?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-01 06:01:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've never really been into horror game but love the adrenaline of getting scared and horror films just aren't cutting it. So I wonder, what about games? I'm currently teetering between amnesia the dark decent and outlast. Though I have also heard good things about RE7:Biohazard, SAMA, layers of fear, and the evil within. What I've played already is Slenderman back in the day RE4 (so much fun but not scary) and hello neighbor (don't know if this counts but saw it on a list of horror games so thought I'd mention it) all were fun but none were particularly scary. I'd love to try P.T but as it stands I have no idea how to be able to do that. Thanks for any and all suggestions!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I noticed in the goals of communism it specifies a classless stateless moneyless society, and the stateless part really got to me. Is communism by definition anarchic? I consider myself to be an anarcho-syndicalist and thought this might be a better place to ask than r/communism or r/communism101. Also, doesn't that mean we haven't ever actually seen communism, just various stages and interpretations of socialism?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree, who knows communism might be inherently doomed to fail, who's to say, but we know for sure socialism works so it may not even be necessary to fight for communism for a long long time. I would be satisfied if we were to adopt the dem socialist ideology. That would be a phenomenal step in the right direction, we should also embrace democracy in all aspects of our lives, I personally think democracy favors socialism. So I guess Democracy for the win, with a constitution to make sure the 51% doesnt just shit all over the 49%, and I would make 2/3 majority required in many instances. But thats just me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently learned that a green new deal is still sponsored by corporations and it wouldn't even be enough because carbon is just one part of a much larger problem, go green still have to mine the lithium and cobalt, were never gonna stop destroying the planet until consumerism stops and endless expansion stops. I don't know that this will ever happen and have realized that the narrative had been pushed so far away that people who support green energy genuinely think they are saving the planet. The machine is too efficient to be stopped with elected officials, and it genuinely feels like the only way to stop it is with a revolution. Only problem with that is there is almost no class consciousness, and Americans have very short attention spans. Get outraged for a month or to, then move on. We see that with George Floyd, we saw that with net neutrality, we saw that in 1992 in la. I have zero faith that America will ever do something about corporate tyranny.</TEXT>

I'm all for educating people on socialism an communism, but I'm tired of caring about figureheads. So I'm moving on from that. It's until Americans are outraged enough that change will happen, but we can't hold on out outrage for very long, so if it happens it'll be a long time from now when all the generations that are indifferent and only care about being upset and not about doing anything are gone. Gen-z is pretty class consciousn so I do believe that this generation could be the one to light the tinder, and since I'm a part of it I guess that I my job too. How is it in France?
