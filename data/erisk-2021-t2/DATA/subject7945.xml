    <TITLE>Is zakat for muslims only ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-26 13:57:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was arguing with a Muslim and he brought up that in chapter 9 verse 60 Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He siad that the quran doesn't say it's for muslims only, I swear I remember reading zakat is just for muslims</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your ignorance is fascinating. We as humans can't know what's beyond the observable universe. We can't know more than laws of physics Who are you, a human ? To tell us other humans if there is a God or not ? Did you see god ? We don't need to disprove him, you can prove him first. The fact everything is complicated proofs god doesn't exist (probably, we can't know for sure) Look in the stars, tell me. What god who makes such a infinite complex universe with trillions of starts and galaxies we will never be able to reach care about us ? Why would the creator of the fucking universe care if i fuck someone of the same sex ? Don't you think the creator of the universe have more important things ? Like idk. ENDING WARS ? Look at syria and all the people dying there. They pray to Allah everyday for this to stops. It doesn't. If the creator of the universe doesn't care about the wars, crimes and suffering, why would he care if you prayed to him telling him how great he is (Allahu akbar=allah is great). Why would a God make us just for us to tell him how good he is ? Why does he have such a big ego ? Evolution is also a fact. If adam and eve were first humans , how do different humans have different skin colors ? I can smell a Muslim saying "different clay colors" Bruh. We aren't made of clay. We are atoms. Have these muslims went to biology class? I know you will say "well, if allah came down and showed himself everyone would be Muslim, so there is no test" So we should put blind Faith in a old barbaric god ? Should we just believe that he exist ? What's the logic? "Why don't you believe in spaghetti monster? He is testing you. If he came down no one will say he doesn't exist so that makes him unable to punish bad people who say he is a children story. The fact DNA looks like spaghetti is proof spaghetti monster made us." See how dumb this sounds ? Exactly, this is just like Islam. And just because a water Mellon says Allah doesn't mean it's proof. Btw: 10 min cool down is because you are getting dowvoted, mods have no control. This is just the shitty reddit system.... C'mon man. You know this cult is wrong. I hope you are smarter than this.</TEXT>

How do people call such a God "most merciful". This Shows how religion is a Brian disease that takes over you..... I know some muslims who are good at critical thinking, but when it comes to their own religion, thier brain turns off....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but saying some things should be punishable Like saying you want to kill all murtads and you support apostaty laws (mohamed hijab for example) shouldn't be okay. When you say you want someone dead because of their believe, that's terrorism in my eye. And making death threats should be punishable obviously. I don't understand why muslim preachers in west who support apostaty laws are not in jail. They literally admit wanting someone dead because of thier beliefs.....</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You got a point. But... Nazis belong to an harmful ideology that wants to kill other people for their beliefs (jews). Nazis want to gain power and hate other people. Apostates don't belong to a harmful ideology (most of them atleast). If you bring 2 random apostates they will only have in common leaving islam for example. If you bring 2 nazis they have in common that they hate jews and want to kill them. Apostates and nazis aren't the same. Apostates don't belong to a specific ideology. Nazis do. Apostaty means simply leaving islam. Nazism is hating a group of people for thier beliefs and wanting to kill them or viewing them as lesser people. Saying "kill all apostates" is saying that you should kill anyone who leaves islam . Maybe a apostate who leaves islam have good intentions and is kind, intelligent and talent. But he gets killed just because he isn't a Muslim. On another hand , saying kill all nazis is different. Nazis have a harmful ideology that wants to harm other groups for thier ideas. They want them dead. There may be ignorant people who call themselves nazi because they think it means something good. However, these are not the majority. The majority of nazis know we'll they hate jews and see proud of wanting them dead. You see the difference? Nazis can't be compared to apostates because Nazis belon to a harmful ideology while apostates simply left Islam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's according to islam. According to islam, earth is flat too and the moon splited. And semen comes from backbone. We are talking from a rational point of view. Nazis are harmful objectively because they want to kill a specific group of people. Apostates aren't (most of them) because apostaty means simply leaving islam while nazism is hating a specific group and wanting them dead. If you bring 2 random apostates they just have in common leaving islam while 2 random Nazis have in common wanting to kill a specific group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are right, what is harmful or not is defined differently. But form a rational point of view, a harmful is harmful for society and safety. Apostates that criticize Islam are spreading critical thinking and they aren't hurting anyone (from a rational pov) . They are voicing thier own opinion and Beliefs. Wich is free speech. Criticizing something isn't hate speech. Maybe according to brain dead muslims but rationly it isn't. Just because you can say something doesn't mean anyone owes you a platform to say it on or mean you are free of consequences. Racisms and nazism is objectively wrong. You are saying a specific group of people to be killed because of something you shouldn't care about. You can say your ideas but that doesn't mean you can't be punished or Judged. When you are saying "kill all jews" you are saying that anyone, who identifies as a jew (many people identify as a specific religion without believing in it) should be killed. You can say that but don't expect to not get backlash. When you are saying this you are a possible threat to society. You basically are saying we should kill some people because they believe in something (or identify). You basically are saying if you could you would kill all jews. Same with saying "kill all apostates, we are proud of apostaty laws" Nazis and racist from thier point of view think it isn't hate speech because they don't know better. Freedom of speech means freedom of thoughts, beliefs, critism . The ability to allow different points of view. Not hating people. Not saying someone should be killed for their ideas, thoughts and beliefs (as long as it isn't harmful). That is hate speech and a threat for safety. However, criticism against Judaism (not hating jews) is valid and a human right. You can perfectly dislike a ideology without saying its followers should be killed.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When you guys at kurzgesagt make another personal videos like dissatisfaction or loneliness please include the purple hair girl again.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-15 10:42:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>She have been through loneliness and dissatisfaction. In loneliness she had short hair but in dissatisfaction she got long hair. She should be in all of these person videos. Because why not. I love the little details like this in this channel. She was "the main" character in loneliness and dissatisfaction. In my opinion She should be again in the next personal video (Wich kurzgesagt said is aorund 1 per year) just because she have already been in past 2 videos and to continue the tradition. (And why not some character development?)</TEXT>

As Much as I would like if i was Muslim (mainly to fill the void or the comfort of knowing suffering is worth it because you will get heaven) ever since I'm agnostic atheist I can finally embrace science! I am finally learn more about big bang and evolution and embrace them rather than trying for them to work in a 1400 years old book. I can finally try and be more open minded. Since I don't have to put the Islamic point of view as the true one. I try and see things form multiple perspectives (I still get close minded sometimes, I'm trying tho not to be)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Im out of words. How barbaric can someone be ? Are these even human ? Are these people same species as us ? We are the one who isn't have morals. We are the one who get called nom moral kaffir or some muslim made up insult. Yet, these people exist. I'm not staying every muslim is like this. But the surprising number of muslims who want shariah and want this shitty laws are high. This is just scary. What fucked up world Is this. A world were people get killed for making a joke that offended someone. A world were you get killed for liking same gender, feelings you can't control. A world were kids are born into war (syria) and people still say the god allowing the war is merciful. This is sick. If god exist, he in not just unkind, not just evil. He isn't just a asshole. He is not even a psychopath. Psychopaths act in a bad way because they are fucked up. God is something else. He is the definition of cruel. The more I read fucked up things the more it realize how bad this life is. The fact these people exist, people who don't have feelings or guilt at all are even called humans scare me. I just don't want to exist in this fucked up world. Everything is so cruel. From barbaric cult members to political leaders who treat thier people like trash and to abusive parents who treat kids like property. I can't believe this is happening. While people in west are going to moon and mars this is were arabs are going . I hate bieng a arab. Most arabs are Muslims and every muslim terrorists stack is almost always done by Arab. I don't know if I can sleep tonight. This is just so sick and fucked up.... EDIT: And the fact people who do this are called extremist is scary. This is true islam, like it or not. There is no Such thing as religion extremist. This is the true face of cults like Islam. Stop defending them by saying people who do this are extremist. They are actually the most real muslims. According to islam, this is how you should be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are so stupid it's FUNNY. Mental illness isn't even recognized in Islam. You get "possesd by a jinn". And plus suicides rates in muslim countries are way higher then actual statistics. Most suicides go un noted because in Islam suicide is viewed as something shameful instead of something sad. Most people get ashamed when their family member commits suicide so they report cause of death as something else. Use your fucking Brian bro, to gonna need it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey not all liberals are like . I say fuck both Islam christianity and most if not all religions. Anys system that build itself on "faith" (trust) without evidence is extremely flawed. I think religion is harmful to society, in any form. Teaching your kids your political views (region) form a young age is traumatizing. Telling kids if they won't do this and that they will burn in hell is fucked up . From personal experience, islam is probably a little bit more fucked up than christianity. I'm pretty ignorant about christianity, but from what I know already, islam is miles more fucked up. I think most liberals are with islam is because middle eastern and muslims get fused. Many people think that if you are arab you have to be Muslim and assume you are a terrorist. And also because many liberals are Brianwashed into the idea muslims are minority (they are not, it's second biggest religion wtf) Critism and hate towards Islam and any religion is fine and in my opinion a human right. We should be able to criticize anything. However, when hating religion turns into hating people who identify as it , that is bad. Many people are forced to identify as muslims. Maybe by family members. Many Muslims (younger ones tend to be more) are not radical. Many just call themselves muslims for culture and don't care that much about religion and many are also more open minded and tolerant. However, liberal muslims and tolerant muslims get trashed in Islamic communities for "trying to please the west". They get called for hypocrites because they are tolerant to LGBT people. They get called "not true muslims" (Wich is true since radical muslims are the most true muslims). We would benefit from no religion at all, but liberal muslims are better than radical for sure. Hate the ideology, not it's followers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To me murtad sounds cool. Very fucking metal tbh It's like they are talking about some ancient, mythical creatures that proved themselves to be the true unchained predators. "The murtad sounds like a creature that dominated everything. It walked among the ummah, proving itself to handle all kinds of mental gymnastics. It went from mosque to mosque, destroying the sheiks with logic and facts. The murtads are few in numbers, but even then. They proved themselves to be the apex predators. They fed on winning debates. The more they learn how bad islam is, the more thier firey rage increased against it. They were unstoppable, no mental gymnastics or "scientific miracles" could convince them back into the cult called islam. When they get thier hand on a Muslim in it's natrual habits, they wait for the perfect moment to strike. They wait for when the doubts start. They attack in the moment with logic. They turn the most dedicated Hafiz into murtads. But , some murtads are even stronger. The murtads with most rage attack in any moment, they don't need doubts on thier side. They show the muslims sahih hadiths that are so bad, the muslim has no choice but to give up and become a murtad." The murtads are the only thing the sheiks fear. That's why, apostaty laws exist. But stupid old laws aren't enough to stop s murtad. His rage is stronger.</TEXT>
