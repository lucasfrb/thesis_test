    <TEXT>Is it likely that we'll get a buckshot + birdshot ammunition hybrid? I mean, it is possible to put both in one shell. It'll obviously widen the spread by a lot and fire 32 pellets but I don't know if it will increase or decrease the damage. As for what it'll be actually be called in the game, you'll have to depend somebody else on that because I'm really bad at naming things. You can unlock it if you acquire 2500 kills using the shotgun that you want it to have. The cons for this idea that it might be too OP.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why your PF suggestion is doodoo (my first rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-29 06:56:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>This post will basically be a breakdown of terrible ideas that people want to be executed in Phantom Forces and me explaining why those ideas are terrible. When reading this post #8211; please be reminded that this is my opinion. Thank you. 1. Throwable Melees Throwable melees are probably the most atrocious idea that I've ever heard suggested in all of PF history besides buffing the BFG. Making a melee a ranged weapon is basically shitting on not just the function of a melee weapon but the very definition of "melee" itself; I would even go forward and classify the term "throwable melee" as an oxymoron. Here is a question for the people that was this idea to be in PF: What will happen after I throw my melee? Will I just pull out a second one? Will I just walk away without it? Or will I fucking pick it up? If you want a ranged weapon besides your primary firearm #8211; then use your secondary firearm. And if you don't wanna use your secondary #8211; then fuck off. 2. Flash/Smoke Grenades I used to be fond of this idea (which I fully regret) #8211; but then I thought to myself "would I really want to spend hours watching my screen suddenly get fucked only to find out that I got killed?" and the answer to that question is no. I will never want flash grenades or smoke grenades to be added in PF; that wouldn't be fair to anybody that plays this game and I bet it would be the one to finally fucking put a bullet on game's playerbase and kill it off at once. If this gets added #8211; I would surely quit and so would the shitlords that asked for this feature. 3. Bipods/Tripods/Whatever-type-of-fucking-pod This is probably the most common suggestion in all of this list and like the previous idea that I've mentioned #8211; I used to also be fond of it which I also fucking regret. First of all: adding the option to equip a bipod to a sniper will be fucking useless since recoil in snipers don't matter because you're gonna have to unscope anyway to pull the bolt. And if you don't unscope after using when using a semi-automatic sniper (besides the SVU) you're basically asking for recoil. Putting bipods on LMGs is another story, that would be actually effective; but the only problem is that it would be too effective causing LMGs to be unbalanced. LMGs are very powerful, boasting a high capacity, high penetration, and high suppression; The only trade-off to them is their slow mobility and recoil. And sometimes the slow mobility isn't even a problem for some people so technically the recoil is the only trade-off; so taking that away would make LMGs broken. People who use LMGs are more annoying when they lay down because people are more likely to mistake them for a corpse so only allowing the recoil to be reduced when the use is fully laying down is like encouraging them to be a nuisance to deal with. We have grips and recoil-reducing barrel attachments #8211; people. What more could you fucking ask for? Second of all: Adding bipods to make your gun to look good wouldn't be as stupid as using them to reduce recoil but it would still be pretty stupid. Two fucking sticks under my barrel won't look good; in fact #8211; I will barely or never even notice that it was fucking there when I actually play the game. When I think of think thing that'll make guns in PF to look good #8211; I'd think of a really cool skin for that gun or a great-looking model for that gun. You know what would never come to mind? My barrel having fucking legs. And that's the end of that shitshow #8211; I didn't really wanna go through all of the other suggestions since I don't hear them get suggested as much thus I'm not as annoyed of seeing them over and over unlike the ideas that I suggested in the list. If you don't wanna fully read the post then I don't blame you. If you want to see the following suggestions get added in the game then stop.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How do I get better with SVDS iron sights?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-20 08:06:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Using the SVDS usually confuses me because of how inconsistent my skill is with it. At my first few rounds #8212; I'm ass with it; my aim and movement are just fucking hot garbage and I shamefully die all the time. And then at later rounds I spontaneously just get headshots the very second I scope in and fire; my movement also improves so enemies find it more difficult to rush me. But the second I go to sleep, wake up, and play PF again #8212; it's like I've been reset. It seems as though the pace of my progress that day is almost the same as the day before. It's like I'm not improving at all. I've been strictly practicing by using the SVDS in close range combat to improve my movement so I have been tarely using my secondary or melee, I'm not aware if this will help me improve or not. Commenting simple tips will be appreiciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's probably the unfunniest subreddit that I've seen; all of the posts are basically the same; if you've seen one r/woooosh post you've seen them all.

A subreddit documenting everytime somebody has drank a glass of milk would be gigaparsecs more entertaining than this. I bet this sub was just a facade to see how many people would be fond of something so bad; if that's the case then the people who unironically like this sub and consider wooooshing as their favorite hobby are the actual ones that deserved to get wooooshed. If you disagree with me and love this subreddit then please tell my why you like this sub because I can't put a grip on why anybody would actually enjoy browsing this subreddit.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Paralytic Spectator Glitch Rant</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-18 23:16:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>To the people who aren't familiar with this: it's basically when your teamspawn gets delayed and your teammate dies at just the right time for you to spawn in and be locked static in a 3rd person perspective where you were supposed to spawn. And you might think that this isn't all too bad but the thing about this nuisance is that you will not and cannot respawn no matter how many fucking times you spam F5 thus you need to fucking rejoin or just give up and join a new lobby. If I could just respawn when it happens it wouldn't be as fucking irritating but sadly that's not the case. I don't know if it's just me but this shit happens to me more often than encountering degenerate hackers. It happened to me 5 TIMES in just a span of 4 fucking hours once and you know how many hackers I encountered in those 4 hours? Absolutely fucking none. I would even go forth and say that this is more annoying than exploiters because you can actually still fucking spawn; sure it's annoying but at least is it's something which is better than fucking nothing which is this glitch. It happened to me 2 times today in both cases I was in a good lobby and the map was fucken Desert Storm; bitch do you know how fun that map is? Whenever it happened I would plead for somebody to accept my friend request so that I could rejoin but none of them gave a shit. I didn't blame them; they don't deserve to also deal with the shit that I've been through; nobody fucken does because this thing shouldn't even fucking exist. I swear to fucking god; if I could make a wish: my first wish would be an infinite amount of wishes and my second would me to fucking eradicate this piece of shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think I'm no longer improving at this game --- it's like I hit a brick wall. Playing PF is getting immensely demotivating and talking to people in the chat became more interesting than actually playing the game. I'm really laggy; today I played the game and my FPS was at 15. And no; my FPS unlocker doesn't seem to be effective. I can also only play this game in weekends and rarely at weekdays due to school. My KDR rarely reaches 1 in rounds and I haven't even gotten my first 75-kill (let alone 100) game. I've considered quitting since I was in my late 80s --- now I'm rank 105 and I feel the same way. At this point: PF feels more like a chore and an obligation rather than I game that I can play and enjoy. Setting goals doesn't help and instead amplifies the feeling of this game being a chore even more. I don't know what to do; what am I doing wrong?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-27 14:57:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>7 is a lonely fuck who doesn't get pussy since it's a pathetic prime number. Whenever I'm required to divide 7 tangible objects for less or more than 7 people #8212;I just fucking give up. And whenever I ask somebody to tell me their favorite number: they always answer 7 #8212;what's so fucking special about 7? Maybe they relate to it #8212;maybe they're also pathetic primes. Why can't people appreciate highly composite numbers (numbers that have more divisors or factors than any number before it)? I mean look at 5040 here: it's divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. It has 60 fucking factors and nobody gives it love. It's why circles are measured in 360 #176; degrees; why we have 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day (except for weeks #8212;some fat fuck decided it would be a good idea to have a week be equal to 7 #8212;he must be one of those people with bad taste in numbers and stan 7). In conclusion: 7 is the K-Pop and 5040 is the Tally Hall of numbers.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-07 14:34:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just realized that the vocals for Happy Monster Band include Rob, Joe, and Zubin; I liked that show's songs when I was a child and I was so surprised when I was first informed about this because I never thought that I would like somebody's work as a child, forget about it, and here their other works a few years later and like it without even knowing that they were the same people. If you're not familiar with the show: it's basically about a band of 4 monsters. When they're talking: they have children as their voices #8212;but when they sing: 3 of Tally Hall's band members have them as their vocals. Rob plays as Frred (the red one), Zubin does L.O. (the yellow one), and Joe does Bluz (the blue one); and as you may observe: none of the colors of the characters that they play match their ties in the band #8212;it's not known whether this is intentional or not (personally think it is). But however the roles of the band members in the show are almost the same in the band; L.O. is the bassist and Zubin does him and he's also a bassist and the same thing applies to Rob/Frred too #8212;unfortunately: Bluz is a keyboardist but Joe isn't. If you listen to one of the show's songs: you can sort of hear their voices. So now that I think about it: I technically never found the band a few months earlier like I thought I did and instead rediscovered them under a name that I wasn't familiar with at the time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Turret Eradication [Objective]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 00:37:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Turret Eradication is an objective where it's basically King of the Hill but instead of the hill: there's turrets that you need to destroy by shooting or throw nades at. But what I think really sets it apart from other protect and capture objectives (like KotH, CtF, and FD) is that you can play either as a regularly or as the overseer #8212;the one controlling the turret. Regular Player's Objectives: The main objectives are to destroy the enemy turret and protect their own. The turrets are located in the team's spawns. The turret has 10k HP which you must drain in order to win and how much damage that you gun deals corresponds with how many the turret will lose and hitting the upper parts will make use of your gun's headshot multiplier, hitting the parts that are on the middle makes use of the torso multipliers, and hitting the lowest parts will Overseer's Objectives: The main objectives of the turret overseer's objectives is to also protect that turret but by only using the turret itself. The turret uses a M61 Vulcan which deals 48 damage, has a monstrous RPM of 3,500 (in reality, it has 6,000 but I thought that might be too laggy/unbalanced), fires massive 20mm rounds, has infinite ammo, and has no multipliers. While that sounds dandy: the speed at which the turret turns is extremely slow. You cannot attack the enemy. **The overseer is also randomly chosen** and has an upward wiew spanning 75 studs vertically and 125 studs horizontally and will not be able to see an enemy if they are hidden in a structure with a roof.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game-To-Game Bounties (IMRPOVED)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 01:08:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>(This is a slightly improved version of my old suggestion from 3 months ago; I deleted that post and decided to tweak it since it had flaws) Game-To-Game bounties is a system that picks a random player in a server; and whoever kills the player who is chosen will receive a prize (this can be credits, exp, or cases, case keys). The prize and its quantity will also be random but there is a limit to avoid over-rewarding. The minimum amount credits you can win from is 50 and the maximum 500, the minimum amount xp you can win is 100 and the maximum is 1000, the minimum amount of crates you can win is 1 and the maximum 5 (all of the cases are the same), and the minimum amount of case keys you can win from this is 1 while the maximum is 3. If you get chosen and fear of being targetted for the whole round then don't worry my friend. Once somebody kills you #8211;they will claim the prize and the bounty ends for the whole round; a new bounty begins the second round and another player gets chosen. If the bounty is not claimed for 5 minutes: it will be stalled for the next round. This system of cancellation is set just in case the bounty target exits the game or goes AFK. The chosen one for the bounty will not be publicly announced so it's kept a mystety to lessen targeting, so the chosen one will not just give up and begged to be killed which will make it not rewarding, and for the chosen one to not leave or go AFK solely because they don't want to be the chosen one.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-25 21:11:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok this is self explanatory; it's literally just the ability to change the opacity of your teammates to avoid them obstruction. Because let's be honest here #8212;if your teammate is acting like a attention-seeking douchebag by forcing you to stare at their shiny white melon head: are they even your teammate or are they just an enemy that you can't kill? The maximum opacity that you can set it is obviously 100% (which is also set by default) and the minimum is also obviously 0%. If this was to be implemented in the game: I'd set it to at most 25% and at least 10%. Why would I not set it to 0%? Because doing that would make the game lonely, sad, and weird; would look like nobody's on your side except for the occasional bullets seemingly out of nowhere. I don't know how this is going to work or of it is even possible; all I know is that I fucking want it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Corona Combat is an objective where instead of bullets and and and explosions: you have coughing, spitting, and sneezing. **How to Win:** in each team: there will be a bed located in their spawns with an elderly woman lying on it; your objective is to infect that woman with COVID-19 by discharging the virus through your firearm by all means possible; each grandma has 400 health. Protect your own grandma by infecting enemies and killing them. Be cautious of your distancing because getting as close to a teammate or enemy by at most 5 studs will cause you both to be drained of HP until either of you depart.  #8203; **Weapon Replacements:** Your primary weapon will be replaced to the Cough-12 which has the spread of a KSG with birdshot before birdshot was nerfed, has 25  #8594; 13 damage, and no multipliers. Your secondary weapon will be replaced with the SPiT 22 which has the same stats as the ZiP 22. Your melee will be replaced with a used napkin which has the same stats as the brass knuckle but with a base damage of 50 and a backstab damage of 100 Your frag will be replaced with a Pardonme sneeze grenade which has the same stats as the frag but with 100  #8594; 40 and a range of 20  #8594; 40. Every second you're holding the grenade: it says "huah" just like how us humans sneeze #8212;every second: the "huah" gets louder and longer.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>honestly what?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-15 13:43:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok so I made a poll on this subreddit basically telling people which among a set of setups are the worst based on statistics and two of the setups were the ZIP 22 with Sagittarius 40x, PBS-4 suppressor, ballistics tracker, and ratshot and a BFG with Sagittarius 40x, regular suppressor, chainsaw grip, and .17 Wildcat. The poll was closed and the votes were tallied; the ZIP setup won by 88 votes  amp; the BFG setup won second place with 48 votes and this made me chuckle. Why am I making a post about this? Because the BFG setup is worse than the ZIP setup and yet it still won. Some of you might be wondering why I even made a poll if I knew what was the worst and that I WANTED the BFG setup to win. First of all: I DID know which setup was the worst; the reason why I conducted that poll was because I wanted a second opinion, I wanted what other people thought, and I wanted constructive criticism and suggestions of how I could make them worse (in fact I even asked for suggestions but nobody gave to me them). I didn't just want to think on my own what the worse was and call it a day because that would make my research one-sided; I wanted to think with others. Second of all: I didn't WANT the BFG setup to win otherwise there would be no point to making the poll. The fact that I'm irritated is not because the ZIP setup won: it's actually because it won and people didn't explain why and how it was worse than the BFG setup was my belief that I thought to be true. It felt like a bunch of people told me that I was wrong, didn't even bother to elaborate, and just fucking ghosted me which I might even consider a pet peeve. The reason I assume why the ZIP won because people voted it solely because it was the ZIP and disregarded the setup for it and the other setups. How is the BFG setup exactly worse than the ZIP setup? Well the ZIP kills with 4 shots at close range if you shoot at the torso and the BFG setup kills with 2 shots in close range if you shoot at the torso; at surface level it would seem logical that the BFG setup would be better but you have to remember that the ZIP's cyclic rate is at a THOUSAND rounds per minute, it had 10 rounds in the magazine with an ok reload time, and the recoil is barely noticable while the BFG shot one bullet and forces you to reload for 3 seconds. So let me just repeat: the ZIP setup could kill with 4 shots in close range and it fires at 1000 RPM with 10 rounds in the mag so you can kill 2 people in without reloading which doesn't seem that bad; the spread is practically on par with the 12U and Sawed-Off so it's not reaching AA-12 levels of choke; just take cover because the handling is actually good and reload; the Sagittarius 40x being there isn't even a problem since you could always gangsta aim or hipfire. Meanwhile the BFG setup requires requires 2 shots to kill in CLOSE range if you shoot at torso so if you do hitmarker with it: you're still gonna have to wait 3 seconds before firing the next shot to actually kill the fucking guy; it does kill with one shot to the head and have 4800 muzzle velocity but GOOD LUCK hitting the head with your inability to ADS due to the chainsaw grip being attached and I wish the best with your endeavors of trying to center enemies with those large-ass crosshairs. But with all of this... can I even blame the participants of the poll? I think what I did wrong was that I made a poll and not a text-post. Because with polls: the end result is gonna be a number; elaboration, verbal reasoning, and explanations are optional. But with text-posts: you're forced to write a descriptive and text-based comment if you want to be heard and share your point of view in a more specific and detailed manner and not just add up to a number with all the other numbers in a number contest. So now I'm making you choose not with a poll but with a text post so now you're forced to TELL me and not just click buttons. Here are the setups in question and you're gonna choose what's worse in the comments and explain your reasoning: -AA-12 with VCOG, PBS-4, ballistics tracker, flashlight, and birdshot -Sawed-Off with PSO-1M2, ballistics tracker, and birdshot -Saiaga-12U with PSO-1M2, PBS-4, ballistics tracker, and birdshot -ZIP 22 with Sagittarius 40x, Osprey, ballistics tracker, and ratshot -BFG 50 with Sagittarius 40x, suppressor (the normal one), chainsaw grip, and .17 Wildcat Thanks for reading and choose wisely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two optics that exist in Phantom Forces which stand out and they are the Animu and Furro sight; some people like the latter (those are the furries), some like the former (and those are the weebs), and some can't decide which they are more fond of; so this sight will cater to all those 3 demographics hence the name. By that introduction: you most likely know what this sight is going to be. The UwUnity sight includes both the Toben (character illustrated in the Furro sight) and Anti (character illustrated in the Animu sight) together in one optic. It will be based on the TAR-21 iron sights because I like those irons. The front irons will have a heart that is striped in a pastel pink and cyan which are the colors of the parent sight's own front irons. The magnification will be an average of both sights. If you look closely: I didn't flair this as a joke post due to the fact that I legitimately want this in the game.

    <TITLE>THE G17 IS LITERALLY CHEESE (StyLiS Conspiracies)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-22 02:48:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>The G17 is a pistol in Phantom Forces that is popular with new players. Right? WRONG! In this Reddit post I'm gonna explain how it is in fact not a pistol nor even a gun but is literally CHEESE! Let's start with the first thing everybody sees first when they see the G17 which is its appearance. The definition of CHEESE is anything that is yellow/white, has at least ONE hole, sometimes has some blue, and takes in a form of a blocky shape/wheel. If we look at the pre-reskin model of the G17: it is yellow, has at least one hole, and takes in the form of a blocky shape. The British even use CHEESE as a slang to describe something very boring and if we look back at the G17: its design is actually **very boring**. Now why am I looking at an outdated model? To prove that StyLiS is trying to hide the truth! But this post exists so it's safe to say that they have failed! This is the part where I look at the origin and history of the G17. The G17 was made by the Austrians and you know what else the Austrians made? CHEESE! The G17 was first manufactured back in 1982 and you know what else came out in 1982? A popular song by the Dutch band "The Mo" which was titled CHEESE and a commercial by Sargento CHEESE! But these aren't really the origins and history of the G17 and are just more lies by StyLiS. CHEESE comes from milk and milk comes from mammals and StyLiS isn't a mammal right? WRONG! StyLiS furry "Toben" is a cat and cats are mammals which means she's able to produce milk. The G17 was made when Shay, Toben, and Lito were stuck in the edges of Highway Lot and they couldn't go back to their headquarters since Highway Lot borders blocked them. To stay hydrated: Lito sucked the milk out of Toben #8212;both her and Lito drank it (and enjoyed it intensely). Shay being the one that makes gun models: decided to not drink Toben's milk and wanted to make a gun out of it. Modeling this gun took so long that the milk became CHEESE and this CHEESE started having a really bad case of blue mold. They escaped a month later after rediscovering that they were developers that whole time. Thus the G17 was born! This is also why Highway Lot has no borders and also caused the birth of Anti: the son of both Toben and Lito; let's just say Toben and Lito got too close one night when they had dinner in the edges of Highway Lot. Therefore Anti and the G17 are half brothers sharing the same mother but not the same father. It's now time to look into the very makers of the Gjetost 17: StyLiS. If you rearrange the letters in "StyLiS" you can get the words "Sit SLy", "itS SLy", and "tiS SLy". StyLiS likes to associate with the word "sly" buy you know what else is sly? Sly  amp; Co. who played 2019's New Years Eve at the Langlois CHEESE Factory! StyLiS is the combination of 2 names: Shay and Lito; how many times did the word sly appear in the rearrangements? 3 times. 2 and 3... (2)3... (2)3 is equal to 6... what is 6? It is the number of letters C-H-E-E-S-E has! Besides the G17 being cheese: you know what StyLiS also hides? The problem of Phantom spawns being bad. Why are they bad and why does StyLiS like the Ghosts so much? Well that's because they see Phantoms as nothing but blue mold to their CHEESE which are the Ghosts. StyLiS is a furweeb cult that praises CHEESE! The G17 isn't just CHEESE; it has an automatic CHEESE grater internally integrated in it. Thus the bullets you shoot and the casings that you discard are actually CHEESE! But how is it lethal? You see the PF in-game character is actually a vegan and CHEESE comes from Toben and Toben is a cat which makes G17 cheese bullets come from an animal which makes it not vegan to eat and you know what happens when vegans eat animal-based food... they fucking die. The PF character being a vegan is also an explanation of why it as pale white skin and wears a smile filled with suffering and the departure of reality. But why would a cult that praises CHEESE make one of their icons a vegan? That's only because they wanted you to believe that the G17 was a gun and not CHEESE. PF man is a fallacy! When I found this out: I was really disappointed in StyLiS. But what disappoints me more is a subreddit mod will probably delete this and call me CHEESY and a degenerate so please spread the message if you see this. Go ahead mr. mod guy. You might be able to hide posts but you will NEVER BE ABLE TO HIDE THE TRUTH YOU SHEEP! Peace out #8212;stinkers.</TEXT>

Each map has 10 locations in where these boxes can be dropped on and these locations are randomly chosen. A round can have at most 5 crates to none and the intervals between the drops can last 3 minutes to the remaining time of the round. The items you can get from these crates range from a mag-worth of reserve ammo, an extra frag, a health kit that can max out HP, a free weapon (including guns/melees that haven't been unlocked by the player or legendary melees) that you can equip until you die, and many more. You can only acquire items that are only temporary to the round this means skins, credits, etc. are unobtainable. These crates are dropped by a Boeing B-17. It flies in a very relative altitude which is 200 studs above the highest solid point of the map. It travels through the map in a duration of 300 studs per second. The starting point of the plane is horizontally aligned to the position of where the crate will be dropped. Once the crate has been dropped: the plane will leave in the same path The crate will drop in a speed of 50 studs per second #8212;this is because it has a parachute. Upon contact with a solid surface: the parachute will already be flat and on the ground but still attached to the box. The crate can be opened if a player presses E while touching it; the box will open like a chest and a popup will appear #8212;revealing what item the player got. The name who got the inside of the crate and what he got will be publicly announced in the game chat; the message is "Congratulations to [playername] for obtaining [item] from a loot crate!". The one who gets the drop first will also be rewarded with 100 EXP and pop-up a message in the killfeed zone saying "[+100] Airdrop Opened!". The box has an opening speed of 0.75. Already opened airdrops will still be visible and just appear opened. If a plane crosses the borders of a map: an alert will appear in place of the level up pop up saying "Airdrop Plane Approaching" and once the crate has already been dropped an alert will appear also in place of the level pop up saying "Crate Dropped"; the crate will also show up in radar as a golden square. Since I'm an edgelord: I've decided to include this. In Crane Site: there is a 20.01% chance in where the Boeing B-17 will be replaced with the Boeing 767 and the aircraft will hit the crane #8212;50 studs away from the crane: a message will appear replacing both two of the airdrop alerts with "There is no God but God, #160;Muhammad #160;is His messenger" which are Muhammad Atta's last words before crashing to the Twin Towers. This easter egg is a reference to the September 11 attacks of 2001. After crashing with the crane: 75% of the upper part of the crane will be completely gone and inside remaining parts of the structure that is still intact will have a dropped crane melee in it. You may now laugh. If the devs decide to add this in the main game not including this easter egg: I'd understand why but still be disappointed.</TEXT>

What the fuck did you expect and why are you surprised? Let me get this straight. You hacked, you KNEW the consequences and you knew that this could cost all the time that you've invested in this account but yet you still fucking did it? And you want it to be reversed like it's somehow not your fault? You had two choices: the first is to not do it and not risk losing progress and the second do it and possibly get banned and fuck over your progress. You chose the latter, you did it purposely, you did it with conscious, now you're gonna fucking cry? Let me play the tiniest violin for your sorry ass. I can't understand people who act this entitled; they even have the audacity to mass ping developers sometimes. It's so stupid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're a pussy #8212;you are a quivering fucking pussy. Sorry I had to say that right off the bat. Unless it's chat harassment/spam related issues: kicking someone for reasons that doesn't involve the use of 3rd party programs with malicious intent makes you and the people who voted yes a pussy. These reasons can be because someone is a certain rank, using a certain gun, or playing in a certain way; and none of these are exploiting. You have a fucking arsenal in front of you, a selection of different weapons that go over a hundred and what do you do? You use a fucking command to banish that player off of the server wiping out his kills that round. This game is about killing people and not kicking them. Besides making you a pussy: this also encourages you to never improve. I'd like to hear from the people that pull this shit. What the fuck justifies anything? I've heard someone argue that "MAN MAKE ME CRY BECAUSE HE USE GUN SO I MAKE HIM GO BYE BYE BUT IT OKAY BECAUSE POPULAR OPINION WITH MY SIDE IT JUST DEMOCRACY". I'd like to know their thinking process and what type of fucking drugs they use just to sink this fucking low.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-28 16:37:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Skill doesn't make the gun better; it makes the user of the gun better. The gun never changes no matter how good you are with it or how many kills you have with it. The line between player and gun is so fucking blurred. People might say that skill matters more than stats and I don't think that's necessarily wrong statement but then it all changes once you use it when criticising/defending the quality of guns. I'm not gonna say it's just my opinion #8212;I think it's objectively stupid to judge a gun by skill which is a factor completely dependent on the player which isn't the gun. I met a guy earlier in the StyLiS Discord server: he said that the SVDS was bad because of its mobility and recoil. But he says the M107 is good and the M107 has way worse mobility and recoil. I called him out on his bias and double-standard; and he says the M9 user can beat the SVDS. Well no shit it can and guess what? A SVDS user can also beat an M9 user and the same goes with any other gun so what the fuck was this man trying to prove? After this he brings up that stats don't matter and skills are top priority and I don't fully disagree with that. The problem is that he jumped from determining gun quality on its own from determining gun quality regarding player intervention. So what is it then? If I had to guess: he was back-peddling. Using player's skill in an argument about the quality of guns is neither provable nor disporvable making it pointless. What's next guys? Are the guns going to start walking around now? Are the guns going to start falsely votekicking others now? Are the guns going to restore the Soviet Union?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's fuck the centrists, impregnate them, radicalize the kid, and then kill the centrist. And if the kid refuses then just fuck the kid and then radicalize the next child. So it's not really just fucking them: it's froking them (which means to fuck, rape, and kill someone). Here is why we should fuck the centrists: 1. Just killing the centrists isn't enough; by performing the procedure above: we will not only reduce the centrists but also increase the extremists 2. It will feel 2x as good. Killing centrists is satisfying but fucking them and then killing them is accomplishing 3. I think the centrists will be as tight as their shelter: the Overton Window (owo) 4. Fuck the centrists 5. I just really want to get laid; I've been very lonely since the pandemic and it has cost me to prevent seeing my nonexistent girlfriend.

    <TITLE>Muzzle Blinder (Barrel Attachment)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-30 05:56:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>The muzzle blinder is a barrel attachment that enlarges your firearm's muzzle flash twice the initial size which is the exact opposite purpose the flash hider serves. If suppressor is to loudener then flash hider is to muzzle blinder. # Here are some questions that people (the voices in my head) frequently ask me about this suggestion * **Why/when would I ever need this?** Well it can be weaponized by using it to blind enemies using the high muzzle flash it offers. * **What gun/s should I use this for?** I recommend using it on high RPM, CQC-oriented, and automatic firearms that you don't ADS with; examples of these guns are the Colt SMG 635, MAC-10, and M231. While you could use it on LMGs to maximize their already high cancer-factor; I think I would be better if you used barrel attachments for recoil-management instead because LMGs already have suppression to serve as the one to blind their target and everyone near them. * **What else would you advise against?** Don't ADS with it equipped. * **What are the trade-offs/cons of this attachment?** Well since the original flash hider slightly reduces hipfire and aiming stability: it would only be sensible to implement both those to the muzzle blinder but replace the "slightly" with "greatly" for balance's sake. Oh and it'll probably cause lag somehow. * **How will this even work?** I have no fucking idea; I literally just made up this shit one day. I don't even know if it's an attachment that exists in the physical world * **Is god dead?** Hopefully you enjoy this attachment if it ever gets added (it won't because nobody ever even skims through this shit).

    <TITLE>HOW TO VOTEKICK SOMEONE IN ROBLOX PHANTOM FORCES (2020)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 14:19:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>If you're reading this: I bet you've already seen the messages that \[Console\] sends in the chat. The message that's relevant in this post is the one where the bot tells you how to votekick someone;, now let me tell you that it actually didn't mention a very important step in votekicking; in fact this is actually the FIRST and most essential step. And this step is **asking for a second opinion**. You might ask: what does this mean? It means not votekicking someone immediately after the suspicion of exploiting even slightly crosses your brain. So if you think someone's hacking then please say it in chat to get everyone's side before you initiate it to avoid mistakes and look like a dumbass in the process. Oh and if the player you want to kick isn't hacking and you're aware of this but you want to do it anyway since you're salty: maybe you should just quit PF because **god forbid we actually use weapons and movement to counter enemies in a first person shooter game instead of banishing them like a child covering their ears**. Just suggestion though.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-05 07:54:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I don't understand the hate for this map if I'm gonna be honest. I do not hate anybody for hating this map; I'm just here to explain why I really like it and find it fun. The very reason for this is simple: it's because people are just really fucking stupid Enemies will camp like statues on those upper-wooden platforms close to the spawns making them one of the easiest targets in the game. When they do move: it's literally just them casually laying down while not changing their position so you can just wallbang them through the wood. And if there's too many of them there: just flank them; they won't even see it coming whether it'd be superjumping at the end of the wooden slope inside the main area of the cathedral, be taking the ladders and plank path, or perhaps one of the stairs leading to the wooden platform. Gives you some CQC interactions. You can also go to the main area of the cathedral (which I also call the junction of the map) and maybe cap the hill if you want to. Enemies will camp under rubble to kill unsuspecting victims. To counter them: just don't forget to always check under the rubble and if you do see a camper then just slide ending up in a location where the enemy isn't aiming at and then just boop their head. I use the Dragunov SVDS and sledgehammer for this map and rarely (if not: never) even pull out my secondary and just do CQC by hipfiring my SVDS via crosshairs or pulling out my sledgehammer. I don't even need attachments. When I started to use this loadout for this map it started to become way for fun than when I use things like autos. Maybe you might have the same experience but that's just me. All things aside: this is just my opinion and if you still hate Ruins then I don't have a problem with that (please just don't fucking vote Mirage over it). My intent with this post is to show another side. Thanks for reading.</TEXT>

I think I can even remember a public announcement in their server about them. It made me happy that it was possibly coming. Now about like 2 days after these rumors: suddenly nobody is talking about them and when I mention them in the StyLiS Discord server nobody answers. So what the hell happened? I'm guessing that it was dropped and that they've switched development to CoR6 which really adds another nail to the coffin PF. Either that or the rumors were simply just rumors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt that almost all the peeps that want the KS-23M's range completely fucked don't understand it's role. You need to consider that it's entirely dependent on range to even be good; it sucks compared to others within its class in close range because of the slow reload, bad mobility, sluggish pumping speed, and bad capacity. You may argue that it IS good in CQC because of it's ability to 1sk which is just stupid since literally every other shotgun can 1sk in CQC too; most of them have a capacity larger than 3, some of them aren't even in need of pumping, some of them have faster reloads, and ALL of them have better mobility than the KS-23M. It's not like it was good in long ranges or mid ranges anyways (even with slugs); some LMGs are better than it at mid range and most snipers and DMRs are better than it in long range. So please just leave it alone and stop being pissbabies about it. I don't think it even excels at range anymore and can't 1sk consistently up to 80 studs because people keep complaining and they still do to this day. Shotgun lives matter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do I counter an LMG? I honestly have no fucking idea. Whenever I kill the M60 guy in the center of Metro: I'm pretty sure it's just luck. Whenever there's an LMG user I rather just suck it up and try to combat them with what I already have or resort to using shotguns or an LMG of my own. Also I'm a sniper main which makes this 100x more difficult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear this phrase all the time in any PF related chat or discussion thread whether it'd be in Discord, Roblox, or here in the subreddit and that phrase is "abusing x" and everytime I hear it: I wonder what the fuck does it even mean? Does it just mean using a gun and doing at least decent on it? You know what? Don't tell me the answer because it's probably just one of those things that people say when they're mad. Like "tryhard"; shit like this has lost all meaning and are used by people who probably don't know its meaning; either that or the phrase/word itself was meaningless in the first place because people don't like it when I use the R870.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I saw a post made by u/legitPoodros like a few minutes ago and they made a statement regarding the new update and how there still isn't enough gun customization and I agree with them a fuck ton. I want more. #Canted Seperate the Canted sights from the "other" or miscellaneous category. I don't see why I shouldn't have a laser and a canted Furro sight at the same time #Muzzle Seperate the muzzle attachments from the barrel attachments. Muzzle attachments are basically the compensator, muzzle brake, the suppressors, etc. and the barrel attachments are the CQB barrels, long barrels, etc. I don't see why I shouldn't have both the carbine barrel and the suppressor simultaneously on my BFG. #Lasers and Grips Seperate the lasers from the underbarrels and rename the underbarrels grips. I don't see I shouldn't have both a laser and a grip simultaneously #Stock Seperate the stocks from the miscellaneous category. I don't see why I shouldn't have a laser and a stock simultaneously. #Magazine Seperate the magazines from the miscellaneous category. I don't see why I shouldn't be able to have both the extended mag and a canted sight simultaneously. #Additional shit  #8226; Basically just delete the miscellaneous category  #8226; Segregate the optics by type (iron sight, standard sights, and scopes (ie: "standard sights" are sights that don't give you tunnel vision and are also not irons. (eg: ACOG, Reflex, Kobra))) I probably forgot a some others too so comment your own suggestions and I might add them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-07 03:51:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>For the love of fucking god: can you people stop being so entitled? Just because they won't add equipment doesn't mean they don't care for the game. A LOT of equipment ideas that I've personally seen are either useless, overpowered, or just will never work at all. I saw one here about shoes that will make you run faster when you wear them and the guy didn't even list the flaws; how will that be realistic or balanced? Use your melee. Have you considered the fact that maybe your idea is just bad? It's been 5 years people: when will you learn that some things will never be added? Just because they won't nerf a weapon that you want nerfed does not mean that they suddenly abandoned the game. Think for a second: is the weapon that you want nerfed even unbalanced and is problematic let alone good or are you just salty and don't know how to counter it? Usually the latter is true. If you hate dying so much then why not just quit or get better? There's nothing wrong with being slightly irritated but to say that it's some sort of huge problem for everybody is stupid as fuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do the lasers affect recoil and spread? This doesn't make ANY sense to me. They're only supposed to give you a reference of where to aim. You're not putting a grip on your gun so it's not supposed to reduce kick; you're not hacking of your barrel so they're not supposed to better recovery, and you're certainly not extending your barrel so they're not supposed to better spread. The blue and green laser improve hipfire spread. The red laser improves hipfire stability. The green and red laser improve recoil recovery. The blue laser improves recoil kick. The tri laser does all of what the 3 lasers do but to a lesser extent. I do know that they don't improve these stats drastically but they still do and I don't know how. I personally just prefer one laser which you can change the color of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here are the changes if you haven't been aware:  #8226; Extended magazines have now been moved to the ammo category therefore you can't equip flechette, slugs, rubber pellets and the AA-12's 20rd drum simultaneously  #8226; The aimchoke stat will no longer be a thing and shotgun choke will now only be defined by the hip choke thus ADS will no longer improve choke stats making spread for the entire category worse  #8226; AA-12's choke was reduced from 3.7 to 2.9 but will be reverted back to 3.7 once equipping the 20rd drum  #8226; Flechette will no longer increase wall penetration by 3 and will now be a multiplier instead of a hardset value; it increases wallpen by 300%. Max damage reduction multiplier increased from 10% to 20%  #8226; Remington 870 choke increased from 2.3 to 2.45 and min damage decreased from 18 to 17.5 Comment the changes that I might've missed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"If they were to go one on one with the BFG user that had good aim they would get fucking destroyed" You realize this says nothing about a BFG? Of course a good player with good aim is going to succeed with any sniper and kill his opponents; that doesn't make the BFG any better. If anything: the BFG is limiting that good player because of its bad stats. "Especially if they have a good secondary like the ZIP 22" Unlike the BFG; most snipers don't need to depend on secondaries to perform good because they have more than one bullet as the capacity.</TEXT>
