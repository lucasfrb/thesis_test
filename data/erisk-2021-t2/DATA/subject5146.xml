E3 will have too much of a focus on next gen to announce something like RE3 there. It should be revealed this month, possibly in a State of Play or even at the Jump event.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Resident Evil Survivor. I was probably 6 or 7 years old. I HATED it. I couldn #8217;t understand why my friends were talking about Resident Evil so highly. After that I pretty much ignored the franchise until Resident Evil 5 was released. I played it and liked it, so I started doing my research on the series and found out Survivor was a spin-off. I guess it was a symptom of not readily having access to things like google and my dad buying me whatever game he saw with the name Resident Evil on it.</TEXT>

That being said, I think RE4 could do with a remake. Visual overhaul and allowing the player to move and shoot would be beneficial. 2 and 3 were VERY outdated by today #8217;s standards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This game just doesn #8217;t sound interesting to me. Monster Hunter World feels sluggish and clunky in my opinion, so that #8217;s not a plus when they say the gameplay is similar. Destiny 2 was boring as far as grinding for loot goes, so that #8217;s also not a good selling point. Beyond that, the aesthetic just doesn #8217;t look appealing.

    <TEXT>Hey all, I was just curious if anyone here has listened to Xero in the past. In high school, about 13 years ago, I had burned a CD with the original EP on it (Reading My Eyes, Fuse, Stick N Move, Rhinestone). I noticed on the 20th Anniversary album, there is of course Dialate (which I know no one has heard) and Esaul. I have heard Esaul demos before but they are all with Chester, not Mark. Anyway was just curious what everyone #8217;s experience was listening to the Xero tracks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Cure for the Itch just has a really cool vibe to it. POA has always been my least favorite on the album, I don #8217;t really have an explanation for why. As for OSC, I #8217;ve just heard it so many times that it #8217;s less enjoyable now. Plus I don #8217;t find it as unique as most of the other songs on the album.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t get me wrong, I don #8217;t think any of the songs are bad. It #8217;s just that POA and OSC are my least favorite. The album is fantastic overall.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I know they are b-sides. But when thinking about Hybrid Theory, most would throw those two tracks in with it.</TEXT>
