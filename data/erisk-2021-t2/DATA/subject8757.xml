    <TITLE>Important(?) Releasetime concern</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-03 01:27:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>When Battlefield 3 and especially MOH:WF they released at 0pm for everyone. But sadly it was the country time not the same time for everyone. That means somone living in Australia(please correct me if i am wrong) could play earlier than somone living in the USA. Knowing this all people tried to get a proxy programm running so they could start playing earlier. What do you guys think? Should it release at some point where everyone in the world could play it or should it be bounded to the countries time? Do you think its fair that some people can start playing 12 hours before others? How do you think EA should handle this?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2013-09-19 00:19:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Okay it may be too early but i was just thinking about the next Battlefield. I mean after BF4, there is going to be Starwars Battlefront but after that? The Possibilities are BF5, BadCompany3, BF2142 Sequel and going Historical again (WW2/Vietnam) or even something completly new. I personally belive that it is not going to be a BF5 because there are alot other things and no new Console generation coming also i dont think BF2142 sequel because Starwars Battlefront is basically a futuristic Laserweaponstyle shooter So i would say maybe a Bad Company 3 because the historical shooters are just worn off. What do you think about the next BF??</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Keep our Beta Stats ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-26 16:22:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the Battlelog information we got tells us that we have a timeline where we can watch the development of our stats. So I know the BF4 stats are going to be resetted but it would be fun IMO if we could at least access to the stats in the beta (or maybe even choose if we wont to save them). By that i mean no unlocks or anything which could give Betaplayers an edge. But just to see that "OMG i was soo bad when the beta came out" after some time of playing can be fun and interesting. What do you guys think about that?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Your opinion on HVTs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-09-29 09:59:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Dice posted some new information (http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/09/ask-dice-commander-mode-revisited/) on High Value Targets and how the Commander can reaveal the location on the map. My Personal opinion: I am really twisted between really good and really bad. Because in the later stages of BF3 you often had a good player in one team who kept hurting the other team hard and it seemed like noone did something against him,or maybe a guy camping in a corner and noone sees him.Those guys are going to have a bad time. But what i really dont like is what it does to "Stealthy" players. Alot of the times when I get  gt; 6 kills its because i go Silencer and flank the enemy maybe even get them from behind. So being revealed would most of the time be my death in these situations. So i think there should be a small change, so that the Commander could only reveal the HVT when he was spotted by somone in the opposing team. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>NPC City Balance Issue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2013-12-10 11:27:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the new Patch is out, i start onto my new starting Planet. This Planet had an Avian Village. So on search of new Weapons i found a Shop in their Village but the Items were too expensive. So i thought mhm lets see what they drop when i kill them. So the first Soldier in their City to die Drops me an 99 Dps Tier 2 Sword. WTF I can again Instakill everything on this planet with this weapon. Just in Comparison: Starting Weapon has 10 DPS and the things you could buy in the Avian Store were from 8-12 and cost 400 or 800. I think this is a huge issue because why would i even think about buying stuff when I just can kill the whole City and they drop much more stuff. There are 2 Ways to Balance this: 1. Give the Npc the weapons you can buy in the Shop. 2.(Which i like better) Make the NPC Soliders much Stronger so that you are "forced" to be friendly (at the beginning at least) Tl;dr: Killing NPCs in a City gets you much more powerful equip than you should get.</TEXT>

Ali because its sooo different from the other maps and its pretty Close Quarters. Never before i had so much fun with shotguns. Cobble: Because i think its well designed and has alot CQ and Long Range engagements. Also you have to worry about alot of niches where people can hide.

    <DATE>2014-06-28 10:22:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just got SSFIVAE and will start playing with a Dualshock controller. Do you guys have any Idea how to set up the controls? I really dont like the standart one. For example do i need a Key which is assigned to a combo?(HK+MK+LK+Sidescroll) Do i need a key for grab? It seems i cant get all these "hotkeys" on my controller so how should i set it up and which keys should i use for the standart kicks and punches?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just made a Demon deck like searching for "demon" and then putting every card that was found into it than added soulfire, sacrifical pact and mortal coil and tried it against a friend. Woah this new Card can give you a huge amount of Value. You might be getting a Felguard, a Doomguard or a Pitlord which would be max value scince you wont activate their battlecry. Sure there is some luck involved but drawing but this has potential. I think there will be some Demon decks in the Meta soon. Or what do you guys think about it? Maybe you already have a nice deck to show off?!</TEXT>

In the time after that he got 10 and i got 1 in the same amount of time. We both played on normal without artifacts. Is something wrong? Or is it just bad luck?! Bonus Question: Do MonsterLogs drop from enemies which i already have? **EDIT: Ok i just found an easy way. Just activate Command Artifact and instead of beaming to the last level you do the first ones again. I had like one dropping every 2 minutes because all enemies are Elite** Thanks for your help anyway :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Mute all allies - Worst option ever! - Here is why</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-07 11:10:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I really hope if you disable the Chat this way you get put into a que with only people who did the same. Here is why: Heroes of the Storm is a team game. And team games require communication. Yes there are toxic poeple playing, and there should be the option to mute a player if he is raging or talking shit. But mute everyone as an option before the game, is like putting everyone in jail because they might commit a crime, its the worst option ever. I dont want to be in a match with somone who chose to mute us all just because he got flamed from some individual. I dont want to be in a match with somone who thinks that this game is a solo experience like Hearthstone. Its a fucking teamgame and you need to talk to other people if you want to win it. Also sometimes the flame(when not attacking somone personally) is totally understandable and should be tolerated. Example: Really close game and somone totally fucks up and looses the game. YES this player deserves some hate. He just destroyed some of the fun for all other four players and as a human being you should be able to unterstand this and deal with that. In 2 teams with one communicating and one not i really think the communicating one will always come out on top. I really hope these people get their extra que and have to wait looong for their game or get some icon so we are seeing before the game who the players are who cant even read the chat. /rant (Just to clear that up i am not saying raging/flaming is good, but sometimes it just happens, and thats ok, and you should solo mute that player and not punish all others for that)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I fully agree to every point. I spent some time thinking why they would implement last stand and i guess its to get more teamplay and less randomness. Why: you can randomly spray through a wall(because you have so much ammo) and down somone which could be very frustrating. with a teammate nearby who can get you back on your feet that is nullified. It also FORCES you to play more slowly. Rushing in and downing somone could end in you getting killed and the person revived. With that said i think this is the "best" thing on that list at least in this new gamemode. In addition to that i dont understand why one team has xray for teammates and the other hasnt Oo</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cant decide which char to learn.(Forsburn/Maypul)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-10-01 10:17:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>I played quite some smash bros (played zero suit samus and ice climbers) even though i dont own it. so i got the basics but iam still quite the noob. I bought the game yesterday btw. Now i cant decide the char i want to learn. At first i liked Kragg but i dont like that he is a slow/strong character as i like the fast ones. Now i am in a decision between Maypul and Forsburn. Both seem quite fun but maaan i cant decide which one to main first. Can someone who mains one of these give some insights in how to play/ advantage-disadvantage so i can decide better :D? Tl;Dr: **Maypul or Forsburn?**</TEXT>

(I think they never even said its f2p ) But in my opinion its going to be like Heroes of the Storm because anything else makes not much sense. So i guess its going to be Game  amp; Maps = gt; f2p Heroes = gt;f2p rotation / for "full" access pay with earned ingame money or buy with real money Skins = gt; pay with real money</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-11-04 23:30:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>How i see it Valve hasn't actually made clear if they are banned forever or if they can be reinstated into Pro CS. IMO thats unfair towards the players. What ever they decide i think there should be a clear decision what will happen. That is best for the "banned" players and the rest of the community. To leave everyone guessing(Will they come back?!) is not a good thing to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did one playtrhough and i played it for 20hrs in my opinion its the most underrated game 2015 while being very good and funny and the gameplay is very diverse going from shoot em up to round based strategy. (Just 2 examples but I dont wanna get into more details :P) The story is also great but also a discussion point because some things about the world are only explained through talking with npc and you are not being told directly. TL;DR: I (still) HIGHLY recommend it and its sure worth 10 bucks imo especially because of the diversity in gameplay, the jokes and the nostalgia about other games :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i am looking for a game that i can play with 3 buddys I dont care if its Coop or Versus, but it should have "rounds." What i mean with that is nothing like Survival or Mmo Games where you put alot time into one session because we dont have much time. Also it would be nice if it was easy to learn but still hard to master so that we got some longtime replayability. At the moment i am thinking Rocket league maybe? Or a fighting game ?!

Its a twin stick top down shooter with enhanced mechanics like turret or tank drops and the difficulty ranges from really easy to frickin hard. else here are some versus games Blazerush is racing similar to mario kart but seen from ariel point of view Speedrunners is small a 2d racing game that is easy to learn but hard to master.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>why are missions easier on pc? with overpowered weapons or xp-boosting missions (easy but much xp) i totally agree. but there could also just be other planet types / user created maps instead of randomly generated ones wich would be awesome or maybe different mission types. or things the community can propose but arrowhead has to "confirm"/balance and can you stop talking about the campaign please. i already said that i also dont want things to screw with it but i still think its possible to make it work without hurting the campaign</TEXT>

    <TITLE>For "evening player" Europeans, the new Blitz Mission Timings are bad</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-20 12:08:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So yesterday there was a change in the Blitz Mission timers. While i appreciate Valves concern, the new timings are worse imo. So in the next 3 days the 3 Blitz rounds everyday are circling around times like 04:00 ,10:00, and 18:00. For me, i am mostly playing past 20:00, there now are no timings where i can really play the Blitz Mission, wich is sad. I mean 10:00 and 18:00 are pretty fair but the one at 4:00 wtf, it seems useless to most Europeans IIRC yesterday there was a mission around 22:00 wich was nice. Am i the only one who has this problem? Why can't every Region have their own timers?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for posting this. The only thing i dont agree with is your last Point " long respawn timer on a Darkzone boss. i like the fast respawning enemies. Otherwise serverhopping is going to be a thing and i would not want that. Even with only ~90hrs into the game i feel the same with the most poits and if i did the math correctly your ~60 members should have about 300hrs+. And with the content atm i could never see myself playing that long. gj and gl to your clan in the future btw</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does Overwatch use the Hearthstone Rank System and not the one from Starcraft ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-21 14:55:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Heroes of the Storm has same as Overwatch, the Hearthstone Rank System aka start at 30 then get to 1 to become one of the best. But a while ago with everyone complaining they said that they will switch to the SC2 Ranking System with different leagues (Bronze to Master) in the Future. Big difference is: The Number Rank does not represent your MMR while the League Rank does. (Example: A Silver Player will mostly play against Silver, Bronze or Gold level players, while with the other system a superior level 30 player who hasnt played in "this" season could play against a rank 1 guy) Now my Question is, if they saw that the System is flawed with another game, why do they put it into Overwatch?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes sure, but i, as a mostly competetive player, think its better if your rank goes up slowly but therefore represents how far you've come. In SC2 i started as Bronze and over two years with hard training i got myself into Diamon. I think these are accomplishments. In HS i didnt even try that hard since Rank 1 just has todo alot with grinding and having much time available to play in a month</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So whenever i play Mei (one of my favorite characters in KotH) and run to the objective i just want to shoot the ground in front of me and Skate on the Ice thats created. I guess it should only work for Mei and with that it would only get her to the fight faster. In the fight itself it would be too hard to pull off for the most. What do you think?</TEXT>

If one of the HP bars would be changed to Armor, from my understanding Widow should no longer One shot him because it reduces the dmg by 5 thus making a charged shot = 145?

    <TITLE>Why I already love that the game is not f2p or cheaper than it is or Open Beta is a lot more toxic</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-05 22:52:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>When i heared first that its going to be a 40$ game i thought "Damn i cant play this with all my friends now" even after hearing their explanation around switching charakters. So during the time of "Preview Beta" for Preorders and Friends i have had some weird Team comps (but the people in it were still friendly) but most the time my games were great and with good/friendly teammates. Now in Open Beta i already met some trolling people (playing Torbj #246;rn on offense with his turret up in spawn all time while being toxic etc.) and some general toxicity and this sadly reminded me of the things i dont like at CS:GO (which is very cheap to get) So all in all i think that the People Who are more devoted to this game are more friendly then people you are going to meet in a cheap or f2p title. just wanted to share my 1 cent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TBH i think there would need to be some kind of Game impact tracker and with that maybe somone on the loosing team shouldnt get PoTG. Should somone get a PotG for a 4x or more kill if Mercy just revives them all after that? Or should you be able to get "Play of the game", which to me sounds like woa it was so important that he/she did that, when your team looses? If your team looses it already means that you didnt make a huge impact.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope you would only see people at the end of the game having a lower rank. Its because the "hidden MMR" or the number that determins your rank stays the same. If the ranks shift it means the Ranks get different numbers. (sry if explained badly) but Your hidden MMR stays the same and MM only considers this hidden rating. and so people would still be as good as you, but they would have a lower rank</TEXT>

    <TEXT>first of all let me tell you that its stupid to talk about these things before there is a real gameplay video or people who have alot experience playing the game. (maybe even before the beta) i think normal mode in contrary to your opinion means that you need more skill to compensate for your "wrong"weapon. also in normale mode in CQC it is normally better instead of spraying into somone at close range still to aim for the head while in HC the one who sprays first most of the time always wins. Wich is also a problem because a ping difference is even worse than in normal play. As said i used to be a HC player in the beginning of CoD4 and lets just say it is ok to play if there are additional rules. When i played with friends we had thinks like NO GL or NO P90 just because these things are not fun in HC or the grenade spam was even worse.With newer CoD i got told that the difference is even stronger and that spray weapons will always win there. To sum up my statement i can say that you should leave the balance and the playstyle to the Devs and either you like the game or not, but not split the community and try to make both splits happy. Also if you want "true", and to me it sounds you want realism, experience maybe you should look for more "hardcore" like shooters.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Skins are not properly shown - Could Blizzard let us test Skins in the Tutorial Area?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-28 18:46:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So some legendary skins are great because of things that you dont see in the Skin Preview but only from First Person or while playing mostly because the weapons are not shown, only the character itself. A few examples being: Reinhardts Axe Skins Hanzos White Ult with the wolf skin Soldier 76s/Widowmakers Gun and there sure is more that i have missed. (Does Bastion have different tank/turret looks with his legendaries??) So before i want to go out there and buy my first legendary skin i have to look up some youtube videos of some of the skins i seem to like. Basically i want to see everything of the skins in some sort of preview.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OK yeah i bet this is gonna be downvoted asap but i want to write this anyway. Currently everyone can have every skin and while (mostly) looking better than the basic skins that makes collecting or owning them boring in some way because still with a legendary skin you are not special. Yes, i too want to have the GI-Suit Zenyatta but still i like the randomness. Maybe i will get no skin at all because i dont have much time. Maybe i will get a different skin for a character i dont like and play him more. The item you get just shows that at some point you participated at that game and were more or less lucky. Also it wont be the last event. So there will be other limited skins and thats fine with me so that when you get a special skin you can feel special :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude you story got me laughing so hard. I tested the game myself and the story started similar. When the Dev Lady told us the controls i immediatly drank my beer and was drunk af. (for anyone not knowing not only is your vision blurred but also the controls are weirded up) So i immediatly wasted a minute of our teams time by falling of the plank before bording and it took me some time to get back on board. The dev and i laughed the whole time. When nobody wanted to control the ship somone scremed into our voice chat "let mr drunk guy do it" and so i did. I ended up steering us between two enemy ships and getting badly shot up.(think pirates of the carribean 3) But somehow i managed to steer us back out and my team could repair the ship. after that we were damn slow and could only get back into the fight for the last minute before the demo or so ended. In this time i felt like a captain, like an idiot and like part of a good team while not being competetive about anything. This game is gonna be great.</TEXT>

Its like the weapon pickup in bf4 but you also get some "armor" additionaly to the new weapon. also every class has a weakness Anti tank sniper: can only shoot while laying down Flame thrower dude: always has gas mask on with limited visibility and is only close range LMG/Armor guy: Cant aim down sight(wich results in close combat only mid and long range would just be for surpressing fire), long reload, (dunno for sure but it feels like he has only armor in the front)</TEXT>

Also i know that it would come to that moment and saved 10k for one of the "new" Heros. I like heroes who are hard to play and maybe have some non standard moba things going on (TLV or Abathur).

    <TEXT>depends on how open/closed the beta is but tbh i think not. the beta players are having fun but they are still "testing" a game while its being polished. IMO a beta can work with getting all Cards available while in Beta but wiping at the end or just letting the players have their cards they earned</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-08 22:49:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i was playing some 3v3 Elimination on PTR and me and my friends chose a tanky team. we managed to kill two of the enemys but the tracer was left. After some time of her running away a countdown of 1 minute started towards the round being a draw. Luckily we killed her but i still think that it should only be able to draw if its 1v1 or 2v2 or even in 3v3 when noone is doing stuff. Running away should never be able to get you something. And in 2v1 or even 3v1 Situations the team with more people should win Thoughts? edit: if you downvote can you atleast explain your opinion?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As somone who enjoys both Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm i think its sad to see that the most People seem to rush against the easy AI to fullfill those 15 matches in the fastest amount of time. This way you will most likely make sure that you dont like the game. Take your Time and play 1 or 2 Real matches to see if you like it too. Also maybe Consider that Blizzard is watching. Of course even a few players staying at Hots would be a win for them but i think such a great event for either the Skin in OW or the Heroes in HotS should not be "abused" like that or maybe in the future Events like this will go differently</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can we please have an option To disable new Ultimate-Voicelines?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-16 22:52:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Ok this may seem harsh now and i am prepared for alot of downvotes but hear me out first. This game is in its Core a Competetive Game and Sound Clues are very important. Right now everyone knows the Basic things and can react to that, and with the last update came new lines for Junkrats and Mercys Ult. While i dont mind mercy that much i feel that voicelines that directly "endanger" me should always stay the same and thus Junkrats Ult Voicelines. With more and more Events in the Future and more and more Skins with alternate voicelines incoming i fear that there will come a point at wich things get confusing in the heat of battle, especially for newer players. And so i would like an Option or something that Assures that i will always hear what the Basic skins say. Thoughts on that? Edit: I would also like to add that i still like the Voicelines and i love Blizzard for doing such awesome work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Three Ideas for new Gungeoneers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-29 15:44:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>So had i had these two ideas when thinking about cool new Gungeoneer concepts. 1)The Glass Cannon - Has only 1 heart when starting but starts with infinite ammo or the weapon of your choice. (I think both ideas would be very nice) 2)A character that has a "secondary" starter pistol that always fires automatically in the direction you are walking to. (or maybe the nearest enemy, not sure?!) 3) The Akimbo -(starting with one pistol) but You HAVE TO eqip two guns (as soon as you got two) which both fire at the button press. Alot of Damage but you need to conserve ammo. This one might be OP or should get the akimbo thing as an active ability? Let me hear your thoughts</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i can completly agree with your review. (except that you forgot to mention the awesome coop mode) having not previously liked any roguelike before, i got into that game because i liked the references and the artstyle, and i heared it was a challenge. I fell in love immediatly and after 70 hours ive gone far, from dying alot to mastering the first bosses, but not beat everything there is to beat. so yeah the only real requirement is that you like a challenge. also it has an awesome 2 Player Coop mode wich makes for a lot of fun rounds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i just played **Titanfall 2** wich got out on Origin Acess for 4 #8364; a month. So far i have only played the Singleplayer Campaign and it is awesome! By far the best level design i have seen in a FPS. I don't really understand why it was launched at the same time as Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty : Whatever the last one was because SP wise it is awesome. but i think to enjoy it you have to like the fast movement system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So 'spoilers' from here on! After 102 hours i finally beat the Sixth Chamber and the Lich. Wohoo to that :) In Chamber 5 after beating the Endboss i found 3 things in the rest of the rooms. First i found the "6th Chamber" (more dmg per curse) at Cursula's and then a Mirror Room Chamber. I thought "Hey go for it, much damage and hopefully it won't jamm the Boss". And then i did the Chamber 6 pretty well had to use my "Orange" and got to the Lich. Well first i thought hey he is not jammed and did Phase 1 pretty good. Phase 2 i get a shock. he is jammed! but i least i have wings so i could outmanouver alot of stuff by flying above the pitzone. With 2.5 hearts left i beat him, none of my blanks left. I'm thinking"Hey, hopefully next Phase wont be jammed then i got a pretty good chance. And bam that Final dude is jammed.-.- Somehow i managed to outmanouver most of his attacks exept one leaving me at 1.5 heart and finishing the game. Whoa best run i had in a long time. I love the game! Had to share this here since noone i know is into this game!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yeah and i appreaciate the long text :) my story with sc2 is similar to yours i just wanted to be good at the game. Considering i started in beta, being really bad at rts games, at copper rank and stopped playing sc2 career after reaching diamond and staying there 2 seasons i think i saw everything from low to high level. Stopped playing there because i was pressuring myself to much and then there was a change which basically made MMM (Terran here) weaker and tanks meta stronger and i hated that. But sometimes i wished they had introduced Unranked with normal ranked, maybe i would have stayed longer. But i really learned alot about myself and what you can achieve if you want to. Btw the mindset that you describe that you never think you are good enough is something that alot of great sportlers / e-sportlers have from interviews i heared. so i would not call that bad :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So in Risk of Rain there is this Run modifier (basically a different ruleset for a run) that lets you choose the item you want from the chest (if its the same rarity as the chest). Why not make it a possible run in EtG like an Enchanted Run? I know it would make the difficulty for this run really easy, but it would also allow to test the combos or runs you have always dreamt about. (For me that would be compaignon only) Just make it cost more SpaceDollars and disable most archievments to "balance" it What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ive been in the same spot as you usually playing competetive games. and here is a big tipp for you : for a certain amount of time, (for me it was about 20 hours in) or maybe even until you beat the boss for the first time dont look up anything in the wiki. maybe even stay off this sub depening what you want from this game. Just want to beat it in a fast way, ok but if you want to find out stuff on your own, wich is also a lot of fun, then play some time without these tipps, or without anything ;) also, you can't force your way through this game. if you ever feel enraged by the game just step away for a while and come back when you want to play again</TEXT>

Yeah the first floors can be repetetive, but its all about the diversity of items you can get and the skill you develop while playing. So if you can get into roguelikes, definetly pick it up for that price. Unlocking everything in this game took me about 120 hours btw</TEXT>

Spoiler for an unlock: [When you beat the Past of] (#s "The Convict") [You unlock] (#s "an item that upon getting it gives you 250 Coins and some Space Dollars which can help you tremendously so if you want to use that unlock it and then do the Pilot stuff")</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So when i was 16 i was on a vacation with other teenagers and one evening/night, and there was a bright fullmoon. We were all sitting around and talking, this drunken dude starts going all scientific about how the moon does not shine by itself but is shined on by the sun etc etc seemingly to impress some girls or what. I was irritated by that guy and asked him casually if he put on sunscreen then because you know moon reflects sunlight and you could actually get "Moonburned" and that its even stronger this night because of the fullmoon. He asked the guy next to me and he agreed with me (knowing that it was a joke). So this idiot runs inside comes out 10 minutes later totally white and covered in sunscreen :D tl;dr - told a guy he could get "moonburned" and he believed it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So alot of comments on the One Trick Issue came down to "ugh yeah why did they ban player XY he is doing great with this hero, his winrate is  gt;50% and he is in high league Z so that means he is still a good addition to the team." While at the same time everyone is saying that normally when that happens, their team is at a disadvantage because in the lower ranks One Tricks (especially "weird" characters like torb etc.) are not so strong and force the rest of the team to change their playstyle. But basically you can't just ban somone for being bad. So either you ban EVERY One trick or NONE. You cant just say "lets only ban the bad ones"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the key thing is made in a way so that you get a guranteed key on each floor either through buying or picking one up. Players (including me, so no offense) are "abusing" this and only picking up keys after buying one. But you are right, there should be at least a sign in the shop or something explaining this After saying all this i need to add that EtG is my favorite Roguelike and one of my Favorite Singleplayer games of all time and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a roguelike or bullethell and a challenge.</TEXT>

Other I want a game that goes with the saying "easy to learn, hard to master" so that you could just easily teach somone, but the more you play the more interesting it gets?

    <TEXT>Same for me in DS2, never touched the dlc but totally different with DS3! First of all the game feels much better then DS2 (especially all of the bosses) I just played through all of the game and dlc this week for the first time. Imo there are at least 3 excellent bosses (in the dlcs combined) that are worth the price, one of which is easily the best DS3 boss. The Area in the 2nd Dlc looks awesome too. But if you just plan on "rushing" through the game then not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>dude you ideas sound like you want the game to be primarily PvE based. The way you describe the bossfights it it could even be a coop game. imo this game is primarily a PvP based game with the addition of monsters as a goal for you mission just to draw people in. and for that they are fine or maybe need a little tweaking, not a rework like you making it sound.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My Prediction for the next season: No Dinosaurs skins, maybe Post Apocalyptic Skins</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-13 08:12:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So ive seen alot of people talk about how Dinosaurs Skins will be the next thing and i disagree with that, so here are my 5 cents to the discussion. So its definetly not Dinosaurs, we already got two of these skins in the game and Season pass 2 and 3 tried something new.(No knights before season 2 and no space stuff before season 3) And also i think the Season Pass 2 and 3 tried to get a theme that everyone thinks is cool and maybe Dinosaurs are a little bit of a nieche. But sticking with the Comet and Destruction theme, it could also be Post Apocalyptic stuff kinda mad max ish. I can certainly see some really cool skins with that. What are your thoughts on that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey my questions are about Duos and Squad games. I have played games, won a few but it seems like i am struggeling at specific points in this game. For Duos: I feel like i am way too passive (which i dont like) when playing "the edge" of the storm or when i drop somewhere and have to run alot, for example Factory so in the end i often end up against peolpe with better loot. If i drop really agressive / stay in the middle of the circle i often die because i am getting seen/shot at / pushed from two sides and different teams. What is a good "middleway"? or idk how do i avoid that. In Squads/sometimes also duos it often happens that me and my team either drop into one house and have not enough loot or two houses and then somone dies early die to being pushed by a whole squad while the rest of the team then cant help while the downed people get killed off. How do i avoid that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>IMO this game needs to try out a mode where you pick your role before entering matchmaking(you can only pick that role ingame) and the game will try to match two equal teams that consists at least out of 1 tank 1 dps and 1 heal with the rest being random but equal in both teams. (maybe put some more camps in like 2 heals max) or even just go with always 2/2/2. I dont play the game but i hear that there is such a mode in LoL and that it works. Edit: That would lead to a more "stale" meta i guess but at times id prefer that over discussion and instalockers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yup i watched a little bit of gameplay from some YT vid so that ive seen some situations :\) also 2 more questions directly at you because you seem to answer also of stuff :\) why no Boomer in the No sympathizer one? she still does have a higher chance to get a cylon in the sleeper phase like a delayed baltar. also in the No sympathizer version there is alot of stuff helping the cylons. \(draw 1 more card and less starting resources if i remember correctly\) Would it be wise to revert one or both of those to normal since its the first game?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i just saw this game for the first time, i am interested it looks awesome and i am thinking about preordering. It seems some people can already play the game so i have a few questions ? How hard is this game and how much playtime can i expect to get from a basic playthrough \(final boss beaten\) or until i have the feeling to have "seen it all"? Also how much of this game is skill dependend and how much is it "farm" dependend. What i mean is like there are roguelites in which enemies are nearly impossible to beat until you have some items and after that its easy to beat , that would be very farm dependend while in other games eg enter the gungeon or isaac you can beat it on the first run.</TEXT>

Both are Rogue\- like/lites with either a fast combat and combo gameplay \(WoL\) or slower with an Item and Shopsystem you have to care about. If you are referring to other Roguelike/lites pls tell me how much the game depends on farming. There are some roguelites wich let you level the character and you have nearly to no chance to complete the games during early runs, wich i dont like. i think it should be skill based.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>nice video man i think it covers Everything that new players should be aware of gameplay wise. i really liked that you highlighted the changes of the latest patch but you might say at the beginning of your videos that stuff might change in future patches. even as a level 90 i felt entertained and i never thought about the concertina bomb as a way to stop a revive. btw do you know if one can destroy a concertina without an explosive if it hinders me reviving my mate? as new video ideas: 1\) loadout changes when reaching T2 / T3/ Max Level 2\) other playstyles with their loadouts \- Sniper / Close range \(shotgun/melee\) / Sneaky \(silenced pistol\) / Special guns \(avtomat / nitro\) 3\) other "modes" \- Single Boss \(do you change loadout wheather you fight the butcher or the spider?\) / loadout\+gameplay changes during night gameplay 4\) you could even make a vid about all the different point of interests and their audio traps like you showed the one spot in the beginning of the video. hope you continue with these vids good hunting!</TEXT>

Is it just something you consider spontaniously or do you explicitly invite people to play it Like for example scythe (one of the few games i ve played of those). I think about buying it but i fear that i will only play it like once or twice at the beginnign and then it goes into the box for a long time.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-06-22 17:38:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i am playing the game soon and i wanna know what exactly is allowed and what not. I tried to read some threads but im not sure about getting it right. First of all though in Card Trades during a negotiation cards are not shown to the other player before trading right ?! Examples from what i got so far, please tell me if i am right or wrong 1)When i say "i will give you an attack 30" or maybe "i will give you your flare card" for your xy then its binding and i cant give something else. So when i say something specific i first of all have to have this card but also need to trade it. right? (Is it even allowed to ask for / offer specifics ?) 2) But what when i say " i will give you my highest attack card" . The other players "knows" that it can litterally be anything. So in this case do i even have to give the highest attack card because the way i said it is not specific or do i have to do exactly what i said or can i "lie" in the way that i give him my attack 5 even though i have attack 30?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cosmic Encounter Question - Best Aliens for a first game ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-23 14:25:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the first impression seems to be very important with a game and with CE i feel like the wrong aliens could mess it up. I know that there are Green/yellow/red aliens but i want to play with aliens who make it fun to play. Ive never played before but i have looked up some powers. As an example i think The Parasite seems awefully strong for a beginner card while not being "fun" to play against in a first game? In the best case it would be like 10-15 Aliens, from the Base game ofc, so that everyone still has a decision between 2 aliens like normally. What Aliens should i use? What Aliens seem fun while reading but should maybe not be used? Maybe there are even intermediate ones that i could include ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, new here got 3 Questions: 1. I just learned the game a week ago and got to play some more at open house. Now i got the tipp that if i want to spend money anyway i should to go to this Pre-Release, especially because there is some sort of Core Cards (dont quite understand what that means). Does that really make sense for somone who is that new? (Though i have to add i played alot of Hearthstone some time ago. I know its a totally different game but i mean that i am familiar with different types of decks/way to play ) 2)If thats a yes what should i do in the limited time that is left? rather try playing alot or learn about deckbuilding or maybe get to know all the cards? i really feel atm that the deckbuilding would be the biggest problem Edit: 3) Does it make sense to say "Ill make an aggro deck anyway" like OP before having seen your cards?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i got Pandemic Legacy and i want to start it soon so please no spoilers. I am also interested in expansions for the vanilla game (especially "On the brink") if i still wanna play more after the Campaign. So is it possible to play through legacy and use that board later as a vanilla version? Possiblity i have thought of: 1)If its any like the Risk Legacy version i could maybe not rip up any cards while playing legacy and ignore stickers afterwards? But i guess that could spoiler stuff for people who havent played legacy? Can you guys maybe help me out? Is there even a smart way?</TEXT>

Even odds for everyone its up to you to use the kit to its strongest. Also the gameplay could vary alot depending on weapon types for examples only silent stuff, everyone gets a shotgun or everyone gets a sniper.  #8203; What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>thanks for you long answer. At the moment Kemet really sounds great. Encouraging aggression is what i want from a game since i really dislike turtling. Also from the looks of it the tech tree allowes for some different kind of strategy besides "what areas do i wanna control". and i guess it seems to make kemet replayable in a good way. The only other game im currently looking into is Rising sun because i heared it has a nice social element with teaming up and backstabbing. have you also played that?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I played it since beta and its a huge success for me. The Atmosphere is awesome and for me there is no MP game that can compete with that. What i especially like is how the game can be really different on how you play / others play. Sometimes you dont hear a shot for 30 minutes and ask yourself whats going on (wich sounds lame but is super tense), only to have a big shootout at the monsters lair. Sometimes its action right from the beginning.  #8203; Id say you have to be a little competetive, while not getting mad when your character dies.  #8203; Most Bad reviews at the beginning came from bad performance. And while its not great yet, Crytek has done alot performance wise. With my 1060 i am able to maintain around 50 fps most of the time and i think they will continue working on that.  #8203; Only "problem" now might be a hard entry. Most people in the community have played for a long time and while you get your first matches with other new players once you get into the que with everyone else (its level based) matches are going to be hard at the beginning.  #8203; Solo is only recommended if you have alot of patience. The game is much better with someone else and at best if thats a friend. But you can always que with randoms or find people on the official discord.  #8203; So imo if the Trailer and premise of the game looks good for you, you should give it a try. if you have huge problems with performance, there is always the steam refund thing...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Interesting thing though, i think esport could be olympic but chess shouldnt be. IMO sport has something to do with "perfect execution" and some sports have tactis on top of that. In chess, there is no such thing as execution. If a chess grandmaster is standing behind you telling you what to do, you could move the pieces exactly where they should go. But if somone tells you to shoot an arrow at the exact spot or run 100m in record time you would not be able to do that. In games such as LoL or CS sure you can say to somone go there and click that, but they wouldnt be able to execute that in the nessesary time and accuracy  #8203; I am not saying that chess easy or something, its incredible what good chess players do but its my take on whats a sport and whats not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep you were right with the "can't".  #8203; I thought a bit what makes a social deduction game for me. And thats a healthy discussion with accusations and defense (no idea if that word is correct) . Whereas Coup, a great game i might add, is played really fast and people dont really explain why they are doing stuff or whatever but just try to play somewhat around their real cards. One thing i want to ask if you play Coup alot, do you remove Cards when playing with a smaller amount of people (for example with 3?) because then everyone can have the card they are claiming to play but with 5 people you know that somone is lying when 4 people claim they got the duke.</TEXT>

And to the playstyle i think the people i am playing it with like it because you can play a round so fast, you want to win but it also doesnt matter as much if you get out first. edit: might i ask if you are playing with ambassador or inquisitor and why, and also if you play with the expansion? thinking about getting it  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Got Damaged Cards in a Precon Commander Deck, what should i do?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-11 19:17:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i bought my first Precon Deck today Aminatou Commander. Opened it at home and not in the Store if that makes a difference. The cards seemed like they were glued together at the top lightly but only lightly so that it was easy to get them apart. Some of the Cards though have their frame damaged. Like they lost some of the color or some fluid was spilled over them and tried. They were sealed and packed in an original package but there is no "proof" that it wasnt me who damaged the cards.  #8203; What should i do? Go to the Store? Message directly?  #8203; Sure they are playable btw, but i still payed for "new" cards.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should i play the Legacy Operations before playing WOTC?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-03 12:51:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i played some of the normal Xcom 2 , stopped playing for a while and now got the dlc. The legacy Ops are supposed to unlock stuff for the campaign so i wanted to play it.  #8203; Now i already played through the first of the four Legacy "Campaigns" but i dont know if i should go on. The Missions already spoiled some of the enemies i havent seen before. wich is not so bad but i am wondering if it is worth going on before getting into the WotC Campaign. Also, 2nd Question: i unlocked "weapons" with the first legacy operation. are these just skins or do they play differently? And what would the next unlocks be?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So i only played a little Xcom 2 before and now i got WotC and the additional addons. Should i use integrated DLC or just have them enabled each?  #8203; I read that integrated is better but then you would be missing out on Story content. Can somone elaborate and tell me whats best?  #8203; Also i only want to do 1 big playthrough so no trying both options.</TEXT>
