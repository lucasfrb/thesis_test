    <TEXT>There are a lot of videos about SL's duty's, Karmakut and Nano did videos about that, it's on old versions of the game, but should help. But anyway to be a good SL need have experience, and i'm not talking about hours of play. That may mean nothing - i mean a quality of that, understanding how game mechanics work and understand of rules and tactics of playing and most of all, teamworking - most important key thing.This is not just put a radio and dig a HAB. SL, specially now- it's a lot of comm's, lots of decisions, good SL per each squads - it's 80% of win. Game is really complex in that way</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BF3\\BF4 -shitty hit reg, even worse that Squad, no modding, which is sevier,map destruction not so great, all scripted liniary mostly.Weapon customizations in modern BF's - absolute funky childish crap,btw, Squad class selection offers some minimum, but combat needed customization,accurate to real military, not some childish crap..And BF 4 is AAA game from big studio, Squad was made by modders as Indy-project and its beta, cause it's difficult to make some, if you don't believe me, try some in UE 4 by yourself.So more content can be in game, including jets and attack helis (everyone knows a heli mod)How you even compare modern DICE garbage to original BF2 masterpiece legacy (made by same studio, but different people) to normal game like Squad?I don't understand why people keep compare games, which can't compare,cause it's has different gameplay and hole idea and even different genre</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help survive during coronavirus in Belarus</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-14 10:56:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound. I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things got pretty bad after my truck company where I work for living was closed due to coronavirus and also freelance work goes down too. Right now I have no income source and I'm afraid I'll run out of savings in few time and won't even be able to pay the rent and buy food. All the money you'd donate me will be used for basic necessities and survival.

    <DATE>2020-06-17 13:59:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound. I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things got pretty bad after my truck company where I work for living was closed due to coronavirus and also freelance work goes down too. Right now I have no income source and I'm afraid I'll run out of savings in few time and won't even be able to pay the rent and buy food. All the money you'd donate me will be used for basic necessities and survival. Also there is a bad political (dictator supporting by russians) and economical situations in country, and coronavirus sufficiently influence on it ,make things worse.There is elections gonna be soon, and we already have political arrests and repressions to people who try to speak about it. What is more, it is very difficult for me to ask for help. I've always been strong and confident. Even in hardest times I worked my way out on my own. Always.

    <TEXT>it works fine in PR -and will be work fine in Squad -there is no "urban only" level there.It's about realism perspective of the game,if we are talking about comms and teamwork. It's not only from "flight sim" perspective.Also works fine in good old Battlefield 2. i'm not including\\ do not think that "Frostbite" era BF's is real BF's - it's more like COD with vehicles... So it would be done, with or without permission players approval.PS. I also fly in past, i was in aviation college and i was grown and trained in Microsoft Flight Sim 2009 or Lock On Flaming Cliffs, so i know what i'm talking about.Lso BF2 modder for 15 years...so...Squad need Air for sure...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's very silly and weak position ... Cause realistically we have aviation which get controlled by people (AI also do,cause it is a game)" If you go with a half  #8222;realistic #8220; approach, there wont be any heli vs. heli or jet vs. jet fights in 95% of all sorties "" In modern times, air-to-air fights are rarely seen , but lets be honest here. "Exactly, lets be honest it's not true at all - I can get some examples and combat proves.. This is not how it works on modern warfare, you better google a bit about how moder army's working today. Things now really complicated, it's not like in 1945 - when y jump in in paper made plane and fight with shity mashingun only on board and fly like a cow.....I say again - it would be done, no one asking permission...if people thinking it's only infantry game - pls go to COD,Insurgency Sandstorm or whatever...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well, after 2500 hours and tonns of Stryker vs 30mm fights i can say - you never know. Even if you know a weak spots and know where to shoot, most of the time 30mm win (obviously higher fire rate auto cannon bigger caliber), but if crew of btr are weaker that you and you have element of surprise, you can kill wheels and engine fast - to destroy mobility,then turret,it enable to lock on you,and the goes for weak spot on armor to kill it,like flank him if his turret disable and shoot it from back - and you win. You need a good skilled driver and lot of communication for that but it's possible, bit struggle -ish, due to 50.cal, but possible if you know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well...those things get me vibes so hard.... Well, BF 2 is good,not only about it's tracking, it's good overall - singleplayer with bots, not depending on internet or server,mods, huge community on ModDB and etc,tons of mods again, lot of 3d software for that, great class balance (not that idiotic 4 class system a.k.a. lone wolf),vehicle balance, map balance, everything, except only about engine itself which is has limitations because it's old. But i'm not sure if we need that - Squad (son of BF 2\\PR for those who in "tank" and don't know what is this) is not about statistics - it's teamworking - the process is a goal - we have already we need\\all stats in end of the match. That's why it's better in crap games like BF3\\4\\V and etc, but not in Squad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound. I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things got pretty bad after my truck company where I work for living was closed due to coronavirus and also freelance work goes down too. Right now I have no income source and I'm afraid I'll run out of savings in few time and won't even be able to pay the rent and buy food. All the money you'd donate me will be used for basic necessities and survival. Also there is a bad political (dictator supporting by russians) and economical situations in country, and coronavirus sufficiently influence on it ,make things worse.There is elections gonna be soon, and we already have political arrests and repressions to people who try to speak about it. What is more, it is very difficult for me to ask for help. I've always been strong and confident. Even in hardest times I worked my way out on my own. Always. But right now I feel very uncertain and afraid. Every small bit of donation can help me to survive the outbreak of the virus and keep me in good shape. I'm praying for everyone who's now in trouble due to current situation. But I believe that it all will turn around and change into good :)) Greetings from Belarus Rostislav [My campaign](https://gogetfunding.com/help-3d-games-animator-from-belarus-to-survive/)</TEXT>

Healthy individualism is a must to be developed successful individual with personality and strong mentality of freedom. I'm sure "the darkest night time is before dawn", so i can only share wishes of support verbally and hope you will be fine. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound. I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things got pretty bad after my truck company where I work for living was closed due to coronavirus and also freelance work goes down too. Right now I have no income source and I'm afraid I'll run out of savings in few time and won't even be able to pay the rent and buy food. All the money you'd donate me will be used for basic necessities and survival. Also there is a bad political (dictator supporting by russians) and economical situations in country, and coronavirus sufficiently influence on it ,make things worse.There is elections gonna be soon, and we already have political arrests and repressions to people who try to speak about it. What is more, it is very difficult for me to ask for help. I've always been strong and confident. Even in hardest times I worked my way out on my own. Always. But right now I feel very uncertain and afraid. Every small bit of donation can help me to survive the outbreak of the virus and keep me in good shape. I'm praying for everyone who's now in trouble due to current situation. But I believe that it all will turn around and change into good :)) [My campaign](https://gogetfunding.com/help-3d-games-animator-from-belarus-to-survive/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>first - it;s different situations second - Luka own it forces for own pretection - they served him, not us,people of Belarus. Third - if your protesters become riots just for crashing private property and magazines, like they did,just for scavenging - they should be stooped by police,cause they violate private property of normal citizens and not demanding anything - they just took it by force,cause they don't care about real goal of people get out(like higher tax payment or social benefits), same as in US, leftists, riots and communists,russian lovers and other criminals,supported by so called "democratic-socialists(communists criminals)" trying to collapse country - and i 100% support Trump secret police actions and i don't care about "Black live Matter (black LIES matter)".

    <TEXT>what a bulllshit i just read.....lies about everything and no proofs, as always, and don't you dare compare Belarus situations with Catalonia..Catalonia is legit part of one country and it's a different story. Yes - my protest is a rightful one - you never prove the opposite, cause you have no knowledge, no facts, i'm sure. "leftists are the "bad guys" and that "LGBT" is fake news or whatever" - leftists are idiots novadays, unfortunately, and it is what it is..I'm said nothing bad against LGBT...do not try to revert and play with world ,cause it's sounds like exuses. "Lukashenko's regime than you think so, eh?" - maybe if you are not pussy come here and help? No? thats what i thought. I curious where've you been when russians attack Ukraine and annex their terriotoires, what didi you do?Nothing...i was there and helping them, volontirering - helping wounded, help with drones and stuff, like most of my friends. "Lithuania is next door. Sounds dumb, doesn't it? That's how you sound." - dictators country welcomes you aswell, if you don't like place where you live..</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Nah man, not at all. You didn't say those protests were dumb, no you didn't. Of course you didn't - it was the famous "putin bot", not you. "LGBTS protests - nobody give a shit about it,no one cares" -read carefuly, use brain i you have or eyes... "putins bots" expressions is so childish...  gt; Okay, how? I guess those leftists that support Minsk protests are dumb, too? I give that you actually support dictatorship in your country, after all? examples,open YT for fuck sake, start diggind, watching nrmal blogger, not a memes after work,there are a lot of proofs, facts, you still have it at least, developed yourself.  gt; Bitch, please. You are one of those folks that think "people shouldn't protest because they have it good there, unlike in Africa". You are exceptionalist that thinks only theirs struggle is valid - that's how you lose support, by being a goddamn prick that downplays the issues of other protests. That is normal people reaction on struggles and how they think, you are trying to play with words , but you are diggid the hole for you by yourself.And btw, you deviate from last quetion...  gt; Nowhere did I say those two are comparable you did, scroll up....  gt; I guess you have some real problems with interpretating words. But sure, let's play your little game. i guess you have some real problems of understanding how things working...but it's your problem.Beeing insult - is a result of weak position and no arguments and proofs.i'm not surpised.  gt; No, it was directed at you. If you don't like the regime - leave. Simple, yes? i know your kind - poeple who are complaining about what goverment trying to do, becoming lazy and sily from healthy life, and stop watching goverment. Instead goverment see, that you are not reacting and continue do what they do, you only complaign and do not do anything. And the a become a critical point and you wake up and realize that y've beeing use and catfished and start protesting...i know how it works...So i say that to you specificaly. You may not like the truth and keep minusing my coments, but y'll never hide the truth - it's always only one.  gt; I just changed Catalonia with Belarus to show off your dumbass logic at play. only a "dumbass' (sorry, i don't wanna be like you, insulting people,cause lack of arguments) can bring bring bad example that logicaly not right and have no realations with current situation in near from your country....i guess watching tv too much...but it's alos your personal problem... Are we done?Or you continue poluting topic with this "arguments",cause i need to go "to kick some riot police ass" with little advice of ukranian "molotov cocktail", before interent goes dawn in night completely....

    <TEXT> gt;Also it seems to me that you, like many east Europeans, don't have any idea what communism is. me? or so you may know?, i'm apologizing, bu if you try to explain me, i'm sure you will justify it, so bro, no, i live in post soviet country,i'm from Minsk, and i'm exactly know here communism leads to...soon y'll be protesting as me against it on streets.  gt; Before you speak further about BLM, you should find out what they protest about. Hint: it's not leftist politics. As much as I dislike Americans making everything about themselves, I also dislike people in this subreddit claiming that only Belarusian protests are legitimate and calling BLM protesters a violent rioting marxist mob. compare closely and will see the truth, and minusing the thread didn't help a lot.... BLM? you mean Belarusians Live Matter? No one of us,belarusians, says that we are only legitimate one, it's your saying that, and it's your problem and perception Before you speak further about so called "racism" which exist only to white people and so called "inequality" they fighting for in US (which is fake, cause US has black president recently and don't you dare excuse that), i suggest a bit learning history of country we speaking to and roots of politician competition happening between two major parties there, neither speak about my Belarus situation....

    <TEXT>Christ, all mixed together "communism,socialism,Czechoslovakia, tanks", such a mess you write there....no understandings of what that is, cause you never saw that, as those lefts who are popogade fro that,just believing on mantra they want and  gt; Having a black president doesn't mean racism is gone read carefully, it means that is no black people complain about, if people are dumb and lazy and don't know how to make a proper life in 2020 in free world countries - that their fucking problem! Why majorities should comply om demands of minorities, who only demand and take, instead of being normal citizens and socialize.  gt; And, in recent years, about literal neonazis (the kind that shout "blood and soil" (a nazi slogan "Blut und Boden", translated) and "Jews will not replace us" while marching with flags of Nazi Germany, US National Socialist Movement and similar organisations) having rallies and killing anti-fascists. All of that while the government and the media slander antifa, as terrorists. Antifa, who so far killed zero people and punched very few. Antifa, who have medics at protests, actual medics who are ready to treat anyone, who cared for a neonazi that was punched until the ambulance arrived. that is big pyle of crap. Check Donut Operator former police officer YT channel  gt; about FBI assassinating Martin Luther King Jr., about racist policing (e.g., the supreme court agreed that NYC stop and frisk program was applied in racist ways), about cops killing people and receiving no punishment, and about cops who speak up against this being fired and blacklisted. what? holy moly fairy tail.....  gt; So maybe you should learn some US history before you speak of their protests, my man. you definitely need to visit at least his memorial in Washington, D.C , maybe learn smth.....Btw emotional speech is childish and not explain anything.... i and many of my americans friends, including police officers,military,and just citizens already saw everything they need to see and share thoughts...i have tonns of vids So pls stop it...this is Belarus thread, not USA....</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help survive during bad Political repression and bad economical and covid time in Belarus</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-26 10:20:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound.I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things got pretty bad after my truck company where I work for living was closed due to coronavirus and also freelance work goes down too.Right now I have no income source and I'm afraid I'll run out of savings in few time and won't even be able to pay the rent\\bank loan and buy some food.Also there is a bad political (dictator supporting by russians) and economical situations in country, and coronavirus sufficiently influence on it ,make things worse.Also we already have political arrests and repressions to people who try do something against the regime.Elections were unfair, and we started to peacefully protest against regime,and you already heard what happens next.

    <TEXT>Of course,it's kinda obvious question. We don't need that fake empire here, in Europe. Soviet union was formed illegally,by force,by occupying other countries,erasing history,languages,culture of other nations,gulags,departations,starvations, executions , denunciations, just continue what russian empire did,but with different sauce. Only jealous, dumb and brainwashed people what it back...cause they want to no need to think,do,or making smth,create,government do all for them, using them as meat, they need just eat food,work as almost slaves for nothing, and listen what the criminal government tells them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>as BF 2 and PR both veteran as player and modder over 15 years, and knowing mostly every line of code of Refractor 2 engine - PR is BF2 blood from blood, just changed and expanded best of BF 2 -real Battlefield not crap Frostbite Era. Expanded VOIP,dedicated server,modding,realism,hardcore,teamwork,dividing by squads,commander mode and etc. Same way Squad goes, but struggling,and a bit in different way, cause UE 4 (which i also working in) has more possibilities to implement stuff that BF2\\PR never get due to poor engine and restrictions, so dev's decided to make things like that,and follow a bit different path,not be similar 100% but keep spirit of "father". After 2600 hours of it, i enjoy it, but i keep in mind some bugs,gameplay features i don't quite like a bit,some changes which should be fixed and etc. So i'm not sure that Squad gonna be 100% PR - it's still different game.But it's doesn't mean it's less hardcore and realistic. It's a PDST simulator for sure for many players :))</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you are denying the facts of history and compare monarch to dictators of late 20-century soviet legacy? but only thing you can oppose is protest thing, which is nothing to deal with freedom about we fighting for. LEARN HISTORY!!!! FYI: In the 1880s Bismarck set aside his conservative impulses to counter the socialists by creating Europe's first modern welfare state, establishing national healthcare (1883), accident insurance (1884) and old age pensions (1889) So what those protets sands form and how it can relate it to what we have now in 21-century? "When you lick this anti-democratic, monarchist fuckers boots, you can go lick Lukashenkos and Putins boots, too." - i see only you doing that pretty much.... Ane we deviated from original statement : Any agreements with Russia are not worth the paper on which they were signed. Real terrorist state</TEXT>

    <TEXT>yes, but it's exactly what they doing - violating every international laws and agreements first, and saying - "that's not us", disclaiming responsibility and blaming others(USA or, in that case,Ukraine) for their failures and failing to keep commitments. That why i put this phrase - it's on point even today...""They are not worth the paper it is written" is a point - rest is dust.the point is- never trust the russians...not rely on their word and etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it's not propaganda at all..For sure, but mentioning this phrase people use to shame actions of russian federation,cause this state reacts same way.But people prefer overreact to words, instead of see the point and actions that words related to, so it's not propaganda, words play,mostly.And if people, like others above,starting overreacting and deviate meaning to other way - it called "diverting from the topic to the side, draining the opponent". it's just attempt to get away from initial post, which means that Putin's russia is occupant and not let him meddle in Belarus the same way.Appears people has not enough brain cells. In fact, Bismarck did not write that. And because there is no such thing in his writings, and because sheer nonsense - what kind of money is this and where should Russia come, if she herself always borrowed, including from Germany?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;**Will Belarus follow Ukraine out of the Russian orbit?** now in 21-st century in 2020 - is a logical way, to get of such a country,especially if we see who is supportive to people directly and who is not. To get away from country, recognized in the international arena as an aggressor and occupier under sanctions for 6 years now, poisoning unwanted people with military chemicals, while inflicting damage on innocent citizens of a developed country, annexing foreign territory in violation of obligations under international treaties and holding fake referendums in these territories, unleashing a war and then not to recognize their own soldiers who are participating in the war without identification marks, saying officially that "this is not us and we are not there", supporting any bloody dictators they can find and so on . So yes...will be good if we can out of it, maybe be independent in our own way but with good relations with our neighbours</TEXT>

    <TEXT>if you smart enough, you can google a bit, and find out, that so called "russain language" is pretty much not natural " #1080; #1089; #1082; #1091; #1089; #1089; #1090; #1074; #1077; #1085; #1085; #1099; #1081;" - as he says.Belarusian language is naturally formed as in any nationally formed country. Typical russian tactics -take information and distort and flip it is upside down making it faked. So that trick was used many time against ukrainian society...It will NOT work here, Mr Lavrov a.k.a. " #1059; #1085; #1099; #1083; #1072; #1103;  #1051; #1086; #1096; #1072; #1076; #1100;" (Sad Horse). Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you send us an AR-15 to each protesting person - we will summerely beat current Luka forces, in quality and quantity and i gladly agree with you....But we don't have any access to weapons - they have all - from pump-action shotguns to heavy vehicles,protective shields and grenades,jamming devices and other stuff for fight....Believe me, we beat off our own - the same kickboxers as you said - a lot of video about it- no one wants a lot of "big blood" - and first sacrifices have already happened on August 9-12..So hand combat not efficient if warfare -self defence and last resort only. Its feels like you watch many Chuck Norris hollywood movies...It's not working in real life....Sorry don't wanna offend you...And weapons only - weapon is a sign for a freedom individual who has right to protect himself against government or any other oppression and crime,has right to be a people's militia.( a.k.a 2-nd amendment in USA Constitution).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, good people on the internet! I hope you all are safe and sound. I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I'm a freelancer 3D games animator I have a dream to to become a full time animator one day. However, things going pretty bad here after elections were unfair, and we started to peacefully protest against regime,and what happens next - we are been tourchered, brutally arrested,striked to death,when police forces start shooting on unarmed civilians who came up on streets to saying their "NO Against the Regime" and fake results of elections.... Result you can observe at Okrestino Jail,where many of my people has detained and arrested,kick out of job's, blocking finances access and possibility work how you want, blocking down the internet for days, threatens to people who want to live in free country with working laws and democracy,clean and fair elections and all attribute of normal country. They only help we can get on our way to gain our freedom - is attention from abroad and any help can get... We will fight, and we can get our freedom, but not all of our citizens are supportive - many of them are get brainwashed and follow regime, but people fight back,it's already become a tradition tho I've always been strong and confident,even in hardest times I worked my way out on my own. Always. But right now sometimes I feel very uncertain and afraid. I can tell more on my Facebook , if you want to know more..... I also have some content on Youtube and on my online Portfolio, which i worked for before, but now it barely possible physically and mentally,cause focus surviving and striking against regime.... Every small bit of help allows me to survive the strike and our way for freedom and keep me in good shape while protesting ,because it helps with pay apartments,so i don't get kick out on streets and beaten by regime-so-called "riot police". I know that i'm not only one with that kinda problems and not special, i just trying to seek some support from people around,who understands me and situation here and overall.Just needed a little "push forward",nothing more. Help me win this fight against poverty,despair,anxiety and become free again! I'm praying for everyone who's now with me in current situation and also for people who being supportive even in such hard time due corona and their own problems on political arena also. Bless you and kind regards from Minsk [My campaign is here](https://gogetfunding.com/help-3d-games-animator-from-belarus-to-survive/)</TEXT>

It's named as "btr goes x2"..don't see any skills here....  #8203;  gt; You seem to think that we can just ignore that you made it about kills, and then changed your claim to fame to being about teamwork. Again, if you don't like your words being read out to you and quoted back at you, maybe choose different words, Mr. Proper English you think that i let you just run away after your words sayed first, mind what you typing tho,son</TEXT>

Bro - we have two options - apologize for all you sad from start-i will apologize in return -and you normally admit that post was normal,and that all comments before are part of you own perception and we will both continue do what we doing before, or just carry on,cause even people in discord are saying to me that hole shitshow not woth my time and as me trying to prove anything to people who not understand is not worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's on you -you start this accusing me in 20th time i can show you from beginning of discussion - that was zero constructivity. you quote this:he was not infantry - he was in 3rd shitty BTR with KPVT MG, and i'm not sure he is more effective than double 30mm, read score carefully)) - what is wrong with this? it's fine. next one: you are hilarious - i wonder how are you even living - so yes chek score carefully especially accusing person in non effectiveness like you claimed before - you are accused person in non effectiveness and now below ----- Read that normally: you saind: Yea, well, he got 24 and you guys got 23 and 22 respectively...so... i said: respectfully, but it's not how this game works, so no.... you said: Are you saying 24  lt; 23? Are you also saying 24  lt; 22? Are you saying you don't know which numbers are bigger? 24, 23, 22, and you don't know which is the biggest? i answer: I'm sorry, don't wanna hurt anyone,but you came from gay- COD or modern BF's? this game is not about kills - i didn't say anything specific like that - and etc. ---------- It's entirely your fault - you started get flamed - you not understand who Squad statistic works!? You said: Are you saying 24  lt; 23? Are you also saying 24  lt; 22? Are you saying you don't know which numbers are bigger - it's your words - not mine - your perception -all of it...i didn't say anything that i super skilled,"god of squad vehicle" initially - that's your words...I just trying to correct you this way :"this game is not about kills" - you didn't get it and all this crap started...But you are definitely heard this one :"I'm sorry, don't wanna hurt anyone,but you came from gay- COD or modern BF's?" - well it's hard truth . And it's not my problem that you are not get point from important info, but get to personal different sarcastic expression...no my problem. This is how it's started....</TEXT>
