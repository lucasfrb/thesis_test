    <TEXT>Judging by her statement on Hong Kong, which she gave to the reporter at the D23 expo, she seems to be neutral on the issue. Her statement: "We are living in a world right now where there #8217;s so much change and confusion and lot of stress. And I really, for me, I hope that there is good resolution and peace and people will find a way. I think always, ultimately, the truth and the goodness of people win out and history proves that time and time again. So, we #8217;ll see ."</TEXT>

After all, Disney had her doing the voice just two years ago for Ralph Breaks the Internet and a few months ago inducted her into their Disney Legend hall of fame.

    <TEXT>In Israel, there is freedom of expression where citizens can freely bash and criticize the Israeli leaders. In West Bank, journalists are harassed for criticizing Abbas and the cronyism in the PA. I love to see Tlaib go to Ramallah and dare to criticize Mahmoud Abbas and his buddies. I love to see what will happen to her and hope that her views in Israel will change after that. She is a total joke anyway.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read an answer about the probable reason why she supports the HK Police, in Quora. According to the answer, her ties to China are also strong. As a young woman she returned to China to attend the Beijing Film Academy. For most of her film career prior to *Mulan*, she has starred in films produced in and for the Chinese domestic market. Although *Mulan* will surely make Liu Yifei more of a contender in Hollywood going forward, it is in her economic self-interest to not alienate herself from the Chinese domestic film market. Even if she doesn #8217;t agree with them, I understand her desire to tow the party line in order to protect her economic self-interest. Even if she did not express support for the Hong Kong protestors, her silence on the matter could very well be taken up by Chinese netizens as an evidence that Liu Yifei is  #8220;too Americanized #8221;,  #8220;not Chinese enough #8221;, or worse,  #8220;a traitor #8221;. So I interpret her social media posts as a pre-emptive move to silence her potential critics, and protect *Mulan #8217;s* Chinese box office.</TEXT>

Also, let #8217;s try bringing up a title for this live action. So the casting are as follows: Ben : Ryan Kelley/Dylan Minnette Gwen : Mary Elizabeth Winstead Kevin : Nathan Keyes Julie : Suzu Hirose Max : Barry Corbin Cooper : Greg Cipes Voices of Ben #8217;s Aliens : Dee Bradley Baker/Mark Hamill In this discussion, we could help in bringing up and discussing a precise plot line for the UA live action and also additional characters who could be the villain and castings for them.

    <TEXT>There is a great deal of evidence that he has been helping China cover up the pandemic: 1. He downplayed the severity of the virus claiming that there is no human to human transmission of the virus in the early months of 2020. 2. He criticised the travel ban and said it #8217;s not effective, without giving any clear evidence of why so. 3. He lavishly praised CCP for effectively dealing with the virus, when in fact their shoddy mismanagement in the dealing with the pandemic is well known. ( literally he seemed to be reading out of a script written by the CCP) 4. He continues his belittlement of Taiwan and ignored several warnings of the virus from Taiwan, just to appease Beijing. 5. He continues parroting official Beijing statements rather than seeking an independent verification or investigation over the origins of the virus and the official death toll in China. And also, he is also known for his cover up of epidemics in his home country while he was the health minister of the country. To me, he already joined the ranks of Hitler, Xi and Stalin. We are just waiting for the moment, when all this ends for him to be tried in the International Criminal Court in The Hague, for his mismanagement of the crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The word President are used by dictator/authoritarians around the world. The countries they rule are often described as democratic and constitutional republic, but in reality still not considered free or democratic. The political party they rule, has the complete dominance in the country #8217;s government or political system. These leaders often groom their family member or political ally to be their successor of them, in ruling the country, just like in PRC. These leaders win sham elections, political dissidents are not tolerated, protests are often suppressed, opposition parties are virtually non- existent and a cult of personality revolves around them. Many of the opposition leaders have to flee abroad to continue their activities in challenging the rule of these autocrats. Examples of few such leaders and countries: 1. Nursuthan Nazarbayev and Kassym Jomart-Tokayev (Presidents of Kazakhstan) 2. Islam Karimov and Shavkat Mirziyoyev (Presidents of Uzbekistan) 3. Ilham Aliyev (President of Azerbaijan) 4. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow (President of Turkmenistan) 5. Emomali Rahmon (President of Tajikistan) 6. Milo  #272;ukanovi #263; (President of Montenegro) 7.

Japanese Anime shows like Pokemon, Digimon, Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, etc. are still popular even in the present generation of children and teens. Doraemon, Shinchan and Kiteretsu are hit Japanese cartoon shows in India. They are even dubbed in Hindi, to allow massive viewership among the population. K-pop is popular among foreign female teens, mainly bands like (BTS). While K-drama is popular in other southeast Asian countries. K-Pop is dominated by several of its dark side aspects, including abuse of stars and their tormenting lives under their music contracts. It #8217;s negative aspects are covered extensively by MSM sources. [The Dark Side of K-Pop](https://youtu.be/02ul1nZpmpY) [The dark side of K-Pop clubs ](https://youtu.be/l-YAUL4qgmU)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, Aladdin #8217;s live action story was also altered in an insignificant way by adding unnecessary characters such as European prince Anders, who is not even mentioned in the actual tale of Aladdin. And also in the actual tale of Aladdin, I don #8217;t recall the part where Jasmine or Aladdin starts singing  #8216;A Whole New World #8217; or  #8216;Speechless #8217;. And yet, these musicals were there in the live action Aladdin movie. Disney has already alienated the animated Mulan fans with the radical changes to the story made in the upcoming live action. They should have stuck to the animated movie #8217;s story with musicals rather than rewriting to make the story different from the animated movie and killing away characters like Li Shang and Mushu.</TEXT>

Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat supported the protests and he is currently blacklisted from doing movie business or movie promotion in mainland China. The lead actress of the Mulan live action (Liu Yifei) has most of her film career based on the film industry in mainland China. She is much well known in China and other East Asian countries than in the US. If you think that it #8217;s a great idea that she should support the Hong Kong protests, then she is literally allowing her film career to commit suicide and she will end up like actress Fan Bingbing.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-26 11:26:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>As a child, I used to watch Mulan and I used to enjoy the movie a lot especially the storyline and musicals in the animated movie. My curiosity is to know, how do the Chinese people perceive the 1998 animated Mulan movie. Does it have aspects that are deemed offensive to Chinese culture or do they like or dislike the entire storyline of the movie?? And did you all like the way Disney retold the entire story of the Ballad of Fa Mulan. As I recall correctly, the Chinese dubbed version of the movie performed poorly in Box Office. I would love to know the overall impression the movie had on the Chinese people and culture and what is your complete overall review of the movie from a Chinese perspective.</TEXT>

It #8217;s these protests that resulted in resignations of Presidents Sargasyan and Kocharyan. 2018 Armenian Velvet revolution will go down in history as one of the bloodless political revolutions. You can also freely criticise the government if you want to, when you don #8217;t agree with their policies. In Azerbaijan: Try organising protests against the Aliyev regime, you will end up being brutally beaten up by the police and thrown in prison, where you possibly can also be tortured. The Aliyev regime will go in greater lengths in order to suppress the political dissidents within their country, whom they feel are threat to their monarchical like rule of the country. Or they will end up launching war against Armenia to distract the country from these protests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A total of 449 tweets were sampled for the data analysis. Indian tweeters account for about half (49%) of the tweets on #TweetforTaiwan. USA comes second at 19%. UAE and Germany are at 4% each. A significant portion of the UAE tweeters could be Indians living there. Taiwanese tweeters are at 2%, tied with Thailand. Hong Kong comes in at 1%. So I guess India is doing the heavy lifting for the #MilkTeaAlliance. Finally, tweets from PRC come in at 1%, although this number could be more, given that they use VPNs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Buran and the American Space Shuttles will not fly again. Both projects have ended, and the orbiters have gone to museums (or have been destroyed). Reactivating these programs would be enormously expensive at this point. The Shuttle showed that a spaceplane has some disadvantages. It turned out to be really expensive to refurbish the spacecraft for each flight. The Shuttle was designed for things NASA rarely or never used: the ability to launch, do something and then land one orbit later was never used. This ability drove the size of the wings, for example. The ability to retrieve satellites from orbit was used a few times, but not as often as envisioned. There's a company working on a space plane right now (Dream Chaser), but it's much smaller than the Shuttle. If Skylon ever becomes reality, we could see a large space plane again.</TEXT>

After Sun died, Jiang made arrangements for Sun's body to be cremated before an autopsy could be performed, and for her ashes to be disposed of before Zhou Enlai could take possession of them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wehrner Von Braun also had a similar story to Kurt Tank. He also worked in designing V-2 rockets, which were used by Nazi Germany in attacking cities in UK, Belgium and Netherlands. Later, he moved to US and became an aerospace engineer. He helped in the the development in the rocket and space technology for NASA. He helped to also design the Saturn V rocket, which helped US the goal of first man in moon. Unlike Wehrmacht (Nazi army) and Luftwaffe (Air Force) generals and officers, engineers who worked in the aviation industry were spared from war crimes trials by Allies, because they felt that these engineers could give them some expertise in the development and advancement of future aviation technology.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Translation: At This moment, we stand with all our partners in the democratic camp, with the people of Hong Kong.  #12288; #12288; In recent days, China's Congress is planning to bypass the Hong Kong Legislature and enact the so-called " Hong Kong version of national security law which seriously threatens the future of Hong Kong. If the law is implemented, the core values of democratic freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong will be severely eroded. The So-called " unchanged for 50 years "," " Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy " is on the verge of bank I believe that my fellow countrymen, like me, are very concerned about Hong Kong at the moment. I have also said more than once that in the face of Hong Kong people's desire for freedom and democracy, the solution is not bullets, not to create more fear and crackdown, but to truly implement freedom and democracy and truly live up to Hong Kong's promise of autonomy. Only in this way can Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities regain trust and let Hong Kong society return to freedom and calm. The government has always taken great concern and responds to the development of the situation in Hong Kong, so as to ensure that the security and interests of the country are fully protected during the exchange between the two sides. According to section 60 of the #hongkong relations ordinance, the situation in Hong Kong can stop applying one or all of the ordinance once the situation changes, we hope that the situation in Hong Kong will not come to this stage and will pay close attention to the future development. Take the necessary contingency measures in time. Taiwan has been giving great care and support to the people of Hong Kong people who are struggling to defend Hong Kong's core values. I would like to stress that the Hong Kong and Macau ordinance has already established the relevant norms in helping the oppressed people of Hong Kong. During the past period, government departments have continued to provide all kinds of possible humanitarian relief. In the face of changes in the situation, the international community is actively helping the people of Hong Kong. We will build on the basis of what we will improve and improve the relevant rescue efforts to provide the necessary assistance.</TEXT>

He literally ended up cheating Teng and was playing with her feelings, so much that Teng was literally heartbroken when she discovered she was deceived by Jackie Chan for so long, when he announced his marriage to Joan Lin (mother of Jackie's kid). This relationship hurt her so deeply that when Teng attended the Hong Kong Golden Melody Awards in a certain year, she even cried and said that she would rather not receive the award than to take the trophy from Jackie Chan. No wonder why Jackie #8217;s own kids have a very sour relationship with their father.</TEXT>

Jet Li #8217;s present wife and children seems to have such wonderful bond with him. His eldest daughter has been doing charity work and advocating for social causes. His daughters attended top schools and universities in Singapore and US. They achieved a lot in their academics, which shows their upbringing. But Jackie #8217;s two children are complete wrecks. His son is arrested for drugs and he stays in Taiwan with his mom (Joan Lin), rather than with Jackie. Chan went as far as not attending his son #8217;s trial hearing. Jackie #8217;s daughter who was completely disowned by him for being a lesbian and for being born from an affair, had to move to Canada, where she is struggling to find a job to work. Jackie does not even maintain any connection with his wife Joan after divorcing her. I would choose Jet Li over Jackie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most of them know what happened in Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, the CCP prohibits any form of discussion regarding what happened and prosecutes anyone doing so. They also have taken measures to block or censor related information. Textbooks have little, if any, information about the protests. Print media containing reference to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events. The Chinese Online Encyclopedia (Baike Baidu) has no article or mention regarding what happened in Tiananmen in 1989. Only the overseas Chinese community and Hong Kongers remember or commemorate the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Any other countries, it is known as Tiananmen Square Massacre. But in China, it is known as Tiananmen Square Incident.</TEXT>

If you were to check the comments of the tweets of Anti-CCP, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong users, you will see that a lot of them commenting statements bashing them and amplifying the support to Chinese government, are actually bots. I can instantly recognise these are bots because most of them have usernames which are long in length and you can #8217;t even barely even remember them. Their accounts are recently created and most of their accounts consists of retweets rather than making their own tweets. They comment derogatory stuff on anyone who is against the CCP and it #8217;s policies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Other than the police brutality, I really hated when Disney actually casted her. [Disney #8217;s Pick for Mulan is Literally the Worst Actress in China, According to China](https://nextshark.com/liu-yifei-disneys-pick-for-mulan-is-literally-the-worst-actress-in-china-according-to-china/) The movies she starred before the live action Mulan, are not that critically acclaimed. After seeing the Mulan trailer, I noticed that she barely even displays more than one emotion to her character and she always has that face paralysis . Seriously, couldn #8217;t they cast actresses like Constance Wu, Katie Leung, Gemma Chan, Krista Marie Lu or Michelle Ang, who are more experienced or critically acclaimed in the roles they played. Well, let #8217;s see how the movie is once it releases in September. I will make further judgements on the movie after that.</TEXT>

It #8217;s so funny #8230;  #8216;I can neither confirm nor deny. #8217; So, yeah! #8221; This statement means that, it is possible she has a cameo in the live action. But she is not openly admitting it, in order not spoil the surprise, since her cameo is something we all are excited in seeing, when the movie releases to the theatres.</TEXT>

They both fought in the uprising, but were imprisoned by the Germans after the Polish Home Army surrendered on October 2nd. They were imprisoned by Germans till May 1945, when they were released following the surrender of Germany. 15 years later, they fled Communist Poland, in order to avoid persecution by the Communist government against former Home Army soldiers. They moved to America, where they settled and started their family there. Boles #322;aw Biega (later known as Bill Biega) wrote a book named "Thirteen Is My Lucky Number", which includes a full account of his experiences during the Warsaw Uprising.</TEXT>

It was built to honor the lives lost in the 1989 Tiananmen protests. It was then destroyed by unknown agents of the Polish Secret Police (S #322;u #380;ba Bezpiecze #324;stwa) in the very next day of its unveiling. However, with the democratization of Poland in 1990, the monument was rebuilt in 1999 and continues to be taken care by the Road and City Maintenance Authority of Wroc #322;aw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If there is such a musician maybe. But it is just that Viktor Tsoi has much more greater impact as a musician. He is often celebrated as cultural link between Russia and South Korea. If you type  #8216; #48709; #53664; #47476;  #52488; #51060; #8217; in Google or YouTube, you will find abundance of videos and news honouring him from South Korea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite being a Russian musician, he is still popular in South Korea. He is considered as Koryo-saram. He and his band were scheduled to visit South Korea following the opening up of Soviet Union in 1990. But, he died in the same year in a car accident in Latvia SSR. As a result, the plans for the band #8217;s tour in South Korea and other Asiatic countries never materialised as a result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think North Koreans were able to visit Russia (which was then part of Soviet Union) because both of them being communist countries and North heavily relying on aid and assistance of different forms from them. USSR never recognised South Korea after the end of Korean War. Although Gorbachev had established indirect ties with South Korea, it was only after the collapse of Soviet Union in 1991, that Russia officially established diplomatic ties with South Korea, under Russian President Boris Yeltsen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think so. According to the articles I read, Soviet pilots never flew combat operations against the US, under the North Vietnam flag. However, they were stationed at North Vietnamese airbases, where they would advise and train the North Vietnamese pilots in combat operations against the US aircraft. There were instances where Soviet pilots flew training sorties with North Vietnamese air cadets, in MiG-15UTI and MiG-21U. They were times when the pilots have been taken surprise by US aircraft and forced to defend themselves. One case I read is that on May 1968, a Soviet instructor was flying with a North Vietnamese student on a Mig-21 trainer, was damaged by an AIM-7 missile fired by an USAF F-4 Phantom. The plane crashed on landing, killing the crew or at least the Soviet advisor.</TEXT>

It #8217;s a topic that requires a lot of additional research until more files regarding the Soviet participation in Vietnam are declassified by the Russian archives Although, the USAF pilots knew that North Vietnamese pilots flew missions against them and scored air to air kills. Several years after the war, some USAF and North Vietnamese pilots met together and established bonds. They talked about their experiences in air to air combat during the Vietnam war. From this, the USAF pilots know their opponents were mostly North Vietnamese pilots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The **Pozna #324; protests of 1956**, also known as **Pozna #324; June** ([Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language): *Pozna #324;ski Czerwiec*), were the first of several massive protests against the communist government of the [Polish People's Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic). Demonstrations by workers demanding better working conditions began on 28 June 1956 at [Pozna #324;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84)'s [Cegielski Factories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cegielski_Factories) and were met with violent repression. A crowd of approximately 100,000 people gathered in the city centre near the local [Ministry of Public Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Security_(Poland)) building. About 400 tanks and 10,000 soldiers of the [Polish People's Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Army) and the [Internal Security Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Security_Corps) under the command of the Polish-Soviet general [Stanislav Poplavsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Poplavsky) were ordered to suppress the demonstration and during the pacification fired at the protesting civilians. The death toll is estimated from 57 to over a hundred people, including a 13-year-old boy, [Romek Strza #322;kowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romek_Strza%C5%82kowski). Hundreds of people sustained injuries. The Pozna #324; protests were an important milestone on the way to the [Polish October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_October) and the installation of a less Soviet-controlled government.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As I can recall correctly, Katie Leung was actually a contender for the Mulan role. But, she lost the role to Yifei, since Leung does not have martial arts experience (Yifei has some because she stared in The Forbidden Kingdom and other Chinese martial arts movies). I checked Zhou Dongyu. She could be perfect contender for the role. She is even listed in the Forbes China 100 list. With some martial arts experience, she could have been the best one to play Mulan.</TEXT>

I probably think Disney is going to put the movie in Disney Plus and put some special pay feature in the service, which would mean that new users or old users have to pay online, in order to watch the movie.

    <TEXT>Lion King and Aladdin had no controversies to begin with, although they were brief protests against the casting of Princess Jasmine (the actress was a British Indian). But no major controversies against the films, which led to highest grossing of these films in box office, as there were no massive boycott campaign against these movies. Mulan, from the start is mired with controversies. The fans of the original hated it, for the removal of musicals in the movie along with their favourite characters in it. Then, the straw that broke the camel #8217;s back was when the lead actress voiced support for the Hong Kong police. This led to the continuous trending of the boycott campaign against movie. Along with COVID-19 pandemic and boycott campaign, Mulan live action is right now in a rock and a hard place. No one is going to theatres when the pandemic is worsening, even if it releases in August, if they are concerned about the health. It would probably mean that the Mulan would be the first Disney live action to flop in Box office.</TEXT>

Mulan became the first Disney movie to be politicised, due to actor #8217;s support for the Hong Kong police. There is a chance that boycott can play a half the role in box office effect of the movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In those days in 1970s, most of the first class cabins of the aircraft were fitted with bars and lounges for the passengers of that class. There might be inflight entertainment those days, such as movie projectors screening movies during the flights with personal headphone for passengers to listen to it in class. Back in 1975, things were simple. All fares were refundable and bundled with a plethora of services. The 1975 fares, even the cheapest ones, were fully refundable. Today's cheapest fares aren't. Your only alternative is to spend another $50 or so to purchase trip-cancellation insurance from a third party--and even that doesn't guarantee a full refund. Yes, first class passengers are the ones paying for comfortable seats and also those days smoking was common in lounges for first class. However, with the start of 21st century, aircrafts stopped having lounges (except A380s and 747), due to cost reduction. Smoking was also prohibited due to regulations.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-15 21:59:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>It was initially a manga series created by the well known Fujiko Fujio, who was also the creator of Doraemon. It was later adapted into an anime series in 1987, by Keiichi Hara and ran from 1987 to 1989. An anime film was also made in 1988. The series is about a girl named Mami Sakura used to be a normal junior high school student, but she happened to acquire supernatural powers. Using her powers and with the help of her childhood friend, Kazuo Takahata, she solves mysterious occurrences. When she senses someone needs help, she uses the "Teleportation Gun" (a heart-shaped brooch Takahata designs) and transports herself there. She then saves people in trouble with her psychic powers, such as telekinesis and telepathy. Does anyone in r/anime remember watching this show or have memories of this show ?  #8203; [ESper Mami - Anime](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1037) [ESper Mami -Pokemon Trainer Community](https://pokemon-trainer.com/threads/why-i-love-esper-mami-anime.3001/) [ESper Mami - TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EsperMami)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is Khorloogiin Choibalsan (leader of Mongolian People's Republic from 1939 to 1952) still honored in present day Mongolia ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 17:27:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Choibalsan was responsible for the deaths of of an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 Mongolians. He is often referred as the 'Mongolian Stalin'. Most of Mongolia's Buddhist monasteries and temples were destroyed, their treasures stolen, and their lamas shot or put to forced labour. Prominent Mongolians were also eliminated during the period of purges. His intense persecution of Mongolia's Buddhists brought about their near complete extinction. Yet in present day Mongolia, there is a statue of him in front of the National University in Ulaanbaatar and a city in Mongolia is also named after him. In 2017, Bank of Mongolia honored him with a coin. Is there a historical reason on why he is still honored in the present day democratic Mongolia, when other Stalinist leaders of Soviet satellite states are often condemned and their memorials removed, following the start of Destalinazation and at the end of Communist rule of those countries ?</TEXT>

Not only because she is supportive of the HK police, but she is such a terrible actress. https://nextshark.com/liu-yifei-disneys-pick-for-mulan-is-literally-the-worst-actress-in-china-according-to-china/ Seriously, Disney should get a better casting agent. Can #8217;t they just cast well known actresses like Gemma Chan, Katie Leung, Constance Wu, Michelle Ang or any other Chinese American and overseas Chinese actress who have played well acclaimed roles in other movies. And plus with the removal of key characters and musicals of the animation in the live action, Disney managed to alienate animated Mulan fans from the live action. With the complete change of the animated movie story, Disney is literally pandering to the mainland China audience. Whatever time the movie releases, it will end up being a box office bomb with negative reviews. And thanks to this HK Police supporting actress, you can expect the boycott campaign to remain strong enough to screw up the movie in the box office.</TEXT>

During World War II, some of them took part during the war. Aleksandr Min became the only Korean to receive the Hero of Soviet Union, during the war. During their life in Soviet Union, the government switched Korean language from being the medium of instruction to being taught merely as a second language in 1939, and from 1945 stopped it from being taught entirely; furthermore, the only publication in the Korean language was the Lenin Kichi. As a result, subsequent generations lost the use of the Korean language.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Authoritarian leaders take ridicule or joke seriously. For example: President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who is currently ruling the country since 2006, fell from a horse during a horse race in 2013. The race and the incident was recorded and as a result, he ordered TV stations to destroy the tape and prevented travellers from leaving the capital city of Ashgabat until their electronic devices were thoroughly searched for the video, to prevent people outside the country, from seeing it. It #8217;s because in Turkic culture, Horse is revered. Falling from a horse is considered as a humiliation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Chinese police are offering cash rewards for clues that could lead them to more than 100 people, as public demonstrations swept through cities in Inner Mongolia over the introduction of the Mandarin language in some school lessons. The police bureau of Tongliao, a city in the autonomous region bordering Mongolia and Russia, published photos and detailed descriptions of dozens of people they accused of  #8220;picking quarrels and causing troubles #8221; starting Wednesday. They said the people had committed the crimes between Aug. 30 and Sept. 1, the same period the unrest broke out. Horqin district police issued a separate notice calling for information on dozens of people. The search comes as government efforts to change the language of instruction of some subjects to Mandarin from Mongolian have prompted parents and students to boycott classes and take to the streets in protest. Similar measures have raised concerns about the dilution of cultures in Tibet, Xinjiang and Guangdong. Videos from human rights groups showed people chanting demands in Tongliao, which has a significant Mongolian population. The rollout of Mandarin-language classes kicked off Tuesday, beginning with language and literature classes for selected grades. It will later cover two other subjects -- morality and law, and history. President Xi Jinping has urged the overhaul of education in the three subjects where changes have taken place in Inner Mongolia in a bid to  #8220;safeguard ideological security. #8221; Local education authorities said in a statement on Monday that Mandarin would only be used to teach the three subjects that are part of the new rollout, and that the current bilingual system of instruction had not been changed. One man wanted by the police has been accused of  #8220;breaking police cordons #8221; on Aug. 31 in the city #8217;s Economic and Technology Development Zone, according to one of the notices. A separate notice issued by the Horqin district police via their official WeChat account sought information on 129 people for the same accusation of  #8220;picking quarrels and causing troubles. #8221; The notices all promised cash rewards of 1,000 yuan ($146) for anyone who provided reliable information on their identities. Tongliao police also urged the people to surrender themselves. China #8217;s Foreign Ministry on Thursday referred to reports of the protests as  #8220;political hype with ulterior motives. #8221;  #8220;The common language of a country is a symbol of sovereignty, #8221; ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing in Beijing.  #8220;Learning and using the common language of a country is both the duty and the right of our citizens. #8221;  #8212; With assistance by Colum Murphy, and Lucille Liu (Updates with China Foreign Ministry comment.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This combat has remained little-known, due to the involvement of the US National Security Agency  #8211; the existence of which was then top secret  #8211; in planning the mission; the MiGs had been intercepted as a result of intelligence provided by the NSA. This is a really amazing story considering the F9F Panther was outclassed by the MiG-15 in almost every way. Lt. Williams was awarded the Silver Star for this action, but in my opinion, he probably deserved a Medal of Honor. [Here](https://youtu.be/OR3Zspvukrc) is a video of Williams describing the Dogfight [Here](https://www.flightjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Four-Down.pdf?746277) is an article on the subject [Here](https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/43421) is Williams' Silver Star citation edit: I updated the video of him describing his dogfight.

    <TEXT>I saw the movie by downloading it from a movie website with a domain based in Ascension Island. Gosh, the movie #8217;s plot is incoherent. It #8217;s a terrible movie and one of the worst remakes that have made so far. In short: No singing, no character development, terrible plot, terrible dialogue, and very questionable cultural accuracy. The battle scenes and the fight scenes were poor. I mean, you got two of the best martial art movie stars on the cast, it could have been much much much better. And no realism... for kids? The script strays so far from the original Mulan story as to be almost unrecognizable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am not sure about that. I mean if a Mulan live action was made in the early 2000 #8217;s, she would have been a preferable candidate. But since it #8217;s made in 2010 #8217;s, Ming-Na has already reached in her 50s, meaning that she is too old to play a character (Mulan) who is in her 20s. Instead of Liu Yifei, I would have preferred actresses like Katie Leung, Gemma Chan, Constance Wu, Ellen Wong, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They should have followed the story of animation, rather literally changing it and making it unrecognisable for the the original 1998 animation. I miss the songs like: I #8217;ll make a man out of you, Reflection, Honor to us all and Girl worth fighting for. And instrumental songs: Mulan #8217;s decision, Blossoms, Gratitude, etc. And characters like: Shan Yu, Li Shang and Grandma Fa The live action is probably the worst remake of any Disney animation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The thing is that, the filmmakers of the live action literally distanced from the animation claiming that its due to some negativity perceived by some Chinese audiences. They marketed the live action as the actual story of Hua Mulan. I checked some reviews in Douban. Some of the reviews praised animation Mulan because in the movie she used determination, wit and courage to overcome obstacles (trying her best to disguise as men), achieve goals (using weights to reach the arrow on the wooden pole, using rocket at avalanche to stop the Huns and the Forbidden city battle ), despite her not being superior in strength and using wit to defeat the Huns. In live action, she is seen already having superior human strength, which therefore spoils the character development of Mulan in the movie. Most of the audiences (including Chinese and westerners) complained how characters like the witch played by Gong li don #8217;t have a serious character building. Therefore, the Mulan live action results in getting hated and is considered as the worst remake among Chinese and Western audiences .</TEXT>

Arab League changed their headquarters from Cairo to Tunis, and also expelled the country from organisations.

    <TEXT>I watched it for free by downloading it from a movie website, with a domain based in Ascension Island. The movie is a complete shit In short: No singing, no character development, terrible plot, terrible dialogue, and very questionable cultural accuracy. The movie #8217;s plot is soo incoherent, that I consider it as one of the worst Disney remakes that have made so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It would have been better if the live action had followed the exact script of the animation. If I could describe one word to this live action , its that it is very Souless. In the animated version, what made me like Mulan was that she was relatable, likeable, and the underdog. Mulan was super funny and I could relate to her being looked down. But most importantly, she didnt need luck or destiny to succeed. She shows that hard work can achieve goals, and did not whine or complain about it. Live action Mulan is born with a lot of Qi, which basically means she #8217;s the chosen one and has super powers. Live Action Mulan is more of a Mary Sue than fricking Rey from Star Wars. Way to go Disney. You butchered my most favourite Disney Princess !!!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Compared to German reunification, Korean reunification is not going to be easy path ahead. The Chinese would never allow it. NK is an important buffer state between China and a US friendly ally. Which is why they support NK even though Kim is nuts and supporting it financially is a pain in the butt. The South will have to subsidise the North big time and could possibly hold back the country for a long time. Getting the North educated and used to a democratic system will require a major change of attitudes and integration, something not possible within a short period of time. Though, in all honesty, it #8217;s at best a pipe dream. Unlikely to happen given the hold Kims have on the country. Yeah, Kims don't want to give up power, but nothing is eternal, see - Soviet Union. Slow, methodical approach would be preferred, to ease the clash of two worlds. High chance that if this will happen, it won't be within our lifetime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During the Korean War, China intervened on the side of North Korea because they don #8217;t want a major U.S ally bordering them. For them, a reunified Korea under South Korea would mean US having bases close to their border, ready to attack and support anti communist operations against them. They didn #8217;t intervene because they had some special affinity to Kim family. If Korea were to reunify, the best thing would be to adapt a sort of Swiss foreign policy, where the country would not take sides with major superpowers and maintain a form of neutrality and allowing close relations with every country. Then, international community could establish a form of financial and aid assistance to help develop the North Korean lands, which was decimated by the abysmal rule of the Kims. But, I doubt that US would ever want a reunified Korea under neutral foreign policy. Losing an ally like that is the last thing that the US ever wants in a highly sensitive geopolitical location.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Croatia was a rare European country to bring daily new Covid-19 cases to zero back in May. Now it has become an example of how summer tourism triggered a second wave of infections sweeping much of the continent. The fall from poster boy to hot spot came after the government, motivated by economic concerns, decided to open the coastal nation #8217;s borders early this summer and woo the foreign tourists who have been a pillar of its economy. After becoming infected, the tourists returned home, taking the virus with them. Croatia has now become a case study in how international travel is acting as an accelerant in the pandemic. Like in Croatia, travel to and within other traditional tourist destinations has pushed the number of infections up across Europe, according to health-care officials. In France, domestic vacationers were linked to a surge in cases in the country #8217;s south and along its Atlantic coast. Spain is experiencing record new infections concentrated in Madrid and tourism hot spots after a large influx of domestic and foreign visitors. While experts say that the resurgence of Covid-19 is driven by tourism-related travel to all vacation hot spots, the example of Croatia #8212;a small Balkan nation that appears to have had an outsize role in the spread of the virus #8212;shows how the European summer season unraveled some of the continent #8217;s earlier gains in the battle against the pandemic. After the lifting of lockdowns, Croatian local authorities allowed clubs and bars to reopen in popular destinations along the Adriatic Sea coast, attracting visitors ranging from German students on a budget to Jay-Z and Beyonc #233;, who spent time there this month. With its Mediterranean climate, 500 miles of Adriatic coast, picturesque ancient towns and affordable accommodations, Croatia is an all-year magnet for tourists from Western and Eastern Europe alike. The country hosted 21 million visitors in 2019, according to the Croatian Tourist Board. Maria Tejero, 34, said she traveled along the Croatian coast in August, passing through the island of Hvar and the towns of Split and Dubrovnik. She described crowded parties and bustling bars and restaurants where hardly anyone kept their distance or wore a mask, as recommended.  #8220;People would kindly tell us that we didn #8217;t need to comply with the [masking] rules in their bars or shops, #8221; said Ms. Tejero, who lives in the Italian city of Parma. European governments, meanwhile, eager to recoup the mounting economic and political costs of the spring #8217;s lockdowns, opened the European Union #8217;s internal borders in June, triggering a rush to the region #8217;s sunbelt. The result, according to health-care authorities in several countries: a rise in infections among mainly younger travelers that, after their return, began eating its way into their home countries #8212;the biggest setback in Europe #8217;s fight against the virus since the region #8217;s first wave peaked in March and April. Now fighting a coronavirus surge at home, Croatia #8217;s leaders said the decision to fully open the country ahead of the tourism season was a calculated risk necessary to prevent an economic meltdown.  #8220;People have to make a living, #8221; President Zoran Milanovic said in a recent broadcast interview.  #8220;Maybe it will not be too bad in the end #8221; he added, pointing to low mortality rates so far. By the end of July, Croatia had hosted 2.5 million visitors, down 40% to 50% from last year. By comparison, Spain lost 75% of visitors, Portugal 83% and Turkey 86%, according to official figures. Croatia #8217;s location in Central Europe had a big advantage amid much reduced air traffic, making it easy to reach by road from a large number of countries. At the peak of the season in August, cars and buses had to wait for up to 10 hours to cross the border into the country. Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic say a rebound in infections since mid-July is driven in part by people returning from visits to Croatia. Between Aug. 10 and Sept. 6, travelers returning from Croatia accounted for 12% of all new Covid-19 cases in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institut, Germany #8217;s leading epidemiology institute. The country also topped the list of destinations where German residents were infected in the same period. The Czech Republic is experiencing a record number of infections, which officials say was fueled by nearly 100,000 tourists returning from Croatia in August. In Austria, over a third of new cases came from returning vacationers earlier this month, more than a thousand of whom had been to Croatia. In Croatia itself, the number of new daily cases grew from an early March peak of 96 to the 369 recorded on Sept. 3, the country #8217;s daily record so far, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country has recorded a total of 14,279 infections so far for a total population of four million. The situation is notable for its similarity to an event that helped spark first Europe #8217;s first coronavirus wave last winter, when thousands of visitors from all around Europe contracted the virus in Ischgl, an Austrian ski resort, before bringing it back home, according to health-care experts. Like with Ischgl, most infections that occurred among tourists in Croatia are believed to have taken place in clubs, bars and at parties, according to Dr. Krunoslav Capak, the head of Croatia #8217;s coronavirus task force.  #8220;We had some tourists who arrived infected, but the vast majority got infected while being here, #8221; Dr. Capak said. Authorities issued guidelines to bars, restaurants and entertainment venues about social distancing and masking, Dr. Capak said, but these weren #8217;t mandatory. As a consequence, some venues operated without any restrictions. Mirjam Hagmann, a 26-year-old who recently graduated from Malmo University in Sweden, said that hardly anyone wore a mask during her stay on the island of Krk in July.  #8220;This was understandable: it was very hot and no one wanted to actually put their mask on, #8221; she said.  #8220;Everything was just like before the pandemic. #8221; This was a stark departure from the winter and spring, when Croatia managed to fend off the virus thanks to its well-prepared health-care system, decisive epidemiological response and high public vigilance, said Ivan Dikic, a biochemistry professor at Frankfurt #8217;s Goethe University who is from Croatia.  #8220;But vigilance dropped after the initial success, as people seemed eager to go out, travel and enjoy the summer after the severe lockdowns, #8221; Prof. Dikic said.  #8220;Still, it is incomprehensible why clubs were allowed to open. #8221; Antje Rothemund, a German woman who lives in France and regularly visits Croatia for yachting tours, said the feeling of freedom when she vacationed there again in August was liberating compared with the strict rules in her home city of Strasbourg.  #8220;I don #8217;t know whether it was naivet #233;, a calculated attempt to attract tourists or a bit of both, but there were no masks, no distancing, and tables in crowded restaurants and cafes were not set apart, #8221; said Ms. Rothemund, who is 57.  #8220;It was basically like any other year. #8221; Write to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever a collective decision on a geopolitical event is made, it should be done through the collective discussion and voting of UN General Assembly, not by some 5 permanent members in security council. Like you said, the UN Security Council need to be abolished because of the veto power made by unsc members are used in defending countries engaged in actual war crimes. Ex. If a resolution is made to investigate if Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, China and Russia will conveniently veto it, therefore preventing any legal justice against the Assad government for its crimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Compared to German reunification, Korean reunification is not going to be easy path ahead. The Chinese would never allow it. NK is an important buffer state between China and a US friendly ally. Which is why they support NK even though Kim is nuts and supporting it financially is a pain in the butt. Reunification was a significant economic challenge for Germany, but it wasn't some horrible humanitarian crisis. North Korea is by all accounts completely dysfunctional economically and any attempt to bring it up to a standard of living comparable to South Korea would be extremely difficult. A reunified Korea will cost billions upon billions of dollars and South Korea will foot most of that bill. For comparison, the reunification of Germany has been estimated to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of two trillion euros. East Germany had much better infrastructure and was logistically much easier to bring into unity with West Germany than North Korea will be for South Korea. Reunification could completely decimate the South #8217;s economy. Though, in all honesty, it #8217;s at best a pipe dream. Unlikely to happen given the hold Kims have on the country. Yeah, Kims don't want to give up power. High chance that if this will happen, it won't be within our lifetime.</TEXT>

His father was a hunter who taught him to be marksman in hunting. In 1940, he was called to serve in active duty. With the start of Operation Barbarossa, he was assigned to the Soviet Navy #8217;s Northern fleet where he served as a marine. He was made a sniper in his marine unit. In October 1944, during Petsamo-Kirkenes operation in Finnish occupied territory of Russian SFSR, he killed 25 enemy soldiers during the battle. However in the fall of 1944, during Soviet military operations in Nazi occupied Norway, he disappeared without trace and later declared dead.</TEXT>

The submarine sank and it took two months for the Soviet Navy to acknowledge that the sub went missing and then start a search mission for it.

    <TEXT>Yeah but still in the eyes of the Western world, Kino is popular. Most of the people tend to recognise Viktor Tsoi and associate him with Russian rock music. Even in South Korea there were attempts to popularise Russian rock. Samsung Music labels tried to sell Kino Albums, but wasn #8217;t able to hit high profits from it because of it being in foreign language and the genre of the music being old rock of the older generation. However the most popular song of Kino (Gruppa Krovi) have been sung by South Korean bands and individual musicians in both the Russian version and Korean translated version.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>His Medal of Honor citation:  gt;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty: Lieutenant Colonel (then Captain) Matt Urban, United States Army, distinguished himself by a series of bold, heroic actions, exemplified by singularly outstanding combat leadership, personal bravery, and tenacious devotion to duty, during the period 14 June to 3 September 1944 while assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. On 14 June, Captain Urban's company, attacking at Renouf, France, encountered heavy enemy small arms and tank fire. The enemy tanks were unmercifully raking his unit's positions and inflicting heavy casualties. Captain Urban, realizing that his company was in imminent danger of being decimated, armed himself with a bazooka. He worked his way with an ammo carrier through hedgerows, under a continuing barrage of fire, to a point near the tanks. He brazenly exposed himself to the enemy fire and, firing the bazooka, destroyed both tanks. Responding to Captain Urban's action, his company moved forward and routed the enemy. Later that same day, still in the attack near Orglandes, Captain Urban was wounded in the leg by direct fire from a 37mm tank-gun. He refused evacuation and continued to lead his company until they moved into defensive positions for the night. At 0500 hours the next day, Captain Urban, though badly wounded, directed his company in another attack. One hour later he was again wounded. Suffering from two wounds, one serious, he was evacuated to England.  gt;  gt;In mid-July, while recovering from his wounds, he learned of his unit's severe losses in the hedgerows of Normandy. Realizing his unit's need for battle-tested leaders, he voluntarily left the hospital and hitchhiked his way back to his unit near St. Lo, France. Arriving at the 2d Battalion Command Post at 1130 hours, 25 July, he found that his unit had jumped-off at 1100 hours in the first attack of "Operation Cobra". Still limping from his leg wound, Captain Urban made his way forward to retake command of his company. He found his company held up by strong enemy opposition. Two supporting tanks had been destroyed and another, intact but with no tank commander or gunner, was not moving. He located a lieutenant in charge of the support tanks and directed a plan of attack to eliminate the enemy strong-point. The lieutenant and a sergeant were immediately killed by the heavy enemy fire when they tried to mount the tank. Captain Urban, though physically hampered by his leg wound and knowing quick action had to be taken, dashed through the scathing fire and mounted the tank. With enemy bullets ricocheting from the tank, Captain Urban ordered the tank forward and, completely exposed to the enemy fire, manned the machine gun and placed devastating fire on the enemy. His action, in the face of enemy fire, galvanized the battalion into action and they attacked and destroyed the enemy position. On 2 August, Captain Urban was wounded in the chest by shell fragments and, disregarding the recommendation of the Battalion Surgeon, again refused evacuation. On 6 August, Captain Urban became the commander of the 2d Battalion. On 15 August, he was again wounded but remained with his unit.  gt;  gt;On 3 September, the 2d Battalion was given the mission of establishing a crossing-point on the Meuse River near Heer, Belgium. The enemy planned to stop the advance of the allied Army by concentrating heavy forces at the Meuse. The 2d Battalion, attacking toward the crossing-point, encountered fierce enemy artillery, small arms and mortar fire which stopped the attack. Captain Urban quickly moved from his command post to the lead position of the battalion. Reorganizing the attacking elements, he personally led a charge toward the enemy's strong-point. As the charge moved across the open terrain, Captain Urban was seriously wounded in the neck. Although unable to talk above a whisper from the paralyzing neck wound, and in danger of losing his life, he refused to be evacuated until the enemy was routed and his battalion had secured the crossing-point on the Meuse River. Captain Urban's personal leadership, limitless bravery, and repeated extraordinary exposure to enemy fire served as an inspiration to his entire battalion. His valorous and intrepid actions reflect the utmost credit on him and uphold the noble traditions of the United States Army. Other than his Medal of Honor, his other awards include: * 2 Silver Stars * Legion of Merit * 3 Bronze Stars with Valor device * 7 Purple Hearts * Army Presidential Unit Citation * French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt star * French Croix de Guerre with Palm (unit citation)</TEXT>
