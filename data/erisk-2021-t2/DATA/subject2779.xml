    <TEXT>I got this watch as a reward for myself last year for hitting career milestone. This started a collection thats now five watches deep, and no sign of escape. The rotation finally made it back to this watch. Theres just something about the dial and the colours under warm light, which reminded me why i got this watch in the first place. edit: it #8217;s really hard to hit five hundred characters. im wondering if spaces count towards this number.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so the first watch cured the itch for about 3 months. wanted something dressier. so i got this baby for my birthday last year. looks like low light doesn #8217;t really do the watch and dial justice, so i took another photo. really like the way warm light plays on the champagne dial. the blue gmt hour hand gives a nice contrast to the champagne and steel colours.</TEXT>
