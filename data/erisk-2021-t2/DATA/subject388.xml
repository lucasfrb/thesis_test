    <TITLE>What helped me get no kip muscle-up</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-16 19:19:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I seemed to plateau at muscle-up training for a year or so, never getting past the transition phase no matter what. But now I managed to nail it in a few months time when I realized that I wasn't paying attention to the actual limitations of my current strength and coordination. Edit: currently I am only able to do ring muscle-up, still working on bar version. What helped me was this progression: 1. body rows - either with rings or low bar, progressing to position where feet are elevated to same height as hands. Goal is to be able to do something like 15x5 clean and slow controlled repetitions, paying attention to scapula and really activating those musclegroups behind shoulders 2. bar hang - just practicing basic hanging from bar for time, aiming for 1 minute x 5 leaning from hand to hand, sometimes hanging with loose shoulders, sometimes activating them and pulling your body up while keeping arms straight 3. static top pull up position hang - just spending time at the upmost position of pull up, aiming for 1 minute x 5 to really make those joints and muscles strong and durable 4. static dip hold at bottom - just spending time in the lowest possible position of ring dip, at the same time strengthening and making your shoulder joints flexible at that critical position. When you get stronger, you can start lowering the elbows down towards the ground and pushing them back up to mimic the transition movement as a negative. Finally you will be able to go to the pull-up top position and come back to this position without any kipping or speed. If you finally manage to do these, you should be able to do the muscle up with relative ease. Hope these tips will help you! And remember, don't train through pain. You'll only get stronger in rest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I should edit the original message and clarify that I am talking about ring muscle up, still some way to go for a proper bar version. They are definitely different ball game, but I think the general progression should be about same. The biggest difference being the amount of effort required to work on the negative transition phase with bar. I am going to try some band assisted bar muscle ups as well to get used to the right range of motion and program nervous system right. However even on rings it is not that much about "throwing the shoulders" because that would be skipping the transition phase with momentum instead of controlled power. The aim is to be able to go through the transition with slow speed, where you can stop and continue the movement at any point, even in the middle of transition. I'd presume if you can get high pull up on bar, but struggle getting on top of it, the best way to continue is start doing really slow negatives from the top, and really putting the effort to control the transition phase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. The difference being that with rings there is nothing to block your positioning during the transition phase, which allows you to move more economically in comparison to bar, which forces you to actually go around the physical obstacle which you can't move around. Also rings allow you to turn and change your hands position in comparison to bar which forces you to keep the grip/positioning pretty static. Of course there's some extra effort required on rings because they are inherently unstable, but at least in my experience, the possibility to go "through" more than compensates for the lack of stability.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I respect and salute you for your commitment to freedom of art, I have found the NC to be quite good compromise between total freedom and complete control. It has given me control to waive the NC option for those projects that are serious enough to contact me and ask for permission after describing what they are doing and not make me wonder if there are some projects that are using my music in a way I wouldn't really like. For example if their agenda / values do not match with ones I'd like to uphold. For me it's more about the possibility to choose what projects to support and what not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my opinion the car analogy doesn't really describe the situation that well. If say a ku-klux-klan or neo-nazi group would do something horrendous while driving a Ford, nobody in their right mind would think that Ford company had anything to do with the situation. However, if they would publish a video representing views/ideals I do not share and would use my music and mention my name in the credits, almost anyone could think that I am actually part of their agenda. Of course the NC part doesn't necessarily remove this possibility, but at least it gives me better possibility to realize where my music could be going.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They might give you better understanding of the position, however they definitely won't take away the fact that unsupported hold is a different ballgame. In my opinion the only thing that matters in planche progression is the amount of lean. You can't "push" yourself up into a tuck hold. You have to lean into it. If you are not leaning far enough, you won't get up. When you lean far enough, it is the only possibility for you to move into, because when you are leaning far enough, you don't have any weight on the toes, and hence you can basically just "pick them up" from the floor instead of pushing. However, the point where you are leaning far enough will put immense pressure on your abs, scapula, shoulders etc. Hence it is the most difficult thing to do when you are first trying it, because the mental feeling is that "this is the farthest point I can lean" while it actually isn't. For me the biggest obstacle was to get rid of this mentality and just lean more. That was the only way to progress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is very probable, because one element of tuck work is the balance part. You are actually balancing all the time, because otherwise you would be flat on your face :) So if you are not leaning far enough, there's no balancing needed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Would be cool. Companies could have "bulletin boards", in the morning you first have to check your "inbox" etc. Also would make relationships more interesting / flavoured for obvious reasons. Poetry slams could be accurately called pissing competitions. Also you would never have to queue to bathrooms in popular bars. In school, teachers could send messages to parents via various means, kids would carry around wet papers or towels with important notices. I don't know if I would keep a diary, but you shouldn't let it dry too much. Also CV would be more graphic. Any thoughts?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2014-12-18 20:23:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Human Flag progression / How to do human flag / Human flag tutorial ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://imgur.com/PW8aW8P - concept image made with my mad paint skillz I have found one of the best ways to train human flag to be scaling the difficulty of the actual position by using a long pull up bar, so that you can grab the vertical pole with the lower arm and the pull up bar with the upper arm. If you move the upper hand away from the pole, the movement becomes easier, because the difference between the hand positions causes your body to be in an lower angle towards the ground when you are doing the flag position. In the easier position you won't be horizontal of course, hence the lower strain, but bit by bit you can start moving the upper hand towards the pole and scale the difficulty just right so that you can do reasonable static hold time in the final position. It is easy to track your progression by marking the position you can still do the move. In the end you can finally put the hand next to the pole, and when you can do it right in that position, it is much more easy to start practicing the final move by grapping the pole with the upper arm as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the general answer to all these bent or straight arms questions is: bent arm strength doesn't carry over to straight arm strength. Is it acceptable? Of course, you can do whatever you like and will probably gain bent arm strength that way, but if your goal is to gain straight arm strength, you have to practice with straight arms. Simple as that. If the reason is that you can't yet perform the tuck front lever with straight arms, you have to continue doing the previous steps to allow you to do that. Bent arm tuck front lever most definitely won't help with that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd recommend following tutorials based on what you are interested in programming. For example nowadays it is very possible for quite beginner coder to program simple games because there are so robust graphics libraries available that wrap the "hard code" inside their functions. Once you have gotten your head around the very basic concepts of the language you are learning, just try to follow and read some tutorial examples that go through step by step with available source code how to program for example a very simple game, and try to change some parts of the code to see what the effect is. Google is your friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I dabbled around with Java AWT graphics library like 10 years ago and did some simple games with it. Own version of Minesweeper and some animated small projects. I found it to be a bit cumbersome, because you have to write so many lines of code to get the basic mechanics up and running. Java might not be the best programming language for this kind of work. However, the general concept is not that complicated once you get your head around it. Here are my few cents on the subject: 1. Think of game graphics to consist of two different levels. The one that is being drawn to the screen and the one that only resides in the current memory. This is called buffering 2. In java, you use the Graphics objects as a means to draw something to the screen or to Image objects. Java gives you the screen graphics object as a parameter in paint method. 3. To prevent screen from flickering, you want to make sure that when you draw something via graphics, you have already drawn it completely in the memory 4. Usually this is done by creating an Image object that is "copy" of the screen that resides in memory. You get another graphics object from this image and use that graphics object to draw all your graphics/sprites/pngs etc into right coordinates. You can clear the Image in the beginning of a paint loop by for example filling it with black first (fillRect()) 5. When the image has been drawn complete, you finally call the actual screen graphics object to draw the Image you have built hidden from the player in the memory. So basically usually my games were such that the object that represented the game window had paint method that would do all the actual drawing with the memory Image objects graphic, and only in the very end all the actual screen graphics object drawImage. There would be some kind of main loop thread that would call repaint() on each loop. The main game thread would update the moving object coordinates and in paint method they would draw themselves at the right coordinates via Image object graphics and then the final call to g.drawImage() would use always 0,0 coordinates to draw the buffered Image that contained the actual graphics of the game at that point of time. Also you don't necessarily have to use sprites, I usually just created game objects that would have int value for the right image index and draw the right png from a folder where they had numbers to represent the frame of the animation. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best way to scale PC based home studio for better VST processing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-12-19 15:45:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm trying to find out what would be best way to scale my currently one PC home studio to allow more VST processing. I presume the most cost effective and practical solution would be to get another PC that I would link with my main one and let it drive some VST instruments. However, what are the technical requirements for the slave PC? Is it enough that I have sound card that has SPDIF connections and basic operating system and the VST instrument stand alone installation so that I can send signal to it via SPDIF and get audio signal back via SPDIF? Has anyone done this kind of scaling with multiple PCs in connection with each other? I'd love to hear some thoughts / links to reasonable resources regarding this kind of operation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks, I am using Cubase and I was thinking of going for this VST system link type of solution. So in this case I'd only need an audio interface that supports SPDIF in the slave? I was thinking of building a Mini ITX solution with 32G memory and basically just audio itnerface, nothing extra. I'd only install windows and VST link and the libraries I need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is related to cavities in head that contain air. As you dive, you enter high pressure environment (every 10 meters of water increases pressure by one "atmosphere", so if you dive to 30 meters, it would be same as if you'd have four times the pressure that you have standing on dry ground. We have gotten so used to normal air pressure that it is hard to realize that there is such thing, but believe me, the pressure caused by the atmosphere - the air around us and on top of us is pretty harsh). As the pressure increases outside our bodies it will cause various effects inside our bodies because the cavities that contain air start to get pressurized and if there is no way for the air to move/balance the pressure difference, it will start to cause stretching and bulging of tissues. You can test this by taking a bag of air, blow it full and then push it under water holding it closed tight. As you push it deeper into water, it starts to get smaller as the increasing pressure around the bag forces the air trapped inside into smaller compartment. Similar thing is happening inside our bodies if we can't find a way to even out the pressure differences. Usually this is done by holding the nose closed and "blowing", this creates pressure inside our body that usually balances the differences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends totally on what your goal is. Applets have really tight security constraints so it would basically mean that it would be simple single player experience. I wouldn't code a game with either AWT nor Swing. They are both pretty cumbersome and not aimed for game development at all. I programmed a few simple Java games with AWT ten years ago and it wasn't exactly fun. If I'd program some 2d game with Java, I'd look for some kind of 2d graphics library that is meant for game development. With fast googling for example something like http://slick.ninjacave.com/ that offers better methods and functions for things you will be needing. Based on your question "Should make a class for each object" I presume you don't have too much experience yet with programming? Not to discourage you but making a Space War 2d game might be a bit more complicated task than it seems like in the beginning. However, motivation is the best medicine for learning so definitely go ahead and start working on it! Answer to the question is yes, you will be making quite a few classes and interfaces as well. I'd recommend you to google for "simple 2d java game tutorial" or similar and look for example projects that go through a simple game from start to end. That way you will learn much faster what is required. http://www.cokeandcode.com/info/tut2d.html for example. Good luck!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your question is a bit tricky to answer without giving an example that hopefully clarifies "the point" of using Interfaces. The Interface doesn't exactly implement anything. It just states what is "expected" of an implementing class - namely the methods and their signatures. It is sort of an blueprint or "rule" for any class that wants to actually implement it. It also leaves the responsibility and freedom to the class itself to decide HOW exactly it is going to go about the implementation and inner workings of the methods. But as you can refer to objects by their class name or interface implementations, you can "hide" the details in some situations regarding what the object is you are actually handling. For example you might have a method that accepts Comparable as it's parameter: public boolean compareSomething(Comparable a, Comparable b) {...} Now if you have for example five different classes that all implement Comparable interface, you could give instance of those classes to this method as a or b and the method would work. So in a way we hide the information regarding what the actual Class of a or b is at the point this method is called, all we care about is that they somehow implement the compare method and we don't care how they do it. Now we come to your question. If you had a class that implements the comparable method, but it wouldn't implement the interface, you wouldn't be able to send it as a parameter to this method. So the implementation of the Interface is important because it states that this class has implemented the required method and so it can be seen as a Comparable type object. Only way to circumvent this would be to change the parameter types to Object a, Object b and then do manual check inside the method via reflect utils - does this instance actually have a method called comparable and if not throw exception. It would be quite clumsy code.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's the trouble with front end stacks... They have always been this way throughout the whole history of the internet and nobody knows where they will head in the next few years. Best guesses are best guesses. I've been a professional programmer for a bit over 10 years and while I've never specialized in front end programming, I've been so close to front end that I've had to learn some javascript / scss and have some experience on the subject. From my point of view it is not that much about what is the exact framework you are competent with at timepoint X. It is more of how broad your understanding is regarding the current situation and possibilities and also skill to "catch up fast" if your next project is done with angular and you haven't used it before. I have dabbled around with 6-7 different javascript libraries in these years and almost none of them were known to me before I had to do something with them. So I'd say that any choice you make will probably be ok. Angular at least seems to be getting more popularity, but hard to tell how it will go. Also it would be good to understand for example jQuery and more "non-framework" -like solutions so that you know how to code manually things that angular does "like magic". Because sometimes you will be running into projects that require something so custom that there isn't a framework that could offer all that detail without some hacking. And if all you have is angular and what it offers, you won't make it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are designing your own program and thinking should I make Interface for this function, it depends on a lot of variables. The main thing is sort of conceptual - is the function of the method itself tied to the role of the class itself, or is the role of the method more generic and maybe even shared between many classes? If it is clearly single class related, keep in the class, but if you later find out that actually it is shared, move it outside the class and create an interface for it. I'd go with classes first and then when you find out you would be duplicating code or would have trouble handling different class types in a single parameter, wrap them in a interface. I'd say that all these kinds of decisions should be based on what is the best way to keep the code simple, clean and readable. If you are duplicating code and doing lots of weird if else structures, there might be a better way to do the thing you are doing and interface might offer solution.</TEXT>
