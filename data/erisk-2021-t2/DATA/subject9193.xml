    <TITLE>Is it possible to lose 40kg in 12 weeks?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-07 22:39:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've just started keto and IF (16:8) Current weight 115kg Target weight 75kg I have an event coming up in 12 weeks time, and would love to be 75kg by then. I also have an outfit picked out to wear. What is everyone's experience? Do you think it's possible to lose that much? A few friends are saying it's impossible to lose that much weight in 12 weeks. Perhaps they're right, but they've not tried keto. Also I'm of the opinion that aiming higher will help me stick to it. What do you guys think? What's your experiences? Any advice is welcomed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, I mean I'm not going to push it or do anything stupid. But a higher goal for me means I will stick to it rather than drop it after a week</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's just a target and target date for me to aim for. If I get there I get there. If I just lose some weight before that date but don't get to the target it's ok, I won't be disappointed as any weight lost is worth it. I can reassess as I get there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! You've been helpful!! I've been calorie counting for a while, but have just been maintaining so anything lost is worthwhile. I'll see what happens whilst doing keto</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand, for me higher goals and targets work. I'm bad for snacking and thinking it'll be ok I'll behave tomorrow. In this case I can't do that because I have a goal. I won't do anything unhealthy, as in the long term that will be more damaging to my health and could cause rebound weight gain! I mean I'll be happy if I hit 100kg by that date, I know it's not a race. I just have to focus on being relentless and getting out of bad habits. Thanks, I also have a backup outfit planned so either will look good!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well my goal is higher because it stops me from cheating. I know myself well. If my goal was 15kg in 3 months I would be "oh I'll just have this pizza, I'll be fine" whereas a higher goal means I refuse all unhealthy snacks available at work. I'm not gonna be disappointed if I don't achieve 40kg, a loss is a loss, but I need something high to aim for</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love reptiles, but I have an extreme phobia of spiders... so it might be a good idea to put what creature is appearing in your videos as a kinda trigger warning. I watch the set up of the tank and it was very relaxing to watch and the finished tank was beautiful. I think you seemed very knowledgeable on the topic. As a side note (hopefully you don't think I'm creepy) but your voice is your selling point, very relaxing and soothing... please read audiobooks too  #128514;</TEXT>

Perhaps include some information about the ingredients or a little voice over or different music. I know cooking videos should be relaxing but I felt something more dynamic would be better.

Another comment, (maybe you did this) but perhaps show the end result first. And as this is "spicy" (for some people) give them hints on how to modify spice levels. Also Paneer is a tricky ingredient to get in some countries (here especially) perhaps include alternatives for difficult ingredients</TEXT>

My only criticism would be to say speak a little slower (but I am watching on a crowded train) Maybe you know but the marble in Ramune is to keep the drink carbonated.

    <TEXT>I think it's better just to be yourself to not risk burnout. And to just enjoy what you're doing. I try to speak slowly and clearly so people who may not speak English can understand what I'm saying. In fact the best compliment I've got is that people have used my video for listening practice. I would turn off a lot of people for some of the subtle tricks you listed. There's an audience out there for everyone. People who watch both the high and low energy people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me I would like closer shots of the plant. I felt the volume was a little low so I struggled to hear, but you definitely know a lot about plants. Not necessarily feedback, but as a pet owner we also have to take into consideration if plants are toxic for animals. Maybe you can include that next time?</TEXT>
