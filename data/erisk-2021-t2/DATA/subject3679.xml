    <TEXT>Language isn #8217;t the barrier it used to be. There #8217;s a lot of mutual intelligibility between language families and these connections can create a sense of unity if kindled right.

    <TEXT>All languages in Europe should be coequal. We should focus on improving the direct translating system in the parliament and improve language learning in schools across the union. I propose that people learn English of course, then either German or French and also 1 language of a State that your state borders. So for example, I #8217;m from Denmark, so I would learn English, then I #8217;d choose German because that #8217;s right to the south and then I #8217;d choose Swedish, again because of proximity. But if you #8217;re for example polish you might learn English, then French and then Czech.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you ask me we have got to be opportunistic in our approach. We have been way too direct in how we are proceeding and I think it has made ordinary people a little uncomfortable, with the idea of more EU. We have got to wait for the right moments to take these steps. Step 1): improve Union democracy. To increase faith and loyalty to the idea of european unity, we have got to create a representative system that people know they can trust. This means, remove the state governments from power and let the people choose our leaders. Tackle corruption and pass transparency laws to end lobbyism and profiteering. And create common news media that is easily accessible to all EU citizens, to inform citizens about the decisions that occur at the union level. Step 2): Begin further integration in key areas. Begin to integrate in the areas where we have the stronger argument, like for example defense. It makes total sense to have common security, when our economies are so interdependent that an attack on one, would disrupt trade in the rest. Also no one can seriously argue that an EU country should fear an invasion from another. Another area is if not fiscal union, then at least fiscal agreements. This is of course to fix the fatal flaw of the euro, but idk if improved democracy would be enough to convince the North/west to help the South/East, that #8217;s something we can work on. Of course there are many steps, but I think that #8217;s a good starting point and these should be worked on for the next 10-20 years, before we can move on to the next steps. Step 3, would probably be a constitution or a collective foreign policy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Denmark* I #8217;m Danish and yeah I agree, but there are legitimate concerns over southern deficit spending and debt accumulation. Denmark isn #8217;t a eurozone member (I wish it was), but the euro zone needs a fiscal union with collective debt responsibility and borrowing, that way us northerners can stop worrying about a second euro crisis and the austerity measures can be stopped. However that will mean that the amount of money each country can borrow will be decided by the EU, along with other things that might make some people unhappy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is America that is responsible for our defense, but it doesn #8217;t have to be like that, we could just as well have a European collective defense and still outspend Russia. Bro the US is a declining empire and they are deficit spending on another level. They have a national debt of 27 trillion and they are paying back their debt by taking new loans, their debt is only gonna increase until the world economy eventually loses trust that they can pay it back. they do it to maintain a military presence around the world, but inevitably a president will come along and cut America #8217;s military spending and reinvest in their own infrastructure and population. We have to be ready to defend ourselves for when that happens, better now than then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The national debt of America went from 8 trillion in 2008 to 20 trillion in 2016. And the US will likely make it 30 trillion soon in an attempt to stimulate the economy. They are also printing a lot of money, but to the surprise of economists it hasn #8217;t devalued the dollar, but if they continue it eventually will. The American war economy is not something that is sustainable and they will eventually have to stop. it #8217;s just inevitable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you #8217;re too idealistic. To realistically achieve the goal of an EF, we need to be opportunistic and use a certain amount of propaganda/ subtle messaging to create enemies in the eyes of the public. Those enemies would of course be all the large global players, most importantly Russia. The message needs to be one of  #8220;us vs them #8221; and if we don #8217;t unite them they will divide and conquer us. Become vassal states to foreign powers. The System will be built partially on fear, but the hope is that future generations will have genuine loyalty to the European identity and then preserve the system, even if the geopolitical situation changes. I don #8217;t think we should split up the states, mostly because it #8217;s not popular and because we should be a federation of nations, of distinct national identities that come together for common benefit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most people see cultural differences, but we federalists see the similarities. To me, the cultural map of Europe is more of a gradient pattern than hard lines. The thing is we need to unite to protect our common interests. We aren #8217;t the great powers we used to be and we are becoming increasingly irrelevant on the international scene. We can use a federal Europe reestablish ourselves as a force not to be trifled with. Things like defense, monetary and fiscal policy should therefore be handled by the federal government, but otherwise we should leave as much as possible to the individual states</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I come from a small country, so I wanted to increase the international influence of my country by joining together with others and I started by supporting pan-Scandinavia. But it changed to pan-Europe because i view Austria and by extension Germany as my second home, due to all the skiing vacations I #8217;ve had there and I speak the language. But if it was a pan-Germanic Union, that would be too dominated by Germany and I was also very interested in Greco-Roman culture so it made sense to do a Europe-wide Union.</TEXT>
