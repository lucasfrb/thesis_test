    <TEXT>I was just being a tit. Your level is probably about right. Was tryna run round to his back legs on solo which didn't work and then thought I'd have enough time or health to survive his AOE attack. I done this boss a few times co-op which helped me level up but could manage is solo or on my own co-op. :/</TEXT>

I've played a lot better in IB, not rushing as much, and I think it will transfer across to Crucible when I go back to playing it. Little tired of PvP at the moment now I've hit level 5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Love the site. I think its brilliant and I appreciate the work you've done.for the community. One issue I have however is after checking an items details and clicking to close the window, it puts me to the top of your list. I'm pretty sure it didn't do that before. Its not broken, just not efficient for me when I'm clicking trying to find the names of the gear to see if I have it. Keep up the good work.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish we could pop a weapon, say for example a leveled raid weapon at this desk and retrieve copies of it at a later date, similar to the exotics from the kiosk. Make the rule that only max leveled weapons or something will be redeemable from there. Would be good for vault space as it wouldn't matter if we delete raid weapons and they would all have the same stats so it should be achievable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They say this is a P2P model, but is it really? I was taught that a P2P model is pretty much going to be a full mesh with each client communicating with every other client, but Destiny (as with pretty much every other multiplayer game) has a server client model, with the server running on the same machine as the client. This is why someone gets host advantage. Isn't this the infrastructure that Destiny uses? Just seeing your perspective on it as I know if I tried to claim console gaming wasn't P2P like most people think it would be shot down in flames lol. Maybe I am wrong. As I said, just wondered what your perspective was.</TEXT>

Also I have only had 2 slight disagreements with my SO in the time we've been together, I don't think 2 fights a week sounds normal. You need to explain that in this current state, him not making the effort to talk to you isn't going to work for you as a couple as it's clearly stressing you out. That isn't what a relationship is suppose to be about, they're suppose to make you happy and put you first. That's my opinion anyway. The idea of pestering you for "nudes" though. That's not on. Unless you're in a good relationship, that just sounds as though they're using you, I could be wrong, I don't know the dynamic of your relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. Having issues with a primary and a trusted domain Trust breakdown. Recreated the trust everyway I can think imaginable. Turned off SID filter which I now don't have access to do anymore. One domain cannot authenticate to the other domain but allows incoming connections. Rebuilding the trust does nothing even though it validates. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</TEXT>

I played the beta for SoT and despite my friends telling me there would be more and aggressive forum folk shooting down people that claimed the beta was most of the content, I knew this would be shallow in content, but despite that. SoT is a lot of fun to play with three other friends. The experience you can get here isn't really found anywhere else, and that to me is worth the price of entry.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DFS Server Target at User Level</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-21 12:32:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm working at a three site school trust. They have a replicated DC at each site and DFS is configured to share network installed software etc. They didn't want everyone as a replicated user due to the storage that would be required so only senior management and a few other have replicated files per site. When none replicated users visit another site (this is rare) and login, they want to view their documents but the vFS creates a new desktop, downloads etc on the 'local' domain so they cannot access their files. Is it possible to apply a preferred DFS server to certain OUs on the DC, or another work around. Many thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that is how it is configured. All three sites are configured with the same name space and it will point to the user folder on the local server. None of these folders or users are replicated, I think I may have confused things when I mentioned replication. I was just hoping there was a way that you could prioritise a particular server on a name share for a set of users.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;hen in AD where your users are stored, create an OU for each facility. Put the users of said facility in that OU. Then create a drive mapping GPO for say H: drive \(home\). Create 3 different item level targets for that drive, using the facility OU that the users are in to map that facilities drive share. Then no matter which PC that user logs into their H: drive would always be mapped to their home facility. Yeah, I am unsure why there is a shared user folder, although it gives you a small amount of redundancy in that where ever you login, you will have a 'home' even if it doesn't have your files. They all have local shares for the user folder for each facility so I think I will just give them a mapped drive they can access that contains their actual files when ever they are off site. Thank you very much for your assistance.</TEXT>
