    <TEXT>Hi guys, just bought a Vita recently. A rather weird/stupid question, I have a physical game card inserted in the vita, but after playing a digitally downloaded game for a few hours, the vita can't read the physical game card. I have to remove and reinsert the card for the vita to read it. Is this supposed to be normal?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Looking to pick up a new game, is D4: NP good? Can't seem to find alot of reviews or recommendations for this game. Besides that, should i get this, Gravity Rush, or Senran Kagura Shinovi VS? I'm aware that they're miles apart in terms of genre and gameplay, but I just can't make up my mind. Looking for something that will last quite a while, so which of this 3 would be best? Thanks guys!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any advice on learning Japanese by myself?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-03 15:52:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've recently finished a Japanese course as a uni elective, and I can't continue to the next level because I've ran out of electives :( Anyway, any advice on how I can continue studying the language by myself? I'm not sure what level of Japanese I'm at, as I didn't take the JLPT assessment. I'll just assume I'm slightly above beginner/elementary. I don't know if I should get a textbook or what online resource that actually works. I can't afford to attend a language centre due to time constraints, but I'm super interested in continuing the language. Any advice? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually I've learned Japanese for a year and a half. I should probably clarify how the course structure is laid out. There are two semesters once a year, and during semester 1 last year I did Japanese  #65297;A, which was the introductory course to Japanese. Japanese  #65297;B was in semester 2 last year, and I stopped at Japanese 2A, which was last semester this year. #12288;Japanese 2B would be this semester but I've stopped taking it. I've actually asked my lecturer what level of Japanese are we supposed to be at, and she said something along the lines of elementary students.</TEXT>

A few days back I went to this smaller hobby store called Shin Tokyo, ordered and bought a 32GB memory card from them. https://www.facebook.com/SHINTOKYOADELAIDE Maybe look out for stores like these, they can help you place orders and import it over here as well, if you don't like buying online.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a beautiful game in terms of art. Different swords kind of have different movesets and attack patterns/speed, and they each have a distinct special move. The combat is quite fun, its quite fluid and fast paced. The boss fights are great too, and there are survival-esque dungeons that allow replayability etc. A few gripes I have though is the constant backtracking you have to do. The whole game is structured like running from point A to point B through the same environment to fight a boss, and on the way there there's multiple branching paths. After that, you have to backtrack the way you came from to do something else. The game has a fast travel system that you can access, but it isn't constantly available to you...so most of the time you spend not fighting is spent running back and forth. Exploration does get quite tiresome at times. I wasn't really fond of the music either, it gets really droning when you're just running through the environment. But really, everything else is pretty damn good, the combat, story, and the art makes up for a lot of it. Also the food and cooking system in this game is bloody amazing. It just looks gorgeous.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel sad and helpless. Not angry or anything, but just...disappointment, despair, and anguish. I'm currently studying in Australia, but I'm really eager and looking forward to graduating and coming back to Malaysia. My family wants me to get a job/PR here so that I can stay over here, but I have this gut feeling that coming back home is the right thing to do. Jumping ship feels wrong, at least to me... I'll try my best to put what I'm thinking into words, I'm not too good at that lmao. Personally, I'm mostly concerned on the direction that these issues are heading, and how these issues will be solved. These problems are all linked to each other, and it all began with the corruption scandal. I mean...if we can't fix the corruption issue, we should make the best out of the worst situation right? Its still all up to our own mentality in the end I guess. We can either focus all our attention and efforts to a negative issue that currently can't be solved, or we can focus on looking for alternatives and fixing little issues in our life that helps build relationships/bridges with other people/communities that promotes unity etc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You raise a valid point, but I don't think the only way to make a change is by joining politics. I might be naive, but like I said, if we can't change the government right now, then we probably shouldn't be focusing on changing what can't be changed. Change can happen in different ways. It always puzzles me why people say that only politicians can change stuff. Sure, they can work to solve national issues, but what about changes on a smaller scale? We should at least try to change our mindset, and the people around us instead of constantly avoiding the issue (Sept 16, corruption etc). Shouldn't we as Malaysians be helping out to facilitate change on that level? Recently I've been thinking of going back to set up a business or a social enterprise to help out the needy/raise awareness about various issues etc. Entrepreneurs are on the rise in Malaysia. If I can even contribute a little bit to facilitate change between the people, then I will. Maybe I'm just stupid and naive, but if I can even do something to make a difference in other people's lives, then I would very much rather do that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My family moved into this new neighbourhood a few years back. It's a gated community, and everyone there were pretty welcoming. Nice people in general, except this one neighbour that was on the left side of our house. This neighbour was a middle aged woman that lived with her daughter, who was around 19 or so iirc. I think she was divorced. When we first moved in, she seemed like a nice person, and she would occasionally interact with us and stuff. But after a few months, and I'm talking like within the first half year that we moved in, she became really nasty. I don't know what set her off, but I honestly doubt my parents did anything to instigate her, since we're a very quiet family. Now, the houses are connected by a wall, and its a pretty short wall too, short enough for someone to throw something over it and hit stuff on the other side. One day we woke up to a shattered kitchen window, and like rocks all around the garden and porch. We confronted her and she started accusing me that I threw rocks at her house first, but I seriously didn't do anything. She freaked out really badly, and the whole neighbourhood could hear her screaming her head off, and just ranting on and on about how we're a terrible family. Shortly after that, she poisoned all our fish. We had this small water feature installed at our side of the wall, and one day my dad woke up to a mini bubble bath in the garden, and all the fish dead in it. She probably threw soap or detergent into it, and since the water runs actively, it foamed and...yeah. It was pretty bad. After a few more screaming confrontations we called the cops (under the advice of other neighbours). Her daughter was actually quite nice, and would apologize to us and iirc, explain that her mother had some mental issues to deal with. No idea whether it was true or not. It calmed down for a few months, and then she moved out shortly after that. tl;dr: neighbour lady threw rocks at our house and poisoned our koi fish</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Estival is the sequel to Shinovi. Haven't played Estival, but it has more features like a kissing mode, diorama mode (taking pics of life and hometown) etc. Shinovi Versus introduces a new faction that also appears in Estival Versus, so its kind of connected in that sense. I don't think the plot is connected, even if it is its just loosely, its more of getting to know the characters that debuted in Shinovi, as they appear in Estival also. Shinovi is pretty good for a brawler, but it does get repetitive. You basically fight enemies in a small arena, move on, more fighting, then its boss time. Another gripe I have is that the feedback sometimes feel quite lacking, like when you're fighting and you just don't feel like you're hitting something. Could just be me though. Can't comment on Estival's gameplay because I don't own it yet, but it should be more or less the same... Endless Summer edition comes with a box, artbook, OST, and some cards. Sakura edition comes with extra DLC swimsuits, but seems like its PS4 and Japan only. If you want more features then you probably could just jump into Estival, but if you want continuity (not really) then you can start with Shinovi, its really up to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It IS a JRPG, so be prepared for a ton of text. It does get better if you're willing to commit. I like (extremely love, if the game were a human being I would make love to it) the game though. It starts slow, but that's because the slow pacing is vital to setting up the whole murder mystery scenario, and then after that it introduces more and more game mechanics and I was like "WHOA how do I balance my time and activities", and the story starts to escalate at a steady pace and bla bla I'm repeating what alot of people has said. Maybe you were expecting something different? Idk. Stick with it is my verdict.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You need to understand that the largest market for the Vita currently is in Japan (don't quote me on this, but it's quite obvious). Japanese developers make games like these to cater towards the Japanese audience and culture. The few indie titles on the Vita are typically from a couple of Western developers. Anime (or according to you, "weeaboo games") games are inevitable because its something that appeals towards the Japanese audience, which happens to be the Vita's largest market. No sane company is stupid enough to start pumping out games for a market that won't bring about profit. According to you though, these are "weeaboo games" just because they're too...japanese-y? I feel like a weeaboo game is more like a game that's been developed by a western developer that just wants to add a ton of Japanese culture and references into their game without actually knowing what the actual context is. These games were developed by actual Japanese people, and then translated by publishers and brought over here, so weaaboo kind of doesn't apply to them since they were originally Japanese... Also not sure why you're trash talking the Vita on a subreddit that's dedicated for the Vita, but okay...just because the thing doesn't cater to your personal preferences doesn't mean it's bad. Judging on your comments though, you're better off just selling it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Where in Australia are you at? Not much options, unfortunately. I'm in SA and I mainly get my physical games from a Japanese hobby store (sells anime and gaming merch etc). You might have to hunt around for shops like these, maybe? EB Games and JB Hi-Fi here has completely obliterated the Vita section too. Other than that I just buy it off PSN. I would recommend P4G, Trails of Cold Steel, Ys: Memories of Celceta, Oreshika, Digimon, Dragon's Crown, Toukiden, Killzone, Metal Gear series. I also really really like Valkyria Chronicles 2 (why doesn't anyone talk about this game) and P3P, these are PSP titles and should appear in the EU PSN.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whoa, small world haha. Yup, it's Shin Tokyo. One thing though, they're still more expensive than just getting it off PSN. They have some "older Vita games", but they're still pretty expensive compared to PSN prices. They also rarely have sales for Vita games. For example, during the recent Easter Sale, Cold Steel was more or less half off on PSN (32 AUD), while ST had it at full price at around 63 AUD. Then again, it's also whether you want it digital or physical. You don't need previous knowledge of Persona games, you can jump straight into it. I recommend you to start with Persona 3 Portable first, then Persona 4 Golden just for the sake of number order haha. They both have separate stories, characters, and settings. It doesn't matter which you play first. P3P is also technically backwards, and presents itself in a VN style, while P4G lets you walk around the overworld in 3PS. If I'm not mistaken, there's a Persona 2 and Persona 3 bundle also, if you want two games for a cheaper price. Persona 2 plays much more differently than P3 and P4 though as its quite dated, so be warned before making your choice. Shit, I'm sorry for this wall of text haha! I can't stop talking about Persona games whenever it gets mentioned</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They're completely different. In Oreshika you have your standard dungeon crawling where you have to look for this room that transports you to like Hell where you fight a boss. There's also a timer to dungeon crawling, so overall its much more fast paced than P4G's dungeons. The combat system is also based on rows, and not individual turns. You also have a village to like manage, where you can upgrade shops to get better goods, have festivals, and invite merchants or smiths to get better equipment. The breeding mechanic is quite confusing at first, but basically you have to collect points from dungeon crawling that allows you to mate with gods. Weak gods require less points, and the offspring will of course be weak, and stronger ones will need more points. Different gods also have different elemental affinity. I think there's like fire, water, wind and earth. I haven't quite figured it out yet, but if your character has a high fire element stat, and if you match it with a similar fire god, the kid will have a higher chance to unlock some fire based secret art. The breeding system also acts like a time limit system in a way. Your characters have a certain lifespan to them, and you have to consistently mate to ensure your bloodline continues.</TEXT>

At March its still fairly early in the game. I really like the ability to customize the equipment and roles of each member as well as your tank. The story gets quite interesting later on too.

    <TEXT>Gamefaqs should have P4G walkthroughs. Dont think theres any difference between a easy and normal walkthrough. My advice though, as its your first Persona game, you're better off not following a guide and enjoy the game as it is. Do a NG+ after that and follow a guide then to 100% the game. If you follow a guide, you have to stick to it really strictly as the schedule is really tight, and IMO it detracts the overall enjoyment of a first playthrough, considering its a plot heavy game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty basic for a rhythm game. I enjoyed it largely for its visuals, the animations and choreography are an absolute thrill to look at, but it's definitely a game aimed at Persona fans. The game has some really good remixes, but it's still a relatively small tracklist compared to other rhythm games. There's a few DLC songs that were really really good too. The story...well it IS a spin-off of a JRPG with a really good plot, but IMO it's not that great, but not very bad either, it's just okay. Maybe because I was expecting it to live up more to its parent game plot.</TEXT>

Just keep going out with the characters you like, or whichever arcana you prefer. If you're stuck on side stuff like quiz answers or whatever, just search it up. Not sure why a guide wouldn't let you date Yukiko though, if you advance each girls S.Link enough, you get a choice whether to romantically involved with them (the game always warns you), and unlike Persona 3, there's no penalties to having multiple girlfriends.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Um, SNES is Nintendo...and the Vita is Sony, so no. Besides that, no one's officially "cracked" a Vita yet I don't think. But you definitely can't run SNES games on it lol. However the Vita can emulate some PS1, PS2 and PSP titles, as long as it's on PSN. Well, being a handheld, the Vita is pretty suitable for a casual gamer. You can just pick it up and play when you want to, let it sleep for a long time, then just continue back again whenever you want to. Not to mention its portable, and fairly cheaper than most consoles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have you tried rebuilding the database again? I have a 32GB, and I got hit with the same error just yesterday. Always freaks me out. It's kinda fixed, just that now my browser gets hit by the error, hasn't appeared in any of my games so far. There was one time where I rebuilt the database and my bubbles all disappeared, rebuilding it a few more times restored them. Anyway, don't know how much this will help you. Worst case scenario, you have to reformat it. Doesnt seem like a memory card dying thing. The error in question is a pain in the ass to deal with and no one really knows what it is even. Just remember to always backup your games frequently if possible.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-05-02 20:24:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm almost done with Cold Steel, and its been quite the ride. Now I'm craving for more from the same franchise. How different in terms of gameplay and writing is Trails in the Sky? Considering that its an earlier game, I'm worried I'll find it difficult to adjust to it. And for its price, I'd like to get some insight before splurging on it. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Estival Versus is really surprisingly good.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-27 11:36:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>At first I thought it'll be pretty similar to Shinovi Vs, so I wasn't expecting much when I got into it. Nearing the end of the 4th school of SV, I was just sick of it because it felt like it was really dragging it's heels at that point, but wanted to just push through for some of the trophies. But when I played EV, it was surprisingly pleasant. **What's great:** There's a huge updated roster filled with different characters that have different movesets, the visuals are crisp and neat, the cutscenes, transitions, animations are really fluid, updated transformation scenes  amp; character art, and the soundtrack imo is a huge upgrade from SV. The gameplay feels really solid and "grounded", compared to SV where it felt much more "floaty" to me. Characters with large heavy weapons feel heavy like they're supposed to, while characters that were supposed to be agile felt really good to control. There's also new mechanics like a wall ambush, environmental finishers, combo aerial raves, and throw-able bombs. Story wise, it really doesn't take itself seriously, but there are parts where it gets quite dark and emotional (as per usual) so you'll either love it or hate it. Performance wise, it's loading times are more or less the same as SV, but to have so many enemies with explodable clothing on screen, it plays really smoothly. **What's not that great:** Leveling up is much more slower compared to SV, where you would jump 4-5 levels after a stage, even with a low grade. In EV, it can take up to 2 stages for 1 level up. And because you need to reach a certain level to unlock more of your moves, it's quite tedious to be stuck with the same basic combos for quite a bit. EV also has a system where you have to unlock the girls' personal missions as well, based on this plot device, compared to SV where it was already available. Not a big fan of this. So yeah, my two cents on this game. Look beyond the butts and boobs and you'll find a pretty good action brawler, imo. Or maybe you just like butts and boobs. That's fine too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty stable for the most part, no noticeable slowdowns for me even when you're in the thick of action. Starting here (Vita) is fine, but EV has characters that debuted in SV, and their backgrounds do carry over and are part of the story, so you might feel a bit lost at times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the personal missions of SV, I felt that it didn't really add more to their characters, but instead it was more of their wacky interactions/adventures with other girls instead...? Then again, I did the personal missions pretty early on, so I did get most of them decently leveled in the middle of the story mode, so maybe I'm a bit biased in that sense, haha. I guess it makes sense though, they would want you to play through the story to a decent point before letting you move on into other modes.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Storing tiny Nendoroid parts</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hi guys, I recently got into buying figures and stuff, and my first Nendoroid (Onodera one) and figures arrived today (maybe I'll post pics later :D). So the Nendoroid has a lot of tiny parts that you can exchange out, I was just wondering like, how do you store these parts? Is there a special case or bag to use, or do I store them in the box itself? Because it feels like whenever I want to quickly change her expressions/parts for photography or whatever, carrying around the box probably isn't going to be a good idea... what do you guys typically do?

    <TEXT>Hi guys. Initially I planned to go to Japan this Oct with my sister, but she couldn't take leave from work so it got cancelled. I'm pretty devastated and disappointed :[ Now we're planning to go around March/April 2017, probably around Tokyo, Kyoto-Osaka, Hiroshima etc., basically the main big cities. Which would be a better month to travel in regards to weather and crowds? I'm aware that around that time its the cherry blossom season and Golden Week is in April, but are the crowds really as bad as they say? What is your personal experience? Probably too early to be asking this anyway, but thanks! (It's probably been asked a thousand times before too, sorry)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that, but there are tons of popular clean family cartoons from other countries that have tons of porn about it...it just seems too excessive. If this were explicit photos of a real individual I would understand the police looking into it, but this isn't even real. It's just some badly retextured graphics of a not real character. I just realised the pictures aren't even porn, they're just suggestive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Shadow Warrior (2013) and subsequently, Shadow Warrior 2. It was such an unexpected reboot, and it was an absolute blast to play through. Another series, Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong. Probably one of the only Kickstarter game that came out from Kickstarter good. Even though it's an isometric top down turn based RPG, it really sucks you into the world and lore.</TEXT>

All I'm saying is that there are plenty of people that go to QP to play as well, and mainly play there.

    <TEXT>Maybe you should cut out Hiroshima? Instead, spend more time in Tokyo, then activate your 7 days JR Pass on Day 6/7, so you can use your JR Pass when returning from Osaka back to Tokyo on Day 13.  gt; Day 3 Tokyo Personally, for Day 3, I would go to Asakusa instead of the Tokyo Skytree. If you're after the paid (2000 yen!) observation deck of the Skytree, you can go to the Tokyo Government Metro Building (Tocho) in Shinjuku instead (on Day 2), as they have a free observation deck. On a clear day, you get a sweet view of Tokyo, and you might even see Mt Fuji in the distance if you're lucky (for free!).  #160; So I would do Day 3 as such: Tsukiji gt;Asakusa gt;Akihabara (you can interchange Akiba and Asakusa since these 3 areas are really close by anyway).  #160; For food, Tsukiji has some really really popular sushi places that's packed from early morning onwards, so it really depends on what you're after. I had my lunch by walking around the outer market and trying out a plethora of street food (eg uni, crab miso, various grilled skewers/shellfish), and then randomly picking a restaurant for a chirashidon. For Asakusa, there are restaurants along the side leading up to Sensoji. Asakusa is pretty popular for its tempura restaurants. For Akihabara, I went for [Kyushu Jangara Ramen] (https://goo.gl/maps/inJmqoEYod92) and [Marugo] (https://goo.gl/maps/ryjZh7qgjZ22). These 2 were freaking awesome.  gt;Day 8 Kyoto This is a really packed day. The travel route makes sense, but you have to factor in travel time and time spent at these places. By the way, which area are you staying in Kyoto? Remember to check out Ninnenzaka/Sannenzaka for your dose of traditional Japanese houses, shops and scenery, which is around Kiyomizu-dera (just a heads up, they're renovating the main temple platform till 2020, so the iconic structure is covered by scaffolding. It's still worth going though.)  gt;Day 9 Kyoto As CyanRaven mentioned, you **MUST** go to Fushimi Inari if it's your first time to Japan. I would suggest that you go to Inari early in the morning, spend a good 2-3 hours there, then head back to Kyoto for Nishiki Market, and then shopping. Most of Kyoto's shopping is concentrated around Teramachi-dori and Shin Kyogoku (it's preeetty tourist-y), which is right next to Nishiki anyway. Then Gion for the evening. Don't forget to check out Yasaka Shrine which is nearby.  #160; This can't be overstated enough, but Japan is a freaking amazing place to travel to. Don't fret too much if you can't cover everything in your plan and have to cut out some places. Have a fantastic trip.</TEXT>

In the original series however, Iscandarians went nearly extinct due to various plagues that started on Garmillas. It eventually affected Iscandars population as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey dude, sorry about your experiences man. I can kinda relate, studied in Aus for a few years. Didn't make as much local friends as I would like to, but that's because I'm an introvert. The unfortunate truth is that, a good majority of Malaysians have quite skewed perceptions when it comes to foreigners, and there's a good bunch of stereotypes that pops up first when Msians encounter foreigners. And it's hard to admit, but I still do that sometimes, even though I'm more than happy to help (as long as it's easy enough). Thing is, we don't really engage in casual conversations in public places with strangers. Honestly I've only seen this happen when my mum talks to the mak cik next to her in the LRT lol. Its really situational and depends on who you're talking to. You can try to engage in casual convos in social situations eg when you're at a pub or club etc. With that being said, not all of Msians are like that. It really depends on your luck too. Ultimately it boils down to our education and culture, and how that affects our perceptions to foreigners. Maybe you can engage more in online forums or groups/clubs that share similar interests. Things that eventually organize meets or stuff like that.</TEXT>

Folks over at Lowyat.net seems to think that the tech involved only covers P2P networks. https://www.lowyat.net/2018/165735/pdrm-internet-monitoring-tool-catches-porn-viewers/ As another user mentioned, the internet surveillance unit has been around since 2014.

    <TEXT>The tech definitely feels overexaggerated in what it can do, and a bit of fearmongering by the article and author. Folks over at Lowyat.net seems to think that the tech involved only covers P2P networks. They don't actually check what sites you go to and every single download you make. https://www.lowyat.net/2018/165735/pdrm-internet-monitoring-tool-catches-porn-viewers/ But no guarantees ah. All speculation since we don't actually know for real what that tech really is. As another user mentioned, the internet surveillance unit has been around since 2014. Since then, we have rarely seen (almost nil) arrest cases made on "legal consensual 18+ models" porn possession etc. I would think if anything does happen, it would only be confiscation of illicit materials and fines.

    <TEXT>Alot of VPN sites have so called "promotions", which cuts prices down if you take yearly subscriptions. Thing is, you have to pay the whole 2-3 year fee in advance first. So its like around 79-99 USD...again depending on what VPN you use. I just bought 3 year plan with NordVPN, was 99 USD. About RM 432 (Paypal conversion rate, always bumped up one). Which is RM 12 per month. For 3 years. Reasonable to me, Spotify sub in comparison is abt RM 15 per month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My friend will be here for a few days only, so they won't have time to go to Langkawi or any of the islands. I reckon a trip to another state will be very tiring and rushed for them...plus the fact that they're coming to Malaysia when we're having a long public holiday too...so it's probably gonna be congested as hell trying to get to other states.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely not, the tool they use actually only screens P2P websites eg Bittorrent, Ares, Gnutella, eMule. P2P is apparently a common way to spread CP, and the tool can actually match unique hash functions of the files and identify the IPs of the computers sharing the files. Unless the tool has been updated to comb for normal porn on normal websites...it really can't see what you're surfing or downloading. The article is really overblown on the whole tech and issue... Anyway, Reddit content is hosted by American company. Unless PDRM asks Reddit to turn over all the user data that has accessed NSFW subs (which is impossible), you're safe lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Important to note from the article is that, regular porn users is highly likely to not be monitored.  gt; "Rozario said, however, that general Internet users should not be alarmed as police will not likely use the system to monitor regular Internet usage outside of P2P networks, amid perception that authorities would watch regular porn users.  gt;  #8220;The monitoring is limited to a small set of P2P networks like bit-torrent, Ares and Freenet. Your Facebook, Twitter, Google, Youtube and all other Internet traffic is still very much private, #8221; he said.  gt; Cyber security expert Fong Chook Fook said mass surveillance was unlikely as it would incur a high cost on the government.  gt;  #8220;The authorities conduct targeted surveillance based on reports. The result of which led to arrests of perpetrators involved in online scams, gambling and such. Mass surveillance is just too resource-intensive, #8217; #8217; he added." Here's a [PPT] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t amp;source=web amp;rct=j amp;url=http://www.teorieib.cz/pbi/files/103-Erdely_ICAC%2520Cops%2520P2P.pptx amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVtM3Th5bcAhWLfn0KHeLUBkgQFjABegQIBBAB amp;usg=AOvVaw23KDiNafMQ63iefk63LPqK) describing how the software actually works (credit: Keith Rozario Twitter) So if you stick to regular porn, don't freak out so quickly. NST seriously misleading and fearmongering with their article. Sure, authorities probably know that you watch regular porn. But there's too much traffic to actually realistically monitor. They aren't interested in seeing what y'all fap or shlick to lol. Only the absolutely terrible ones.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do I convince my mum to stop believing in online scams? I've tried everything and it's not working. I have no idea how to educate her on how to identify what websites  amp; links are scams. My mum reads The Star Online on a daily basis. At the bottom of their webpages, they have a section for Sponsored Ads, and there are always ads abt scam products there. Because she clicks on these links, she always reads the fabricated "testimonials" and stuff, and always comes to me saying like "omg ah boi ah, you see this miracle product, can buy for me or not". Then i look it up myself and the company is from Slovenia and no one has ever received their product ever. I remember once she excitedly came to told me how she do this browser survey then she can win a S9 for RM 1. Or that shit about Tony Fernandes asking u to invest in online shares and it made him even more rich. It's super tiring and I'm afraid she will fall for one of these scams one of these days. Her phone always get a ton of malware too from all this websites.</TEXT>

There's no way they'll dare to risk their next GE. Plus imagine if they did force it. Religious nuts will be going "why are you introducing and encouraging more porn and sex to our children while censoring internet porn?!". Malaysia is just not ready for this change yet until we stop seeing porn and sex as the ultimate taboo. Which is impossible as it clashes with Islamic views.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Multi level marketing. The "legal version" of a pyramid scheme lol. You obtain stock for a product from a MLM company. Now you need to sell this stock. So you recruit people. These idiots think MLM is good money, that's fine. Then these idiots that you recruited, they in turn recruit more bodo people. So it keeps going on. Lets say you recruit two people. Then your 2 recruits recruit 2 people each. Then they recruit 3 people each. So it forms a pyramid. Thats why its "multi level". Now, everyone has to sell this stock off. So every sale your recruits, and their recruits make, you get a commission. So that's how you "earn" in a MLM. There are some that pays based off how many ppl you manage to recruit. So the lower levels, your underlings, they earn like shit, while you sit on top and feed off their hard work.</TEXT>

It's just that I don't want it to end (esp if it's a game I really like and grown attached to), so I stop playing/watching just so the game/anime doesn't end. I need to stop doing that because there's no closure to anything I play or watch lol</TEXT>

It's not a matter of whether OP asked to bring her parents along, but her parents role, commitment and responsibility to be by her side to console or support her when she collects the result.

    <TEXT>OP, I'm in no position to advise or guide you on what you should do with your life, but giving up is not the way. Please please seek medical help for your depression if it's leading you to suicidal thoughts. Talking to a qualified doctor does wonders, or even ranting like this to faceless strangers... we're all willing to listen. It may feel like it's just downward all the way. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. But there is, and there always will be a better, sunnier day waiting for you. One step at a time. One day at a time. Take your problems as they come. Start things small. Make tiny changes to your life. One day when all of this has passed, you'll look back and be able to happily say that you've proved all your critics and doubters wrong. Keep fighting and doing your best, OP. I know you will overcome this rough patch. I believe in you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Moving out from parents house as a Malaysian</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-22 11:41:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Funny how my mother always threatens "if you so good, you move out la!" then when I actually bring up the idea to her with like a proper plan in place, she says "why you wanna move out, now you old already, you wanna dump your parents now la?". So I'm stuck in this constant limbo. Move out also wrong. Don't move out also wrong. It's so frustrating. At one hand, she asks me to grow up and be independent. On the other hand, she refuses to let go. Sometimes I wonder, how does the average Malaysian take that first step to move out from their parents house. How was it for you monyets? What age did ya'll move out from your parents houses? How did it happen? Any tips?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It shouldn't be an issue. I'm financially capable to move out. I have a plan in place. The thing is, my parents take moving out as a declaration that "I want nothing to do with them, and I'm cutting off all familial connections with them". My mum would probably just disown me on the spot. I don't actually want that to happen. And well, I'm the only son in a traditional Chinese family. As per filial piety, it'll eventually be my responsibility to take care of my parents as they get older. And in my family, the only way of doing this is to stay with your parents to care for them. Moving out would be seen as an extremely rebellious and shitty move, causing my parents to lose face etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look up Dr Ranjit at SS15, Subang Jaya. Reputable skin specialist. Unfortunately I don't take Accutane as I'm saving it as a "last resort" method (heard some ppl do experience side effects which worsens the acne), my condition isn't too bad atm as its mostly scarring for me. Anyway, doc prescribed me facial cleanser and two topical creams. Lasts about 3 months, costs about RM130 including consultation. My acne is mostly gone with the exception of 1 or 2 occassional popout. I'm guessing it should be roughly the same cost if you wanna jump on Accutane. Subsequent visits to the doc, you can just collect the medicine over the counter. So no consultation fees incurred there, just meds only. Best to see him first and get a proper diagnosis on your condition. The clinic is really popular and there's large crowds almost everyday, so make an appointment first. Last time I walk in, it took me about 4 hours to see him.</TEXT>

Since then your videos have carried me through the worst and the best times of my life. 7 years. What a ride. Thank you for all the wonderful moments in gaming that you guys gave to us. I'm heartbroken and I feel like a part of me has died, and as much as I want everything to stay the same, I know that just isn't possible. It hurts more to know that Matt and Pat aren't friends anymore, and I hope they reconcile in the future.

I can't even bear to think how these pics get circulated or used...this kinda stuff should be left private. Its a competition at this point, a game of "My mom is hotter than your mom". Especially posting on a website like Reddit where its largely anons and strangers? You're gonna get fucking flak for it. People need to realize when you post pics of yourself or your family on the internet, you're putting yourself OUT there, for the whole world to view. And that shit can't be easily removed, even if you delete the pic or post - who knows what creep out there has it saved for "personal uses" or spreading it on another forum...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Worked in Inspidea (not as an Animator, but worked closely with them). Paid like shit, staff treated like shit (by clients and management), and their whole renumeration  amp; incentive structure were abysmal. High af turnover rate, ppl kept going out and coming in, but I expect its like this in the industry. However, the projects they did were pretty interesting, and there was a lot to learn and gain experience from. Good for a stepping stone - definitely not long term, not any studio in Malaysia. Sadly that's the reality of the animation industry in Malaysia, and its not gonna change anytime soon. "Industry standard" they call it. But its just a convenient excuse to fuck over animators and related jobs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, its like she's a professional show performer. Or like a trickster. And it's really how all the PT outfit designs are based around, they're meant to be flashy so they can stand out And while I agree that leotards do have a certain appeal to look at, its kinda disappointing that shortsighted people are almost singling out her design as being "overtly sexy and revealing", and essentially condemning her whole character before we can actually learn more about her. No one even complained this much about Ann's catsuit outfit. So why did everyone conveniently forget that gymnasts wearing leotards are an actual thing that exists irl?</TEXT>

Then it hit me, oh shit, I don't know this guy...and somehow my mind doubled down and I waved AGAIN hoping he would respond...but he didn't. And I'm sure he saw me wave at him twice. This random dude just enthusiastically waving at him from inside his car. The guy just drove away but I'm sat here in my car, red faced, contemplating my life choices.

    <TEXT>I've been using CMB since the start of this year, got maybe around 20-30 matches so far but I noticed that zero girls will initiate conversation first. Makes me wonder why girls always have to wait for the guy to initiate first sometimes, even if it's just to say hi. That difficult meh... Even after I initiate conversation, some end up ghosting me lol No luck so far in finding a partner :(</TEXT>
