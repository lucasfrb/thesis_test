    <TEXT>Student loans are their own special form of hell. They're outrageously expensive, agreed to when you're hardly an adult, and can loop so many people into it. You have every right to be scared and upset about them because it is such bullshit. You may be able to request a deferment on your loans.

    <TEXT>Oh, God. That is a special form of hell. I'm trans, too, and it's nerve\-wracking enough just existing in society. I can't imagine being in a space that is so hostile towards us. You could probably try something like [7 Cups](https://www.7cups.com/). It's an online\-based therapy service. You can talk one on one with a listener for free and they do have professionals available. You can also get more traditional sessions for a certain amount of money per month (It's cheaper than what a therapist charges per hour in the US) I haven't used it extensively, but I've heard some good things about it. Another option is to try the [Trans Lifeline](https://www.translifeline.org/). It's based out of the United States, but I think you could get around any kind of region blocking by using something like a Google Voice number. It isn't fair or right that you're going through this. I know that some people will try to say "Well, why don't you just move?" and for a lot of people that's just not feasible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dear Lord do I feel that! You are so not alone in that regard. Last year I avoided Facebook for like two months after my birthday because I couldn't stand all of the well\-wishing. These people come out of the woodwork for shit like that but then don't talk to me for the other 364 days of the year. If you don't mind me being a bit of a weeb for second, there's a really good song about this topic. It's ["Unhappy Birthday" by Kairiki Bear](https://youtu.be/qfVnQSt1--U). The same producer has a good variety of songs about different things like isolation, suicide, fear of people, and others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have *extreme* chronic pain (typically it's mild to moderate), but I did have to rely on a cane for things last year and it really fucking sucks. It was embarrassing to have to walk with it since I'm still a young adult and the pitying looks from other people made me want to smash some faces in. Chronic health conditions, whether physical or mental, are terrible. Especially when you're young because no one seems to believe you. Have you ever looked into or have been asked about Complex PTSD (aka C\-PTSD)? [Here's some information on it from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder). It's basically PTSD that has been stretched out over a long period of time and is often found with people who've been abused as a kid. It shares some signs and symptoms with PTSD, but some of the special symptoms are things like impaired memory and poor emotional regulation. It isn't included in the DSM, even though it's been proposed for the last two editions. I'm glad that you do have a partner who accepts you for who you are. It's important to have a net of people who will be there for you. I fear that the trans issues are only getting started in the US. It's terrifying that we have people in power who are such bigots. I mean, gay marriage was only won a few years ago. It still feels like we can have everything ripped from us again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*You are not a bad person for being sick.* People try to imply that all the time and it's bullshit. I'm in the same boat with the ACA. It's terrifying to me that I can again be denied coverage because of what conditions I have or have had in the past. And if it's not a total refusal of coverage, they make your monthly payments and deductibles absurdly high. No one should be denied healthcare on the basis of whether or not they can afford it. It makes me extremely uneasy that the Congress could force a bill through that would kill the preexisting conditions clause. I was white knuckling it last year when it came down to Senator McCain and thank the stars he was against it. Most people don't understand that they're only one illness or accident away from losing everything.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most artists don't hit their stride while they are still in their early 20s. Although, trying to create something and hitting a brick wall again and again is probably one of the worst experiences that artists do go through. It's even worse when you're surrounded by successful creatives and you begin to compare yourself to them. Have you ever heard of "[The Gap](https://youtu.be/3ResTHKVxf4)"? It's a pretty popular speech segment. Basically, it's the distance between what your work is and what you want it to be. You're supercritical about your own work because you can see what could be and just don't have the means to express it quite yet. You have really good tastes, but your skill level just isn't quite there. It's something that every creative professional (and amateurs!) go through. It can take years to get through it. Do you have any sort of peer group that is willing to give you constructive feedback about your works? The chances are very good that you don't suck as much as you think that you do. We can get bogged down by the flaws in your work that you can't see where your work shines. I've been taking photography seriously as a career choice for 12 years. It took me 6 years to get good enough for formal education and another 4 to finally start creating work that I like. I spent a good chunk of time detesting my work and questioning what I was doing. Each time I found that when I didn't have a camera on me, I wished I had a camera on me. Dreams would be an interesting place to start, since you're already having vivid ones. I haven't tried it, but I have heard that writing down your dreams helps you to remember more of them when you wake up. Like, you'll start remembering smaller details from the overall dream. I can't lie \-\- I did laugh at the term "suicide jail" because it's a *really* good way to describe it. It's awful that we have to hide our pain because we're scared of being forcibly locked up. It's very counter\-intuitive and just leaves more people hurting for longer than they need to. If you do approach your psychs about the topic, be very specific that you do not have *any* plans or preparations. Also, remember that they're working for *you.* You're the client. You do not owe them anything and if you're not happy with the way that your treatment is progressing, then you are completely within the right to find someone who works better for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone who does self harm, I'd encourage you to not start. Of course, I read that kind of advice before I started and didn't heed it. You think it will go well and it just doesn't. Other methods than cutting also have their own risks. There is no safe way to self harm. If you're into the pain, one of the best things is holding an ice cube or rubbing it over areas where you self harm. It fulfills the need to cause pain or sensation while also doing no permanent damage. If it's the marks that you're after, then I have a slightly unconventional suggestion. (And hopefully not one that will get me reported. Mods, if you're reading this, I'm still trying to get a grip of where the line is regarding this sort of topic!) Get a dip pen set. They're sold at craft stores and are generally from $10\-12 USD. They come with a bunch of nibs and a holder or two. I like to use the sketching nibs ([like these](https://www.speedballart.com/our-product-lines/speedball-drawing-lettering/speedball-pen-nibs/speedball-pointed-crowquill-pen-nibs/)) versus the calligraphy nibs. Dip the pen into some red food dye and make your marks. Don't press down hard \-\- remember this is an *alternative to self harm.* The marks will stay for several days at the very least before washing away. You can take rubbing alcohol and scrub them off, as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You will have a very bad time, but will most likely not die. But you're going to be very, very sick and probably wind up in the hospital. It's possible that Prozac just doesn't work for you. It happens. Another possibility is that it hasn't had enough time to fully kick in if you haven't been on it for long. The way that SSRIs work is that they give you back more energy *before* they start improving mood. That's why the medications have a black box warning.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>OCD and self-harm are slowly killing me (heads up for self-harm and EDs)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-14 01:23:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, feel free to laugh at this. I know it's illogical and quite silly, but it's the way I attempt to live my life. I have OCD with a strong basis in contamination and fear of illness. About 5 years ago, I developed IBS\-D out of the clear blue sky. I was already scared of vomiting, but then found the joys of just how much it hurts when bile comes into contact with your anus. The IBS also led to an eating disorder. No idea why the hell it started or figured out what triggered it, so I just started restricting food in general Thank God I was fat to begin with because I lost upwards of 150lbs over the course of about a year or so. It's bad enough that I'm down to rice crackers and Ensure. The magical thinking of the OCD took the IBS and ran with it to it illogical end, to say the least. I also have pretty much zero ways to express or even process mental or emotional pain. I missed that lesson as a kid, so the only coping mechanisms I have are things that take my mind off of the emotional pain and translate it into physical pain. I also have had a trauma conga sort of childhood with abuse, major people in my life dying, almost being coerced into having unnecessary surgery as a kid, the list of events probably take a good four or five sessions with every therapist I go to who want my history. Okay, with all of that in mind, let's take a look at the problem I am obsessing over today. About two weeks ago, I smashed a 5lb weight on my right calf to get some relief from my brain. It was hard enough to make me double over with pain, but at that moment it was such a release for me. The only way I can describe it is that it's like orgasm. I go out of town on a trip. The area starts to swell and get red, but I figure that it's just because of the way I hit it. It didn't get better on its own. In fact, the area grew and became more and more discolored. I went to the doctor yesterday and he gave me a script for an x\-ray, ultrasound, and for an antibiotic. Somehow I developed cellulitis (a skin infection) from a fucking *bruise*. My peeps, my biggest fear right now is that the antibiotics are going to give me diarrhea. ***That's the entire issue.*** It is so fucking stupid, even I can hardly keep a straight face. Thank you for listening to me whinge. Feel free to comment with your bizarre fears. I promise I will not make fun of them, even if they're really out there. Also, I want to say thank you for making this space. It's good to have somewhere you can go full of people who won't freak out about your mental status.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The way that personality disorders are represented and treated is shameful. Like, I'm sure you feel bad enough about things without some doctor or therapist coming at you with the whole "personality disorders can't be fixed" crap. You can learn how to manage the symptoms, but there's no cookie\-cutter specific treatment plan laid out. I'm not going to say it gets better. I can't tell you that and you don't want to hear that. But, sometimes psychs are wrong. They're only human and mental illness is subjective as hell. For example, I was diagnosed with an entire host of disorders form a scantron test from a psychologist. The disorders included AVPD and Dependent Personality Disorder, both with Borderline features. It took me almost two full years and another therapist to find that I probably have Complex\-PSTD, which has very similar features to BPD.</TEXT>

That being said, if you've just started taking new medication, it can make you act or feel really weird. For example, about a week after I started Anafranil I was getting rage episodes around 4:00 PM every day. No rhyme or reason for it. At first we thought it was related to blood sugar, but nope, just a weird side effect of my brain trying to process the new drug.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have no idea. It is like the weirdest place in the world. I actually have a specific shorthand for when my OCD goes beyond logic and just becomes funny. I call it a "nuclear potato". Why? Because one day I had just read about two people in Mexico stealing medical equipment, which included a radiation machine for people with cancer. (I'm pretty sure this is the specific incident) I was washing a potato to make a baked potato and all of a sudden my OCD jumped the shark and put together a weird theory where the potato was radioactive. I actually had to stop what I was doing because I was laughing so hard \-\- it made absolutely zero sense. The incident in Mexico had just happened, the potatoes were already on their or had made it to the store by then, I live nowhere *near* Mexico, and the potato itself was grown in Iowa. Thus, "nuclear potato".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not failing her at all. Please remember that. It sounds like this has been really rough on the both of you. If your girlfriend isn't in therapy, it's possible she may benefit from it. Specifically, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) which aims to help bridge the gaps between logic and emotion while still acknowledging that her emotions ***do*** matter. This always sounds so heartless, but you can't be her everything. I highly doubt that she's doing this on purpose, but she's putting you into a bad spot with your own well being and health. This isn't really what a relationship is supposed to be like. It's a little like when someone is drowning. If someone who doesn't know the correct way to rescue them, then the person who's drowning can inadvertently drag down their rescuer until they're both drowning. It isn't intentional at all, but it can have very poor results. I can go back and forth between extreme emotions like your girlfriend does. I had been tagged with everything I possibly could be tagged with until I had a therapist tell me about Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), which can cause symptoms that mimic a bunch of different illnesses. If she's lived in an environment all her life where she's been mistreated or abused, she most certainly developed some unhealthy coping habits from it. I hope that this helps somewhat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the big thing for me is understanding that I've had chronic thoughts of suicide since I was a little kid. I don't use suicide for attention, but I do have my moments when something goes wrong I mutter "Just kill me now!" to myself. People tend to have an overreaction response and tell me that I need to go to the hospital ASAP or that they will force me there because they're worried about me The other side of the coin, there are people who just assume that I'm joking. I have met two (2) therapists in my life who have had the appropriate reaction: establish whether or not the person has made plans and are about to commit suicide or if they just have suicidal ideation. I felt comfortable enough with them both to tell them if the thoughts were getting worse, and one even volunteered to be with me to go to the hospital if I decided I needed to be committed. It was such a big deal for me at the time because I had never had anyone offer that kind of support. And it was kind of funny because she wasn't a private therapist, but rather worked for my school's counseling services and had many other students that she met with. She had worked inpatient before, so she knew what the difference between the two was.</TEXT>

People will comment on how much I've overcome and it's like, "No, what you're seeing isn't the truth. I go through hell every day because of the shit that has been dumped into my life."

    <TEXT>First off, the fact that your parents call you "thin as a stick" is *not* cool. You don't deserve that kind of belittlement. If you're eating a bunch of food and not gaining any kind of weight, you may have something like hyperthyroidism, where your metabolism works way too fast. I don't know how old you are, but if you're still in your teens, your metabolism is still going to be all over the place as your body prepares to go into adulthood. As for how to gain a little weight, there are different drinks and foods that will provide some dense calories but aren't unhealthy. It sounds like you're in Europe, so I don't know what the food markets are like where you are, but here in the States you can go into a grocery store and get something like [Ensure](https://ensure.com/nutrition-products), which is a drink that has a lot of calories and also has a bunch of vitamins, minerals, and protein.

    <TEXT>I've found that when I think or utter "I want to kill myself," what I really want is for whatever bad thing is happening to just stop happening. Now, that isn't to say that I've never been suicidal, but a lot of it was just short hand for another emotion. This may be what you're trying to express. Another example for me is that I'll utter "I just wanna go home!" even when I *am* home. What I really mean is that I don't feel safe in a situation and want to feel safe. I don't think that I can be much help about the low self esteem issue. I'm going face to face with that on a daily basis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's extremely understandable to feel the way you feel about this. To put it lightly, this is actually a really fucked up situation. You are *not* responsible for your parents' happiness. This isn't because of something that you did and you cannot make this situation better by yourself. Whatever happens, you are not at fault. I think that it may be a good time to reach out to a trusted adult: maybe a teacher, a councilor, or a friend's parent and let them know what you found on your dad's phone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I go through this. For me, it's a part of my struggle to learn how to regulate my emotions. It's not really "normal" to be swinging so far from one emotion to the other, but it is a thing. A lot of people are dealing with it. What I've personally noticed is that it's a hormonal thing with me. When I'm on my period, it's like being on a [pendulum ride](https://youtu.be/a9tde1ifR_0?t=21). When I'm not on my period, it tends to go between a hammock to a regular playground swing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The best way to deal with my anxiety is to know what it feels like right before I start to get anxious. If I can figure out what's happening, then I can sort of control it. Or at the very least mitigate the effects. For example, sometimes I get anxious when I'm out shopping. I've noticed that two things in particular tend to ramp up that response: crowds and noise. So if I'm in a place with a lot of crowds and noise, I'm alert to how I'm feeling. Is my breathing picking up? Do I feel my heart racing? Etc. I lose words when I'm having a panic attack. I know what I want to say but it just won't come out of my mouth. When I get to that point, I tend to remove myself from the situation that's causing the anxiety and wait it out for a few minutes. I find that fidget toys help me, as do stupid apps on my phone like Buzzfeed. Going back to that example, I'd get myself out of where I was in the middle of a crowd, take my headphones out of my bag and put them in my ears. Now I've dampened the noise and have moved away from other people, the amount of adrenaline in my body will slowly lower with time. The ultimate goal is to get yourself calm enough to go back into the situation. Unfortunately, you're not doing yourself any favors just avoiding things. But you can work your way up through it. I hope this makes some sense!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You probably want to hear my sob story as much as I want to tell it -- not at all. I'm just feeling frustrated because my friends' consensus is that I'd recover from my mental illnesses much better if I moved away from my somewhat abusive parents. Which I agree with. I would probably be less stressed if I did not live with them. The problem is that I am not stable enough to live completely on my own. There are other complicating factors, like the fact that I take 9 different prescription medications throughout the day (my body hates me as well). I can't really guarantee that I'll be able to get my meds if I'm couch surfing or if I suddenly decide to move cross country. The biggest hurdle is that I have a piss poor grasp of basic emotional regulation because of mentioned child abuse. I really don't want to end up in a psychiatric ward, hospital, or jail in the event that I have a meltdown that scares other people (I don't hurt others, but sometimes self-harm because it takes the extreme feelings away). I love my friends, but it comes down to the fact of "Well, I did it (under a completely different set of circumstances), so you should do it too!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for responding. I appreciate it. :) I'd love to move out of my parents house within the next year. I've been formally diagnosed with: General Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Specific Phobia, Avoidant Personality Disorder, and Dependent Personality Disorder. Now that's just one of those scantron things that some psychologists do. I'd say my biggest battles are with OCD, Depression, and C-PTSD. Right now, I'm kinda stuck in place. I used to live alone when I was off in college. I hit a mental rough spot and had to come home. I've been living home for 2 years now and in that time my psychical health went to heck for a while. Things are sticky for the simple fact that I can't work a full time job, but I still need healthcare. My family makes no where near enough money to qualify for the health insurance subsidies and Florida is one of the states that didn't expand Medicaid. So, the only way I can get Medicaid is if I'm deemed disabled by the state. This really sucks because I have a ridiculously low limit to how much I can even own (in my case, no more than \~$500 USD in any kind of bank account). My parents love me and want to protect me, but it's turned into a toxic situation. I love them, but I'm smothered. I'm going to take my next therapy session to see what is out there for people like me. Thank you for taking the time to reply. It means a lot. I'm feeling better this morning.</TEXT>

I'm basing this on living in the US, but here you only need like first and last month's rent and a security payment. So the total costs would be maybe something like maybe $2,000 USD to rent your own place up front and then maybe something like $1,000 USD per month for rent.

    <TEXT>I routinely traumatize my friends with stories from my childhood by accident. And I won't know what'll set off someone until I blunder into it. Thus, my friends from bad families don't get to hear as many stories as my friends from good families because I could elicit a PSTD type flashback. Which leaves me in the odd situation that everyone who can emphasize with me cannot deal with me sometimes because of their own mental health concerns while I can talk to people who haven't had those experiences but they often don't understand the trauma. I've traumatized therapists, too. I think it's the blase attitude because I don't have a working schematic of what children go through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The eye twitching could be related to stress or the lack of caffeine. See if you can notice any patterns in it like what time of day it happens and things like that. Stress and using electronics and bring about eyestrain which will give you a low grade headache. Objectively, Benedryl isn't the *worst* thing you can be taking, but it's bad to get into the habit of going "Oh, I *need* to take something for my anxiety." Here and there it's okay, but not every day or more than one time a day. Learn from my mistakes on that one. When my anxiety gets to be bothersome, I try to immerse myself in something until I eventually forget what I was anxious about (the one decent thing about having anxiety and ADHD tendencies at the same time). Going to therapy may be a good idea. The hardest part is finding someone you like and trust, but it's good to hear perspective from a professional. They can teach you things like how to ride out your waves of anxiety or other coping skills. If all of that doesn't work, giving psych meds a try may be an option. They can make a world of difference, especially when combined with therapy, but they can be a pain in the ass to go off of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It depends a *lot.* Medications can really help, but they all have side effects and it can take a while to find the medication (or medications) that works for you. It may not be the first medication you try or you may have to try taking a few different ones. Pick a psychiatrist who you feel comfortable going to. A good psych will weigh the benefits and options and will listen to you when you report side effects. They can help you feel better, but they aren't like taking antibiotics for an infection. Right now, there's no real way to cure mental illness. But they can help you cope a lot better. I've been on meds most of my life and while I don't particularly *like* taking them, I do like how I'm able to function while I'm on them. The one thing that I wish I had known before starting on a medication is that sometimes you'll feel *worse* for a few weeks. This is because the medication increases your energy levels first before lifting your mood. It's normal and something you should talk to your doctor about if you're worried. Generally, this effect is found most in teens and young adults.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Generally, the point between normal functioning and needing help is drawn when something is impeding on your everyday life. Since it is affecting you, then you should get help. You don't need to be 100% positive that you have depression in order to seek therapy if you want it. You may actually be ahead of things because it's a lot easier to bounce back from things when you're not too bad than it is when you hit rock bottom. Just make sure that you make it explicit that you're having suicidal *thoughts* and not actually planning suicide. Some professionals can be a little jumpy around the topic. As for where to find someone, I've used [Psychology Today's listings](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists). Go with your gut feeling and always remember that your therapist is working for you. It's fine to switch providers if you don't click with someone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sorry you feel like you have to hide your struggles That tends to be pretty isolating in and of itself. I can understand why you'd want to keep something like this private depending on what your field is. I've found good fortune through using the [Psychology Today therapist listings](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists). You can narrow the search by a bunch of different qualifiers and hopefully find someone who you can work with. Most insurance plans will cover both therapy and medication and all health insurance now has to cover mental health. I don't think it's legal for an insurance company to report to your workplace. I am pretty sure that is a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (more commonly known as HIPAA). But, you can definitely pay out of pocket for treatment if that's really how you want to go. Rates vary between people and most places have a sliding scale pricing. I'd take a look at [Good RX](https://www.goodrx.com/) for medication pricing. Most of the common medications shouldn't be *that* much money, but make sure to ask for the generic. As for getting ads, I suggest using your browser's private mode. Firefox has a Private Browsing mode and Google Chrome has Incognito mode. Both of these will make sure that you aren't collecting cookies from sites and should make sure that you don't have ads popping up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Medication has helped me. Right now I'm on Paxil and Anafranil. They aren't magic, but they do make my brain calm down to a level where I can do normal things without a heck of a lot of energy being sucked from my soul. Antidepressants aren't addictive in the same way that benzos are. I can totally understand why you'd be scared to start meds if you've only ever had Valium. I would definitely talk with your therapist and let them know how you're feeling. They'll have a better idea of what will help you. As far as the weed goes, there's not enough information out there. Since it's still illegal federally, there aren't a lot of studies that look at weed and its interactions with other medications. I'd urge caution when combining them with any kind of mental health med. The same goes for alcohol. I hope this helps a little!</TEXT>

I have times where I don't have as many symptoms, but it's not something that's going to go away entirely. I was exposed to complex trauma as a kid and got myself wired wrong. My mind doesn't work the way other people's do. Although, I have something closer to dysthymia or "chronic depression" than one singular episode of depression. Speaking honestly, I become incredibly envious of people who've "beaten" it because it's not an option for me. It almost strikes me as arrogant. I wish my story was as simple as "I had depression, but therapy and medication have fixed my problem." Mine's more or less "I had a panic disorder as a child and as I've gotten older I've just grown that garden and accumulated diagnoses like other kids collected baseball cards."

I've had a mental health professional give up on me and it took me *years* to understand that that was *her* problem, not mine. She wanted an easy case where I'd be able to go through a course of CBT and be completely in remission. She saw me as a problem to solve and not a person. She told me that I would *never* get better without *months* of inpatient treatment. You know what? She was wrong. Psych medications are so complex and hard to get right. Like, it's hard to treat just depression. It's harder to treat depression, anxiety, and OCD at the same time. It can feel like the moment you put out one fire, another one sparks. I have OCD, too, and wouldn't wish it on my worse enemy. It is such a disabling condition. Right now I'm in a better place than I was, but I still struggle to get through things sometimes. Definitely switch providers. Another doctor may have some ideas on what can help. If you haven't already tried tricyclic antidepressants, you may want to give one a go. I was prescribed Anafranil a few years ago and it's helped me to stay steady. I'm so sorry that you've been put through this. You are far from alone in this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is *totally normal*. It's called "antidepressant discontinuation syndrome." Basically, your body has gotten used to the medication and when you go off of them your body is like "What the fuck? EMERGENCY TIME!" It is often mistaken for a relapse because it causes symptoms that look like depression or anxiety disorders. All psych medications need to be weaned off of. Stopping it cold turkey is *not* a fun time, as you've experienced. [Here's some more information about it from Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants).

    <TEXT>I don't think it's a *bad* decision, no. Whether or not you take medication isn't a morality choice. If you feel like they are not working for you or if you feel that the side effects outweigh the benefits, then by all means stop taking them. You just have to make sure you taper or you'll probably get some withdrawal effects. Doing it under a doctor's care is best, but I know people who've tapered off on their own. It's a slow process, though. I'd do it little by little. For example, I'm on Paxil and I have been for nearly 20 years. If I wanted to go off of it, I'd start very slow. I'm on 40mg, so I'd lower it by 5mg for a few weeks, then 30mg for a few weeks, and so on. You don't have to do it *that* slow if you haven't been on the medication a long time. You may be able to decrease it to something like 3/4 of your dose to begin with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem. I'll list what I've been "officially diagnosed" with, or the things that I've had various psychologists and psychiatrists have pegged me with. Keep in mind I've been in the system for 20 years at this point. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Major Depressive Disorder (Depression) Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthmia) Specific Phobia (Phobia of vomiting) Panic Disorder (Panic attacks) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder Avoidant Personality Disorder with Borderline features Dependent Personality Disorder with Borderline features Now, that's what I've been explicitly *told* I've had and I don't agree with all of the diagnoses. There's also been talk about Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar disorder and ADHD. The reason why I have so many diagnoses is because I tick a lot of boxes for a *lot* of disorders. But there's a Non-DSM disorder that *does* and that's Complex PTSD (C-PTSD). It's not an "official" disorder yet, but more research is being done on it. With C-PTSD as an option, the list looks more like this: OCD, Depression, Specific Phobia, and C-PSTD. As for how I cope... I think I have a different experience of the world than a lot of people do. A lot of it is trying to keep in mind that everything going through my head is most likely temporary. I have frequent panic attacks and have a harder time bouncing back from hardships, but I'm learning how to manage things with dialectical behavior therapy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sassenacho knocked this out of the park on this one. :) Here's the one thing that I wish someone told me when I first started seeking help: Your psychiatrist, psychologist, and/or therapist works for *you.* If you don't mesh with someone, it's totally normal to find a different person. It's hard to talk about what's going on in your head and it's important that you feel safe and secure with the people you're seeking help from. 1. There isn't a general kind of sheet of official diagnoses or anything. There *are* tests, but most of the time they're given orally and the patient doesn't see any kind of readouts. It's not like drawing blood and other lab work (I wish it was that simple, though!). 2. She may not have enough information about you yet. You *can* request any of the notes that she took while you were talking with her and they may have more information. I think she's trying to test the waters and float the idea of mental illness in your direction to see how you'll react. 3. You totally don't need to try an SSRI if you don't feel comfortable with the idea. You sound like you're functioning fairly well, so therapy alone may do it for you. Psych meds are more like tools than miracles. They may help you cope with your symptoms and are not mandatory. 4. Getting a second opinion is always a good thing. If you what to and have the means to go to another professional for another evaluation, do it. If you feel like you can cope without the medications, I'd try therapy. CBT is a good start, but other forms may also help you. The biggest thing is going to be finding a therapist to help lead you through this journey. I hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That can happen with medication. Normally, it settles down at the 6-8 week mark. But, if you really feel like you can't take it, talk to your doctor. Sometimes a different medication in the same category will work better for you or cause you less side effects. When I was first put on Anafranil (older antidepressant), I had daily episodes of rage for the first few weeks before my body adjusted to the medication. Now it's smooth sailing in that regard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What you're experiencing has now been labeled "Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome." [Here's a link to more information about it](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants). As for how long the brain zaps last, it seems to be dependent on how long you've been on the medication. Since you were only on it for nine months, it'll probably last for a few weeks to months, getting less severe over time. One of the key traits to distinguish the discontinuation syndrome from another mental illness is that the symptoms will stop fully with taking the medication. The relief typically comes within 24 hours. I hope that your cases go well!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's great when you make strides, but it always seems so delicate and you're always afraid of messing up and sliding back down. You get better at it as time goes on. It becomes less of a constant effort and more of a natural reaction. It's like lifting weights; you will eventually become stronger and the weight of this moment will feel lighter. You'll have missteps and rough times (because of external factors) and that's normal. My big measuring stick is "Is this feeling so important that it's worth undoing everything over?" Most of the time my answer is no. Sometimes, my answer is yes. When it's yes, I give myself some time to calm down and then reassess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The system here *is* really fucked up. Has withdrawal from olanzapine come up? I've never experienced it, but I know it'll make people *really* sick, both physically and mentally. [Here's a link to more information on withdrawal](https://www.withdrawal.net/learn/antipsychotic/). If it *is* withdrawal, then giving her a dose of the olanzapine will "fix" what's going on here. Psych wards aren't the most fun place to be. She'll be separated from you and you'll have to work from the outside to make sure that she's getting the care she needs. Personally, I found that it worsened my condition, but it all depends on the person and the facility. I can't guarantee anything. Some places are great, some places are pretty damn sucky. If you or she has ever been inpatient in a hospital, it's kind of like that but with a lot more locks on doors and more restrictions on what you can or cannot do. [Here's a decent overview of what to take and what to expect.](https://share.upmc.com/2017/05/inpatient-psychiatric-stay/) Some things will happen regardless, like being separated from family members/friends/loved ones (you're not going to be able to go with her). Just as a warning, they may end up strip searching her, so she should prepare for that. It took me off guard on the day I was admitted. They're looking for scars (particularly self-harm scars). I hope she's feeling better soon!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, it's great that you took a shower! Things like that should get a little easier when you get your energy back. From what I understand, with SSRIs you get your energy back before you start feeling a lifted mood. That's why there are all those warnings about thoughts of suicide and such. If someone is deep into that hole, sometimes taking the meds give them enough energy to attempt it before things get better. What you're going through is likely a combination of side effects from the medication as your body adjusts to it and realizing that you may have a worse problem than you thought you have. If you want, calling the doctor that prescribed you the medication wouldn't be a bad idea. They'll have much more knowledge than most of us here do and it's good to keep them updated on effects. But yes, it takes a few weeks for everything to settle down inside your brain. Be watchful for any drastic changes in mood (almost to where you feel like you don't have control) and if that happens, definitely get in touch with your doctor. I hope that everything evens out for you soon and that your treatment will work!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish I could tell you how to fix self hate, but I'm in the middle of it myself. I've found that helping other people has actually been a helpful way to cope. It's a small way of going, "Well, at least I did xyz for someone today." It doesn't have to be big things. It can be as simple as just saying hello to someone or giving directions to tourists or even just holding the door. Try not to start cutting. I know that everything hurts and that pain can feel *really* good, but it makes sometimes it makes it harder for yourself down the road. If you want to feel pain, hold on to an ice cube or stick your hand in icy water. This will cause pain sensation, but won't do any harm. I wouldn't do it for an extended period of time, but it may help to release the same endorphins. If you want to self harm because you want a mark of some sort (like a way to signal to people "I'm feeling horrible" or as a way of externalizing your symptoms), then a marker can be helpful. Again, it won't cause any physical harm, but it'll still allow you that record of your pain. Those are the two most common substitutes. But, if you're up for it, doing something else all together to distract you will also help. Play a video game, color, watch TV, listen to music. Anything that will put some time between your urge and a potential action. Most of the time you'll find that after a while, the urge will lessen. Your body eventually relaxes and stops producing as many chemical signals that create things like panic attacks. I hope that this helps, at least a bit.</TEXT>

It's sadly becoming more and more common for kids to be taking psychiatric drugs. I've heard of *toddlers* being prescribed these things now. ([Here's a medical journal article talking about the amount of kids being put on SSRIs, lowest age was 3.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640815/)) Antidepressants have been used this way for a long while (since around 2000), but more kids are being put on anti-psychotics, which can *really* heck you up because they're more powerful. They're generally used to keep people calm and anti-combative.

I don't know if it actually does anything, but I don't want to go through withdrawal.

Getting used to a new system takes some time especially since the manufacturers seem to constantly be switching controls and button combinations. I can't really answer your question to get the images of people you would let down out of your head.

    <TEXT>That is quite the situation. For right now, you may not want to get drunk or high. It may be best to keep yourself firmly to the ground while you stabilize. Just getting through today is your main goal. Take care of your leg, too. I've had times when I've accidentally hurt myself during a panic, too. It does suck that you do have to go to work while you feel like hell. You have a few options, but I think your best bet is to talk to your therapist and tell him or her what happened if you feel comfortable doing so. You do want to keep in mind that if they think you are a danger than yourself, they may push you to go to the hospital as an inpatient. That *might* help. It will certainly keep you in a confined area and away from physical harm, but it's probably not the best idea if you cannot take time off of work because you could be stuck in there anywhere from a day or two to a few weeks. If you do want to go that route, you'll want to look up the hospital(s) near you to see what kind of services there are and to read reviews. Another option is to tell your therapist that you've been thinking about suicide, but make it clear that you don't have any plans to actually do it. That *usually* hits the right spot between "I'm fine." and "I'm a danger to myself." It's in "I'm not okay and need some help." territory. You don't have to go through this alone.</TEXT>

If you're on the drugs for years then you'll have a harder time than someone who's only taken it for a few weeks.

    <TEXT>I'm sorry that this has been happening to you. What you describe sounds like an anxiety or panic attack. It's basically your fight-or-flight instinct being suddenly activated and your body gets into a very excited, tense state. They can make you anxious about having another one which just feeds back into itself. [Here's some more information](https://moodsmith.com/panic-disorder/). The good news is that they're pretty dang common and there are ways to help get yourself back down to a more grounded state. [This article](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-stop-a-panic-attack) has some of the more common coping methods.

    <TEXT>Part of it is because there are such strong stigmas against certain disorders, even among psych professionals. For example, someone who is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is going to have a hell of a time finding treatment because so few people want to take on Borderline clients. People with BPD are seen as dramatic bothers who will do nothing but back stab, suck up the air, and refuse treatment. Those are just harmful stereotypes. For the most part a lot of it is just trying to get through life while having our emotions set up like a roller coaster. It actually took me a hell of a long time to get help because everyone was like, "You're too *nice* to have BPD!" Pro tip: If anyone else has been seen as "too nice" for a BPD dx and if you've had trauma in your past, try for a Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) diagnosis. It's all the same symptoms, just packaged in a different label. Another disorder that comes with a plane's worth of baggage is Schizophrenia. It's so bad that they're thinking about renaming it. Although, it is nice to have something as tangible to hold as a diagnosis. I know that when I found out about BPD/C-PTSD I was so relieved because it someone else has been though this. I wasn't going it alone anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Try them out, at least for a little while. They can cause some side effects, but those can be helped by either switching to a different medication and/or letting your body get used to the medication. It's going to mess you up less than the alcohol and/or other drugs will. Just keep in mind that they may increase your energy before they lift your mood, so it's good to let a trusted person know you're taking them so that they can keep an eye on you. The worst of it is in the first few weeks. If it makes you feel any better, I've considered doing the same with the police. I never acted on it, but I can understand the thoughts behind it. I hope that this can be a new beginning for you. You're still young and have time to get things in order.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing about this is fair. It's not fair that your family has all but cut you out or that you've been assaulted or that you're living with so much pain. Anyone who's gone through all of that is going to end up shaken by it. I'm sure you've heard all the advice they can possibly give you in therapy. Inpatient treatment can be kind of shit regarding helping you after you've passed through their care. Please excuse me for assuming your gender (you mentioned about being seen as a brother). Did you go over your sexual assault when you talked to professionals? It sounds like you're really struggling with the way that that has changed you. You're not alone in it nor should you feel like you're worthless. And if you *are* a guy, it doesn't make you any less of a man, y'know? It wasn't your fault. If you've tried a few different treatments and they haven't worked, you may be eligible for the ketimine-related medication that's just been cleared by the FDA for treatment resistant depression. I also remember reading an article when they first started researching it that it can also really help with PTSD. And it's supposed to work fast, too. Within a few days. [Here's a news story about it.](https://www.self.com/story/esketamine-for-depression) It may be worth giving it a shot considering that you've been inpatient a few times and have already attempted suicide. Your doctors should have some kind of idea where you can find either that treatment or a ketamine clinic. I hope that something in this message is useful to you.  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, you just told all of us. I can't promise that I'll personally be here to talk to you, but there are usually quite a few people hanging around. I'm sorry you're feeling such an intense nothingness. That void and nothingness is a common symptom of depression called "anhedonia." You're not alone in this. And you're not alone in feeling like you have no future. A lot of people who've grown up with depression have a hard time planning for the future because they don't feel like they'll make it. I had the same feelings when I was your age. I never thought I'd make it to 20, but I'm still here at 26. I'm going to assume that you're from the US just because a lot of people here are from it. Depending on the state you live in, you may be able to seek out therapy or other mental health services without your parents' consent, but in most of them you have to be living away from them. [Here is some information about the age of consent as it regards to medicine](https://www.schoolhouseconnection.org/state-laws-on-minor-consent-for-routine-medical-care/). If you're afraid to talk to your parents about how you've been feeling, or if you feel like you aren't being heard, sometimes it's better to write them a letter explaining how you feel and that you want to seek help. I'm not entirely sure the right way to phrase it, but the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a helpline that you can call to get referrals. [Here's some info on that](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-HelpLine). Another handy site to use is 7 Cups of Tea. It's a mental health focused service where you can vent to someone who'll listen to you. I haven't used the service myself, but I've heard some good things about it. [They have a specific area for teens.](https://www.7cups.com/teen-chat-support/) They're better equipped than I am to walk you through all of this. Finally, [here's a huge list of resources from Mental Illness Mouse](https://mentalillnessmouse.wordpress.com/helpfulresources/). It goes over basically everything you'll need to know about getting help, diagnosis, etc. It's helped me out quite a few times. I hope that you're able to get the help you need.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm currently trapped in the Disability hellhole and it is *so* much work and stress to get on the program. People think it's so easy, but it just isn't. Endless mounds of paperwork, doctor's visits, and interviews. Basically everyone who applies gets rejected and appeals can take a long time. So, don't beat yourself up too hard for not getting it approved. It's *designed* to put you through the wringer. It is good that you managed to find a job where you're not doing customer service. It's a lot easier to modulate when you're not forced to interact with rude and demanding customers all day. You may have already tired or heard about this, but Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can be a huge help in these kinds of situations. It's basically a therapy that helps you wrangle emotions. A good chunk of the therapy is what's called "distress tolerance." Its main focus is to bring your anxiety and emotions back more towards baseline though activating physical senses (touch, smell, sound, etc.). It's best done with a therapist who can help you sort out your emotions more, but the techniques are fairly simple. [Here's some more detail about the techniques for tolerating existence](https://www.sunrisertc.com/distress-tolerance-skills/) when the dark hole opens up suddenly beneath you. Things that you can do are fairly simple like increasing or decreasing your body's temperature and breathing exercises. Personally, I find that making myself cold helps me to bring my focus back to the moment, so during the winter I'll step outside for a few minutes just to get the feeling of the cold air on my face. Then I do breathing exercises. It can really help me to calm down before I do something stupid. If you want/need more information on just about everything to do with mental illness, [here's a huge list of resources that are my own personal go-to.](https://mentalillnessmouse.wordpress.com/helpfulresources/) I hope that you're doing at least a bit better now.

    <TEXT>Even the people who are the toughest still have a breaking point. I think that you're ahead of the game because you recognize the drop and the ways it can affect you. It's a lot easier to get out of that hole when it's three feet deep than when it's fifty. You won't be a bother to anyone if you let them know that you haven't been doing well recently. Letting someone in your life in could make you feel a lot better. You don't have to go it alone. That way, they can also keep an eye on you to make sure that you don't sink too far down. You'd do the same for your friend or your partner, right? I'm sure you've been through the ropes as far as self-harm goes. I find that using DBT skills ([like these](https://www.sunrisertc.com/distress-tolerance-skills/)) make it easier to process my feelings more objectively. Most of the time I try to lose myself in an activity I enjoy, like playing video games or making art. Eventually, the feeling passes for me. It may be good to track what kind of symptoms you're having because they could be caused by something physical going on. PMS is one of the major health things that can turn me upside down (I'm not trying to say it's PMS, but hormones play a huge part in how we feel). I hope that you're feeling more like yourself again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, first off, you are a kickass friend. Just writing all of this up to ask us all must have taken you a long while and it really shows just how much you care for him. The hardest damn part of this is that you can't force someone to seek treatment. I wish that I could tell you the magic words to help your friend see that he \*is\* worth it. This next part of this is hard to say and will be hard to hear: You need to take care of yourself, too. It seems like your friend has had a lot of chances to get the help he needs, but for some reason he isn't reaching out to the resources he has. I've done this myself. I've had all the resources I could have possibly needed, but still refused help. Part of it was because I didn't think I was worth it and part of it was because I kind of liked the pain. I could feel pain on the days when I couldn't feel anything. It's like picking at a scab. It feels unhealthy to be supporting him like this because it is unhealthy. You can't be his only support. Doing what you're doing now is probably unsustainable in the long run and could hurt both of you in the end. Getting out of a hole as deep as your friend is in is hard. It takes a lot of energy and time and understanding to be able to take the steps towards a different future. Your friend may find some hope in the fact that the FDA just approved a new medication for treatment resistant depression. It's a nasal spray that has to be given at the doctor's, but it's supposed to work very quickly. It's possible that the medications that he's on aren't the right ones for him or that he may not be taking them as regularly as he should. Most of the meds we have now take a few weeks to really start working and can raise up your energy before it raises your mood. [Here's a big list of different mental health resources.](https://mentalillnessmouse.wordpress.com/helpfulresources/) I've used it so many times over the years and it's helped in some really rough circumstances. It does have some links about BDD, too. I think some of the links under "Helping a friend" would be a good place to start. I'd also look under "Borderline Personality Disorder" (BPD). BPD gets a horrible rep. Basically, it's a combination of different factors such as emotion dysregulation (mood swings) and a difficulty with interpersonal relationships (connecting with other people). People with BPD are often afraid of being abandoned, so they typically either really latch on to people or push people away. I have Borderline tendencies (not "full on" but the experiences ring true) and the first time I understood what was going on in my head was through memes. Years ago, we used to have motivational animals. One that floated my way was the "Borderline Scorpion." I had to laugh at them because they were \*so\* me and it gave me a lot of hope because the swirling thoughts and emotions actually had a name. [Here are the memes](http://borderlinescorpion.tumblr.com/). BPD \*is\* something that you can learn to get a handle on and it's usually treated with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and medication. [This link is a really good guide for how to support someone who struggles with BPD](http://betterthandarkchocolate.tumblr.com/post/29746668068/ten-guidelines-for-families-partners-and-friends). It goes through everything from trying to get them help to how to put some boundaries and keep your loved one accountable. Even if your friend doesn't have BPD, it's still handy. I hope that this post helps somewhat. I wish you and your friend the best and I hope that he can see in himself the person who you see he is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just keep in mind that psych meds often take a few weeks to get up to start really working. You may feel an increase in energy without an increase of mood at first. So you may feel agitated, angry, or aggressive for seemingly no reason. This side effect should stop within a few weeks. If you have anyone who you are close to and see regularly who you trust with personal information, tell them that you're starting a new medication and ask if they can keep an eye out to see if you're acting weirdly. If you do notice a lot of side effects with your medication, tell your PCP and they can move you to a different medication or help you to safely stop taking them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Abused by Psychologist during ERP</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-19 15:21:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi, this is my first time posting on this particular board. Basically, my main question is how do I try to get help for OCD when I was abused by a psychologist who used CBT and ERP against me? I had hit a low point in 2015 where I was so worried about contamination as it regards to germs. Standard stuff. I was washing my hands a lot and it got to the point where I was spending 4-5 hours a day just on trying to find some relief. I knew that CBT and ERP are considered the gold standard for OCD care, so I went to a well known OCD organization to find someone in my area who did those kinds of therapies. Surprisingly, I did find someone near where I was attending college. Long story short, there were quite a few things that went off the rails during treatment. The psychologist treated me with little respect from the first time I met her. I just figured that I deserved to be treated like that and I went to see her weekly for about six months. I'm pretty sure part of her problem with me is that this hadn't been my first time in therapy. I was diagnosed with mental health conditions when I was a child, so I had spent plenty of time in therapy. When I described the dissociative and depersonalization episodes that hit me when I got pushed over the edge, she told me that I was the one that was causing them and that I should stop. I ended up crying (she rolled her eyes at me for that) while trying to explain that no, I didn't *want* to flip into dissociation and that it scared me. She insisted that it was my own doing and that I could easily stop it. She also wanted me to not read any more about OCD or treatments for it, telling me that the only things that I needed to know is what she was telling me. It was said in less of a "Oh, it's okay, I'll provide you with information" way and in more of a "You will be obedient to *me"* sort of way. The psychologist dumped me into the deep end of ERP, moving from learning my triggers to rummaging around in a trash can in the same session. And though she told me that it could take my body more than two hours for the fight-or-flight response to die down, she wanted me out of her office as soon as my appointment time was up. She seemed to like dropping me down into that void and then kicking me out. Another thing that she liked to do was to prove to me that my thoughts and feelings were stupid and that I was just being an emotional brat. The kicker came about five months into the process. During a time of great stress (university finals) she just left me. I had been having a hard time, but making some progress. That day, I had finals to complete and errands to run. I asked her if we could skip the ERP for that day and she just told me that she couldn't help me and that I would *never* recover from OCD without spending a few months in an intense residential program and taking MAOIs and anti-psychotics. And then she just left me with a "Hope you have a good day!" and nothing else. No referrals, no talk of continuing care or *anything.* Now, that wasn't the end of my downward spiral (I'm doing much better today), but it was enough of a bad experience that it put me off of both types of therapy. Anyone have a similar situation or can think of another way to get around the OCD and live a more normal life?</TEXT>

It doesn't cause any stinging and it works within hours to days. You can apply it whenever you need to.

    <TEXT>I feel you. Being so afraid by bodily sensations and actions can be absolutely suffocating. And since the gut is so influenced by stress, it goes into a feedback loop of not feeling well leading to panicking leading to not feel well. If it makes you feel any better, I'm not having that great of a night myself in regards to being afraid of being ill. It's the worst it's been in quite a few months. If you haven't already tried it, the distress tolerance aspect in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can really help when you're heading towards a crisis area. It's not the gold standard for OCD because it doesn't directly address the obsessions and compulsions, but it can help when you don't have the spoons to battle it head-on.

    <TITLE>What's your "Nuclear Potato"?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-21 13:49:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>What's what you say to yourself when your OCD goes off the deep end and brings up a completely ridiculous theory? Something that is so laughably irrational that it doesn't bother you? Just something that is so out there that even *you* can't take it seriously. Mine is a "nuclear potato." One day, I was making a baked potato and while I was waiting for it to cook I found an news article about how a machine that is used for radiation therapy for cancer was stolen in Mexico and there was a risk of exposure for the people who stole it. My brain decided that it was going to mash this new factoid into my contamination obsessions. It started telling me a theory that somehow radiation from that one specific machine has contaminated my potato and that if I eat the potato I would become ill. Never mind that I: A) Live in Florida, nowhere *near* Mexico. B) The potato was grown in Idaho, again, *nowhere near Mexico.* C) The news story was from that day, *after I had bought the potato at the supermarket the day before*. I started laughing so hard from just how illogical the scenario was that my mom thought that something horrible had happened to me and that I was sobbing. The only thing I could get out was to tell her "Nuclear potato!" Has your OCD ever spat something like that out at you? Something that is so far out of left field that even *you* can be assured that the event couldn't take place?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, okay, I see where you're coming from. Like you kind of want to be like "You know what? I'm going to do this dangerous thing to show myself what *real* fear and anxiety and torment is!" I feel like the throwing self in danger could be a form of self harm and I think it could be a manifestation of self-hatred or self loathing. So tread carefully. But doing things that are a *tiny bit* dangerous to give my body something to react to does make me feel somewhat more in control and calmer for some weird reason. Sometimes it comes in the form of exercising. Sometimes it's me dancing my heart out to a song in front of people. It doesn't have to be *dangerous*, it just has to be out of the normal. I went to art school where formal critique of your projects and ideas is a common thing. Before my final project, I'd get pretty nervous and excited to see what everyone would think of it. My heart would pound and I'd get jittery in a good way. And once it was over and went well, I'd feel *so* much calmer afterwards. I think there could be safe ways to do this. Lots of people like to seek out the adrenaline rush. It shouldn't be a part of the whole OCD thing. Like, using adrenaline inducing activities as an obsession and/or compulsion. Another thing that gets me that rush in a good way is performing on stage. Before I'd go on I'd be bouncing around backstage because of being excited and anxious. So, yeah, I think that maybe embracing good anxiety and excitement may work to help cope with "bad" anxiety. It'd get you used to being in that heightened state without freaking you out. I am not a professional, so I'd take my own post with a grain of salt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was kind of a dick move on the psychologist's part. You can't just dump that on someone and keep moving on. I have periods of derealization, dissociation, and depersonalization where I don't feel attached to myself. I've been having these symptoms since I was a toddler. 24 years later and nothing has progressed into more psychotic features. It's not to where I'm not in control, it just makes me feel weird. Sissociation and the like are very common features with anyone who has been through trauma, especially as a child. In and of themselves, they're not psychosis. You don't sound like you have delusions at all and have a firm grip on reality. Professionals can make mistakes or misdiagnose someone, especially after one appointment. One appointment is nowhere *near* the amount of time it takes to get a full assessment of someone's history and also understand what they're going through today. For example, I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for being a little bit too chipper during a morning meeting while also saying that I have been having depressive and anxious symptoms. Before you try to change everything about your life, get a second opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think anyone in your shoes would be stressed! There may be some resources for new parents through the hospital or clinic you gave birth at. You are not alone in this; *many* new parents struggle with anxiety, stress, and depression. Now, you're saying that you don't actually want to kill yourself, right? What I've learned is that "I want to kill myself" or other thoughts of suicide can sometimes be shorthand in our minds for "I want the stress to stop right now." I've never been a parent, but I've had thoughts of suicide throughout my life. It helped immensely when I realized many of my thoughts of suicide weren't always literally my wanting to die. A lot of the times, I just wanted whatever bad thing that was happening to end. It was helpful for re-framing my thoughts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How far does ERP go? (COCD people may want to stay away)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-08 14:53:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm going to be talking about #2 and issues related to it, so anyone who's really wary of that should stay away.  #8203; I can't afford ERP, but I'm curious to know how far it goes and what it could look like for me. I have issues with going to the bathroom, particularly diarrhea. Six years ago I developed IBS out of the blue and it has dominated my OCD obsessions since then. I'm on a few different medications because of the IBS because the human body is cruel and gut and brain problems can synch up. I'm a lot better than I was at my worst (where I wasn't eating much of anything and was pretty damn sick), but there's a lot of room for improvement. How far does ERP go with these sorts of things? I've been incorporating new foods into my diet (some which I hadn't eaten in over five years). That's been going pretty well, actually, but it really doesn't address the obsession in any headlong way. I would think that it'd focus on expanding my diet more, learning how to listen to my body. But I don't know what the later stages would look like. Since I have problems with diarrhea, would I take laxatives to force my body to have a bowel movement just so I could expose myself to being sick? Just curious if anyone has had something like this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You really don't deserve to be treated like this. I'm sorry you're in this situation because it is *not* normal. Since you're 20, they can't legally force you into treatment unless they have enough evidence to get you committed (going to hurt/kill self or others, etc.). Ultimately, you have the right to full control over your therapy and who you seek help from. I've had the same kind of struggles as you. College was really rough because not only did I need to do all of this schooling work, but I also had to fight the mental illness off. Both of these things are full-time jobs and it's exhausting to try to do both. Talk with your therapist and let her know what is going on. She's already shown to you that she can be trusted. She may give you a smaller fee (sliding scale pricing) or she may allow you to pay off your sessions a little at a time. I know that this is easier said than done when you're financially dependent on them. This could fall under financial abuse, especially if they've done this or something like this to you before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to do something like that and it's still really hard for me to not hurt myself when I'm at my breaking point. It's not a good thing, to say the least. For me it comes from a place where I have a hard time processesing intense emotion. If you're getting this on the regular, it may help to get a stress ball or something to take you energy out on. I find that once that little bit of energy is out things resolve themselves quickly. Those squishy things that are really popular with kids work great to take abuse out on. I figured that out after impulsively sweeping things off of tables. Thankfully nothing broke, but I had to then pick everything up off the ground, which took a bit. Suicidal thoughts suck because it makes everything seem so worthless. I'm glad that you were able to get away from that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish that cannabis was legal where I live (Florida). I used to have a medical card for it, but once I started on the Anafranil in conjunction with the Paxil and Xanax I stopped using it. I mean, it isn't really "good" to be using substances to help you cope, but I found vaping CBD oil was as effective as a 0.5mg Xanax without the grogginess. It's also less addictive (I'm on daily Xanax and withdrawal is too much for me right now). The big thing is that the best treatment is to face your obsession, but sometimes that isn't practical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately, there are few options. You can try getting yourself committed at a hospital as a suicide risk. I've been through that and honestly, it wasn't the best environment for me. There was no one with OCD beside me and most of the people where I was were coming off of drug addiction or alcoholism. There were little DBT sessions during the day, but most people were too zonked out to do much. My experiences are really aligned with writer Norah Vincent in her book *Voluntary Madness: My Year Lost and Found in the Loony Bin.* The first hospital she gets admitted to is pretty much a standard mental hospital like the one I was in. It *will* be a complete and dramatic upheaval of your current life involving rituals because there are little in the ways of accommodation. For example, soap was given out by the attendants and was not available near the sinks in the bathrooms because someone could try to drink it to hurt themselves. Everything is done by a strict schedule and they basically tell you where you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to do at any given time. On one hand it kind of sucks to have all your freedom stripped away. But it was also kind of nice not having to think about what I was going to do. The good news is that they are totally prepared if you go off the deep end and have a breakdown. Tranquilizers are fairly common and your medication will be assessed and reworked. If you checked yourself in and were not admitted involuntarily, you usually have some control over what they give you. When I was there, I refused one of the medications they were trying to set me up on (Topamax, aka "Dopamax") because I had no history of bipolar disorder and the psychiatrist visited with me a total of five minutes. The entire experience didn't do anything for me except make me a little more paranoid around professionals. Resources seemed to be stretched thin. There *are* facilities for OCD specifically, but most of these other facilities are privately owned and will only take people who are insured. Some offer grants, but you'll need special paperwork and be able to jump through hoops. You try to get Medicaid in states that expanded the coverage. Even then, it depends on which company provides the coverage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have! My experience was that I was afraid that food was going to make me physically ill. It all stemmed from a time in 2013 where I was first diagnosed with IBS and a bunch of different foods started to make me sick (for example, anything really greasy, anything spiced, etc.). So I did what anyone would do: started tracking foods that made me feel ill. It just piled up from there until I had a twin disorder between an ED and OCD. If you can nip this problem in the bud now, you're going to be so much better off for it. Mine got to the point where I lost like 150lbs overall and I almost died after about 5 years with eating fewer and fewer things. It almost got to the point where if I wouldn't eat at the hospital, they were going to put me on a feeding tube. At my worst, I was eating a single bowl of Rice Chex cereal a day without milk. And that was it. I honestly don't know how I managed to keep going physically on that, but I was pretty damn heavy before and that was probably oddly a good thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes professionals make mistakes, too. If you're looking at the symptoms and are noticing that you don't have them, then maybe it's time to seek a second opinion. The pros are not infallible. For example, I was once diagnosed with both Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD) and Avoidant Personality Disorder (APD) because I ticked off enough boxes in that general area of a standardized test. I looked at the criteria and I don't meet it. I don't have issues making decisions, am not afraid to express disagreement, and I don't need someone to do all of the caring for me in my life. I was pegged with DPD because I have issues with abandonment. In the same way, I was diagnosed with APD because of my low self esteem, but I don't have any of the anxiety issues around talking to people. You know yourself best. I'd get in touch with your current professional with your concerns about a wrong diagnosis and tell them that you'd like more of the explanation about why you were pegged with OCD.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately. I also get back pains. For me, I've found that whatever gas there is triggers nerves and muscle pains for me. Like, my skeletal muscles cramp up and won't loosen up for a long time. It's bad enough that I've been prescribed a muscle relaxer (Flexeril). If I start to cramp up really bad, I take the muscle relaxer and it stops the pain in its tracks. It is *wonderful.* If you have the same kind of muscle symptoms, it may be worth looking at adding a relaxer in. They may make you really sleepy, though, so it's best used if you're at home. The other thing I've found that helps the muscle cramps is Lidocaine. It's available OTC. I massage some into all of the areas that cramp up and it takes the horrible pain away. It doesn't work as fully as Flexeril, but it's a safer thing to use.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Over six years, IBS has taken over my life</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-19 18:49:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>First and foremost: I *do* have doctors, a therapist, and a psychiatrist. I am getting all of the help that one can get. How do I even start this? Honestly, all of these points could be their own post, but I don't really want to go through it all in detail. I developed IBS one random day in May 2013. Just one day I was fine and the next day I was sick. And it just never got better. Went to doctors, had tests done, no one knows why all of a sudden my body decided to do this. I would get these episodes after dinner every night where my body decided to eject everything that I had put in it. It really hurt near the end as I would be passing yellow bile. It was bad enough that I'd just sit there and cry and sometimes scream with pain and frustration. I began to loathe food. It led me doing a low FODMAP diet on my own to try and figure out the "cause" of my illness. This spiraled into an eating disorder where I lost about 150 lbs and at one point I was living on a small bowl of Rice Chex a day. I was going to college and was busy and I used Imodium to control my symptoms. Anything to keep me off the toilet. Around the same time as the IBS began to develop, I developed severe OCD on top of all of the other mental diagnoses. To put it frankly: I am unstable and a control freak thanks to a difficult childhood full of bad things that I couldn't control. My OCD tangled up with the IBS and soon I was doing things like washing my hands 100 times before I could eat. That took a long time, but it wasn't particularly dangerous. But a few years ago, the OCD latched on to the Imodium and soon I was taking absurd amounts of the stuff. I ended up in the hospital twice because of it and I still went back to it because it has been the only thing that has helped me. I also take Bentyl, but I don't really know if it's working or not. During the hospital visits, I discovered that I could indeed eat some foods and have now a really limited, but looser diet of Bananas, bread, coffee, animal crackers, chicken, rice, raspberries, and grapes. So my eating has improved, but I'm still on the Imodium. I also had a bunch of tests done in the hospital and didn't have any signs of any kind of a disorder like IBD, Chrons, or Celiac. One of my triggers for OCD is having a symptom flare, so I will do *anything* to not have one. So not only are the flare ups are psychically painful, but they turn me into a psychological mess. I am just wondering if anyone here has had *any* kind of experience like mine. I'm going through therapy to help deal with it, but I've never met anyone who had my problems. Also, what is the best thing to put on your anus to make it stop burning if/when you pass bile? For me it's just pure agony.</TEXT>

I hadn't shown any kind of resistance, but I can see why. The strip search caught me off guard. It was like, "Welp, okay, this is happening." Thankfully, I wasn't in crisis, so I had enough wits about me to just go with everything. It would've been hellish if I was actually unstable. I got in there because I went to the ER for a bad leg infection and they asked me if I had *ever* had thoughts of killing myself. Offhandedly. And because the question was phrased like, "Hey hon, have you ever had any thoughts of hurting yourself?" So instead of getting my leg treated, I was sent to psych. When I ended up back in the ER the next day because of my leg infection, I was told that the reason I was held was because I was violent at home and threatened to kill my cat with a knife. *I didn't even* ***have*** *a cat at the time.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tend to be a very caring person, but if someone I loved was in the *ICU* and some toddler or small bopped into the room or was causing mayhem, I would throw what could be called a shit fit. Seriously, if you're in the ICU you're not having a good time to begin with. Everyone is likely to be stressed and at the ends of their ropes. Life support equipment is everywhere. It's downright scary in there for most people. Toddlers should not be visiting people in the ICU. If they are somehow there, then the person who brought them needs to be on top of the kid at *all* times. Children are little disease vectors and chaos making machines, which are *horrible* things to have in the unit of the hospital that sees the most severe and ill people.</TEXT>

I'm actually pissed at myself for not documenting anything because I didn't realize at the time how abusive that patient-therapist relationship was. She blamed me for all of my problems and had no interest in helping me learn how to cope with my OCD and anxiety. She was constantly disappointed in me and I knew that she loathed our sessions. She let me go on for *six months* with her before she suddenly told me I was noncompliant and that she couldn't do anything more for me and that I was to vacate the premises immediately. And because I had gone through abuse and had no self-esteem, I let her do it to me. I was a fucking doormat.</TEXT>

It's just one of those things where it's never really fully admitted because everyone's underlying question is "Well, what the hell is *wrong* with you?" It does sting to see so many people my age who are either in very serious relationships or married. It's expected of us that we start dating in middle or high school and continue to do so until we find "the one." Other routes are seldom heard about. I placate myself with the idea that there are what? Seven billion people in the world? There has to be at least one person out there that's willing to put up with me and my specific brand of bullshit. Normally, I'd try to say something to the effect of "we need to get out there and mingle," but it's a *terrible* time to be trying to date right now with the pandemic and everything. All we can do is really sit tight and wait it out. Easier said than done, I know.

    <TEXT>You know what? I completely understand why you're so distraught. This is a lot for one person to handle. If you haven't already, it may be worth it to talk to your school's disability department. There may be a certain procedure for helping a student who has a certain set of circumstances come up. I've had classmates who've been able to finish their work after the deadline due to losing a grandparent and I was allowed to do so because of mental health issues. The worst they can say is "Sorry, I can't help you." Losing a dog is one of the worst things that has ever happened in my life. It is a very particular hell and there are a lot of people who don't understand it. To not be able to get that closure and final goodbye is heartbreaking and I'm sorry that it's happening to you. Could there be any way for you to give your parents an article of clothing or something that smells of you to maybe put around your dog? The coronavirus dies on soft surfaces in 2-3 days, but scent lasts a lot longer. Would perhaps bathing your dog be an option? The virus is both killed by soap and the soap physically removes the virus from hair and skin. There are also wipes for animals designed to kill germs. Your boss is being an asshole. I don't have a lot of work experience, so I can't give much advice other than maybe take it up with HR. But what he did to you isn't right. I have fewer ideas about the housing issue, though. I know that here in the US there are certain restrictions on landlords because of the pandemic. In a lot of places evictions aren't being done at all. I hope I could be of some help. I really do wish you the best.</TEXT>

ETA: I've tried my best to keep other people at arm's length. If I feel like I am becoming too close to other people, I pretty much just ghost them. I have a lot of acquaintances and know how to make people feel like they're close to me without actually being close. Like, a lot of people know intimate details about me and my struggles, but I don't really talk to anyone on the regular. The people I do talk to really only online or in text.

    <TEXT>Just remember, you asked. ;) I've had varying degrees of therapy throughout my life. The vast majority of it wasn't helpful, but when you're the "troubled child" no one seems to care. I had one therapist in college who was an absolute bitch. So, I was seeking treatment for OCD, but I also have other mental health issues. This was back in the days before I knew that C-PTSD even existed so I had zero idea why I had the issues that I did and felt the way I felt. My first mistake was simply having gone through therapy before. She was just really rude and somewhat aggressive when she found out that I already knew about exposure therapy and all of that jazz. She always acted like she was doing me some kind of favor just by seeing me. She actually made me cry in my very first session with her. She told me that my dissociation and derealization were my choices and that I was the one at fault for having them. I didn't know that they were responses to stress. I just thought I was losing it and she seemed to agree with that. I once asked her if she had any good recommendations as far as books that may help me. She had an entire wall of her office completely filled with psychology books. There had to be hundreds of them. And she just snapped at me and said, "No. You *only* listen to what *I* tell you." The therapist was also very invested in getting me to a psychiatrist and on a completely different course of various drugs. I was already taking Paxil and Xanax at that point and I didn't want to abruptly change medications because I was living alone and I was in the middle of a full semester of school. She started telling me things like I'd never recover from OCD and that the *only* way that I could even possibly get better is if I was in an inpatient facility and it'd take months of work and a lot of drugs to help me. Still, she was the esteemed professional in the area, so I figured that my problems were my fault and she was just giving me tough love or something. I was supposed to be doing exposure therapy, which is something that has to be done in the right way or else it's just traumatic rather than therapeutic. I had to go through her trash bin and handle everything that was in there and then I wasn't allowed to wash my hands afterward. And there was some nasty stuff in there like old food and other things like that. I also had to touch my face and mouth with dirty, nasty hands. Eventually, she decided to give me a big test of all different kinds of disorders. It was like a bubble in test with hundreds of questions. It took an hour just to complete. The results came in two sessions later. I had, in no particular order: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Avoidant Personality disorder with Borderline features, and Dependent Personality Disorder with Borderline Features. With little chance of getting better. There was one session in which she wanted me to do an exposure, but I was in the middle of finals and had a *ton* of work and other chores that needed to be done and that I didn't have the sanity to spare. Basically, if I had done the exposures, it would've screwed with my entire life. I wouldn't be able to get projects done, I wouldn't be able to get groceries, I just didn't have the spoons to spare. Then, about two weeks later, she told me that we weren't making any progress, I was noncompliant with her treatment, she couldn't help me, and that this was the last time I would be allowed in her office. Sort of like "Can't help you, have a nice life!" No sort of follow-up care, no suggestions as to who could possibly help me, just a stern warning to scram. Oh, man, was *that* fun! Let's keep in perspective that I was a model patient. I only spoke to her during sessions, I did all of my homework, I never *ever* bothered her outside of the hour I had to spend with her a week, I was polite, I was always on time, I was agreeable and friendly, I was trying my *damndest* to please her. I tried *desperately* to please her. I ended up seeing this lady for *six months* before I had a breakdown and had to leave college for a while. So yeah, that was the story of how I was mistreated by a psychologist and didn't realize that I wasn't the one at fault until *years* later.</TEXT>

It's one of those things where I'd either have to work three part-time jobs just to pay an insurance premium or be perpetually pregnant to get Medicaid in this Godforsaken state. It means I have to live with my parents because I can't afford any sort of housing. It's... fine. The abuse has (mostly) stopped as I got older. The only thing that drives me up a wall is that I'm still treated like a teenager and am given little agency even though I'm 27. I *was* thinking about going back to college and getting my Master's, but that has been put on hold because of COVID-19.

When I first heard about dissociation and derealization I was absolutely stunned that the sensations had a name and that it wasn't just me who was experiencing them! I lose contact with my body. All sensation, especially touch, is dulled to the point where I have to be careful about what I'm doing because pain won't kick in as it should.

    <TITLE>Confusion Regarding Loving Parents</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-19 18:25:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm fairly new to all of this. I'm sure that this question has been asked dozens of times, but I tried my best to find another post like this and came up with little. Does anyone else find that they're completely split when it comes to their parents? My experience has been two totally different lives. My parents are either wonderful and supportive or terrible and angry. It is either one or the other and when things change they change very quickly. It's enough to give me whiplash. I know that nothing they do is *intentional*, but that's of little comfort sometimes. It's normally peaceful and quiet and everything is fine. But then I get into huge fights with my dad where he becomes verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abusive. He yells, screams, threatens me, and occasionally either hits me or knocks me down. He always feels terrible about how he acts and always apologizes to me after he's cooled down, but he doesn't do anything to stop from doing it again the next time. The rest of the time he's great. He's loving and caring and would do anything for me. We get along well. My mom is the quiet one. When my dad and I fight, she hides. She's done this since I was a little kid, leaving me to face my father pretty much alone. She reappears to assess the damage and to comfort me, but it's too little too late at that point. There is generally a period of weeks to months between fights where everything is normal. I'm always on the alert to react and avoid my dad if he's in a bad mood so that we don't clash. I've always been "the mentally ill one" in the household. My parents don't think that I can survive without them, so they've effectively kept me in an adolescent phase of life even though I lived alone when I was in college. I'm 27, going on 28, and have little autonomy in my life. Has anyone else been just left completely confused by the doublethink? I *know* that the way that they treated me and are treating me is wrong. But at the same time, I feel like I can't live without them and have a hard time staying mad at them. Is this the whole "fawn" reaction? It just feels like I have two sets of parents.</TEXT>

The abuse has stopped, only reprised somewhat when my dad and I clash. I'm a lot better at controlling my responses to him now that I'm an adult and can defuse the situation by physically stepping back. At least we both found this place.

    <TEXT>First, I hope that your tests come back normal. It sounds like you have a lot to deal with already and don't need that added on top of everything. I don't feel like your feelings are irrational. You went through something that no kid should have to go through and had to put up walls and barriers to cope. Having your body examined can be extremely uncomfortable and triggering for people who *haven't* been through CSA. I went through a lot of traumatic medical procedures as a kid and I can't stand having people touch my body in a clinical way. It makes me want to curl into a ball in the corner of the room and cry every time. I went looking for resources and I found two things that might help. This first link is a [PDF intended for doctors](https://www.wcsap.org/sites/default/files/uploads/webinars/sexual_assault_advocacy_healthcare_access_youth_2012_06/getting_through_medical_examinations_providers.pdf) describing what they can do to make a sexual assault survivor more comfortable during procedures. It's useful to know what steps can be taken and what kind of accommodations they can make. Since you're having issues with someone else touching your breasts, they can allow you to do much of the positioning yourself. It'll probably take longer, but you'll be in control. It would be best to contact the office or testing center beforehand to explain your situation. It's something that they should be used to doing and they should be immediately understanding about it. If they're not, you may want to find a different center. Here's [a post with tips for mammograms,](https://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=5936794) written with survivors in mind.

["Self Inflicted Achromatic"](https://youtu.be/6eh39VWPIj4) (TW for suicidal thoughts) works, too, especially with the depression.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>DAE loathe the inner child?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-22 19:44:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>TW: mentions of trauma, aggression, suicidal ideation, self-harm I'm still fairly new to all of this, but the big issue I'm running into is the whole inner child thing. There is an intense and feral hatred for my inner child or child self. Like, it takes me a good amount of self-restraint to tolerate the idea and not rush to metaphorically kill it. I just don't like kids to begin with. I feel almost zero affection towards them. I'm not mean to them or anything like that, but I definitely don't enjoy the time I spend around them. I'm *never* becoming a parent or any kind of parental figure. That's non-negotiable for me, to the point where I won't even consider any kind of romantic relationship with anyone who wants kids or who's on the fence about them. To be honest, I think my childhood ended by the time I was 10. I had already dealt with my father's outbursts, my grandparents dying, dieting and hating my body, physically having an adult body (precocious puberty), self-harm, suicidal ideation, threats of being institutionalized for the rest of my life, taking adult doses of psychiatric medication, abuse from a psychiatrist, being Queer while growing up Catholic, traumatic medical procedures... I've probably forgotten things. Either way, I find the whole inner child thing hard to process because I still blame myself for everything that happened to me. I don't remember a time when I *didn't* hate myself. My earliest memories are of me wandering around, being dissociated and derealized and confused because I felt like I was in a dream. I had to be 3 or so and didn't realize that the dreamlike feeling had a name. Anyone else in a similar boat? ETA: Now that I've really thought about things, quite a bit of it comes from being raised Catholic. From a young age, it was impressed upon me that I had to do the "right" things and be the "right" way. I was taught that evil in the world comes from sin and thus deduced that if bad things happened to me it was because I was sinful and deserved it. It was only further complicated by my realization that I am Bi. Suddenly *who I was* was in and of itself a problem. I was no longer just *committing* sins, but my own love *was* the sin.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-25 15:48:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure the answer is going to be "Yes" on this, but I want to ask anyway. Does anyone else get told that they're too serious or that they're "too intense" for people? I'm always ready to talk about all sorts of serious stuff (the news, politics, religion, science, etc.), but I find that I'm often dismissed. I seem to have a talent for making everything awkward, both online and offline. I can't even count how many threads that I've killed on various message boards, even when I'm *not* being serious. Now, I'm not being inappropriate. I'm not striking up casual conversation with a random person and immediately talking politics. I can read the room and I'm decent at small talk. I like making people laugh. I just don't get topic fatigue when discussing heavy matters. It's just frustrating because I'm always there for people when they need to talk about something serious going on in *their* lives or if they *do* want to delve into a deeper discussion. People come to me for advice. Can anyone else commiserate?</TEXT>

When she was good, She was very, very good But when she was bad she was *awful*. It's a misremembered version of [this poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44650/there-was-a-little-girl). I don't remember too much else. I know that I was dissassociating and derealizing starting from when I was 2 or 3. I kept asking my parents if I was in a dream because I felt floaty and unreal. I also had no idea how to act around other kids because I only interacted with them a few times a month. Otherwise, all my company was adults.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You were definitely abused by your mom. At the very least physically, emotionally, and verbally. What you've been through is not okay and you have a right to be upset about it. Don't doubt yourself on this. You're feeling this way for many reasons and they're pretty damn big, too. It sounds like you didn't get to have very much of a childhood at all. It's completely unfair that you were taught that there was something "messed up" about you. I know what that feels like and it sucks. Just because her spanking didn't leave any marks doesn't mean that it wasn't abuse. It's unacceptable to hit a child and physical discipline has had huge negative impacts on people. Your mom is also gaslighting you by asserting that "it wasn't that bad." She's questioning your reality and planting those seeds of doubt within you. This is a manipulation tactic. The venting about her sexual and romantic relationships to you when you were a kid was not good, either. That's emotional incest. She shouldn't have relied on you for emotional support that she should have gotten from another adult. And, needless to say, her fixation with your body was especially cruel. No one should have to go through all of that crap. We live in a culture that's obsessed with looks and for you to have gotten that harassment from your mom is just cruel. What your dad did to you in anger wasn't okay, either. He was the adult and shouldn't have taken his anger out on you or any member of your family. That being said, I *can* understand what he did. I have a hard time with anger, too, and I have done things that I've really regretted. The fact that he not only apologized sincerely every time it happened and has gotten help for his anger issues can't undo what he did, but it's the responsible and mature thing to do. He should have been there to support you and shield you from your mother. But that's just me making assumptions that he didn't. Either way, it sounds like you have at least a decent relationship with him. I don't have siblings, so I can't really speak on the issue of sibling abuse, but do know that it's something that does exist. I know that kids, especially boys, are often treated with a "kids will be kids" attitude, and that can contribute to people excusing sibling abuse as something that kids just do naturally. There's no one right way to feel about all of this. I know that I have all sorts of mixed feelings about my parents. But that is okay and normal. You're allowed to have feelings. If I were you, I'd keep limiting contact with your mom. She's shown you all your life that she really doesn't care. I'm so sorry that you've had to go through all of this, but you're among people who understand here. Things can get better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hear you loud and clear and have been through something similar with a group of friends. They have good intentions but don't think of the ramifications of their scenarios. Like having a revolution and fighting for what you believe in and all that jazz sounds kind of fun when you haven't been exposed to that kind of upheaval. It sounds heroic and like a movie come to life. My group of friends came to the conclusion that we're not moving fast enough with the way that society is progressing and that the best thing would be some kind of huge conflict. They didn't understand why I hesitated to call for the violent overthrow of the government even though I stood with them in their beliefs. War is not fun. It's not pretty. It's not glorious. It is tragic, profound loss. It is interrupted food and supply lines. It's having to decide which of your patients has a better chance of living because you don't have enough supplies to treat them all. It's being awoken to the sounds of gunfire and explosions and not knowing if you're going to be the next one hit. It's having to live not knowing if a random stranger is going to be desperate enough to kill you to get food. It's so many horrible things that I don't know of because I've never seen war up close and personal. I don't *want* to see it. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that war is not a fucking game. I think that what we're facing in the US is vitally important and it *is* worth fighting for. But that doesn't mean that I *want* to see massive conflict. If we can resolve this through legislation, then let's do that instead. In real life, conflict is less *Call of Duty* and more *This War of Mine*. We've already lost over 100,000 people in the US just to COVID-19. We don't need a war on top of it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I stim a lot, but I know how to make it unnoticeable. I have a weird mish-mash of traits, so I may be somewhere on the spectrum. If I were to be born today, I would have been at least assessed for it. The most obvious one would probably be the happy/excited hand flapping and bouncing. I also get pretty physically bouncy when I'm excited. I sometimes [fingerspell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspelling) words I'm speaking when I'm thinking hard. I try my hardest to limit these movements when I'm around other people, but sometimes it sneaks out. I also have a tendency to display the "raptor hands" (explained better [here](https://overexplainingautistic.tumblr.com/post/168045062854/hi-what-are-raptor-hands-i-see-people-talk-about)) resting position when I stand. It's a very stereotypical posture for autistic people. I do this a lot when I'm at home, but I don't *think* I do it around other people. I toe walk sometimes, too, and fidget a lot. I've used [tangles](https://www.tanglecreations.com/) (a common stim toy) to the point of breaking. I bounce my leg when I'm bored or stressed. I *constantly* bite on my lip or cheek. So long answer short: Yes, I stim. That being said, stimming is normal for everyone regardless of neurotypicality. It's just that neurotypical stimming is seen as more normal. For example, leg bouncing, foot-tapping, pen clicking, and pencil twirling. All stim behaviors, but they're seen as normal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First off, I'm so sorry to hear about your dog. People process grief in totally different ways. Feeling absolutely nothing is often totally *normal* with grief. It's one of those times where dissociation is a typical reaction and is seen in "normal" people. When one of my dogs died, I didn't feel anything at first. It was only after a few days to a week when it finally hit me. This is different from not allowing yourself to feel things. Just check in on yourself a few times a day to access and address what you may be feeling.

    <TEXT>Games have always been a way of escape for me since I was a kid. I honestly couldn't imagine my life without them. Playing a role in video games has helped me both learn about other people and learn about myself. The characters in different games have been an *immense* comfort in my life. Like, right now, *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* really helps to soothe me while the world is just crazy. Nothing really terrible can happen to you or other characters in it, so I feel like I can fully relax and chill when I'm playing. I play *The Sims* in a similar way to unwind. *Harvest Moon* and *Stardew Valley* are also relaxing. And *Minecraft.* I'm also a big Pokemon fan. I got *Pokemon Yellow* for my birthday when I was 5 or 6. I was lured in by the anime originally but loved the games, too. I remember how hyped I was for *Gold* and *Silver.* I still play a lot of Nintendo games in general. On the opposite side of things, playing horror games allows me to purposefully invoke that fight/flight instinct and learn how to better think on my feet and let myself experience what it feels like to be afraid without having to worry about anything actually hurting me. I like psychological horror games better than ones that rely on jumpscares. In that regard, I really like *Layers of Fear* and *Observer. Doki Doki Literature Club* was really messed up in a good way. And *Yume Nikki* and *Ib.* I'd consider these games to be highly triggering and while I personally don't get triggered by them, other people definitely will be. I also really like RPGs, whether they're smaller scale or if they're open world. So I like both *Fallout 4* and *Undertale* a lot. All of them allow me to carve out a safe space to practice and run through different stories. I like games that let me customize the character a lot, but I'm happy to assume the form of a pre-made character. Hell, I even like walking simulators. Or anything that I can either experience or build a story with. The one genre that I really don't touch are MMOs. Games are an escape from other people for me and *having* to interact with other people in real time really dampers things. I have no problem being around other people, but I don't want to let other people down, so I don't play games that require teams. As far as how they have influenced my journey, I've used characters and stories to comfort myself in the absence of comforting people in my life. I've engaged in maladaptive daydreaming when things become too stressful. I'm working on building more meaningful relationships IRL.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dental Trauma as a Child and Getting Treated</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-06 15:13:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>TW: Body horror, medical malpractice, medical procedures. ***This is pretty fucked up.*** My teeth are a mess and I have portions of my gums that are inflamed and have been bothering me since the beginning of the week. I'm probably going to have to see the dentist and get checked out. Problem: I have major unresolved trauma surrounding going to the dentist and really don't trust anyone putting things inside my mouth. I've told the story to a few therapists and they seem to be a little too stunned by the story to really be of much help. I really don't need any advice or anything. Just a recognition that what happened is fucked up. Anyway, when I was about 3, I went to the dentist. The dentist said that he had to pull out my four front teeth on my upper jaw. So all of my upper incisors. The dentist and his assistants kicked my parents out of the room to perform the procedure. I remember being put on a metal table and pinned down with two people on each limb. I screamed for my parents, but they were in the waiting room and couldn't hear me. No one attempted to soothe me at all. In fact, they were angry with me because I was kicking and pushing them away as best as I could. As any child would have done. They tried to put their fingers in my mouth and I started biting. That's when they shoved a metal gag into my mouth and strapped it tight around my face (something like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416vXncE2TL._AC_SX425_.jpg)). Then they forcefully pulled the teeth out without any numbing agent or pain medication. I don't remember how painful it was because I think my mind may have blacked it out, but I *know* that the teeth weren't loose or anything. I do remember that afterward I had these huge sores the size of half-dollars on the outside of my cheeks where the gag had worn on the skin. My parents were angry and were going to sue the pediatric dentist who did it to me, but we didn't have enough money to afford it. As far as I know, the place is still in practice. This would be reprised a few years later when the doctors needed to take my blood. It was the first time I had had it done and was terrified. But they just held me down in the same way and took it. It's a small miracle that I've been to *any* doctor since then.</TEXT>
