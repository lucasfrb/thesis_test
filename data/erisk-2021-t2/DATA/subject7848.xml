    <DATE>2019-04-27 13:56:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been playing this game for about 3 years now. About a year ago when i switched to my Oneplus 6, i noticed that the game doesnt play on full screen. The screen is cut from top and bottom as if i still have huge bezels. Its been so long, so many updates, yet this issue is not resolved. What to do?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. First of all, Congratulations on your new Device. I'm an OP6 user since the day it came out so i'll try my best to help you. First things first, invest in a good case and tempered glass for the phone. This is a glass sandwich, and you dont want it cracking. Secondly, to answer your first question, the latest version of the OS is pretty perfect as far as i've noticed. Recently i was encountering a few bugs, but this update seemed to fix all of them, and the so called battery issue, I've not experienced it yet. As far as Gcam is concerned, the latest version of that works pefectly. I didnt use much of the features. I tried normal pictures, portraits and night mode. All of which seemed to work perfectly. You can just search for the app on XDA forums. As far as recommended apps go, i'll say its a matter of preference and need. I usually set up my home screen in the stock launcher, switch to google photos instead of stock gallery and thats about it. However if you need an app for great wallpapers i'll recommend Creative and Wallpixel. I've been using this phone for a year, and its a beauty. I hope you enjoy your new device. Feel free to ask any more questions :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, I Am from India as well and i have owned a oneplus 6 ever since it came out last may. My phone is still in perfect condition, it doesnt slow down, there are no lags or any issues. however i'd recommend before buying your friends phone, you might wanna check it first. Use it for 10-15 mins, put it to intensive tasks, pubg +snapchat+ facebook+ whatsapp. Ideally, my phone doesnt slow down when all that is open, neither does it load the apps again. So that is what you want to look for. If it works perfectly, then you have a good deal. In my opinion OP6 was their perfect phone yet. I'm gonna be switching to OP7, just because of the snapdragon 855. Hope it turns out to be worth it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly it depends upon how the person has used it over the course of the year. Some people have weird charge cycles where they will either charge the phone every time the battery drops by a few points ot they will wait for it to discharge completely. Both of which harm the battery life. But if he has maintained it nicely, i'd say it'd be at 90% of its efficiency easily, maybe even better You can go to the battery stats, and check thr screen on time, and usage details. That should give you an idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well tbh its gonna be a great switch to OnePlus. You'll be experiencing new things such as the dash charge. The Oxygen Os is just as great as the stock experience on Pixel, but a bit better. Put that along with timely updates, you get an amazing thing. Yeah you're gonna miss the camera on pixel. The OP7 camera is going to be great, no doubt. Definitely better than pixel 2Xl. However not the best in the industry. Its decent if you take pictures now and then, but if you are deeply into photography, you might not like it. Apart from this i can't think of one reason why you shouldn't switch.</TEXT>

Try not to leave your phone on charging at night, with this speed why would you need that anyways. Always keep a cover or skin on the phone, its damn slippery. Apart from that use the phone any way you intend to. Its a beast. Also, Congratulations</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are choosing between the 6 and the 6t. I'd definitely recommend the 6 over the t model First of all you get the so beloved headphone jack Secondly you can get it for a cheaper price. Thirdly you have that amazing fingerprint sensor. Yeah you do get the notch, but then you also get the led indicator and how much can the notch really bother you anyways. I've had OP6 for a year, and honestly. I dont mind the notch anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is one of the most common debates at this moment. Now considering you are looking at the 12gb model of 7pro, price definitely isnt the factor here, so I'm gonna move past that. Moving on the camera, there are various videos out there comparing the camera of s10+ , huawei p30 pro and oneplus 7pro. You can watch them if you like, but in short the 7pro gives competition to the p30 pro, if not outdoes it at points. And p30 pro is the camera king at the moment, so thats saying something. Secondly, softwares. Samsung has never been known for fluid softwares. Even though one ui is good, its no oxygen os. And moreover the system updates. Oneplus is the fastest to give updates, after google of course. Moving on, yeah the motor camera isnt that great. But atleast you get the whole screen to yourself and how many times are you gonna use the front camera anyways. OnePlus phones age the best in the market, even better than pixel phones. And Samsung ages rather shittily. You do get reverse wireless charging and an ip rating. But here you get the 30w warp charger. And the ufs 3.0. it's a lot faster than any other phone using ufs 2.1. These are my opinions, the reasons why i am choosing the 7pro over the s10+ The nebula blue color that I'm getting is just a cherry on the top.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi. Oneplus 6 user here. I have the same pattern, switching phones once a year. I skipped the 6t because of the fingerprint and the lack of headphone jack. However the headphone jack is dead now, almost everywhere. And with the reviews of 7pro saying its fingerprint sensor is amazing. If you ask me, i'd say that if you have the money, go for it. Its definitely an upgrade. Its their best and most complete phone till now. And i dont see why not, apart from the money problem, if you have that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm facing the same issue. So here's my recommendation. Skip the grey. You've always used black/white. The blue on the 7pro is amazing. It's matte and its one of the prettiest colors on a phone I've seen. The almost color is good though, although not my cup of tea. I'd stills say its a nice color. So it comes down to if you are okay with that gold-ish finish. I'm going for the blue variant because i cant bear that gold finish. And also cuz that blue is amazing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm planning to buy a oneplus 7 pro. I'm confused between the nebula blue version and the mirror grey version. The confusion exists that blue is a different color and is pretty cool, but how much does color matter if I'm gonna strap on a case to it anyways. Also if i guy mirror grey rn, i get OnePlus c type earphone free along with some other goodies. Please help me out , also some pics of both the devices will be much appreciated. Update: Guys i went for the mirror grey version as i got approx 100$+ worth of goodies with the phone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Over here there's a popup experience event going on. I got the free goodies over there along with approx 20$ extra discount on the main amount. The nebula is a great color, but there's the issue of compatibility with cases. Not all cases would look nice would the blue color. The grey color is nice, the mirror black was the most appealing part to me. I currently have the op6 mirror black, and that grey still seemed lovely and appealing. I guess it would come down a lot to your personal preference, and the phone you are currently using. But yeah, if you want a phone that stands out from the rest and would like to rock a transparent case, go for the blue version. But if you are like me and would use a protective case, go for the black version.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tempered glass for OnePlus 7 pro</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-04 18:08:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been trying to search for tempered glass for my phone. The flimsy screen guard that comes with the phone had bubbles in it and i had to remove it. After that I've tried 3 different tempered glass and each has the same issue, that there is glue just at the edges and so the screen doesn't work properly. Has anyone found a perfect tempered glass for the phone? Please share some pictures and link for the same if you have. Update: I wasnt able to find anything online so i went to the market and found a tempered glass. The shopkeeper quoted a price of 25$. I bargained it down to 15$. Its one of those uv tempered glass where they put the glue on the screen then apply the tempered and then do something with uv to set it. However it works amazingly, no issues with screen or fingerprint at all. Also this is the only one so far that has worked. It seems to be case compatible as well, using it with the official carbon fiber case right now</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey. I see all those negative reviews and would give you my opinion, being a college student. Go for OnePlus, i swear by it. Its an amazing phone, especially for students. Youtube- full qhd screen done Games- 90hz done Assignments- 6.7inch screen done Getting late and no battery- warp charge done Storage- no issues Slowdown- never Being a college student i dont think there's a better option in this price range. The camera isn't like mind blowing but i promise you, its no low res either. It gives off great shots. Also the price drop could be somewhere around 100-150$ i'd say. There's no telling that. But expect more drop on 7pro than 7t/t pro</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should i switch my Oneplus 7 Pro for Oneplus 8 pro</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-19 18:27:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live in India and have been using my OnePlus 7 pro for almost a year. I was amongst the first people to get my hands on the phone and i have loved it for a year. During the launch event when the prices were revealed i was shocked to see the 8pro being 899$. However today when Indian pricing was revealed it's around 720$. Which is 25$ more than what i paid for my 7pro at that time. This leads to me the question is it worth switching now? I like the specs on the 8pro, the Snapdragon 865, the 120hz screen, the improved cameras. They're all great. BUT, there's that holepunch. There's the issue of a bigger size (i dont want the 8, it lacks a lot). So should i upgrade or stick with this till maybe the 8t pro or 9pro arrives? EDIT- Thank you everyone for your responses. I'm going to stick with my 7pro for the next 6 months atleast, lets see what the T model brings.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>7PRO getting really laggy (anyone else)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-22 19:21:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Its been about a month since I've been noticing my phone slow down. First of all there's the issue that if u restart your phone, you got to press the power button twice for your screen to turn on, the only workaround to which is switching the screen to 1080p. Even moving away from that thing, recently I've been feeling my phone is a lot slow. It's the basic things, I'm using one app, get notification from another, i click on it, and earlier the transition used to be instant, but now it takes like 5 seconds to move from one app to another. At times when i use the swipe back gesure, the white indicator that comes when u swipe back, it stays there until i tap the screen again, sometimes even longer. And the last one is when I'm using my keyboard to type and i swipe back to put the keyboard down, the weird arrow looking icon gets stuck there sometimes for 5-10 seconds making that area non responsive. 7pro has Snapdragon 855, which is by no means a slow processor. OnePlus phones were supposed to be fast and smooth, this is not smooth. I asked around with my friends who have OP7pro, they have been facing similar issues. Anyone know how to fix it? I tried formatting and clean flashing OOS.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Planning to change the ROM</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 21:46:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been using OP7PRO for over a year. Lately, for about 3-4 months I've been experiencing major lags in the phone. Things that just dont work well, lags here and there, glitches and such. Oxygen OS is no longer as refined as it once was. I dont mind bloatware, but the one thing that kept me with Oneplus was the fact that it never lagged. I had a OP5, OP6 and they worked perfectly but recently Oneplus had gone offtrack So I'm planning to switch to a custom rom, but dont know what I dont know much about ROMS. I have heard about Havoc, Resurrection and Pixel experience. I'm also considering the possibility of rooting the phone on Oxygen os or moving to open beta. Can someone who is rooted/on open beta/ using a custom rom share their experience and recommend me what to do? P.S. Your time is much appreciated Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I'm going with Havoc Os.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Op7 pro user here. I've rooted my phone like 10 times in the past 2-3 months to get a good idea of should i or should i not root it. 1) the rooting process is simple, just download all in one tool available from xda store. Enable oem unlocking and adb options in devp mode. Unlock bootloader and root it. All through the software 2) i tried bluespark, kirisakura and elemental ex kernel. Bluspark is the most stable out of all of them. Kirisakura is great but has a few bugs. 3) xxx nolimits is just amazing, makes your phone smoother than it ever was. 4) renovate ice, if available for your model. Make sure to install that. 5) substantrum theming is amazing. Makes your phone feel new and the options are amazing. 6) adaway is great. Almost no more ads on your phone. So why did i unroot? I'm not really sure either. I'm constantly switching between root and unroot. But yeah I'd definitely recommend to stick to oxygen os, because as good as the other custom roms are. The experience of oos is amazing. The gaming mode, zen mode, stock camera, 90fps on pubg, instant pairing with oneplus buds (if you have them). These are just some things that make you stick to oxygen os. Feel free to ask any questions if you have em.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came back to CODM after a while and picked up from Rookie 1. I pushed all the way from there to master 3 but seem to be stuck now. I can't seem to kill people, am confused with the skill to use and can't land sniper shots anymore Can anyone help me with 1) what primary gun to use. I currently use ak117 or pdw at times. 2) which skill to use, i like trickster, Poltergeist and mechanic 3) which is the best sniper and how do i land shots on players at a distance. I was good at sniping in pubg mobile, but sniping in codm seems diff and I can't get a hang of it. I don't care if I can't make it to legendary, master 3 is good for me. But what does matter is that i want to improve my gameplay. Help please.......</TEXT>

Also they're gonna introduce a new "mythic" category, so it's probably gonna be the home to that too. The mythic category as i understand will be upgradable with special attachments, so this might also be the place to upgrade and customise or something like that.</TEXT>
