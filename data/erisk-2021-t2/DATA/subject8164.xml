    <TITLE>Concering OC Jim Chaney</TITLE>
    <DATE>2014-10-12 12:12:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Is anybody else as mad as I am at OC Jim Chaney? I legitimately think it is because of his awful playcalling that we are not better than we are. Not to mention how he decides to change what works at halftime every single game. Honestly, he screwed up at Tennessee, and I think we could do 10x better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With the ending to G-Reco, it has become painfully obvious to me that Tomino needs something whenever he makes a show. You might think it's better coherence or whatever, but you would be wrong. He needs, and I mean NEEDS fifty episodes. This is not the first time I've seen Tomino seemingly rush through something and have time skips all over (*cough* Brain Powerd). It makes you wonder what could have been had he had 50 episodes to work with, or even 43 like the original. That being said, I did enjoy G-Reco. Anyways anybody else feel this way?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Updated Chronological UC Timeline</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-25 21:08:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I once again went ahead and updated my previous timeline. There's been quite a few series come out since then and I think with the release of Twilight Axis, it's time to do this. So if you want to watch the Universal Century in a way that works chronologically, here you go. In this update, I've moved things around, updated episodes, replaced Thunderbolt with the movie series and added a bunch. Still not sure which manga I'd add but if you have ideas, let me know! Also I removed the links because that seemed to be a hot button for people last time I posted this.
