    <TEXT>Ironic. The same crowd that rejects evolution is done in by one of its fundamental forces, natural selection. You can get away with being foolish in a world to some extent, but when diseases like this enter the picture, evolution tends to win out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can attest to the benefits of stretching. That has definitely helped in the past. My knee and foot would probably be a lot worse without it. I'll try to switch up the pace as well. But I feel like this is really a byproduct of not being able to go to the gym and use an elliptical. Before the lockdown, I was using an elliptical regularly and that really helped minimize the strain on my knee. I haven't been able to use one in over a month. I worry that if I push myself, I'll do some lasting damage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's definitely up there. I agree with that. But better? Well, in some ways it is. Certain characters were more developed and refined compared to the 90s cartoon. But overall, I'd still give a slight edge to the animated series. They're still great shows. I love them both, along with Wolverine and the X-Men. But I'll always have a special place for the first animated series because it's what helped get me into comics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a painful question that I think few people ask. I feel like a lot of other shows treat alcoholism as this boss battle that will simply go away once the main character fights it off. There are people in the real world who have a similar mentality. They act like if they stop drinking, then suddenly all the awful parts of themselves will go away. But that's just not the case. That's not how people work and to date, Bojack Horseman is the only show that really goes out of its way to highlight this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Frank can be a sweet, loving man in the right situation. When the world isn't screwing him over, undermining his dreams, or demeaning his well-being, he can be a genuinely nice guy. This scene was a great moment. It showed the kind of man Frank is capable of being. It nicely complements that other scene with Chet in the plane when, as he thinks its crashing, his first instinct is to profess how much he loves Sue. Both scenes give layers to Frank's character and a context to his angry outbursts. It's part of what I love about this show. It has steadily established that Frank isn't just angry for the sake of being angry. He has a reason to be upset with how his life has panned out. His dreams of being a pilot were undermined. His boss is a slob. His kids don't appreciate him. Who wouldn't be angry with all that going on? But at the end of the day, he still loves Sue. He still has some good things in his life and that helps keep him balanced...relatively speaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Once again, Isaac Arthur takes all the complexities of an issue and presents in a way that is wonderfully engaging. He actually presented some key issues that would arise for those who choose to upload their minds to a digital medium. It has some profound implications for our entire sense of being. And unlike some of the other technologies he discusses, there's nothing too radical about this process. It's just a matter of scale and computing power. When it does become a possibility, we'll have to reckon with the idea that a clump of digital code is a sentient being. What could that mean for humanity?

Conversely, when someone disrespects him, namely his kids, he won't be subtle about it. He's a man of extremes. Unfortunately, many of those extremes have occurred on the wrong end.</TEXT>

I don't doubt that the creators of the show have their hearts in the right place, but every seasons seems to do a worse job of portraying real issues. That's really egregious when you consider that shows like Bojack Horseman, a show that has walking cartoon animals, does a much better job addressing those issues than any season of this show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There were points in the show where I couldn't stand Diane. She came off as pretentious and self-righteous to an extreme.

    <TEXT>If you haven't checked out any Dr. Aphra comics, now is a good time to catch up. I've been a fan of her since she debuted in Darth Vader #3. She's a unique character in the Star Wars landscape. She's cunning, witty, and lovably amoral. She doesn't take sides. She just does her own thing and dares to have a little fun while doing it. She's one of my favorite new characters in Star Wars and I really hope she shows up in a movie or Disney+ show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These are all valid concerns. I share them to. However, I do take comfort in the knowledge that Kevin Feige has worked on X-Men before. He got his start on the first X-Men movie. He helped produce the Wolverine and the X-Men cartoon. He knows this franchise. He understands it better than much of the Fox staff did, especially during the early days of the trilogy. That said, putting the X-Men in the MCU at this point would be very tricky. And I don't know how it can be done at this point without getting overly contrived. I also don't doubt Disney will try to package the X-Men and F4 into something they can sell to a wide audience, including kids. But that didn't stop other movies like Black Panther or Captain Marvel from taking on some more mature themes. I think there's room for plenty of creativity, but it'll probably be the most challenging thing Marvel Studios has done to date.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm genuinely curious. Not enough to spend money for another subscription service, but still very curious. I think back to Watchmen and how the director's cut of the movie was much more complete and cohesive than the theatrical cut. The same is true of Dawn of Justice. The longer cut of that movie does improve the plot, pacing, and cohesiveness of the story. This tends to happen to Zack Snyder a lot, it seems. And given how different his style is compared to Joss Whedon, I hope this movie turns out better than what we got.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't like the plot surrounding Emma hallucinating the old Hellfire Club. I also though her characterization was off at times, especially when compared to Kitty Pryde, who really shined throughout the run. I also felt like the final arc was rushed. The way Cyclops went back to wearing his visor just felt a bit contrived. It left me wondering whether there were parts of the story that Whedon had to cut out. Don't get me wrong. It's still a great run. Definitely one of the most defining runs in X-Men history. But it had its flaws. I think if Whedon had stayed on longer and had more time to flesh out his story, it would've been one of the best of all time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like the concept of Emma Frost dealing with survivor's guilt. I'm glad Whedon explored some of her lingering issues, which built on some of the things Morrison did with the character. I just didn't think it was done very well. And when the resolution got rushed, it just didn't have much of an impact. I can also see some of that anxiety you mentioned. I get the sense that Whedon really wanted to do a lot with this run, but didn't have the time or resources to make it happen. He still made the most of it. The mutant cure and Breakworld were incredible. Those stories helped make his run great.</TEXT>

I think if Endgame had ended like this with Steve sacrificing himself, Tony would've broken down. It might have been too much for him, or the audience for that matter. It would've been hard to find some happiness to that ending, which is why I suspect we got the ending we got. At least with that, Steve got a happy ending to his journey.

    <TEXT>I hope you're right. I think for X-Men to work in the MCU (or any medium, for that matter), the concept of being a marginalized group needs to apply. In Ultimate, it just didn't. They weren't marginalized. They were just a failed science experiment that got out. That robs every mutant, including the X-Men, of their humanity and their identity. They become a problem to be solved rather than an issue to be confronted. Ultimate Marvel made many mistakes, but that was one of the biggest. And I hope the MCU avoids that mistake at all costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. Ultron not coming back would only underscore the threat he posed in Age of Ultron. Plus, I think his defeat in that movie was somewhat bland. For such a powerful threat, it seemed too clean cut. Ultron is to powerful and resourceful to let that be it. It's a matter of finding the right story for him to come back in. And I think he would be the perfect threat for a new Avengers team that's still living in the shadow that Tony and Cap still cast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is my reasoning too. She grew up in such an affluent environment that I doubt she'd develop a typical Bostonian accent. Even if she did, I doubt it stuck. And seeing as how her family came from old money, I wouldn't be surprised if they retained that accent, just for the sake of sophistication.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. This was probably the most likable version of Wolverine I've ever seen. In every other medium, he's either just clashing with Cyclops or lusting after married women. He does develop friendships, but only reluctantly. X-Men Evolution changed that. That show made him a true mentor while still retaining his gruff persona. He never got caught up in a love triangle or anything, which I think brought out the best in him. To date, he's one of my favorite versions of Wolverine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely one of Cyclops' best moments. It's the moment where he effectively rebukes the Avengers. They're heroes, they have superpowers, and they're adored, but they've never done squat to help innocent mutants. It was once one of those unspoken flaws in the system of the Marvel universe and Cyclops flat out exposed it. Someone had to do it. I'm glad it was him.

    <TEXT>This movie will always have a special place in my heart. For me, it's one of the best X-Men movies of the Fox era and one of my favorite superhero movies of all time. I get this is not a popular opinion. But I stand by it. I saw Dark Phoenix in theaters the day it came out. It was one of the most satisfying experiences I've had at a movie. Yes, it would've worked best as two movies. That's what Kinberg wanted and I wish he'd gotten that chance. But given the constraints, he really managed to make this work. In a simple, concise story, he showed us how Jean gained all this power, lost control, and used it to save her friends. It captured all the right elements of an X-Men movie. It took moments straight from the source material. And it ended on a hopeful note that ties in nicely with the ending to DOFP. It had its flaws. It certainly wasn't perfect. And it probably would've done a lot better if it had been a two-parter. But I think it worked beautifully in the final product. And I think this movie is going to age better than most expect. Let's face it. We'll never get a movie like this again. Disney would never allow it. They'd never allow a movie like Logan, either. I doubt they'd even let DOFP, given how dark that movie was at times. And even if the X-Men succeed in the MCU, and I believe they will, they'll have that same generic MCU style that has become so common. I think it'll help people appreciate Dark Phoenix even more in the long run. Five years from now, I think it'll be interesting and revealing to revisit this movie and what it achieved before Disney took over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, I am NOT a "FoX-Man Stan." I didn't like the original X-Men trilogy at all. And yes, that includes X2. Wolverine Origins had absolutely no redeeming value. And I thought The Wolverine was incredibly overrated. The point of the tweet you linked was my worry that under Disney, we won't get movies like Logan or even Days of Future Past anymore. We won't get movies that are a different tone than the Disney/MCU formula. Now, I love that formula. I love the MCU. Avengers Infinity War is one of my favorite movies of all time. But I feel like the MCU can't be as bold under Disney. Some of the scenes in early MCU movies just could not happen under the current leadership. And I think that's a shame. Because part of what helps a franchise and a genre evolve are bold variations, like Logan was. And if we don't get any of that under Disney, then I think we've lost something. Please don't claim to know my affiliations based on a single tweet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope you're right. I really do. Because I respectfully disagree about the MCU movies having vastly different tones. I don't deny that every movie has varies. Black Panther and Dr. Strange both have very different aesthetics. At the same time, you can still tell they're an MCU movie. And you can tell they've been somewhat "Disneyfied" for lack of a better word. Some of the content in the early MCU movies would not have flown after Disney bought Marvel. And that's my concern. It's not so much Marvel. It's Disney that worries me. Fox had to take risks with X-Men, often because they really screwed up. Deadpool is a good example of that. I don't think Disney would've allowed those risks if something similar happened with the MCU. And I worry what that means for the future of the genre.</TEXT>

It's a complicated issue that seems to complicate any discussion of related social issues, including gender. I think it's something that warrants a larger discussion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hope not, but I suspect Marvel/Disney will still put its most prominent and popular characters front and center. Like it or not, Wolverine is still very popular. Yes, he derailed many of the Fox era movies, but I suspect the powers that be will want to balance that out in the MCU. They can't just rely on one character to carry the franchise. Not when the X-Men have so many great characters to develop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! This is the banter that the First Family needs when they join the MCU. It's the kind of banter that has made them such an endearing family in the comics. The Fox movies tried somewhat to capture this, but did a poor job. I hope the MCU really puts some effort into capturing the family dynamics of the Fantastic Four. Because at the end of the day, that's a big part of what makes the Fantastic Four great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like this theory. It adds a sort of harmony to how Rey's story played out. I also think it improves it in a major way. I honestly didn't care much for Rey in the first two movies. I didn't hate her, but I didn't think she was that interesting, especially compared to characters like Kylo Ren or Finn. But Rise of Skywalker really changed that. Making her the granddaughter of Senator Palpatine really gave context to her journey. It gave more weight to her decisions and everything she went through. Her becoming the balance in the end just adds a little bit of poetry to the mix. Thanks for sharking this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. I think animation is about to get a huge influx of investment. There's no way this pandemic is ending within the next year-and-a-half. That's going to make live action shows a lot more difficult to shoot, not to mention more costly due to the precautions. I know people who work on movie and TV productions. They've said these new precautions aren't cheap and they're cutting into thin margins. Animation is different. It can be done remotely. Thanks to the internet and Zoom, you can coordinate on a project from afar. Since studios are going to need new content, especially with people stuck at home, animation is the only game in town. We won't see it all at once, but I have a feeling we will see it sooner rather than later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An underrated love story that never got a chance to blossom in the comics. I really hope that, at some point, Marvel revisits this. Mystique's history, as well as Destiny's, has a lot of underdeveloped areas. I think the time is right to bring it back to the forefront.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>X-Men: Dark Phoenix. I honestly don't understand all the harsh criticism of this movie. It did so many things right, especially compared to X3 and the original X-Men trilogy in general. I feel like people decided to hate it before they even saw it, knowing it was the last Fox movie before the X-Men were brought to the MCU. It's really sad because, when you sit down and actually watch it, it's a solid, concise movie with much more re-watch value than most superhero movies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was supposed to be two movies, Phoenix and Dark Phoenix. That's what Simon Kinberg wanted. The first would have Jean become the Phoenix. The second would have her go Dark Phoenix. The Shi'ar were going to be involved. There's even concept art that shows the Hellfire Club. But the studio forced him to change his plans. I still enjoyed the movie. I think it turned out better than most people give it credit for. But I don't deny that it could've been so much more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did! I thought it was one of the best runs on an X-Men comic in the past 20 years. The ending was somewhat weak, but I loved the style, the action, and melodrama. Definitely a book I would highly recommend.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Me too. After all the whining he did about Cyclops forming X-Force, followed by messing with the time stream, he has just completely lost the moral high ground. And he's not even trying to win it back. The way Jean confronted him in this issue is a nice summation of where he stands right now in the grand scheme of things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's an interesting way of looking at it. I can't say I disagree, either. Historically, Logan has always had a messed up moral center. He's no Captain America and he knows that. But at the same time, he understands the world of X-Force. He understands the complexities and moral ambiguities behind it. Given how compromised Beast has become, and all the baggage that Colossus still has, he might be X-Force's best hope for success in the long run. And the past several issues have proven that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I genuinely loved it. Dark Phoenix was, at least for me, one of the best X-Men movies of the Fox era. It was far more enjoyable than any of the movies in the original trilogy. I think it did justice to the Phoenix Saga and nicely capped off Fox's X-Men saga. I get the sense that the hatred surrounding the movie was unjustified. People just wanted to hate this movie before they saw it and looked for any excuse to justify that attitude. That's just textbook confirmation bias. I also think that this movie just came out at a bad time. Avengers Endgame had just broken all those records and Dark Phoenix got wedged into a bunch of other summer movies. It had no chance. I think if it came out in February, instead of Alita, it would've done a lot better and been much better received. That's just my opinion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>General Francis X Hummel from The Rock (the movie, not the man). He takes over Alcatrez, holds hostages, and threatens a city with nerve gas. But the only reason he's doing it is because the government won't spare a single cent to compensate the families of dead soldiers that he led throughout his career. He says in the first few minutes that he tried everything. He even demands that the ransom money come directly from a slush fund that the Pentagon uses to keep the proceeds of its illegal activities. The man didn't look to hurt anyone. He just wanted to get money for the families of dead soldiers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Prince Zuko in Avatar: The Last Airbender. He starts off as a villain. He seems like just some angry kid, at first. Then, as we learn more about him, we find out where he came from, what kind of life he's lived, and what motivates him. From there, we follow him as he struggles to decide what kind of life he wants and who he wants to be. His story is more complex than anyone in Avatar and I've yet to find another character with a journey quite like his.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great moment. Magneto and Red Skull are both great villains, but they're both very different in how they go about it. Red Skull is very much a pure evil, pure hate villain. There's not much complexity to him, but that's part of what makes him so menacing. Magneto is much more complicated. His villainy is a product of the events that influenced him. That makes him menacing in a way that's understandable. The fact that these two can clash and be so effective is what makes moments like this so profound.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I find this funny, but not surprising. Years ago, I attended a Jay and Silent Bob panel and I can attest that Kevin Smith has a hard time censoring himself. He's also hilariously aware of that. That's why he's one of my favorite comic loving celebrities.  #128522;</TEXT>

That took a lot longer than I expected. But I think the extra effort was worth it. I think this show is smarter than people give it credit for. It's not just about Frank threatening to put people through walls. There's a larger message behind the story and that message is worth exploring. Edit: Wow! Thanks for the upvotes and likes, guys! I really appreciate it.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think when asking this question, it's important to remember the time period and the context of the show. Bill Burr has said that the choice to set this show in the 1970s was deliberate. He called it "the golden age of parenting" in which the idea of being a parent was grossly simplified. The idea was that, as a parent, your job is to keep them safe and punish them when they step out of line. Notions of parents being friends or teachers weren't really mainstream. Back then, the idea was that teachers taught the kids. Parents do the parenting, which mainly extended to discipline and protection. Add Frank's own upbringing to the mix, and it's easy to see why he takes his approach. His father took that idea to an even greater extreme. Again, the time period for this show matters. That's why asking this question is bound to get an incomplete answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why is this suddenly NSFW? I see some of the comments have been crude, but is this really THAT sexual? She's basically wearing what Emma Frost wears in the comics. She's not showing anything overly graphic. Yes, she looks very sexy in this attire, but is that enough to warrant the NSFW tag?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, it's definitely worth watching. It's a great iteration of X-Men and one that inspired a generation of fans, including my self. That said, it's definitely a product of its time. Both the animation and story is definitely catered to that of a kids show. It's still solid, more so than shows like Teen Titans Go. So yeah, if you've got Disney Plus, give the show a try. And if you like that show, you'll enjoy X-Men Evolution and Wolverine and the X-Men even more.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would the cancellation of college football in 2020 help or hurt the XFL?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-12 17:27:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've seen this discussed in multiple threads. I thought I'd simplify it here. At the moment, a good chunk of the major college football conferences have either cancelled their seasons or moved their games to the spring. There's still a chance that we'll see a partial college football season this fall. There's also a chance the whole thing will get cancelled, which could do some irreparable harm to college sports, as a whole. I think the latter outcome is a last resort, but one I think could happen if multiple schools get a surge of positive tests. In that scenario, you've suddenly got a large group of college athletes, many of whom do not have a job or much certainty about their scholarships, in need of work. The XFL, and alternative football leagues in general, may never have a better chance to recruit a huge crop of players who want a chance to show what they can do. Many would likely join as a means of getting into the NFL, but many more may just appreciate a paycheck, which is more than the NCAA will ever give them. I'm now convinced that if this pandemic doesn't prompt the NCAA to pay its athletes, then nothing will. It may ultimately benefit the XFL if college football takes a moral blow this year. It's just a matter of how the league structures itself.</TEXT>

Netflix is great, but when they take over, it's not always for the better. They made it work with Lucifer, but they kept the original showrunner. They tried to make it work with Designated Survivor and it was a mess. It felt like an entirely different show. I want to be excited about this. I really do.

At least with FaceBook, it's easier to streamline your feed so that it only deals with people you know. With Twitter, it's too easy for misguided outrage and hatred to spread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love this announcement and this writing team. I've had the pleasure of meeting Kieron Gillen at multiple comic book conventions. He's a really smart, insightful guy. He's great at writing really cerebral stories. I think he's the perfect guy for the job to write Eternals in preparation of the movie. It sucks we won't get the movie this year, but I'll gladly settle for this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, it's not an unreasonable question in the grand scheme of things. After everything they've done, saving the world and becoming these iconic heroes, can they really say they've made a difference? They save the world, but they keep having to save it. They never seem to become more than these colorful icon. Does that do anything to change the world in a meaningful way? It's a profound question and one I hope gets asked more seriously.</TEXT>

He one-shots the Hulk, takes on the rest of the Avengers, and doesn't even break a sweat. This is why he's one of the greatest villains of all time. It's also why this should be the template for Dr. Doom in the MCU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am so excited to see this. I didn't hate the theatrical cut of Justice League, but I could tell that it was a very messy movie. The way the story flowed was just too inconsistent. There were so many other details that felt contrived and forced, which is usually a good sign that there were significant reshoots. I could also tell that this movie tried too hard to set up a sequel. I like the idea of this cut being a full 4 hours of a full vision. This seems to be where Snyder shines best. A lot of his movies get cut up too much and lose their meaning. Movies like Sucker Punch, Watchmen, and BvS: Dawn of Justice, are all great examples. Watch the Director's cut of Watchmen or the Ultimate Cut of BvS. There is a solid, competent movie in there. Snyder does know how to make them. They just keep getting chopped up for theaters. Maybe this is where he's best suited, telling longer narratives for a streaming giant like HBO Max. I think his ability to tell large-scale stories will do well on a platform like that. And I hope this does well enough to warrant more content from him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not the least bit surprised. This kind of hypocrisy has been standard for extreme Christian blowhards, going back to the days of Ted Haggard. But at this point, it's somewhat frustrating. These people preach all this hate, intolerance, and repression, but they never really pay a price for it when they get caught. Seriously, how much does Falwell even stand to lose? Even if he lost half his money, he'd still be rich enough to retire comfortably. And because he hides behind religion, he pays no taxes. It's frustrating. But that's the world we live in, sadly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having just finished Season 5a recently, I couldn't be more excited for the direction of the show. Lucifer really raised the bar in just 8 episodes. And I have high hopes for the next part. It also gave me an idea for a video for my YouTube channel. I've been hoping to do a video about Lucifer for a while now. This felt like as great an opportunity as any. I tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum. I do discuss a few details about Season 5, but no more than we saw in the trailer. I hope my fellow Lucifer fans enjoy this.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not an inaccurate observation. Maze, more than most, gets caught up in other peoples' agendas. Season 5 was no exception. First, it was Amenadiel. Then, it was Cain. Then, it was Michael. That's a pattern, not a trend. But, at the same time, it's not like Maze never has a choice in the matter. Time and again, she has a chance to either go along with someone else's agenda or do something different. She just never does. Some of it is just part of her impulsive nature, but most of it is just someone dangling something she really wants in front of her. It shows, to some extent, how powerless she is at times. Every time she wants something, she's just not in a position to get it. Then, someone comes along with an opportunity and she jumps at the chance. It's frustrating, but some of it is a byproduct of her own choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I know which comics you're talking about. That's why I highly recommended the initial Sandman comics in the video. What Neil Gamin did, and what other writers built on, added a great deal of complexity to Lucifer's persona and agenda. And I think it's because of that complexity that it wasn't incorporated into the show. For the most part, the show keeps things basic and, for a TV show, I think that works. I also think it conveys the necessary themes of Lucifer's unique theology. That's part of what I love about the show and Season 5 really takes that concept to new heights. It gives me high hopes for the rest of the season and for Season 6.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not an expert, but I have worked in IT and I know quite a few who definitely qualify as experts. One important tip they often share is that, when it comes to passwords, sometimes a string of random characters just isn't enough. It's usually better to just write out 10 unrelated words and put some numbers at the end. For example: plane mouse youth TV coal Mark shotgun tiger Glass hammer77 Sometimes, length matters more than complexity. Write it on a sticky note and keep it in your wallet/purse. And if two-factor authentication is an option, use it!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was a good look for her. It gave Cindy a sense of mystery. I wanted to learn more about her. And the more I learned, the more I came to like her. She's one of the best new characters to come out of the Spider-Man comics in a long time. I really hope she gets a shot in the MCU at some point, either in a movie or in a TV series. Her story is unique, but still captures the same themes that make Spider-Man so great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just binged the first three episodes. Overall, I'm loving the direction of the season thus far. With each episode, Homelander becomes more and more terrifying. He's definitely one of the best parts of the show, relatively speaking. I'm also liking how Starlight's story is continuing. You can see her becoming more and more disillusioned with being in the Seven. Something has to give and I think Stormfront will give her that final push. Plus, Patton Oswalt singing totally made my weekend.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I second this. My school started classes at 7:20 a.m. I had to be at a bus stop by 6:30 a.m. I don't care how young you are. You can only be so sharp at that hour of the morning, especially during the winter when it's still dark out most of the time. In all the jobs I've had since high school, I've never had to wake up that early just to go. I can't imagine that's doing any good for the mental and physical well-being of teenagers.</TEXT>

Other classes, not so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like this idea too. I think mental health is a bit less taboo these days than it was when I was in high school, but it's still underserved. I feel like many of the adults in high school, even those who are sincere and well-meaning, have forgotten how overwhelming it was to be a teenager. You're awash in hormones. You're expected to chart your entire life out over the course of four years. At the same time, you have to deal with whatever personal issues you might be dealing with. Things are getting better, but I think there's plenty of room for improvement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadly, this is a very common double standard. And it's frustrating too because, if you're petty enough, you can call any group oppressed, spoiled, etc. Yes, women did suffer gross injustices in the past. Men did, as well. Both still suffer today. Men can still be drafted. I still remember how I had to sign up for the Selective Service in order to get my driver's license. If I didn't, I would've been committing a crime. I have multiple sisters. They didn't have to sign up. Like any politically charged rhetoric, people pick and choose what to emphasize. It's really frustrating, but that's just how confirmation bias works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This show was so great. It felt like a full, realized Marvel universe. I still can't get over how this got cancelled and we got a far inferior product in Avengers Assemble. That show had none of EMH's heart. EMH had drama, romance, and depth to it. Avengers Assemble was just so dumbed down that it was unwatchable most of the time. And if season 3 brought us the X-Men, then that just makes EMH a far greater loss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Beautifully put. I think this conversation was long overdue. They avoided it for too long, but I'm glad Gwen and Peter finally had this chat. Gwen's death is one of the most iconic moments in Spider-Man's history. It's become so iconic that it defines the characters. But that's not the entirety of their story. Their lives had other moments that defined them. This one just hangs over them more than most. It's tragic, but it's also understandable. This sort of thing had to be said sooner. Better late than never, I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your perspective. I know that's kind of broad, but it's an underrated benefit. When you're young, your perspective is so limited. You haven't experienced enough of the world to have a firm understanding of what really matters in the grand scheme of things. As a teenager, I thought getting a C on a test was the end of the world. It's just not. The stuff you think is critical in your youth rarely stays that way when you get older. Life experiences will change how you see things in the past, present, and future.</TEXT>

Bendis has always done his best work when he has one character to focus on, like Spider-Man, Superman, or Daredevil. He tends to not do as well with team books. His run on X-Men proved that. Hopefully, he's improved since then.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd love for this to be the case, but after Tenant's limited box office, I suspect that Disney will delay this movie again. They want to maximize the box office for this movie and that can't happen as long as theaters are still working at a reduced capacity. I think it's going to get pushed back into 2021, possibly January in hopes that by then, a vaccine will be available.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's probably a lot harder than actually working out. That was my experience. But I figured out ways to pull it off. I used to binge a lot on cereal. I replaced that with meaty chili. I also found out that some foods make you less hungry. Eggs are great at that. So, I usually eat one hard boiled egg before every meal. And that helps me eat less while also being pure protein. It took a while to get used to, but it does pay off. And it's the only way you'll see significant results.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I respect both of these guys. They've succeeded plenty in their respective field. But I also think talking about the threat of AI and not offering a possible recourse is somewhat wasteful. I've heard Harris talk about regulations on AI research, but I don't see how that can work, especially when you've got other countries who won't always follow the rules. And while Musk has Neuralink as a possible solution, the specifics are still vague. I think, if we're really going to address the potential threat of AI, a proper recourse has to involve discussions on how we'll align our interests with it. I think that's the only way we'll be able to mitigate any threat. We'll both prosper if mutual benefit the key motivation for both parties.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! I would love for D'onofrio to return as Kingpin. He could definitely play a key role in the emergence of the Sinister Six. I think if Marvel Studios wants to go that route, and I think they do, he would only make that story better.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like Routh. He was okay in Superman Returns, but the story in that movie just didn't work. And he never got a chance to really embrace the role like Cavil did. John Krazinsky is still my first choice for Reed, but if Routh got the part, I wouldn't at all be disappointed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree. This is such a beautiful moment. And it highlights a key component for Kamala's character. She has a loving, caring family. They raised her right. They gave her a strong understanding of right and wrong. And she didn't need to lose them to become a superhero. She just had to be inspired to embrace that role. And this moment with her father is just so perfect. It really highlights Kamala's humanity and heart. It reaffirms why she fights so hard to do the right thing. And you just can't help but cheer her on. I really hope we see a moment like this in the Ms. Marvel show. It would really hammer home just why Kamala is so special.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. The extended version just feels more complete, overall. It doesn't just work Rogue into the story. It adds some extra details that just make the movie more satisfying, in the end. For me, it's the only version I regularly watch. Not saying the Theatrical Cut is bad, but sub-par compared to the extended version.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definitely appreciate this opinion. I love X-Men Evolution too. It really helped me get back into the X-Men after losing touch in wake of the 90s show ending. But the best version? I think that's a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong. He's great. X-Men Evolution is definitely one of the better versions of Cyclops in any medium. But I wouldn't call it the best. The show was largely built around how he and the other X-Men grew into their role. And Cyclops definitely grew into his role with this show. It took a while, but he became one of the most well-rounded characters of the entire cast.</TEXT>

I saw it once and I've never felt inclined to see it again. I can barely remember any major quotes from it.

    <TEXT>People are becoming more health conscious in ways beyond the pandemic. They're starting to understand and appreciate why it's so important to regularly wash your hands. They're also learning the hard way, in some cases, why vaccines are so important and why listening to qualified experts is so critical. Those who have denigrated science, especially modern medical science, now understand the price we pay for that kind of attitude. It can genuinely hurt them, their family, their community, and their country. If one good thing comes out of this year, it should be a greater appreciation for the men and women who make science and medicine their greatest passion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt this is a popular opinion, but I support it. I really liked Storm and Wolverine's relationship, right up until Death of Wolverine. They had real chemistry. They complemented one another so well. They felt like one of the most well-rounded couples in all of Marvel. I really wish Marvel would give them another chance. Given the current status of romance in the X-Books, now is a great time for them to reconnect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! I loved it. It's one of my favorite superhero movies and one I feel got written off for all the wrong reasons. It really captured some of the critical elements from the Phoenix Saga. And Sophie Turner really shined as Jean Grey throughout the movie. It's a much more personal story, compared to X-Men Apocalypse or even the original trilogy. I also think it stands well on its own. You don't have to have seen every X-Men movie before it to enjoy it. It's also a lot more re-watchable than most superhero movies. For this reason, and plenty others, I have a special place in my collection for this movie.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In addition, it was supposed to be two movies: Phoenix and Dark Phoenix. Sort of like what Avengers did with Infinity War and Endgame. That was Simon Kinberg's original plan. The studio made him do everything in a single movie. He just didn't get the money or the resources. And that's a shame. As much as I loved this movie, it felt like it could've been even more epic.</TEXT>

This feels like it could be different. The classics are there, but so are some new faces. If they can both complement one another, then this could be something truly special.  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This video is just a general reaction to the show at this point. The spoilers have been kept to a minimum, but I'll mark it with the spoiler tag just in case. I think after two season, the overall themes of this show (as well as the source material that inspired it) are really starting to come together. The first season did a lot of world-building, but season two really added some interesting layers to the mix. It'll be interesting to see how they expand in the third season. Interesting and probably extremely violent.  #128521;</TEXT>
