    <TEXT>I have dual French, American citizenship so I don #8217;t really have to worry paying for collage all that much since it #8217;s free in France and I have half of my family there but regardless I already am taking AP classes I plan on studying either psychics neuroscience or chemical engineering Still debating on those three but love them all equally. How/where can I look to open a Roth IRA, I #8217;ve heard about it but haven #8217;t really looked into it. If I can contribute 6k a year I think I #8217;ll have some left over money after that since I #8217;m looking for a job and minimum wage here in Hawaii is pretty high + I have no expenses so I will be able to save 100% of my income.</TEXT>

If you haven #8217;t learned how to read sheet music yet it #8217;s better just to bite to bullet and do it, i know it #8217;s hard but it will improve you #8217;re learning 10x but if you want to play right now just to get adrenaline going I #8217;d suggest looking up synthesia on youtube and fallowing along those especially those from amosdoll music there really friendly for beginners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Other then continuing to practice you #8217;re scales I #8217;d recommend just practicing improvising in that key, it doesn #8217;t matter if it sounds good just as long as you get you #8217;re hands use to the shape of chords and melody #8217;s in the key. As for how to improvise since I #8217;m assuming you #8217;re haven #8217;t done it very much try to play some 3 note chords, each note of the chord spaced apart my one note in the scale then in you #8217;re left hand play the scale up and down, once you have that down add a rhythm to you #8217;re playing then in the left hand space out the notes in the scale having small 1-2 note jumps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I feel you bro, I #8217;m 15 and I #8217;ve also been playing for a year and a half and it took me like 8 months to complete my first song which in all honesty was completely my fault by starting way over my head with Turkish March and I didn #8217;t have a set practice routine some days I #8217;d play for hours on end and others I wouldn #8217;t touch the piano for a week. If you want to get better I think you need to practice every single day for 20-30min for at least a month just to get the habit in and once that #8217;s there practicing will become second nature. Once you feel like you #8217;re not progressing as fast up you #8217;re time practicing to 30min 50min 1h 1h30min 2h, I #8217;m currently at 2h. As for what to practice scales, scales and more scales I know it #8217;s really boring but it will same so much time in the long run. along with scales try to learn about theory I #8217;ve heard that people find it boring but I think it #8217;s really fun so just give it a shot also if you don #8217;t know how to read sheet music do that it looks really hard but it makes a lot of sense and it should only take a week or to get down for ways to find songs try MuseScore it #8217;s free and has everything. If you have any more questions about anything else feel free to ask.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you should first get the piano then worry about everything else, it #8217;s like trying to teach someone how to cook without them actually cooking. For the piano personally I use the Yamaha p-125, it #8217;s above you budget by about 40-60$ but if you can afford it you won #8217;t need another keyboard for a very long time. As for resources I #8217;d honestly just stick to YouTube reddit or the internet in general but it #8217;s not structured you can end up wasting a lot of time and given it sounds like you have a life that #8217;s not a good idea so I #8217;d recommend getting the first 2 Suzuki books for piano and once you finish those explore the depths of the internet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say yes get a pedal right away, you only really need one and there like 20$ on Amazon. As for learning start trying to read sheet music off the bat it will take awhile but is saves you and incomprehensible amount of time once you get it down. As of how to learn I #8217;d recommend setting a big goal of what song you want to be able to play so you always have a concrete goal and along the way set smaller goals to get yourself there. There #8217;s lots of stuff about piano learning on YouTube and if you can #8217;t find what you #8217;re looking for you can always come here and ask, good luck :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Recently my best and only friend got into a fight along with her boyfriend, mainly between me and her boyfriend. The fight was over the stupidest thing imaginable, literally over dying In a video game but then it escalated between us two then I complained about it to my friend then he got mad at me saying that I talk shit about him to her behind his back and shit like that which is fair enough. So we stopped contacting each other for a few days until either me or my friend reached out to each ( I don #8217;t remember who started it) then I got into a argument with her stating my I did and said what I did and she explained why he said and did what he did and us being degenerates it eventually devolved into throwing insults at each other, mainly me throwing them and me saying things I wish I didn #8217;t say. Anyways now we haven #8217;t talked in about 3 months and recently she contracted me saying  #8220;I want to talk to you again #8221; but then proceeding to say that I need to change so that wouldn #8217;t happen again which Is almost impossible for me because in that case it was very much provoked. And even if I do do that her boyfriend just rubs me the wrong way and I feel that no matter what I do it will happen again. I just feel like I #8217;m in the titanic sinking and all I have to fix it is half used roll of duct tape and I feel like no matter what I say or do it will just make it worse. Help.</TEXT>

When I was about 13 I started thinking about it more and came to the conclusion I didn #8217;t believe in god so I stopped going to the displease of her saying  #8220;she failed as a parent #8221; so that #8217;s fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Since I #8217;m new, what #8217;s considered a small cap stock? The smallest market cap stock I own is AMD which is at 100billon and reason I bought them is because intel has been struggling with getting their 7nm chips to market and AMD was clearly very close. Once intel announced they will delay there 7nm chips to 2021 maybe 2022 it was like a signal that AMD will be the dominant chip producer until then. I got in right before intel announced that  #8220;which was very lucky. #8221; and now AMD is up over 50% which is kinda crazy but I can see why. that being said I #8217;m trying not to put all my eggs in one basket and I spread out my investments throughout different sectors although it is skewing towards tech since that #8217;s what I #8217;m most comfortable with and  #8220;know #8221; the most about.</TEXT>

Last month I started messaging her and she was acting all high and mighty saying that she wants me  #8220;to learn from what I did and be a better person #8221; and a bunch of self righteous shit like that acting like she knows more then me just because she #8217;s slightly older. Now we #8217;ve gotten over that and have started talking normally but I feel like I #8217;m walking thin ice but ever since then we have been getting into more arguments, 3 since we started talking about that I can remember. For example this week we were talking about the protests and racism in general and the whole time she was talking to me as if I was stupid saying that I #8217;m near sighted never challenge my belief  #8220;which I know isn #8217;t true because I purposely try #8221; and saying that I #8217;m arrogant and always have to be right. Now she #8217;s referring to me as racist, although clearly a joke it #8217;s like wtf why? After all that I just feel like if I continue to talk to her will eventually and enevativly lead to more conflict. I still care about her but I just feel like it #8217;s a pointless effort and I don #8217;t know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some days I wake up and Defacto emotion is feeling null. Through out my day il just be doing hat I #8217;d normally do and I #8217;ll question myself, why am I this? I #8217;m not having any fun even though this is what I normally do for fun. But then I have nothing else to do so eventually I settle for doing the thing I don #8217;t enjoy because it #8217;s slightly more entertaining then doing nothing. That cycle continues until eventually I find myself in bed not because I #8217;m tired but because sleeping will get the day over with faster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also regardless of how I view all religions I can take your same concepts and apply them in any discussion and be right so long as I change the definition of what the conversation is about to be in my favor. Religion isn #8217;t defined by being a good person and being thankful, that idea is ripe to be taken out of context and used as a bad thing to people who say they aren #8217;t religious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And on top of that atheism is the belief that there is no god or supreme deity. If you want to say it #8217;s not a religion but something else #8217;s like a set of beliefs then we could have a real conversation but grouping it along with such different ideological views is unfaithful to giving each side a chance to explain them selfs. Each religion is different, grouping them together as one isn #8217;t fair to any party.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been noticing that every few weeks I go through a period of feeling depressed for a lack of a better word. While I #8217;m in one of those phases I find it nearly impossible to do anything and mainly just lay in bed watch YouTube, barely eat and sleep. The main thing I want to learn how to fix is when I #8217;m in one of those moods I can #8217;t do any school work and my productivity has dropped a considerable amount which sucks to say the least. So I #8217;ve been wondering what is happening and how I can deal with it or stop it all together if possible. If you have any ideas of what I can do to help fix this or what #8217;s going on so I can learn to fix it would be helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I (16) currently have 3 hobbies, piano and investing. I got into piano because when I was little I took piano lessons for about 6 months and I hated it with every bone in my body until I quit then when I was 14 I was like huh I wanna learn how to play that again, by that time I had forgotten everything so I had to restart. Tbh the main reason I started learning piano is because I was #8221;still am #8221; lonely and I hope that if I have skills that make me special eventually someone will care enough to notice me. I got into investing last year because I see everyone in my family complaining about money and I don #8217;t want to be like them + I personally view money as a complex game and usually when I play normal games I min-max them so I want to do the same with money/life and get the highest score possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reason I #8217;m interested in the us is because I live there half the time and that #8217;s my exact point. People outside of the us, I know from experience nobody cares. the usa isn #8217;t what it used to be, it #8217;s no longer the land of opportunity #8217;s and it #8217;s losing it #8217;s hold on being the biggest economy. It #8217;s Heath and social care is a dumpster fire, I mean if I brake a wrist in the us that #8217;s like 6-8k just gone like fml just let me die at that point as where if I break that same wrist in not just France but almost any other country it #8217;s just a few hundred dollars if that. After trump got elected and all the dumb shit he #8217;s done in regards to the Paris agreement, the way he #8217;s handling China trade deals and immigration not even mentioning the shit storm that is his response to the coronavirus *cough*i mean China virus because he can #8217;t even speak English correctly just shows to every other country that is the usa is a joke. + you saying you couldn #8217;t care less about the politics  #8220;in France or where ever you #8217;re at #8221; goes to show you really don #8217;t even care about politics and you just care about the usa which believe it or not isn #8217;t the whole world, sorry to burst you #8217;re bubble. So now please continue as to why the usa is the greatest. I #8217;m genuinely interested, I like to think of myself as fairly open minded so prove me wrong.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why do my dreams feel so real and mess me up emotionally?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-02 06:11:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Oct 1 2020 7:01pm I just had the weirdest and for some reason the saddest dream in my life to the point where even when i woke up i felt like shit. Anyways the dream went like this... I was up on a stage about to perform a concert with two other people one was playing the piano and one the guitar. I felt out of place and uncomfortable + I didn't have an instrument I could play so I was panicking. I walked over to this big white soundboard and i was like AHHHHHH i've never played a soundboard in my life so I started panicking again but then the guy who was playing the guitar to my left walked over to me and reached behind a pile of equipment and pulled out a smaller soundboard with the buttons shaped like piano keys,  #8220;the instrument i could play #8221; and said  #8220;just have fun #8221;. I grabbed the new sound board and tried to accompany the other two. It was going smoothly and then when we were coming to the end the song started to go slow so I played more restrained and quiet then the girl who was playing piano to my right and complemented my dynamics. The song came to an end then the guy said to come over to my house so me and the girl were like ok. Once we got to the house for some reason we were just chilling in the middle of a long hallway when the guy brought out two joysticks and so we started playing games. The first round was the other two fighting each other in a weird all to realistic mecha fighting game that felt like we were inside of it. The girl won so then she challenged me so i started playing and it felt like i was inside of the game, she teached me the controls then killed me the first round and i proceeded to button mash her to death in the second round. After the second round we were back in the house and she was walking out of the hallway and into the kitchen which looked very similar to the kitchen in my house in real life. She then grabbed a chair and sat in the corner and was talking to me and asked can if she could pay a song for me so i nodded and she grabbed a ukulele from seemingly nowhere  #8220;dream logic #8221; then began to play a song and idk why but it felt really nostalgic and i was humming along then the dream ended. For some reason even though the dream sounds fun it felt like it had an air of loneliness so when I woke up I felt/still feel absolutely horrible. On the bright side this is the first dream I #8217;ve had in months where I didn #8217;t die a gruesome death. Even then why do all of my dreams have to feel so real and made me feel so bad when I wake up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(((Person option alarm))) I don #8217;t know much about bit coin but my rule of thumb is if I learn  #8220;key word learn #8221; about a company that I think will truly make a impact I #8217;m not bothered by allocating 10-20% of my portfolio into it. You need to remember nothing you invest in is 100% as airlines and big oil have shown all of us this year and will continue to do so (At least in oils case). The best you can do is try to understand what you #8217;re invested. Personally I have 60% of my portfolio in Tesla which I recognize is very high but that #8217;s mostly do to how much it #8217;s gone up but I #8217;m starting to cut back on it though i intend to continue to have it as a large portion since I truly believe in it. Don #8217;t be afraid of investing in what you believe in as long as you understand it thoroughly.</TEXT>
