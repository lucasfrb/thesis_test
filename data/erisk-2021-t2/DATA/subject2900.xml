    <TITLE>Method to extend Cat5e?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-22 00:51:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, Is it possible to extend a Cat5e cable using a keystone? One side would plug into with an rj45 connector and the other would be punched down. Is there any disadvantages to this? The keystone will be wrapped around with electrical tape to prevent dust build up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, I need suggestions on what HDMI splitter I should use. [This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07211HGDZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_X6DgAb508KQWF) is the best budget splitter I found but in terms of reliability I'm not so sure if I can trust it. I'll be using this splitter to bring in a video feed from the congregation building in my church and into the academy building with eight projectors so the children can watch. Thank you, I apologize if this is the wrong community. If you can point me to a more suitable community I'll be happy to move this post.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best way to send audio over Cat5e</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-25 21:53:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I wanted to use a Cat5e cable to send audio to an amplifier and from there it would distribute out to a intercom system. The intercom system I have figured out, what I need help with, is using a Cat5e cable a good option? Say I have an XLR output on a soundboard and I wanted to grab that audio and send it to the amplifier, what adapter would I use for the Cat5 cable on the soundboard side? Thank you, if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi all, I have a sound mixer and I need to output the signal over a Cat5e cable. I'm using an XLR to RJ45 adapter and I need help connecting the other end. I have an amplifier with inputs that accepts terminal blocks. My question is, on the other end of the cable do I use the wires 7,8 for ground, 2 for negative, and 1 for positive? For the wires 7,8 I would put in the ground hole with both the cables copper touching each other right? Finally, the wiring diagram for the adapter says the wires 7,8 are used for 0V, would the other end of these wires be plugged into the ground hole in the terminal? Here is what pairs the adapter uses and a picture of the amplifier: https://imgur.com/a/wbLQG Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, I'm wondering if it's normal behavior for ISPs to give a router a dynamic IP address when a static IP address is set on the plan. Is this to allow for multiple routers to obtain different IP addresses by manually going into the routers web interface and assigning an IP address?

    <TITLE>Video/audio transmitter and reciever over IP</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-16 22:49:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi all, I'm completely lost and don't know where to look anymore. I'm trying to find a device that inputs a video connection, preferably with a BNC input but it can be anything as long as it meets my requirements. This will be the transmitter. On the other side there will be a reciever which establishes a connection with the transmitter over the network. Now I've seen hundreds of devices like these but all of them work off of multicast which basically floods the network trying to send a signal out to the reciever unit. I'm hoping there's a device where it's IP based and the device sends the signal directly to the reciever rather than flooding the network with packets. I am aware I could also use a managed switch and setup a VLAN for the devices that use multicast but I would not like to go that route if possible. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Cat5e cable dropping connection</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-29 18:13:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I'm dealing with a Cat5e cable that was run above a drop ceiling and is terminated to a keystone jack. The other end was crimped with an RJ45 connector. This cable was tested using a continuity tester and everything was normal. However, the cable cannot connect to the LAN, it seems as if it works for a second and then stops working. What could be to blame for this? It was working for about 4 months, now this happens. The wires on the keystone jack do look a bit loose, will re terminating possibly fix the issue? Could electrical lines that were ran next to the cable also be something that's causing the issues? Thanks. UPDATE: Re-terminating on the keystone appears to have worked like a charm. Thank you for the replies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello all! I have a contractor wiring up my indoor swimming area for an audio system. I came here to you guys in hopes of suggestions on good speakers. The size of the swimming area is not too big, around L: 50ft W: 115ft. They will be mounting four speakers in each corner of the room. I started to look around and found the Dual Electronics LU53PW speaker. Will these speakers in each corner be loud enough to fill the entire area? If not, what are your suggestions for a white speaker that can be mounted to a wall like the one mentioned? The price for each speaker can't be no more than $200 and the speakers need to be passive.

    <TITLE>Cat5e/6/6e bend radius when punching down?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-04 07:02:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey there, this has been on my mind for quite a while now. There are industry standards of how far you should bend a CAT cable but is there anything out there that mentions a bend radius for individual conductors? For example, you strip the jacket of the CAT6 cable, place it in a keystone punchdown jack, and place the conductors into the 110 blades. The thing is, aren't the conductors exceeding a bend radius? In most cases, the conductors are forced to make a right angle bend. I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Proper way to connect two buildings to LAN</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-11 01:52:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello there, a small company I work for has a Cat5e CMR solid conductor cable outside which connects the two buildings together so they're on the same LAN. The cable is completely exposed to the harsh elements outside, the sheathing has cracked open in multiple areas and water has most likely slipped through. I'd like to prevent a future disaster. My question is, how do I properly connect the two buildings using a UTP cable? Fiber is too expensive for this company and they don't have room for a fiber patch panel. I'd like to mention that the cable is running overhead on the flat roof. Would it be as simple as running conduit on the roof and fishing a new ethernet cable through? Any recommendations are appreciated, thanks. EDIT: I'll be using fiber for this project. I asked for the proper way to do it, and you guys delivered. Thank you for all the replies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Happy Tuesday, I was hoping a  #8220;industry standard #8221; method existed when supporting cables. I #8217;ve found a few methods but they require reaching the true ceiling and screwing there. Is there any method that can be used such as J hooks screwed on the drywall partition that sits above the drop ceiling? Here #8217;s a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/5vlb3f/if_you_do_this_or_you_let_your_apprentice_do_this/?st=JR7X3PLU amp;sh=5e4c7f9a) showing a method of securing cable to the hanger wire, which is not a good way to do it according to that post. Also, isn #8217;t it the same as just placing the cable on the tile? I mean, all you #8217;re doing is moving the cable and supporting it to the wire. In the end, that hanger wire is supporting the cable either way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, It #8217;s finally Friday! I had a quick question regarding IP cameras and NVRs. I #8217;ve been looking around Amazon and a few surveillance store sites and haven #8217;t been able to find a budget system (under $1000 for 32CH NVR  amp; at least 10 cameras). Would anyone be able to share what setup/brand of cameras and NVR they use? I #8217;ve looked into Blue Iris and would cost $65 for the full version which supports up to 64 cameras which seems like a good deal. Is this a one-time fee you pay? If anyone has used Blue Iris, does it usually work with most IP cameras? Most importantly, what brand of IP cameras do you think are the best? I #8217;ve looked into HIKVision and some other cheap Chinese cameras. They all have their flaws. This will be setup for a medium size church. Room for expansion will be needed. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello there, we #8217;re planning to install 14 IP dome cameras on the exterior of our office building. The exterior is brick. We #8217;ll be using UTP Cat6 and the cameras will be powered by our PoE switches. The cables will NOT be exposed when outside. Some of the cable runs will be in metallic conduit. The cameras will be sealed with a silicone sealer/caulk. Is there any risk of lightning striking the cameras and damaging our network equipment with this current setup? If so, how does your company/business go about mounting IP cameras outside? I #8217;ve been researching for the past hour and can #8217;t find a solid solution. I #8217;ve read that the lightning will strike the camera regardless but supposedly my goal is to prevent damage to the other network equipment. If the cables are concealed will I have an issue?

    <TITLE>Quality of Cat6 cable from different manufacturers. How do I spot the differences?</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hi there, I #8217;ve been browsing Anixter, CableSupply and other cable distributors to purchase new cable for the office. I know the typical things I should watch out for (CCA conductors, gauge, CMR, CMP, etc). However, most of the cables I found are the same. The only difference is the price and brand. For example, I found [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007GGZ24/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_SkPRCbVSDT351) spool of Cat6 from Tripp Lite listed for $129. On Anixter, I found [this](https://www.anixter.com/en_us/products/PUR6004BU-UY/PANDUIT/Voice-and-Data-Cable/p/CM-00424PND-7RB-06) spool of Panduit Cat6 for $319. There #8217;s an obvious price difference but what factors into the cable price being different? Is it the brand of the cable, specs of the cable that I may be missing? Is there anything on the spec sheets that I need to understand when deciding which cable I should buy?</TEXT>

We will be mounting two 10U hinged IDF racks with plywood backing (fire-rated). What method has worked well for you? I #8217;d appreciate any feedback/suggestions. Here #8217;s an [example](https://imgur.com/a/GOdThIS) of a hinged 12U IDF mounted to a wall with plywood backing. Can anyone tell what the installer did here? Ideally, I #8217;d like the two racks to hold a UPS, switch, and a patch panel. Thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best way to fish multiple Cat6 cables down an exterior wall with foam board insulation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-07 04:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve tried using a fish rod to fish the cable down but the most I #8217;m able to fish down the wall is two cables. I need another two cables, and a switch isn #8217;t an option here. I #8217;ve tried using a long drill bit to carve out a hole but I #8217;ve been unsuccessful in doing so, I believe the drill bit goes sideways when reaching a certain spot. Please note that there is no horizontal stud in the wall, as I was able to get the fish rod down the wall. Are there any other methods to fish multiple cables down a heavily insulated wall? I also tried tying the cables with a pull string and pulling, it ended up ripping the string. Any help would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wall mountable rack recommendations for a non-secured environment?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-08 05:13:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all! I've been having a hard time finding a wall mountable rack that's at least 9U (preferably 12U), hinged, has a cutout in the back (to bring in cables  amp; power), and a solid front door. The best I've found is the [CUBE-iT Wall-Mount Cabinet](https://www.chatsworth.com/en-us/products/cabinets-enclosures-containment/wall-mount-cabinets/swing-frame/cube-it-wall-mount-cabinet/11890-724) by Chatsworth. However, it cost a whopping $734. My employer will only approve a rack $400 or less. This rack will sit in a non-secured environment, it's important that the rack is totally isolated from the outside world. Thank you, any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve always wondered what the proper method is. For example, is option 1 or 2 correct? Option 1: MDF to IDF1, MDF to IDF2, MDF to IDF3 OR Option 2: MDF to IDF1, IDF1 to IDF2, IDF2 to IDF3 Please explain why, I haven #8217;t been able to find a reason online. If one IDF goes down, then the ones that are daisy chained go down. That #8217;s the only reason I have to NOT daisy chain.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello! I spent the last 2 hours trying to fish cable down a wall. I tried the following but I was unsuccessful in doing so: fish rod, flexible drill bit, and fish tape (meant for conduit but I tried anyways). The insulation behind my wall is [foam board](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://i0.wp.com/www.eps.supply/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Foam-Board-Insulation-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-4.2-EPS-HalfBack.jpg?fit%3D500%252C500%26ssl%3D1 amp;imgrefurl=https://www.eps.supply/product/foam-board-insulation-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-r-4-2-eps-halfback/ amp;tbnid=Q9X6ONTUDFJgaM amp;vet=1 amp;docid=cDzh_mgKQoq6QM amp;w=500 amp;h=500 amp;hl=en-us amp;source=sh/x/im) insulation. Does anyone know a good method of running cable down the wall with this insulation? Thank you. Edit: unfortunately, cable raceways aren #8217;t acceptable for this.</TEXT>

The content that will be pushed out will just be ordinary images that the assigned employee will upload from his or her desktop. I have found that a network web page is the easiest solution for the employees, as the only thing they have to do is save the IP on their desktop and login. The webpage should preferably have a security wall with a simple password. This will only be on the local network.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best practices to bring down cable bundle  amp; terminate for a 2/4 post rack?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-23 18:43:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! We just finished running Cat6 throughout the building. Now we #8217;re stumped regarding what the best method is to bring the large cable bundle down from the drop ceiling into the patch panel. Here are a few [methods](https://imgur.com/a/kVQs9O1) we #8217;ve seen before. In one example, the cables come in through a pre-cut EMT conduit strapped to the wall, onto a cable runway and then into a patch panel. In another, no EMT conduit is used and the tile was simply cut for the bundle. To cut to the point, should a cable runway be used? Should we just position the 2/4 post rack next to the wall so the cables just come down? Why should a EMT conduit be used for ceiling entry? Thank you.</TEXT>

Based on the room size, the estimated cost to replace with VCT tile and replace the base cove would be around $120 + labor. I am aware of static concerns but has anyone dealt with this same situation? If so, what should be done? The people in charge only want necessary changes, so I need to give them reasons to replace if needed. Thank you. Update: VCT tiles were installed and sealed/polished. No regrets!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Changing balanced cable (80ft) from Nexia CS to unbalanced RCA?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-31 00:18:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello! We **currently have an** **80ft** **balanced** audio cable running from a Nexia CS output and plugs into a 70V amplifier input. Both sides are wired to euro block connectors. There are currently no issues such as hum/noise, assuming because both sides are balanced. Cable: One positive conductor, one negative conductor, and one shield wire. A request came up that requires me to unplug the euro block connector from the 70V amplifier input and plug into an RCA splitter. My question is: 1. If I were to solder an RCA connector on the cable would I run into signal degradation/hum because the cable would become unbalanced? If so, would [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/634376-REG/RDL_TX_A2_TX_A2_Mono_Balanced_to.html) mono balanced to unbalanced converter eliminate signal degradation/hum? 2. Is there any other solutions/products other than paying $80 for that converter (which isn't an issue if it works)? Thank you, any help would be appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>ATTENTION: All Pickup leads or supervisors! (Please read for your sake)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-16 22:51:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is a suggestion for the Pickup department to allow high volume stores to run more efficiently and to save Kroger money in the long run by allowing an automated system do the job of an associate. If you could please quickly skim over, and if you're onboard, forward this idea to your local division Pickup head. If you have any kind of authority where you could get the attention of the Pickup heads, please forward this to them. The goal here is to get as much attention possible on this suggestion. I work in the Pickup department. As you probably know, most of the Kroger stores, especially marketplaces have upwards of 180 or more orders a day. We haven't had much issues with selecting. However, in my opinion, there seems to be lots of room for improvement for the curbside aspect.  #8203; At the moment, Pickup departments rely on the phones in order for the customers to let us know they are in the lot. Here's a perfect scenario, there's two attendants in the backroom. A customer pulls into the lot, calls the number on the sign, one of the attendants picks up the phone, and both the attendants put the order together in a timely manner. Five minutes later, another car pulls up, and the steps are repeated. There's no issue with this process, for stores with a very small amount of orders per hour.  #8203; **Problem** In our case, we have about 20 or more orders per hour. One of the attendants (usually a lead) will get stuck answering calls throughout the duration of the wave. In other words, Kroger is paying someone to act as a receptionist for 8+ hours. There will be a few customers that call in to make a complaint or ask a question about their order. When this happens, the lead has no choice but to talk to the customer and hold off on the incoming calls from customers in the lot. As the phones are going haywire, another attendant that was working on an order now has to stop and pickup the phone if they don't want frustrated customers asking why the phone isn't being picked up. One of the Best Practices while curbside is to get the customer in and out of the lot as soon as possible (under 5 minutes? - currently not meeting that as customers wait 30-45 minutes), I believe the backroom could run more efficiently if another type of system was in place of answering the phones. This new system I would be suggesting would help free up the attendant standing by the phone for the duration of the wave and better utilize their time working as a team putting the orders together.  #8203; [10 lot parking space with 15+ cars lined up waiting.](https://preview.redd.it/92a42ijt69t41.jpg?width=2100 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=540778656212e2cecde4db6dd5531fabc0f82e07)  #8203; **Rakuten Ready** I can agree that this is useful, for stores with low order volumes. While the attendants have a short break, they can see a customer driving and get their order ready. However, with a high order volume department you can hardly keep up with the cars in the lot as you are constantly preparing orders with little to no break between waves. Also, this relies on the customers to allow the Kroger mobile application to constantly track the customers location. Let's be honest, who wants someone constantly tracking your location let alone a corporation?  #8203; **Suggestion** Create an automated phone answering system for customers to use when parking in the lot. When a customer parks in a spot, they will call the number, and they will be notified of the store location they called (to prevent checking in at a wrong store). They will use their phone keypad to input their order number (this could be as simple as the four digit tote numbers that is used for their order) and the space they are parked in. The monitor that is currently in use by the Rakuten Ready program could be replaced with a program that is linked with the automated answering system and collects the data after the customer places the call. The program would display the customer name, order number, their pickup time, space parked in, bar code for order retrieval and other useful identifying information. As soon as the entry shows up on the screen, an attendant would be able to scan the bar code next to the entry so they can start working on the order. After the order is put together, the attendant will retrieve the paper from the drawer, note the space they are parked in, and use the MPOS to retrieve the transaction. If the transaction was already processed, then the entry from the screen would disappear a minute after the order was marked as picked up (to ensure the attendant has enough time to note the space they are parked in). If the transaction wasn't processed, the entry would disappear after the attendant processes the order while car-side (this would be the ideal scenario).  #8203; **Example** 1. Customer parks in a space. 2. Customer calls the phone number on the sign. 3. An automated phone system begins playing 1. Thank you for calling Fry's Pickup at 1234 Address Ln. May I know the 4 digit confirmation number associated with your order? 4. Customer presses 4 numbers on their keypad (again, this could be the tote number). 5. Thank you, your order scheduled for April 16th at 5:00pm-6:00pm is ready to be picked up. Are you currently in the parking lot at the moment? Press 1 for yes or 2 for no. 6. If no, system will respond with 1. Thank you for calling, have a great day! 7. If yes, system will respond with 1. Great! What parking spot number are you in? 1. Customer inputs parking spot number on keypad. 2. Thank you, an associate will be right out with your order. This could obviously be modified in many ways, there's always room for improvement. Just thinking of the foundation.  #8203; [Example of the automated phone system.](https://preview.redd.it/d4k8oku9oat41.jpg?width=4032 amp;format=pjpg amp;auto=webp amp;s=d1f9af9b2ea16576f026eb149fafd242faa4325e) **TL;DR** I thought of an idea that could improve the efficiency of the Pickup backroom by introducing an automated phone system. By doing this, we could have one less person in the backroom or use that person that was once taking phone calls to help put together orders/select on the floor.  #8203; I need **YOUR** help to make this possible. If anyone knows who is in charge of implementing these technological features, please private message me. For now, the best way to get attention is to keep forwarding this suggestion to Pickup division heads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sigh... Look into voltage and amperage. It is safe to use a power output with a different amperage as long as the voltage is the same. The SRHHG3 or Baymax takes 5VDC through a mini-USB connector. Guess what? The battery bank also outputs 5VDC but up to 3.1A on each USB port. The Baymax only takes what is needed, assuming that the Pilot 2GS technology doesn #8217;t first detect how much amperage to output. Kroger intended it for scales, but the battery bank is intended to charge 5VDC devices. If Kroger doesn #8217;t want lost productivity, we need more Baymax devices or better battery life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would I be able to use a MPX (HD-CVI) PTZ camera as a live stream camera?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-20 07:54:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all, I #8217;ve been looking at PTZ cameras meant for live streaming house of worships and one of the cheapest I #8217;ve found is a PTZOptics camera. We currently have a Canon VC-C50i which only outputs composite video so anything with better quality will do. My question is, will I experience any issues if using a camera like [this](https://www.lorextechnology.com/hd-security-cameras/1080p-weatherproof-mpx-ptz-camera/LZV2925SB-1-p) for live streaming? We can run RG6, two conductor cable, and Cat5 or 6 for RS-485 to this camera. The output will feed into a BNC to HDMI converter (most likely Blackmagic) and into a capture card. Again, quality isn #8217;t an issue here, but I do expect it to be better than the 480p video we have now. What are the pros and cons of using a camera meant for live streaming vs an analog HD security camera?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hate seeing messes like this, years and years of techs doing the bare minimum. I #8217;d purchase a demarc box to house all those coax cables  amp; splitters. (read below) I don #8217;t see how you could utilize MoCA in this scenario as you you would have to have a device on the outside and inside where you would like LAN access. You would need an Ethernet cable of some sort running to the outside wall to connect the MoCA adapters to your LAN. If you really wanted, you could utilize two pairs of MoCA adapters so you could turn a coax cable into Ethernet. To give you the reality, if you have to go out and purchase hundreds of dollars worth of MoCA technology and in return you get 70% or less of the speed of Ethernet, I don #8217;t see any benefit. If I were you, I #8217;d gut all the coax cabling and run brand new RG6  amp; Cat6 to each bedroom and any other area you #8217;d like those cables. All these cables should run back to a central point such as a closet, laundry room, etc. For internet access, you would have to run another RG6 to the outside of your house or keep one cable that #8217;s already ran in your house.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-27 02:22:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example, all the cameras I see in the $40 or less price range is cameras that have Chinese branding like HIKTECHL right smack dab on the front.

    <TEXT>See if you can at least find out where it goes to. You may need it in the future. You can place a blank wall plate where that cable is and push it in a little. It #8217;s just if anyone in the future needs to find the other end. You would usually install low voltage wall plates by cutting out a hole the size of a receptacle but in this case you could just use drywall anchors to secure it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You see those holes at the bottom of your switch? I would simply mount the switch next to your enclosure and plug all the cables into it. I wouldn #8217;t recommend installing it inside your enclosure as it may lead to overheating, if you manage to fit it inside. The cables that are professionally ran throughout houses or businesses in walls are solid conductor cables (one thick copper conductor). These cables are not meant to be moved as often as stranded cables (few small copper wires that are twisted). Stranded cables or patch cables are meant to be moved constantly as they can handle it. In other words, those cables in your enclosure should #8217;ve been punched down to a patch panel (in your case, something similar to a Leviton data module). Since you say everything is working, I would only go that route if you feel comfortable in doing so. For the coax cables, unless you need all that slack, I would try pushing them up in the wall cavity and use Velcro or zip tie to give it a  #8220;finished look #8221;. For Cat5e, untangle them and use Velcro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only real issue here is the ink display blocking the fire exist. I believe the reasoning behind restricting the traffic flow is to prevent shoppers from standing next to each other. Kroger was in the talks of creating one way aisles. I believe this may be an alternative. For example, if you walk through an aisle, you have to keep going straight. There is no room for two carts to be side by side. For the freezer aisles, same idea, you want shoppers to maintain a good amount of distance and those middle displays should help. They also force shoppers to remain on one side of the aisle. The go backs are just a matter of store management not staffing enough employees to put all the items back on the shelves. As a result, a large amount of items pile up front. These displays are strategically placed by the order of people in higher authority than the store management. They do everything for a reason wether it be to increase profit margins or deal with the social distancing that is required nowadays. Have you talked to store management about the display that is blocking the fire exit? I highly doubt that was an initiative by the higher ups. If they don #8217;t comply, you could be a little fussy and call the local fire Marshall.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Based on past experience, can junction boxes be concealed in walls if used for low voltage?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-20 04:56:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello there, Currently in a commercial building that needs some new AV wiring ran. The problem is, where the AV rack is, there is a 1 inch EMT conduit with 5 cables in it. On the other side (which is a drop ceiling), the conduit is somehow a 3/4 with only 2 cables in it (I have confirmed that these are the same cables heading to the AV rack). This is the case for all the other 6 EMTs above the AV rack, they somehow split off. There are drywall cavities where the AC ducts are ran on each side of the walls, could the junction boxes be inside these? The drywall cavities are all drywall, there is no accessibility to them. However, there are a few sections where vents can be removed. Would it be possible that there are junction boxes hidden in these cavities? Is it against code to hide junction boxes used for low voltage cables? Thank you. Edit: In the cavities, there is an AC duct and right below it, there #8217;s about 4 feet of empty space. These cables were NOT ran in the ducts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Biamp (Nexia CS) outputting a balanced signal to an unbalanced RCA signal? (100ft)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-21 05:59:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, We currently own a Nexia CS. Attached below is Biamp's official method of sending a balanced output to an unbalanced input. Can anyone explain why they recommend using the positive and shield terminals instead of simply connecting to the positive and negative? If I follow Biamp's recommendation, should any ground loops be introduced? [Wiring audio inputs and outputs article from Biamp Support](https://preview.redd.it/mbkbsw2w22051.png?width=934 amp;format=png amp;auto=webp amp;s=c96b6a84a90cf807fb1f5d4e377eebe6e16bd113) At the moment, we have to use RCA audio ground loop isolators at the other end to get rid of the hum. Is there anyway the cables can be wired so there is no need for isolators? **My method?** I thought of just sending a balanced signal terminated to an XLR wall plate. From there, connect an XLR patch cable to the wall plate and on the other side it would be plugged into a sound mixer. From the sound mixer, I could use the "tape/CD" RCA outputs to connect to the consumer equipment. Would this also work? **Mono balanced to stereo connection** This has been on my mind for a long time, is it right to connect 2 pairs of conductors to the same euroblock terminals if you want a dual mono or "stereo" connection on the other side?  #8203; I am eager to hear your thoughts. If you have any questions, please let me know!</TEXT>
