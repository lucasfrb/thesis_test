    <TEXT>One of the reasons is that in a war ravaged country once the war ends these planes are not planes any longer but precious resources aka steel and other valuable materials. Those shot down during the war are cannibalized or simply looted by locals and enemy troops. After the war Germany was desperate for any raw material available. Planes, tanks and ships are where the industrial effort went, now they just had to reverse it as much as possible, call it reciclyng. If you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PHILIPPINE SEA (Sept. 16, 2018) - The guided-missile destroyer USS Milius (DDG 69) fires a Standard Missile 2 in front of the guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville (CG 62) as part of Valiant Shield 2018. Valiant Shield is a U.S. only, biennial field training exercise (FTX) with a focus on integration of joint training in a blue-water environment among U.S. forces. This training enables real-world proficiency in sustaining joint forces through detecting, locating, tracking, and engaging units at sea, in the air, on land, and in cyberspace in response to a range of mission areas.

    <TEXT>In fact there is some to it. Seems Hitler got his first official plane in 1933 after becoming Chancellor, a Ju 52 which was named "Immelmann II" after the German WW1 Ace Max Immelmann. When he got the Fw 200 it received the name "Immelmann III" , so there is something along those lines you suggest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right, in fairness they weren't useless in their context if we look at the years they were in service. Taking the Spanish Civil War as an example (1936-1939) many of the tanks in the battlefield were not much better. The Renault FT-17 was still there in numbers while the light Italian tanquettes created much havoc for a couple of years since they mainly faced infantry. The Germans took to Spain mainly Pz.I and Pz.II, the former not much better than a FT17 while they most advanced tanks of the conflict were the Soviet ones, the T-26 being the heaviest and the most modern. Even in 1940 during the French campaign the BEF had many 2 crew light tanks armed with a 1 or 2 MGs, and this was almost a decade later than the model pictured here , which in turn traced its origins to a 1918 design. Poland, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands had little armor and some were just armored cars. So this one was not that bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am really interested in reading some documents on this during Xmas. My perception is this may be down to specific vessel interactions among the crew members. A ship is a very enclosed space, more the old ones like this so contact is far more intense. So depending on the crew believes the blacks may do better or worse I suppose. I still believe segregation was harsh in the Navy. All the navies in the world are pretty class divided with decks and rooms for officers, NCOs and plain sailors all separated so it seems to me a very segregated place by definition. Official USN documents tell an official polite story too pinkish, I found another more objective doc that deal with "non-whites" in general but offer some more realistic scenarios in my opinion (link below) but some extensive reading is require to be honest. Page 12 mid page is particularly interesting. [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a488652.pdf](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a488652.pdf)  #8203; Edit: typos  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pfc. Faris "Bob" M. Tuohy (born 1924) from Ohio, a US Marine with the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Marine Regiment, sips a cup of well-earned coffee alongside his fellow Marines aboard the mess deck of transport ship USS Arthur Middleton (APA-25) after surviving the two day fight for Engebi Island in the Enewetak Atoll, during the Battle of Enewetak. Engebi, Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands. February 19, 1944.  #8203; USS Arthur Middleton history extract for February 19, 1944: "The securing of Engebi went well and mopping up operations were in progress before nightfall. Five Japanese prisoners were brought aboard and the transport also received a total of 76 Marine casualties aboard by evening."  #8203; Like much of the combat in the Pacific, the fight for this tiny island was a brutally violent affair, evident in the expressions and appearance of these three survivors. To the right of Bob Tuohy is Pfc. Stephen Garboski 399460 (born 1921) from Ringoes, New Jersey. He would be killed in action during the Battle of Guam in July 23, 1944, believed to have been a victim of friendly fire from an USAAF aircraft. The unnamed man in the center of the photo is thought to have died on Okinawa in 1945. Bob Tuohy survived the war. He married Ruth Tavenner and according to online records, both are still alive today.  #8203; Photographer: CPhoM Ray R. Platnik  #8203; (Colorized by Fr #233;d #233;ric Duriez from France)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From another Redittor: " The photo is dated May 23, 1944 and the Marder previously belonged to 1. Kompanie, Panzerj #228;ger Abteilung 171 of the Wehrmacht #8217;s 71.  #8220;Kleeblatt #8221; ( #8220;Cloverleaf #8221;) Infanterie-Division. The picture was taken in the Monte Majo area near Cassino. The unit suffered significantly heavy casualties during the fighting at Monte Cassino, nearly to the point of total destruction having barely escaped encirclement, and by the end of May 1944 Panzerj #228;ger Abteilung 171 had lost almost half of its Marders and other assault guns in combat. They moved to the Gothic Line after the Battle of Monte Cassino ended. There are actually several other black and white photos on google which show the same Marder III from a bunch of different angles. Just search the exact panzer unit I mentioned above (including the company) and you should be able to find them. "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They were certainly in a transition phase. But not all of them. For instance newly delivered Grumman Avengers took part in Midway as well as SBD Dauntless, both types becoming the main workhorses of the US naval aviation in WW2. Fighter cover was mainly done by Wildcats that we're still somehow inferior to the Japanese Zero but we'e sturdy models and could put up a good fight with a good pilot. US air superiority began with them.</TEXT>

Italians and Germans had nothing in the single engine type. Only the Japanese counterpart (Nakajima B5N) can arguably be superior to the Douglas one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No he did not, just do some basic wikipedia reading. Since Franco later emerged as the dictator of the resulting regime and stayed in power for 40 years he continues to be blamed for the CW , mainly for ignorance and leftist political view which on purpose mixed it all. Truth is, he was not even in the main plot ring and was convinced to join in the very final hours (literally) when the coup was already in motion. Generals Sanjurjo and Mola were the 2 planners and instigators of the coup. Both died early in the war in plane crashes, lacking these 2 strong leaders the remaining generals settled on Franco. Long story short.</TEXT>

Yes we call them Soviets, I think more using the political meaning than the ethnic one. So I think Russians continued to be Russians under the USSR, but following the above reasoning it could be a Georgian tank for instance. Now is the point when you answer me stating that you're actually Russian and I have no clue about your country history ;C edit: typos</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They all did. In the particular case of the B-24 the pilot manual clearly indicated that they should have it on all the time, and one of the crew members was named the parachute officer (normally the on board engineer). He supervised they were all in good condition, men instructed in its use and how to abandon the plane when required. They all have parachutes BUT in some bombers you could not have it on while flying. For instance the tail gunner in the British Lancaster did not have room enough to have the chute on. It was in a lateral hook behind him. If he had to bail out , he had to pull back from his turret, put it on and proceed to the designated hatch for bailing out. Which brings the question of how difficult it may be abandoning the plane. Having a parachute did not guarantee much. Escaping from a B-25 or a B-17 had to be done through a narrow tunnel. If the plane was "flyable" meaning it glided or kept some sort of steady course you had a chance, but if it was falling even without spinning then bailing out may have been impossible,. The G forces would simply push you to the aircraft walls and you could do much but wait for the impact. edited for typos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very extensive, at least on the allied side, I have seen very few peaks of German ones. That said these balloons were a common sight over London and other British major areas under risk of bombing by the Luftwaffe. Normandy landings, after the consolidation of the beachheads were also plenty of these balloons. Same for landings and strong areas in the Mediterranean areas from Alexandria to Sicily..

    <TEXT>It's more negating the area to airplanes, an area surrounded by balloons would make low altitude bombing impossible for enemy airplanes. So fighter-bombers, single engine attackers and twin-engines light-medium size bombers had a hard time around this. In fact the danger for the attacker comes from the cables not the balloons themselves. Getting your wings or tail entangled in one of those is an almost certain crash.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Many medium/large units were equipped with catapults to launch them. They acted primarily as scouts over the horizon looking for the enemy. Artillery spotter for trajectory corrections was another task. When returning the plane would land in water and hoisted by the vessel cranes for that purpose.

The pic is colorized and may be misleading but the wounded guy seems to have German like pants and straps. It seems to me they got a soviet prisoner and are asking him to help carry the guy to the rear or similar. Unless it has some valuable intelligence it seems unlikely they would try to do much for a wounded enemy in the Eastern front.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On a more serious note there is an interesting mix of features here. On one hand this came up of an aircraft designer placing a lot of importance on hydrodynamics (oversimplifying just see it as aerodynamics in a different fluid) and high speed. The other odd feature is the WW1 feeling of British torpedo coastal boats of the time. Wiki says previous designs were based on captured WW1 British boats most likely during the Russian Revolution of 1917.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given the sailors leisurely watching the fire I assume she is firing on regular artillery support and not in the initial phase of the engagement. "Agamemnon was hit by seven 240-millimetre (9.4-inch) shells in ten minutes on 25 February and was holed above the waterline, suffering three dead. She supported the small amphibious landings of 4 March and participated in another bombardment on 6 March 1915. She came under heavy fire from Fort Hamidieh on 7 March, taking eight hits from large-calibre shells; one of them, allegedly a 14-inch (356 mm) round, blew a large hole in her quarterdeck and wrecked the wardroom and the gunroom. She also took several hits by light shells that day, and, although she suffered damage to her superstructure, her fighting and steaming capabilities were not seriously impaired. The ship also participated in the main attack on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March. This time a 6-inch (152 mm) howitzer battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes; five of the howitzer shells hit her armour and did no damage, but the seven that hit outside her armour protection did considerable structural damage and temporarily put one of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns out of action."</TEXT>

RAF 88 Sqn was part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force based in France in 1940. This was a RAF contingent in France but independent from the BEF. The 88 Sqn was based in Mourmelon. [http://france1940.free.fr/uk/raf\_may.html](http://france1940.free.fr/uk/raf_may.html)  #8203; The 1eme Escadrille du Group de Chasse 1/2 Cigognes if I am correct was based in Toul-Ochey et Laon-Chambry . The unit later moved to Nimes in mid 1940 but that would have been after push by the German advance and the departure of the British unit so Nimes would not be the pic.

    <TEXT>From wiki: "Spitfire Floatplanes (types 355 and 359)  #8203; The Spitfire Vb floatplane W3760 With the German invasion of Norway in April 1940 the RAF took an interest in the concept of using floatplane fighters in areas where airfields were not immediately available. To this end a Spitfire Mk I R6722 was taken in hand at the Woolston factory to be modified and mounted on Blackburn Roc floats. Tank tests were carried out at Farnborough, using a 1/7 scale model, it was found that the concept was basically sound, although the vertical tail surfaces would need to be enlarged to counterbalance the side area of the floats. The end of the Battle of Norway and the need for as many Spitfires as possible meant that R6772 was converted back to an ordinary fighter without being flown.  #8203; With the entry of Japan into the war the concept was revived in early 1942. A Spitfire V W3760 was fitted with a pair of floats 25 ft 7 in (7.8 m) long, mounted on cantilever legs. This aircraft was powered by a Merlin 45 driving a four-bladed propeller of 11 ft 3 in (3.43 m) diameter (3.4 m). A Vokes filter was fitted to the carburettor air intake and under the tail an extra fin extension was added. Other changes included external lifting points forward of and behind the cockpit and a spin-recovery parachute with a rudder balance-horn guard. The Spitfire floatplane was first flown on 12 October 1942 by Jeffrey Quill. Soon afterwards the Vokes filter was replaced by an Aero-Vee filter, similar to that on later Merlin 61 series aircraft, which was extended to prevent water entry, and full Mk VB armament was installed. Two more VBs EP751 and EP754 were converted by Folland and all three floatplanes were transported to Egypt, arriving in October 1943. At the time it was thought that the floatplanes could operate from concealed bases in the Dodecanese Islands, disrupting supply lines to German outposts in the area which relied on resupply by transport aircraft. This scheme came to naught when a large number of German troops, backed by the Luftwaffe, took over the British held islands of Kos and Leros. No other role could be found for the floatplane Spitfires, which languished in Egypt, operating from the Great Bitter Lake. Specifications for the VB based floatplane included a maximum speed of 324 mph (521 km/h) at 19,500 ft (521 km/h at 5,943 m), a maximum rate of climb of 2,450 ft/min at 15,500 ft (12.45 m/s at 4,724 m) and an estimated service ceiling of 33,400 ft (10,180 m).\[nb 7\].  #8203; In the spring of 1944, with the prospect of use in the Pacific Theatre, a Spitfire IX MJ892 was converted to a floatplane. This used the same components as the earlier Mk VB conversions. Jeffrey Quill wrote:  #8203; The Spitfire IX on floats was faster than the standard Hurricane. Its handling on the water was extremely good and its only unusual feature was a tendency to "tramp" from side to side on the floats, or to "waddle" a bit when at high speed in the plane.  #8203; Soon after testing started the idea of using floatplane fighters was dropped and MJ982 was converted back to a landplane.  #8203; Five aircraft were converted:  #8203; Mk I  #8211; R6722 F Mk Vb  #8211; W3760 Mk V  #8211; EP751 and EP754 Mk IXb  #8211; MJ892 "</TEXT>

Wounded (on their own as you can imagine) or ferry a very specific person to a troubled position. From the wiki: " Standard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light. "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a legit question, Barrage balloons, those would go up over the beaches. They basically negate a portion of airspace to planes (enemy). Attached to the ships in the beach with long cables enemy planes could not risk hit one or get entangled in the cables. They were extensively used over cities and important areas as a deterrent method against aircraft.

    <TEXT>" On April 22, 1944, the USS Texas reached the estuary of Clyde in Scotland where it remains awaiting Operation Overlord. During Operation Neptune, USS Texas is designated as the flagship of the bombing force at [Omaha Beach](https://www.dday-overlord.com/en/d-day/beaches/omaha-beach). On June 6, 1944 at 3 o #8217;clock in the morning, it reached its position 11 kilometers off [Pointe du Hoc](https://www.dday-overlord.com/en/d-day/beaches/pointe-du-hoc). The bombardment begins at 5:50 am: 255 360-mm shells are fired for 34 minutes at the positions of the German battery. At the same time, the 127 mm pieces opened fire on the Dog one exit in Vierville-sur-Mer. The German resistance is such that Texas is obliged to approach 2.7 kilometers from the shore only to silence the German defenses on the western outskirts of Vierville. The day after D-Day, it sent two [LCVP](https://www.dday-overlord.com/en/material/warships/landing-craft/lcvp)s filled with ammunition to the Rangers, isolated at the top of Pointe du Hoc. 35 wounded are evacuated aboard the boats (as well as prisoners) and a Ranger dies as a result of its injuries aboard Texas. During the day it opened fire on German positions at Formigny and Tr #233;vi #232;res. On June 8, it shot in the direction of Isigny, Maisy #8217;s battery and again on Trevi #232;res. After a refueling in England, the USS Texas returns off Normandy on June 11, supporting with its fires the progression of the American land forces until June 16. On the 25th, in Task Group 129.2, it bombed the German batteries defending access to the port of Cherbourg, in particular the battery Hamburg: at 12.33 pm, it was taken under German fire and hit at 13.16. A sailor is killed, ten are wounded, the material damage is light. At 1447, a shell penetrates the building but does not explode. It leaves the area at 3 pm."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They had both, MGs and Flak cannons, but you use what come handy and is available. This Russian MG is the counter part of the American 0.5" Browning (12.70 mm), the Russian is a 12.70 also but the cartridge is a bit longer, 12.70x108 mm vs the US 12.70x99 mm. Overall MGs are a inferior for AA purposes mainly because the range and smaller caliber. A flak gun like the Oerlikon or Bofors in 20 mm and 40 mm have a longer range -so they can engage planes earlier - and pack more power and explosive in the shell. On the con side these are heavier and more cumbersome to drag around.</TEXT>

Normally you do not call in Strategic bombers for that although there are cases when you throw in all you have. For instance during the Vietnam war, in the last days of the war, before the fall of Saigon, B-52s were called in to do this same thing in support of South Vietnamese units defending the roads to Saigon and avoid being overrun by armored units of the North Vietnamese Army.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think overall there is a feeling that the US has lost it's credibility in the international arena. Most Europeans consider they have wasted their reputation, and that generation we talk about in this sub is just history. The US has not lived up to that std for a while now. Worth noting that like anything else is also an idealized generation in some aspects. Things like segregation were well built into the US society including the Armed Forces. But every nation has its dark side of history.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wiki et all: "PBJ-1D Similar to the B-25D for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, it differed in having a single .50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun in the tail turret and waist gun positions similar to the B-25H. Often it was fitted with airborne search radar and used in the antisubmarine role." "Operational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1's began in March 1944. The Marine PBJ's operated from the Philippines, Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long range interdiction of enemy shipping that was trying to run the blockade which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried on underwing racks. Many of the PBJ-1C and PBJ-1D versions carried a rather ugly, bulbous antenna for an APS-3 search radar sticking out of the upper part of the transparent nose. On the PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J, the APS-3 search radar antenna was usually housed inside a ventral or wingtip radome. Some PBJ-1J's had their top turrets removed to save weight, especially toward the end of the war when Japanese fighters had become relatively scarce."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very nice explanation, thank you. One of the things that has always puzzled me is why most nations never realize the autogyro potential for things missions ASW and rescue (and transport). I know some real helicopters were used for this in Burma but there is a whole potential in all theaters. Low speed and considerable STOL capabilities made them a very useful tool, even with limited short ranges and payloads.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, however I must admit it is well crafted, the mount and the whole system seems pretty well made and mechanized. They took the effort to do it properly, the effectiveness however is probably null, more subjected to chance than anything else. In those days planes were very slow and got very close to each other in combat, this thing seems to be designed to fire all pistols at once, like a shotgun, so there is always some chance that 1 bullet will make it to the right spot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to wiki: " ## Surviving examples[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_VIII_tank amp;action=edit amp;section=7)] * A Liberty tank survives at [Fort Meade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_George_G._Meade) in [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland). The tank is displayed in the Post Museum and was made in 1920 at the Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. It was assigned to the 301st Tank Battalion (Heavy), later redesignated the 17th Tank Battalion (Heavy). Throughout most of 1921 #8211;1922, Major [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) commanded this unit. * A second American Liberty tank was at the [Aberdeen Proving Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Proving_Ground) in [Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen), [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland); it was moved to the [National Armor and Cavalry Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Armor_and_Cavalry_Museum amp;action=edit amp;redlink=1) at [Fort Benning, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Benning,_Georgia) in 2010, and has been inside ever since. The interior has extensive damage from water/rust, although plans are in place for restoration. * The British never allocated their Mark VIIIs to a tank unit; a single vehicle survives at the [Bovington Tank Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovington_Tank_Museum). The tank appearing in the 1989 [*Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade) movie was a replica vehicle made from an [excavator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavator), following the hull shape of the Mark VIII but with a turret added.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_VIII_tank#cite_note-8)"</TEXT>

The comment about machine guns vs cannons is very interesting too, but I suppose he is a dogfight pilot above all while both Germans and Japanese screamed for heavier cannons to deal with bombers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess that was it. At any rate actual engagements (firing) would not last 1 hour or the likes. Probably some minutes, I bet they did not even use it all up. Fighter cover would not let you be around for long, even without fighter opposition gaining and loosing altitude to reposition for another run takes some time. Don't have the book on hand now but the 30 mm guns in other planes carried like 50 or 60 rounds, years later the Mig-15 23 mm cannons would carry something like 70 or 80 rounds and the 37 mm some 40 round tops if I am correct.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In fact not. "Operational history An Me 410A-1/U4 with a BK 5 cannon peels off during attack on USAAF B-17s The Me 410 night bomber proved to be an elusive target for the RAF night fighters. The first unit to operate over the UK was V./KG 2, which lost its first Me 410 on the night of 13 #8211;14 July 1943, when it was shot down by a de Havilland Mosquito of No. 85 Squadron RAF. The Me 410 was also used as a bomber destroyer against the daylight bomber formations of the USAAF, upgraded with Umr #252;st-Baus #228;tze factory conversion kits, all bearing a /U suffix, for the design  #8212; these suffixes could vary in meaning between subtypes. As one example, the earlier Me 410 A-1/U1 designation signified a camera-fitting in the under-nose ordnance bay for reconnaissance use (as the A-3 was meant to do from its start), while the same /U1 designation or the later Me 410 B-2 signified a mount of a pair of the long barreled, 30mm calibre MK 103 cannon in the undernose ordnance bay. The /U2 suffix designated a fitment of two additional 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in the under-nose ordnance bay instead  #8212; the A-1/U4 subtype fitted the massive, 540 kg (1,190 lb) weight Bordkanone series 50 mm (2 in) BK 5 cannon, loaded with 21 rounds in the same undernose ordnance bay in place of either the /U1's cameras or MK 103s, or the /U2's added pair of MG 151/20 autocannon. For breaking up the bomber formations, many Me 410s also had four underwing tubular launchers, two per wing panel, firing converted 21 cm (8 in) Werfer-Granate 21 infantry barrage rockets. Two Geschwader, Zerst #246;rergeschwader 26 and 76, were thus equipped with the Me 410 by late 1943. They were moderately successful against unescorted bombers through 1943, with a considerable number of kills against USAAF day bomber formations being achieved. However, the Me 410 was no match in a dogfight with the lighter Allied single-engine fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. In early 1944, the Me 410 formations encountered swarms of Allied fighters protecting the bomber streams, usually flying far ahead of the combat box formations as an air supremacy move in clearing the skies of any Luftwaffe opposition, resulting in the Me 410's previous successes against escorted bombers now often being offset by their losses. An example of this  #8212; as part of a campaign started two days earlier by the USAAF  #8212; was on 6 March 1944 during an attack on Berlin by 750 8th AF heavy bombers, when 16 Me 410s were shot down in return for eight B-17s and four P-51s (which were destroyed by Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighters escorting the Me 410s).[1][2] The following month on 11 April, with 8th AF raids hitting Sorau, Rostock and Oschersleben, II./ZG 26's Me 410s accounted for a rare clear success, initially bringing down 10 B-17s without any losses. During the course of the same raid, their second sortie was intercepted by P-51s that destroyed eight Me 410s and three Bf 110s. Sixteen crewmen were killed and three wounded.[3] From mid-1944, despite being Hitler's favourite bomber destroyer, the Me 410 units were taken from Defence of the Reich duties and production was phased out in favour of heavily armed single-engine fighters as dedicated bomber destroyers, with the Me 410s remaining in service flying on reconnaissance duties only.[4] Some Me 410s were used with Junkers Ju 188s during the Battle of Normandy, for high-altitude night reconnaissance" Edit: taken from wiki</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a good question. Most had somehow viable prototypes. The key is getting from prototype to fully operational jet, that is not a trivial matter. Specially when it represents a radical turn in development. While somebody else may offer a detailed explanation you have to deal with an ongoing war, introducing new manufacturing techniques and machinery, pilots training, potentially new doctrine, ground crews training and intelligence. You do not want to loose one over enemy territory to have them copying the stuff, etc etc. So initial models were there but there were a lot of things to work upon. The B-29 for instance was more similar to its predecessors, still propeller driven and adaptation to the new model should have been more straight forward than transitioning to a jet, and yet the pressurized cabin, being the main new feature, and other technical improvements in materials and performance cause a protracted and expensive development.

    <TEXT>Interesting question. I read "For King and Another Country: Indian Soldiers on the Western Front, 1914-18" by Shrabani Basu and there are extensive references to Brighton. No clear indication of segregation but Indians were centralized there, had somehow a tight permission system to visit the town (sometimes restricted if any incident was reported) and sometimes they had to go accompanied. So formally or not there seems to have been some sort of "compartmentalization" lacking any other word on my side. True that whenever an large army contingent is placed next to a population center there is a tendency to impose some restriction to avoid disruption and/or conflict with the civilians, but it seems some had more freedom of movement than others. Edit: typos and further comments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand 1 of the reasons to introduce them was to defend themselves against German long range bomber  amp; reconnaissance aircraft like the Fw200 Condor in the North Sea. These would attack the convoys but also radio their positions and courses to the U-boat flotillas, and these had devastating effects. Eventually escort carriers would join the fight but at that moment they were not available.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>" Desperate times called for desperate measures. The greatest threat to Britain #8217;s ability to continue the war lay in the Atlantic where the U-Boat attacks on convoys were a cause for serious concern throughout 1941. Some means had to be found to combat the long range German [**Condor aircraft**](http://ww2today.com/august-1940-condor-aircraft-join-the-battle-of-the-atlantic) that were used to locate convoys and call in U-Boats, as well as undertaking bombing themselves. Catapult Armed Merchant ships were introduced in the spring of 1941. These were fitted with a launch rail from which Hurricats  #8211; catapult launched Hurricanes -could be given a rocket assisted take off whilst in mid ocean. Apart the hazards inherent in such a procedure there was the problem of recovering the pilot after he completed his task of defending the convoy. There was no way of recovering the aircraft to these merchant ships  #8211; these were single use planes. The pilot was expected to ditch in the sea and hope to be picked up by one of the convoy escorts. On the 3rd August 1941 Flight Lieutenant Everett from No. 804 Squadron launched from HMS Maplin and shot down the first German aircraft by this method. He ditched in the sea and just managed to escape from his aircraft as it sank immediately  #8211; and was picked up by a destroyer."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am really looking forward for an answer to this comment. What an interesting scenario. Artillery certainly saves money as every shot, even if high tech, is going to be cheaper than a modern missile. Needless to say if this ever comes true then the classic armament race/escalation occurs. In other words more armor to counter the artillery etc and then we are back to you know what.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seems people is interested in what the Japanese made with it, here an excerpt from wiki: "Peresvet was refloated by Japanese engineers on 29 June 1905 and steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal, where she arrived on 25 August. She was renamed Sagami, after the eponymous ancient province. She was classified as a first-class battleship on 25 August and arrived at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 16 September. Her repairs began on 30 September and continued until 20 July 1908, although she participated in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905.  #8203; To improve her stability, Sagami's forward fighting top was removed. Sagami was rearmed with four 10-inch 45 caliber guns, ten 6-inch (152 mm) guns and sixteen QF 12-pounder 12 cwt\[ guns. Two above-water 18-inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men. She was one of the reception ships when the American Great White Fleet visited Japan in late 1908 and was often used as an "enemy" ship during the annual fleet maneuvers. Sagami was reclassified as a first-class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am going to say no, unlikely. My main argument is the Pacific War amply demonstrated that ships cannot stand waves of air attacks on their own, particularly if the naval force is of small size. The Japanese had already spotted the ships twice and I doubt they'd let go the opportunity. In addition to that 2 IJN subs had tracked the British force and one of them already attacked it, which could have ended the affair even before the air attack. Let's give some credit to the AA guys too. They shot down or seriously damaged many of the Japanese planes, Repulse also managed to dodge 16 torpedoes! which is a feat. But it was all a matter of time. May be not sunk so quickly, may be with extensive damage and slowly loosing the ship...but I am pretty convinced that without air cover once the Japanese forces fixed on the British force those ships were doomed. Edit: typos and structure</TEXT>

Flight Lieutenant* [*Rod Learoyd*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_Alastair_Brook_Learoyd) *of 49 Squadron was awarded the* [*Victoria Cross*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross) *for the attack that he led on the* [*Dortmund-Ems canal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund-Ems_canal) *on 12 August 1940.*[*\[18\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Hampden#cite_note-BCDbob-18) *On 25 August 1940, Hampdens from various squadrons participated in the RAF's first bombing raid on* [*Berlin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)*.*[*\[19\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Hampden#cite_note-moyes_8-19) *Sergeant* [*John Hannah*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hannah_(VC)) *was the wireless operator/air gunner of an* [*83 Squadron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._83_Squadron_RAF) *Hampden and was awarded the Victoria Cross on 15 September 1940, when he fought the flames of the burning aircraft, allowing the pilot to return it to base."* *"In Canadian service.

I found them all in audiobook format easily, you should not have issues. Cheers. And there are few Podcast too, but I need to get home to check. Edit: structure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes they did. I am sure somebody has made a study of the German foreign  amp; economical policy in war time towards neutral countries. Nonetheless there is also a blurred line between export and providing materials to allies like Finland and Romania who also received German equipment, like armor, planes and certainly hand weapons. That said Spain was neutral but "more friendly" with the Axis than the allies for sure. Germany kept importing goods and raw materials from foreign countries. A classic Spanish example was wolfram, key to produce light bulbs, ammo etc. Apparently Germany partly paid for this with equipment, other Spanish sources said Spain charged nothing as this was payment for the help received during the Spanish Civil War and others said the equipment came to reinforce the Spanish Army and deter the allies as much as possible of any intention of invading Germany south flank and open a front there. I never got a satisfactory answer to be honest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Russians began to pull out troops as early as 1979/80. Despite tensions in the 80s tactical nuclear armament became increasingly important over conventional forces. In 1989 Russians agreed to withdraw a significant part of its armored units from the GDR, this was mostly brought by Gorbachev's policies and the fall of the Berlin Wall. You're right, the so called Western Group of Forces would remain in German soil until 1994 when the GDR decided to join the FDR. Edit:typos</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt it, at least not knowing war was over, radio links were strong with the sub crews, problem is Enigma was compromised but I am sure the German High Command would have radioed the surrender order in the clear even for the Allies to verify (they did not know Enigma code was broken, the Brits indeed kept this secret for years as many Enigma and similar machines were in other countries, like in the Middle East, and kept reading their comms at least well into the 50s.). You may also imagine that knowing the attrition of sub crews in the Kriegsmarine one would be happy to surrender the sooner the better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the down size it also limits your payload, the room for fuel tanks, the number of guns and caliber you can install and also how much armor you can put on to protect the pilot and other plane vital areas. Similarly it may phase out the type itself if you cannot provide a fitting more powerful engine, in most WW2 engines the increase of power brought an increase in weight and some times size. So you may face a scenario in which, due to weight and/or size, the plane cell cannot hold any larger engines. Also even fitting physically the plane structure may not be able to resist the increasing power in terms of vibrations, torque, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"The propulsion was carried out by means of a diesel engine of the Pegaso brand of 125 hp and a Cenemesa electric motor (Siemens patent) of 110 hp. Thanks to the 2 kg / cm #178; of exhaust gas pressure, these mini submarines could be submerged with the diesel engine running, which allowed them to dive on the order of 6 seconds before turning off the diesel engines and starting operation with the electric ones. In addition, they had an automatic diesel engine shutdown system below the 10-meter level, being able to reach a maximum immersion level of 80 meters, and 40 meters with the two torpedoes The crew, consisting of two people, could not stand up, which limited their autonomy to no more than 50 hours. The armament consisted of two G7e torpedoes mounted on the outside of the submersible, which caused a significant imbalance after the firing of one of them. Among its features, the access hatch with transparent cover stood out. Despite their high maintenance cost and the problems caused by batteries (generation of hydrogen gases), both units were operational between 1963 and 1967, making a total of 50 sorties. The two units produced are preserved. The SA-41 at the Naval Station of Mah #243;n and the SA-42 at the Isaac Peral Base in Cartagena."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I did not make the numbers , just took them, but making them now it seems 82% would be the correct number. 38 sets of brothers = 76 + 2 sets of 3 brothers = 6 + 2 (1 father  amp; 1 son) that makes 84, so 15*100/84 = 17.8% or 18% after rounding. This is the % of survivors so the casualty rate is 100-18 = 82% casualties.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[Wait for me daddy story](https://www.thevintagenews.com/?p=133995)  #8203;  #8220;Wait for Me, Daddy #8221; is an iconic photo taken by Claude P. Dettloff on October 1, 1940, of The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught #8217;s Own Rifles) marching down Eighth Street at the Columbia Street intersection, New Westminster, Canada. While Dettloff was taking the photo, Warren  #8220;Whitey #8221; Bernard ran away from his mother to his father, Private Jack Bernard. The picture received extensive exposure and was used in war-bond drives and here is the story behind it. On Saturday August 26, 1939, Hitler was threatening Poland and demanding Danzig. At 4:15 that morning the Regimental Adjutant in British Columbia, Canada received a call from the Canadian capital instructing him to call out the BC Regiment. #160;Soldiers fanned out in the city to guard vulnerable points. On September 10, 1939, the Parliament of Canada declared war against the German Reich, which had invaded Poland on the first of the month. While other units were sent to the United Kingdom, the British Columbia Regiment was left behind on the west coast. After months of drills and guard duty the regiment was ordered out and on October 1, 1940, marched to New Westminster to catch a waiting ship, the SS Princess Joan, to their secret destination. Wait for Me, Daddy, taken by Claude P. Dettloff. #160;[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_for_Me,_Daddy#/media/File:British_Columbia_Regiment_1940.jpg) Coming down Eighth Street in New Westminster, Canadian photographer Claude P. Dettloff of The Province newspaper positioned himself to photograph the whole column marching down the hill. As he was getting ready to take the picture, he saw a young boy run out onto the road. Wait for Me, Daddy captures the image of the boy, five-year-old Warren  #8220;Whitey #8221; Bernard, running out of his mother #8217;s grasp to his father. The picture Dettloff captured was picked up all over the world, getting exposure in Life; it hung in every school in British Columbia during the war. The secret destination turned out to be Nanaimo, only three hours away. Later, after years of training, the regiment converted from infantry to armor and was sent to France and the Netherlands; it returned home at war #8217;s end. When Jack Bernard returned home Dettloff was on hand to photograph the family #8217;s reunion. Jack and Bernice Bernard eventually divorced. The City of New Westminster commissioned a bronze statue honoring the photo to be placed at the bottom of 8th Street, in Hyack Square. The city unveiled the statue on October 4, 2014. At the same event, the Royal Canadian Mint #160;announced the issue of a series of three coins featuring a scene adapted from the image: it was released in denominations of $2 (alloy), $3 (1/4 ounce silver) and 10 (1/2 ounce silver). #160;Canada Post also issued a stamp featuring the iconic image.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She was lost in the Battle of Jutland. From wiki: *" Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament.In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25, the range was down to 14,400 yards (13,200 m), and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late for Queen Mary, however, as Derfflinger's fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated one or both of the forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell.A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink.Tiger, the battlecruiser behind her, was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains.1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers Laurel, Petard, and Tipperary, and two by the Germans."*</TEXT>

They sailed from Hvalfj #246;r #240;ur on 29 April. On 1 May, she was rammed and sunk in a collision with the battleship HMS King George V in foggy conditions. While steaming in formation in heavy fog, the lookout on Punjabi reported what he believed to be a mine dead ahead; the captain reflexively (and regrettably) ordered a 15-point emergency turn to port; in so doing, she sailed directly into the path of King George V and was sliced in two by the battleship's bow. 169 of the ship #8217;s company were rescued from the forward section, and another 40 were picked up from the sea by other escorts, including Marne. Those crew left in the aft section, which sank very quickly, were killed when her depth charges detonated; 49 of her crew lost their lives in the accident. She sank directly in the path of the US battleship USS Washington, which had to sail between the halves of the sinking destroyer. Washington suffered slight damage from the detonation of the depth charges. King George V sustained serious damage to her bow, and was forced to return to port for repairs. Further investigation revealed no mines in the area, or indeed in any part of the convoy's eventual path. It is unknown what the lookout actually spotted, if anything."*</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Yes, one of the main reasons was to test the damage inflicted by the atomic blast to surface vessels of different strength at different distance. The ships were not there to watch the explosion, they were old ships, captured ones or ones that were worn out beyond cost effective repair, they were there to be destroyed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**PART 1** Here we go. Below you can see some of the results, I must add that there was not a single test. If my memory serves me right there were a total of 23 tests in the area in total over several years. I must also point out that while no humans were in the ships some of them contained live animals to study the effect of the blast  amp; radiation on them. [From this site](https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/article-bikini-atoll-nuclear-target-fleet.htm) " ## Carriers [***USS Saratoga*** (CV-32)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Saratoga_(CV0-3)) Lexington-class aircraft carrier  #8212; She survived the Test Able blast, an air burst on 1 July 1946 at Bikini Atoll, with only minor damage, but was damaged beyond repair by the Test Baker blast on 25 July 1946, an underwater atom bomb blast which was detonated under LSM-60 500 metres (500 yards) from the carrier. Salvage efforts were prevented by radioactivity, and seven-and-one-half hours after the blast, with her funnel collapsed across her deck, Saratoga slipped, stern first, beneath the surface of Bikini Lagoon. * [*USS Independence* (CVL-22)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Independence_(CVL-22)) light aircraft carrier  #8212; Assigned as a target vessel for the Bikini atomic bomb tests, she was placed within one-half-mile of ground zero for the 1 July 1946 explosion. The veteran ship did not sink, however (though her funnels and island were crumpled by the blast), and after taking part in another explosion 25 July 1946 was taken to Kwajalein Atoll and decommissioned 28 August 1946. The highly radioactive hulk was later taken to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco for further tests and was finally scuttled off the coast of San Francisco, California, on 29 January 1951. Controversy has subsequently arisen about the sinking of the Independence, as it is claimed she was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste at the time of her sinking, and that the waste has subsequently contaminated the wildlife refuge and commercial fisheries associated with the Farallon Islands. ## Battleships * [***USS Arkansas*** (BB-33)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arkansas_(BB-33)) Wyoming-class dreadnought battleship  #8212; On 1 July 1946, the Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in the Test Able atomic test, but survived with extensive shock damage to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were little damaged. On 25 July 1946, the battleship was sunk by the underwater nuclear Test Baker at Bikini Atoll. Unattentuated by air, the shock was "transmitted directly to underwater hulls", and Arkansas, only 250 yards from the epicenter, appeared to have been "crushed as if by a tremendous hammer blow from below". It appears that the wave of water from the blast capsised the ship, which was then hammered down into the shallow bottom by the descent of the water column thrown up by the atomic blast. * [***HIJMS Nagato***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Nagato) Japanese battleship  #8212; In the atom bomb airburst Test Able on 1 July 1946 she was 1,640 yards from ground zero and was not severely damaged. In Test Baker, an underwater atom bomb explosion on 25 July 1946 she was severely damaged, eventually capsised and sank five days later. * [*USS Nevada* (BB-36)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nevada_(BB-36)) Nevada-class battleship  #8212; Designated aim point for Test Able air-dropped atomic bomb, she was painted an "ugly" reddish-orange to help the bombardier's aim. However, even with the high visibility color scheme, the bomb fell about 1,600 metres (1,700 yd) off-target, exploding above the light carrier Independence instead. Nevada also survived Test Baker, but she was damaged and extremely radioactive. Nevada was then towed to Kwajalein Atoll by USS Preserver (ARS-8), decommissioned on 29 August 1946, and then towed to Pearl Harbor. After she was thoroughly examined at Pearl Harbor, her final sortie came on 31 July 1948 when Iowa and two other vessels used Nevada as a gunnery target for practice. The three ships did not sink Nevada, so she was given a coup de gr #65533;ce with an aerial torpedo hit amidships. * [*USS New York* (BB-34)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_New_York_(BB-34)) New York-class battleship  #8212; Surviving the Test Able surface blast on 1 July 1946 and the underwater Test Baker explosion on 25 July 1946, she was taken into Kwajalein Atoll and decommissioned there on 29 August 1946. Later towed to Pearl Harbor, she was studied during the next two years, and on 8 July 1948 was towed out to sea some 40 mi (35 nmi; 64 km) and there sunk after an 8-hour pounding by ships and planes carrying out full-scale battle maneuvers with new weapons. * [*USS Pennsylvania* (BB-38)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pennsylvania_(BB-38)) super-dreadnought battleship  #8212; After surviving the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll, she was then towed to Kwajalein Atoll where she decommissioned on 29 August 1946. She remained in Kwajalein Lagoon for radiological and structural studies until 10 February 1948, when she was sunk stern first off Kwajalein Atoll. ## Cruisers * [***IJN Sakawa***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Sakawa) Agano class light cruiser  #8212; The detonation of the Test Able atom bomb at Bikini Atoll occurred 450 metres (490 yards) above and slightly to starboard of IJN Sakawa's stern. The blast caused IJN Sakawa to burn fiercely for twenty-four hours before she eventually sank. The second atom bomb, Test Baker, was an underwater shot about 150 metres (500 feet) away from the sunken Sakawa. * [*Prinz Eugen*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cruiser_Prinz_Eugen) Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruiser  #8212; The ship survived two atomic bomb blasts at Bikini Atoll, Test Able, on 1 July 1946, and Test Baker on 25 July 1946. Prinz Eugen was thoroughly contaminated with radioactive fallout, but suffered no structural damage from the explosions. The irradiated ship was towed to the Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific, where a small leak went unrepaired. By late December 1946, the ship was in very bad condition. On 21 December 1946, the ship began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein Atoll in time, so the US Navy attempted to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December 1946, Prinz Eugen capsised and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remain visible above the surface of the water. * [*USS Pensacola* (CA-24)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pensacola_(CA-24)) Pensacola-class heavy cruiser  #8212; She survived the atom bomb tests of 1 July and 25 July 1946. On 24 August 1946, she was taken in tow for Kwajalein Atoll where she decommissioned on 26 August. Her hulk was turned over to the custody of Joint Task Force One for radiological and structural studies. On completion of these studies, her hulk was sunk on 10 November 1948 off the Washington coast in 1,400 fathoms. * [*USS Salt Lake City* (CA-25)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Salt_Lake_City_(CA-25)) Pensacola-class heavy cruiser  #8212; Surviving two atomic bomb blasts at Bikini Atoll, she was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and laid up to await ultimate disposal. She was sunk by torpedoes as a target hull on 25 May 1948, 130 mi (110 nmi; 210 km) off San Diego southern California in 2,000 fathoms." ## ## "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PART 4 * [*USS Geneva* (APA-86)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Geneva_(APA-86)) Gilliam-class attack transport  #8212; She was to be one of the target ships in Operation Crossroads Test Able on the morning of 1 July 1946 when the fourth atomic bomb to be exploded and the first ever detonated over water was to be dropped from a B-29. The attack transport survived the explosion and the huge column of water and steam that rose to 35,000 feet (11,000 m) and formed a mushroom-shaped cloud. Geneva was declared free of radioactivity the following day. She also survived Test Baker on 25 July 1946. That morning at 0835 an atomic bomb suspended below LSM-60 was exploded - the first to be detonated under water. Geneva was in normal operation 4 days after that explosion, steaming to Kwajalein Atoll 25 August 1946, then proceeding via Hawaii to San Francisco, where she arrived 5 November 1946. Geneva departed San Francisco on 4 December 1946, touched San Diego and transited the Panama Canal for Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on the 27 December 1946. She was returned to the Maritime Commission on 2 April 1947 and joined the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia. Geneva was transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina, in July 1955 and sold for scrap by the Maritime Administration on 2 November 1966. * [*USS Niagara* (APA-87)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Niagara_(APA-87)) Gilliam-class attack transport  #8212; Niagara survived the atomic explosions of Operation Crossroads.

Niagara remained on the west coast until she departed San Diego 7 November 1946, steaming via the Panama Canal to Hampton Roads, Virginia. She arrived Norfolk, Virginia on 2 December 1946 and was decommissioned there 12 December 1946. After serving to test the effects of special conventional explosives in the Chesapeake Bay, Niagara was sold for scrapping on 5 February 1950 to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ## LSTs (Landing Ships, Tank) * LST-52  #8212; Sunk off Kwajalein Atoll in April 1948 by gunfire of USS Oakland (CL-95) in 2,280 fathoms. * LST-125  #8212; Deliberately beached before Test Baker shot, then sunk by gunfire of USS Fall River (CA-131) off Bikini Atoll on 14 August 1946. * LST-133  #8212; Sunk off Kwajalein Atoll on 11 May 1948. * LST-220  #8212; Sunk off Kwajalein Atoll on 12 May 1948. * LST-545  #8212; Sunk off Kwajalein Atoll on 12 May 1948. * LST-661  #8212; Sunk off Kwajalein Atoll on 25 July 1948. ## LSMs (Landing Ships, Medium) [***USS LSM-60***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSM-60) landing ship, medium (LSM) amphibious assault ship  #8212; Used as the float to suspend a fission bomb underwater during the Operation Crossroads Test Baker at Bikini Atoll, becoming the first naval vessel to use a nuclear weapon. She was modified with a well through the cargo deck and hull, a derrick to lower the bomb through the well, and a large antenna to receive the detonation signal. On 25 July 1946, a standard Mk. 3A "Fat Man" type atomic bomb, nicknamed Helen of Bikini, placed in a watertight casing, was suspended 90 feet below LSM-60 in the lagoon of Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. At 0835 local time the bomb was detonated, destroying LSM-60 and eight target ships, including USS Saratoga (CV-3). A seaman present claimed that "there was not one identifiable piece of the LSM-60 ever located", however a British naval constructor present reports he saw a 3-inch (7.6 cm) square piece of LSM-60 on the deck of a target ship afterward. ## LCTs (Landing Craft, Tank) * **LCT-414**  #8212; Sunk by demolition charges at Bikini Atoll shortly after Test Baker shot. * **LCT-1114**  #8212; Capsised by Test Baker shot and sunk by demolition charges at Bikini Atoll on 30 July 1946. * **LCT-1175**  #8212; Sunk at Bikini by Test Baker shot on 25 July 1946. * **LCT-1187**  #8212; Sunk by demolition charges at Bikini Atoll shortly after Test Baker shot. * **LCT-1237**  #8212; Sunk by demolition charges at Bikini Atoll shortly after Test Baker shot. * LCT-412  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-705  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-746  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in March 1947. * LCT-812  #8212; Sunk by demolition charges at Bikini Atoll shortly after Baker shot. * LCT-816  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in June 1947. * LCT-818  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-874  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-1013  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-1078  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-1112  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCT-1113  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in June 1947. ## Auxiliaries * **ARDC-13** drydock  #8212; Sunk at Bikini Atoll by Test Baker shot on 6 August 1946. * **YO-160** yard oiler  #8212; Sunk at Bikini Atoll by Test Baker shot on 25 July 1946. * YOG-83  #8212; Beached at Kwajalein Atoll on 23 September 1946, and scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll on 16 September 1948. ## LCIs (Landing Craft, Infantry) * LCI-327  #8212; Stranded at Bascombe (Mek) Island, Kwajalein Atoll, and destroyed there on 30 October 1947. * LCI-329  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll on 16 March 1948. * LCI-332  #8212; Scuttled off Kwajalein Atoll in September 1947. * LCI-549  #8212; Used at Kwajalein Atoll as patrol vessel until June 1948.

    <TEXT>Yes and no. Let me elaborate on that. The plane was actually fine, nothing wrong with the design and as a matter of fact it was a good plane, pretty much a competitor for the fighters the French Air Force would use in 1940 against the Germans. Yes, granted, in the Pacific had very high casualties but most of the fighters of the time suffered or would have suffered them too facing the Japanese models. The problem with the Buffalo was that it was horribly made, poorly manufactured with severe quality issues, the ones given to the Australians among the worst apparently. However it already had some of the features of later navy fighters, ruggedness for instance. The Dutch used it in Borneo and had quite some good words for it, some pilots were amazed at the ton of damage it could take and keep flying. The fact that Finnish (after fixing the quality issues) used it so successfully against more modern Soviet planes and in a far harder and different climate is a vindication of a good design after all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, it's a fair question. Many models lacked some parts, yes you got that right. Like buying a new car but you discover it did not bring any spark plugs or an exhaust pipe. The Dutch for instance bought the model but ordered some components separately like engines, armor glass windscreens, reflector gun sights or self sealing fuel tanks and gun heaters. So overall they would have assembled a good all around plane. Aussies on the other hand got the worst part. I cite: "Firstly, they are an excellent design but were very wrongly built in America. This resulted in problems in two areas: Engines  amp; Airframes. Our aircraft were supposed to be fitted with the 1,250 hp engines, and the engine plates so stated. However, the variation in power [between one aircraft and another] was very evident. When making an operational formation climb, particularly over 8,000 ft., the relative performance of some aircraft was pathetic. This stemmed from the fact that a number of the engines were time-expired airline engines reworked and reissued as new and up to rated power. We also had a sabotage problem in the American factories: valve springs over-hardened, flattened cam rings, cam rings not hardened at all, oil pumps outside tolerance and thus low pressure, and pressure relief springs being too soft--again low pressure. A fuel pump from the "Hornet" series engines of 600-800 hp output would not supply those bigger engines. Airscrew seals were second-hand and blew if the oil pressure surged due to quick change to fine pitch. [I think it's fairly well established that the problems in Buffalo manufacture were due to Brewster's incompetence, not sabotage. Evidently some Buffs had been refitted with fuel pumps from the Pratt  amp; Whitney Hornet engine, inadequate to the task. -- DF] Whilst the airframes themselves were basically very sound, the "bits" were a real headache. The single hydraulic ram for the undercarriage was a good design, but the inboard ball joint was prone to bend or fail. Also the piston on the undercarriage rod was a single bolt--quite good if the bolt is there and tight [but] several of our aircraft had no bolt on delivery. Makes landings very interesting!" So going to your original question, the airframes (as mentioned above) were sound and structurally ok, hence they could take considerable damage in combat but many other bits around the model were a disaster. So it was a good plane, Finnish went on to produce their own improved version, but badly made. Hope I explained the contradiction. Edit: typos.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is pretty much like Spanish Guardia Civil, they operationally depend from the Ministry of Interior but the are part of the Army and hence military. They have military ranks and a pretty much the same promotion process. In case of war they actually become a kind of Military Police taking care of POW, securing crossroads, roads, airports and ports. In peave times they have additional duties within the civil sphere, they are the rural police force, transport inmates, manage traffic outside the cities as well as having a Coast Guard component, Special Operations and Search and Rescue units. THeir legal status is fully military.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Kind of, it was envisioned as a sort of flying flak. But you are adding more modern arguments into the picture. The concept, I better say the practicality, of fighter escorts into medium/long distance missions was pretty much in its infancy. Both Germany and the UK never had the American style long range fighters to do that. Spitfires, Hurricanes and Bf-109 were severely limited to sometimes few minutes fighting before having to turn back and abandon the bombers. The Germans made an effort but Brits would send waves of medium and heavy bombers pretty much on their own in the early part of the war and the RAF night missions over Germany would much continue in this way for a while. I never saw the Defiant as a practical concept but there was a bit of a logic behind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They normally did get in from inside the plane. But there was no room for a parachute. In order to bail out they had to return to the interior of the fuselage, put on the parachute and find an exit to jump from. In addition you can only enter/exit the turret when is in certain position. That said if the plane goes into a spin nobody can get out no matter the position inside, the G forces just pin you to the walls and you can't move, you're doomed. If the plane is falling down slowly, let's say gliding after loosing 1 or more engines then like everyone else you should be able to get your parachute and jump. Still it looks to me you were in a better place than in a smaller bomber. In the B-25 the nose guy had to crawl back throw a narrow tunnel below the pilots, difficult enough in normal fly just think in an emergency. Same for the Navy Avenger, if I am right only the pilot could jump off directly from his seat, the navigator and rear gunner could not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apparently the test pilot was not impressed at first, but it had a 2 blade propeller for instance. But prototypes are flown for a reason, find out the issues. "K5054 Spitfire Prototype K5054 was the name given to the prototype Supermarine Spitfire as flown by Joseph  #8216;Mutt #8217; Summers in March 1936. The flight was such a revelation that on landing Summers said of K5054  #8220;Don #8217;t touch a thing #8221;. Work on K5054 started in December 1934. K5054 took off on its maiden flight at 16.30 on March 5th 1936 from Eastleigh Aerodrome in Hampshire. The flight lasted just eight minutes. Summers flew the new aircraft four times before handing testing over to test pilots Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. K5054 was given a certificate of flight worthiness on April 2nd 1936. k5054 The official cost of K5054 from design board to first flight was officially put at  #163;14,637. Though the Spitfire gained a reputation as being an excellent aircraft to fly, Summers was not initially impressed with K5054 #8217;s rudder, which he felt was too sensitive. However, that aside, the first flight of K5054 led to the famous quote of Summers about engineers changing nothing. Initial flights of K5054 gave it a top speed of 330 mph. In later trial flights, K5054 was fitted with a better-shaped propeller and this pushed its top speed to 348 mph  #8211; somewhat faster than the Hawker Hurricane. The performance of K5054 set the standard for fighter interceptors of the day: after a series of trials the aircraft had a top speed of 349 mph at 16,800 feet. Its rate of climb was 2,400 feet a minute; K5054 took just under 6 minutes to get to 15,000 feet and it had a maximum ceiling of 35,400 feet. In May 1936, Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath where it was handed over to the AAEE  #8211; the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment  #8211; where it underwent service trials for the RAF. K5054 made its first public appearance at RAF Hendon on June 27th 1936 where it was displayed in the  #8216;New Types #8217; section at the aircraft display. In September 1936, a report on the handling trials was released. It stated that the controls were  #8220;quick under all conditions #8221; and that the rudder  #8211; modifed since the first flight  #8211; was  #8220;extremely effective #8221;. The report stated that the stability of K5054 in flight was  #8220;satisfactory #8221; but that while doing acrobatics in the air K5054 was  #8220;very easy and pleasant #8221; to fly. Take-off was  #8220;easy #8221; and the undercarriage had  #8220;excellent shock absorbing qualities #8221; with ground handling being  #8220;extremely good #8221;. A summary of K5054 #8217;s flying qualities was  #8220;simple and easy to fly and has no vices #8221;. In its first few flights, K5054 was unarmed. Now work was done to fit out the aircraft with its armaments and furhter refinements were made. The Air Ministry was so impressed with what K5054 achieved that an order for 310 Spitfires was made on June 3rd 1936. When these rolled off the production line, they were known as Mark I Spitfires. However, further developments to K5054 were used in the production of the Mark II and Mark III. K5054 became the mould for the Spitfires that fought in the Battle of Britain. However, the aircraft did not always function well. On March 22nd 1937, K5054 had to make a forced landing as a result of engine failure caused by oil pressure problems. K5054 also crashed just one day after World War Two was declared (September 4th 1939) but on this occasion the pilot, Flight Lieutenant White, was killed even though the fuselage was relatively undamaged." https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/famous-battles-of-world-war-two/battle-of-britain/k5054-spitfire-prototype/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Truth is Great Britain was closer to invade Sweden than Germany. Before Germany considered invading Norway it was Churchill who considered to go for both, precisely to control the iron ore resources and deprive the Germans of them. Germany was satisfied with keeping open the Baltic Sea. Eventually it got to the same conclusion as Great Britain and beat them for few weeks really. Germany knew it was too much at the same time and had no real prejudice against a "nordic" race. Britain saw the obvious additional value of land bases close enough to German territory.

Like constantly adjusting engine and combustible parameters. They have some good engines and interesting aerodynamics but seem to overtax the pilot.

    <TEXT>They enter service almost at the same time and complement each other, the Soviet Air Force never had enough interceptors to cover their vast airspace, in particular the northern frontier. The Fiddler was pretty much designed with those distances in mind to cover the whole of the arctic area. The Flagon was oriented to replace the Su-11  amp; Su-9, far less capable for that task, with much more radar capabilities and range. They are called interceptors but I am sure you know they are not to dogfight anyone, they flying weapon (I like to called them flying SAMs) platforms to shoot from as far as possible and practical to bring down enemy bombers. They are also very interesting as they are a unique solution to a unique problem of the immense Russian geography.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[NASA XB-70 Valkyrie factsheet](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-084-DFRC.html) " To achieve Mach 3 performance, the B-70 was designed to "ride" its own shock wave, much as a surfer rides an ocean wave. The resulting shape used a delta wing on a slab-sided fuselage that contained the six jet engines that powered the aircraft. The outer wing panels were hinged. During take off, landing, and subsonic flight, they remained in the horizontal position. This feature increased the amount of lift produced, improving the lift-to-drag ratio. Once the aircraft was supersonic, the wing panels would be hinged downward. Changing the position of the wing panels reduced the drag caused by the wingtips interacted with the inlet shock wave. The repositioned wingtips also reduced the area behind the airplane's center of gravity, which reduced trim drag. The downturned outer panels also provided more vertical surface to improve directional stability at high Mach numbers. Attached to the delta was a long, thin forward fuselage. Behind the cockpit were two large canards, which acted as control surfaces. "</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to wiki: "In contrast to the DUKW, the GPA did not perform well in the field. At some 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) the production truck had become much heavier than the original 1,200 kg (2,600 lb) specified in the design brief, but its volume had not been increased accordingly. As a consequence, a low freeboard in the water meant that the GPA could not handle more than a light chop or carry much cargo. The GPA's intended use of ferrying troops and cargo from ships off-shore, over a beach and continuing inland, was therefore very limited. On land, the vehicle was too heavy and its body too unwieldy to be popular with the soldiers. GPAs would frequently get stuck in shallow waters, where the regular Willys MB's water fording abilities allowed it to drive straight through (Pohl, 1998). Production was already halted in March 1943 after production of only 12,778 vehicles[1] due to financial quibbles between Ford and the US government, as well as bad reception of the vehicle in theatre." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_GPA</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the gun page in facebook: " This gun is the largest surviving railway Howitzer in the world and currently lives at the Royal Armouries at Fort Nelson just outside Portsmouth. The BL 18 inch railway howitzer (formally Ordnance BL 18 inch Mk I howitzer on truck, railway) was a British railway gun developed during World War I. Part of the progression of ever-larger howitzers on the Western Front, it did not enter service until 1920. The remaining examples were used for home defence and testing during WW2. Five guns and two complete equipments on railway wagons were produced. After World War I there was no use for such large but relatively short-ranged weapons and they were placed in storage. In World War II the two wagons were used to mount 13.5 inch guns, which were capable of engaging targets on the German-occupied Channel coast of France. In late 1940 one 18-inch howitzer was mounted on the railway mounting nicknamed "Boche Buster" which had been used in World War I to carry a 14-inch gun. It was deployed at Bishopsbourne in Kent on the Elham to Canterbury Line as a coast defence gun as a precaution against possible German invasion. The gun's range was insufficient for cross-Channel firing and hence it was never fired in action but provided a useful home defence role on the SE Coast Counter Invasion Stop line. A single gun barrel, number one, survives. This gun was tested at MoD Shoeburyness in 1920 before being moved away from the site for twenty years, probably to the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In 1940 it returned to Shoeburyness to be used in testing. Post war it continued to be used in testing until 1959. The gun's final firings were a series of tests where it fired 1000 pound bombs with a much reduced charge. In 2008 the weapon was put on display at the Royal Artillery headquarters at Larkhill. In March 2013 it was loaned to the Spoorweg museum, the Dutch national rail museum. In September 2013 it was moved to the Royal Armouries artillery museum at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. It is mounted on a proofing carriage, a gun carriage with very limited elevation and traverse intended for test firing."</TEXT>

On to the test, you can fire very short bursts from the hip, not shoulder, but there is no accuracy or anything. It could work in a closed space or very short range as it basically becomes more of a shotgun than a MG. Again, very short burst since the whole mass  amp; recoil of the device makes it uncontrollable for anything other than that once or twice. anything else will be more dangerous to you than the enemy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It wasn't an old plane, it was the plane of the time in development. Wind tunnels were already in operation back then. Edit: let me apologize and correct myself, the plane first flew in 1932 and deliveries began in 1933 while the pic is dated in 1934. Did some further reading and discover this was part of a study  amp; during a measurement of pilot's field of view. So the plane wasn't old, here 1 year after entering service but was already developed and the reason why it's here in the tunnel is entirely different.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apart from what /u/Goldeagle1123 has pointed out you may not see it well in this pic, but they were not mere towers. They had a multi purpose crane in the back that, for instance, could hook and remove a turret, a main gun or an engine from another tank making them mobile workshops. They could also mount other devices such mine rolls or a plow. All nations with an armored branch used some kind of them from the US to Japan. These were truly specialized vehicles and modern ones, technology aside, look still pretty similar. In these pics you can see some of the equipment I described.

Yes, it also can be used as a working day or as a travelling journey day which I suspect is the real meaning here. Spaniards gave it the name most likely referring to the travelling journey crossing the desert, a journey that was likely to kill you. Edit: typos</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think this particular naval case is more about geopolitics. Germany had few colonial and overseas possessions as well as allies/sympathizers so the German navy had to move from a relatively local area of operations, I am thinking of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea , to a global engagement in several oceans, and it was not just prepared for that. The naval supremacy of Britain was based on centuries of Empire building nurturing it, the US would have to take a similar path expanding, tackling the Panama Canal , probing the Pacific and South East Asia some decades prior to WW1. In the German case I believe a naval construction program would not suffice, you need to create the culture and the strategic thinking for that projection, not just the machines and man them, it does not happen in few years.

    <TEXT>With this info in hand I had to go down the rabbit hole -of course- and seems the German unit behind this it's most likely to be the ***Nachtjagdgeschwader*** **1 (NJG #160;1)** which faced ta heavy raid on Duisburg in May 1943. Up to March that year the unit operated mostly Bf-110 and few Do-217, starting to use the He-219 after that month. So either a Bf-110 or a Do-217 are the most likely culprits as they carried the MG  amp; Cannon combination, He-219 used exclusively cannons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like a doctrine issue. The Navy Minister of the time was an admiral named Th #233;ophile Aube, turns out he was a strong supporter of a French doctrine named Jeune Ecole or Young School which, and I cite "advocated the use of small, heavily armed vessels to combat larger battleships, and the use of commerce raiders to counter the Royal Navy". Hence the Marceau, being an Ironclad, had no place in this doctrine. Eventually it'd make it to the sea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not know the specific answer, may be the climate, but one thing is for sure it wasn't that rare. Half of the american stock was top open, all tank destroyers and the M8 based on the Stuart chassis were top open. Germans had a significant number of them like the Nashorn, Wessex, Marders etc were all open and the Soviets had some too, the SU-76M being the best known. Granted , some of them were based on relatively small chassis that left little room with the gun installed, but the point is it was not a rare feature at that time.</TEXT>

The one who made it out was just jettisoned by those same forces. In some stations it was so cramped that could not wear their parachutes, so unless the plane was hit but managed to glide for some minutes in a semi-controlled way to let the men bail out, it was the end.

    <TEXT>This is a very good question. My knowledge of the Vichy Regime is rather superficial, as I understand it the Germans let the French keep a small number of assets for internal policing, colonies included; I doubt Germany allowed much freedom in the French continental airspace. That said I do not know how Germany intended to control distant colonies (protectorate in this case) like Syria where Germany has no presence nor access to. I guess the French expected to be rather autonomous there and wait for better times. Overall Vichy Armed forces were not so keen to jump into the Allied side as one could have expected. i hope somebody has a better knowledge of the matter to provide a more in depth answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem at all. The allies, most of it the USN had to go into Tokyo bay to sign the surrender of Japan but also to station forces there and begin post-war occupation. If you are not familiar with naval matters you always desire to have a local pilot, the practice is still in use in most ports around the world. It's a local sailor, typically a captain himself who comes on board and takes control of the ship for the navigation into the port or channel, this is done because he knows best the channels, currents and blind spots in those waters. Same thing for departure. As for the historical context of this pic I'l refer you to this crosspost of this same pic. The story is detailed in one of the comments.
