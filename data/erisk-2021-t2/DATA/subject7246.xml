    <TITLE>My first 12-0 run, zoolock deck.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-25 21:11:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, i managed to do my first 12-0 run yesterday with a zoolock deck. I hadn't done even 8 wins with warlock before yesterday so the run was quite nice of a change in these hard arena times. Main reason I hadn't done more than 8 wins with warlock before was because I don't play warlock much and I'm slowly starting to play it more, before yesterday my warlock wasn't even on lvl 30. I have played some constructed zoolock (50 odd games on ladder) and I have watched a lot of streamers do well with similar style of warlock decks before so that helped a lot. This was my 7th 12 win run, first one was around 3 weeks ago, and the 4th class I have done 12 wins with (4 rogue, 1 druid, 1 pally). Playing the deck had a simple strategy, get on board on turn 1 or turn 2 in worst case scenario and maintain control of the board. Only 1 game I came close to losing the board but was saved by an elven archer from a peddler. Sickest opener was both the chows and peddlers against a priest at 8-0, priest was just overwhelmed and game ended quickly. MVP were definitely the peddlers, sad that they will be seen much less now.

These 2 characters in your opinion had the best combination of story, dialogue and acting. And as the characters should have had a proper story, recurring gag characters like Jean - Ralphio aren't allowed.

    <TITLE>After the last episode it genuinely seems like the show is most probably ending and the creators know it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-24 02:09:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been one of the few people who has believed that they won't cancel the show with S4 and that if they have given it 3 extra seasons with its poor ratings, they r at least going to give it a final season. But now, after the last episode, I believe that the show is probably ending and everyone involved is aware of the fact because that final season that the show deserves for a proper ending is this final arc of S4, Agents of Hydra. With all the themes of regret, first ever mention of Fitz and Simmons getting married and having kids and Simmons being aware that its the first ever mention, Coulson wondering what his life would have been like if he were a civilian and hadn't gotten involved with Shield in the first place or if he hadn't became a field agent, Coulson and May's love story coming to its peak, Daisy's biggest regret of losing Lincoln, the upcoming storyline being such that everyone will be wondering 'What if' (Also the name of the next episode) they weren't shield agents/were civilians or would have never met the rest of the team and this simulated life was their real life, and old characters from past seasons coming back, it really seems the show is ending. Also, storyline going back to Hydra in focus which is how the show started in the first place. And Jed Whedon finally directing an episode after 4 years of running the show, probably trying to put all the heart they have left in the final few episodes of the show. All of this combined with the fact that ABC is planning big GoT lvl Marvel shows now and They could divert the funds they put in AoS for another Inhumans lvl show which will probably be watched by more people and will earn them more money. I still hope it's renewed somehow but if it isn't, I hope it goes out (The last 7 eps left) with a Bang like the last episode rather than a Whimper. Edit : I also hope that if Marvel is making another Inhumans lvl big budget show they tap Jed and Maurissa to run it, they've done a gr8 job past 4 years and they clearly love the universe.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Problems with various heroes' skills that no one seem to mention or talk about.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-04 08:33:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>There are some problems with many Heroes's skills that I have noticed and no one seems to talk about. I'd like to point them out in hopes that some notices them and they get fixed or at least a discussion gets kicked off. Leia's 'Call for enforcements' and Cassian's Pathfinders take too much time to deploy and half the time in battle when you tap the button they just don't deploy cause you are being attacked and you end up tapping it like a crazy person. Another problem with both skills is that you can't pick a target to deploy them (Even though the skill button icon floats upon your tap which suggests you can deploy them at your own target even though you can't. Weird.) like you can with other cards, this is a big problem cause if you are being attacked and you are about to die then you don't wanna deploy the forces right where you are standing cause they'll be attacked instantly and die, ability to chose a target to deploy would be make these skills much better. Agent Kallus's Crackdown has the same problem like the 2 I mentioned above, you can't seem to use it when you are being attacked really fast. This is a bigger problem in this case though cause the skill is an aoe attack that requires the character in the middle of enemy forces to get good value. The strategy obviously is that you dash between enemy forces and quickly press the skill button and do aoe damage to them (You most possibly will die in this situation but that's alright cause your forces will live) but what ends up happening is you immediately start getting attacked as soon as you dash in and die and the skill rarely goes off. Bodhi's 'Request supplies', this skill is probably the weirdest skill (And possibly the weakest) in the game. First of all the animation is so long it takes ages so its not a lifesaver, it can rarely be used when you are low cause you die by the time you take it. Secondly, you can't 'Choose' to drop energy or health which is just baffling to me, there should be two buttons for this hero and the player should able to choose what he wants to deploy. Third, Not anyone should be able to pick up the supplies, only you and your team mate should be able to pick it up. Fourth, they need to be much more visually identifiable because unlike the health packs that are stationary these drop at random areas in the map and are generally hard to spot in the chaos of the battle with so many animations, especially the gold coloured one. I hope someone notices these problems and considers fixing them.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-07 09:23:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>This has happened to me multiple times now, I start a pack unlock and I get a free 12 hr premium booster immediately afterwards, but the unlock time doesn't reduce for that pack. Say, if I have put a Gold pack for unlock and get a booster immediately afterwards, the 12 hrs doesn't reduce to half and unlock time remains at 12 hrs and almost half the booster goes to waste (6 hrs). Is this intended to be this way ? Or is this a bug ? If this is intended to be this way then I suppose I'd be really pissed if it wasn't a free premium booster and I had paid money for it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-20 11:49:24</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sabine's special ability says 'The attack power of allies using explosives increases by 20%' And Fenn Rau does fire Explosive Missiles so does that mean Fenn Rau gets the 20% attack buff ? Is the buff only on his missiles or his normal gun firing too ? What else gets the her buff ? I know GNK droid and Grenadier get her buff, some people say the Explosive turret also gets the buff but not sure about that. Also, does allies in 2v2 get her buff ? If so then what Legendaries and Unqiues get her buff ? Baze and Chirrut both fire Explosives occasionally (Baze skill is Explosive shots), Han's mine is an explosive so does he get the buff ? So many questions regarding this and many other ambiguous buffs in the game. Netmarble, please clear this stuff up with detailed information.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Suggestion/Idea] Let players limitedly trade Unqiues/Legendaries in their guilds.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-23 17:31:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I had an idea today that i (And a guild member as well) thought Netmarble should consider, allow people to trade 1 Unqiue or a Legendary card with someone from the guild every week. You issue your trade like you request Commons and Rares and when someone who has an extra of what you want sees your trade they can request what they want in return. So when you come back online you see a pop up saying these 3~ people are willing to give you the card you requested but they want these different Unique/Legendary cards in return, and you can pick which one is the best for you and go with that trade and if you don't like those options you just wait for someone else to reply to your request. Say u have too many cards of a Unqiue or a Legendary but you don't play with it much so you don't need to upgrade it that high (Or you already have them at say lvl 3 but lvl 4 is too many cards so you wanna lvl up your lvl 1 Unqiues/Legendaries first) whereas someone might need it, or say you trade with someone who is a really good friend of yours in the guild and really needs a card that he just never opens because of poor luck so you can trade accordingly. This will make being in guilds more important, will even out bad luck a bit (As almost everyone opens some cards too much that they don't play with much and some cards not at all but they really want to play with) and also make people chat A LOT (And hence play more) more in guilds as they will need to interact with people in chat to coordinate trades. This also won't be too big of a freebie give out for Netmarble as this is only 1 trade per week and they aren't actually even giving out free Unqiues/Legendaries but are just allowing people to trade amongst each other and even out their bad luck a bit (So it's like giving out half a free card extra every week??). Also, this will make new player experience better. I had this idea today after i opened yet another U Wing (I already have it on lvl 3 and have traded 5 U wings in past 2 weeks and i just don't play with Bodhi ) while i still don't have Bossk, Eighth Brother, and a few more cards so i cant even play with them in 2v2. What do you all think about it ? if any1 has any idea on how to implement this system in an even better way pls share. If any1 wants to share this on the official forums so it's more likely to be seen by someone from Netmarble, pls do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dear netmarble, pls mix up the coop missions.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-28 12:48:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>Coop missions was a real nice addition to the game, especially cause ranked 2v2 was removed simultaneously but they are slowly starting to get boring. A way to mix stuff up is to obviously have different missions every week, not a NEW AND different mission #8203; every week, just a different one. Me and most other players i know assumed in the first week of coop missions that they will get changed every week but that never happened and Netmarble hasn't mentioned anything about mixing them up so here's hoping this thread is seen by someone from Netmarble and they consider this. A few examples of different missions off the top of my - - Destroy X no. of enemy Units. - Destroy X no. of enemy Heroes. - Destroy X no. of Organic Units. - Destroy X no. of Support Units. - Win X no. of 1v1 or 2v2 Games. - Play X no. of 2v2 or 1v1 Games. - Play X no. of support cards. - Play X no. of tech cards. These are just some examples i thought up in a few seconds and Netmarble would probably come up with better ones. Ideally every week we will have a different mission out of 4+ different missions (So we don't see the same mission twice in a month). Not all have to be equally hard, some can be harder than others but not by a very big margin.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lot of Lag past few weeks when high no. of units in field.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-12 08:33:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been facing quite a bit of lag past few weeks (Not sure when it started) when there are a lot of units in the field, this ofc doesn't generally happen during 1v1 but does happen in every game of 2v2 making it game almost unplayable. Today I was trying a somewhat swarmy 1v1 deck and was facing similar lag, unlike 2v2 the lag is a big deal in 1v1 cause I can lose points because of it. Now apparently I'm not the only one who has been facing such lag, I've seen people in my guild and on discord say that they've also been facing lag for a while now on similar high end phones like mine and on stable connections. So it seems that this might be a problem with the game either from the server side or something is bugged in the app code, I mean the game did used to run perfectly before, before when I ONLY used to play ranked 2v2. Has any1 else been facing such lag? Did you find a solution ? What kind of a device and connection do you play the game on ?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] (Theory) The Green-Eyed Angel of Death.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-10-13 18:04:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>**This is my theory on who killed Grundy and shot Fred, i might be right (I hope I am right, lol) or wrong, nonetheless spoilers incoming -** **From all the information we have after season 2 episode 1, I believe the guy with Green eyes who shot Fred and Killed Grundy is Archie's father, who is a Blossom.** I have 2 main reasons to support this -  #8226; The killer's victims and their connection. The guy intended to kill Fred and killed Grundy, the only connection between those 2 is Archie, Grundy took advantage of Archie's naiveness for her personal awful gain, and Fred well Fred must have done something wrong according to this guy. From what we know Fred hasn't done much wrong in his life except have a failed marriage and that 'DUI right after Mary left' (Which they left to be revealed in future), so he must have done something that the killer thinks is wrong or makes him hate Fred. How about he took his **Son** from him (I'll get back to this below).  #8226; The Archie and Ronnie marriage sequence, in that sequence we see Fred looking at the front row and weirdly the Blossoms are sitting in the front row and even weirdly Mary is sitting with them for some reason. The camera focuses in slomo individually on the faces of Cliff Blossom, Jason Blossom, and Mary but left out Cherly who is sitting with the three of them, weird right ? Notice the Greenish Grey eyes of Cliff and Jason. Then the killer walks into the wedding (Notice the particular camera angle, it intentionally shows the killer in the same shot, coming out from behind of Mary and the Blossoms). His eyes and face (Hidden behind the mask) were clearly shown in the episode multiple times and they are similarly Greenish Grey like Cliff and Jason's. His facial hair is also kind of visible in one his close up shots, seems to have similar eyebrows to Archie and Red facial hair like that of a Blossom. This is what I think happened, Mary cheated on Fred and Archie isn't his biological son. Notice how Archie tried to jump between Fred and the killer and but the killer still shot Fred. Archie then got really close to him, could have attacked the killer easily but the killer still didn't shoot him but he had no hesitation shooting Fred who was so far away at that time. He intended to kill Fred and didn't want to hurt Archie. Now this is the stuff we just don't have enough information to properly theorise about yet, so a lot of questions - We don't know what exactly happened between Fred and Mary, my theory is that Mary cheated on him with the Green eyed guy when they were young and 'deeply in love' and somehow he found out years later (Maybe Mary told her out of guilt), that's when he left Mary. We don't know the rest of the details about this like why Archie remained with Fred rather Mary, I would assume cause Fred considered himself Archie's real dad as he had raised him and Mary (obviously being in guilt) agreed to leave Archie with Fred. What's going on with the killer ? How come he is doing what he is now ? How did he found out ? How long has he known (I believe it isn't very long given that his attempt to murder Fred was poorly executed. Don't think he went through that one calmly and with a proper plan, his mask was home made too. The Grundy one after just a day or so was much more thought through) ? He knew about Grundy  amp; Archie, very few people know about them, did he find it through Mary, is she back with him again or is in contact with him again ? Also, if Mary did tell him recently, wouldn't the news of Grundy's death make the killer's identity clear for Mary, won't she figure it out or does she already know and is in on it ? How exactly is the Green eyed killer a Blossom ? The Blossom family is big and apparently spread around in the state, is he from the extended family or a failure of a brother of Cliff we don't know about (Would make much more sense and would be better for the story). Also, I think he he might actually kill Fred later on, around the mid season. Tell me what you guys think about this theory, is there anything else that fits in the theory that I missed, or did I get something wrong or are there any big holes in the theory that makes me delete this post. Edit : Fixed a lot of grammatical mistakes and other stuff. Also, who do you guys think this guy might try and kill now ? Is there anyone else who wronged Archie and hurt him deeply ? Edit : Forgot to mention a real neat thing I noticed, Green eyed killer kills Grundy with the Bow Archie gifted her. Makes the whole thing poetic and is another hint by the writers that the murder is about Archie.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Solution/Workaround to the L3 DRM HD playback problem, 1080p playback works.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-17 03:37:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I posted this comment in the other thread that was posted asking if 3T will ever get HD playback on Netflix and other streaming services, I am making a separate thread cause I felt like almost no one would scroll down enough to find the comment and other people *could definitely use this solution*. I use this solution for Prime Video and theoretically it should also work with Netflix. This is basically a copy paste of my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/7qrlv7/will_3t_ever_get_hd_support_for_netflix/dssnb5x/) from that thread - Here's a override to this issue, it works for **Prime Video** so it should theoretically work for Netflix too (I can't test it cause I don't have Netflix right now, I figured this method out just recently and I haven't had Netflix for a few months). I hope me discussing it here doesn't result in them fixing it - Open PrimeVideo (Or Netflix in your case) in [Ecosia Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ecosia.android) and after you open the website just request a desktop website from the menu options. It should work perfectly fine and result in 1080p HD streaming (It does for me). This also works in Firefox Nightly (Not in the Stable one, or the Beta one, you get Pop-Ups on those saying you need to fix a setting in your browser which actually doesn't exist) ***but*** even though it will start playing the videos, the videos themselves will have 1 of 2 different massive visual artifact issues that happen. I have tried many many browsers and in almost all of them this doesn't work, you get some or the other pop-up disallowing the video to play. Only other browser I know where this worked for me is Microsoft Edge but that also started showing the error pop-up after 2~ days for some reason. I have tried this method on 3 different 1080p HD screen phones which all have L3 DRM limit and on all three this worked so this should work on the 3, 5, 5T or any other such phone too. Someone lemme know if this works with Netflix or not, i might get Netflix back again if this works with Netflix. And I really hope they fix this soon. I'm just so sick and tired of this DRM bullshit. You pay for an expensive high resolution phone, you pay for a high bandwidth connection and then you pay for a streaming service that provides high resolution streaming and still you have to fucking watch stuff in 20 year old standard resolution.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone owns Redgear Invader MK881 Kalih Brown, Is it any good?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-05 17:55:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I have never owned a mechanical keyboard and have been getting into playing Overwatch a lot past few months and am seriously considering buying a mechanical keyboard. After some research into what kind of mechanical switches are good and what offerings are available in India around 3K~ (Even upto 5K) it seems that the Redgear Mk881 is the best option with the Kailh Brown switches, which are supposedly really good now. Upon a lot of researching around on Reddit I learnt that Brown switches are generally the best for gaming and that Kailh actually makes better switches than Cherry MX past year or two and even though their Box range is their best offering, their regular switches are really good and the Kailh Browns also got a quality bump around a year or two ago. I couldn't find a lot of reviews of the Kailh Brown version on Amazon and want someone who actually owns it to tell me what their experience has been like. Are they good for gaming or not? Also, how does the RGB lighting looks IRL? I have seen many photos and videos of it now and it just looks really tacky and ugly to me. I wish they had just sold single solid colour variants. And are the keys easily reprogrammable? I saw that it doesn't have volume keys and that's a problem. If someone has any other suggestions for gaming keyboards in around 3K~ range then I am open to suggestions. I am also open to waiting for new launches if there are any rumours of any new cheap mechanical keyboards coming out or if Redgear is going to release any keyboards soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They said the next big patch (For which the preload is already out) will be the 'remaster' patch with supposed performance changes and some improvements but the current PTR feels exactly the same as the current live patch in terms of performance. I am getting the same FPS drops and same overall FPS on PTR as I do on live (Live is actually a bit better in terms of FPS and drops), so what gives? No real performance optimization in the 'Remaster' patch or can the game not be further optimized and a lot of players are holding onto false hope? Edit : Would also like to add that I do play on a pretty low-end laptop, 'constrained' as they put it, and the load times are also the same. No noticeable improvement.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Save your OWL tokens for the All-Star weekend.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-19 15:29:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last year Blizzard unexpectedly released 2 special All-Star skins (Tracer and Genji) during the OWL All-Star weekend that cost 200 (300 tokens initially, then price was reduced after outrage) tokens each. They'll very likely do the same this year, plus we might see some random emote drop like the Lucio emote from last year. The All-Star weekend is happening after Stage 2 this season, you are guaranteed (If you watch all the OWL games ofc) to have earned 720 (72 per week for 10 weeks) tokens by the time stage 2 ends. Good chance we'll be able to earn a bit more from days when games go on for longer and from random 100 token drops (For those who are eligible) but still should take 700~ tokens as a solid sure amount one can earn. Skins will most probably cost 200 each, if they release 2 like last year that'll be 400 right there and if they put out last year's skins for sale again (Hopefully discounted now for 100 each instead of 200) that'll be 600 tokens required for either 3 or 4 skins (Depending if they discount last year's skins or not). So, if you aren't hardcore about supporting a team or don't really *love* the regular team skins, I'll suggest saving your tokens for the All-Star weekend for the All-Star skins. Last year's skins were really high quality and some of the most unique skins they have ever released. Also, you'll earn 720+ more tokens in stage 3  amp; 4 and can then buy some team skins from those. Or you can just pay for the skins. 4Head</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I had my Y540 order placed 6 days ago, with an i5-9300H and a 144Hz panel. Initially the shipping was 3-4 weeks and an additional 3-5 days for delivery, after just 6 days the order has already been delayed by 5 days from the original final delivery date. Anyone know if this is an ongoing issue with Lenovo y540s and the chances that I'll get it in the first week of July(The original delivery date) or not? If I can't get it by then then I have to cancel the order altogether because someone is getting it for me from the US. This will truly suck cause this laptop will easily cost 50% more if I get it from my country and I don't see many good alternatives I can get from other companies right now at this price point. Asus has a couple of choices but they have mediocre screens with bad colour accuracy, and the thermals are mediocre too.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSE1 (Singapore servers) have been randomly shutting down games and acting up for almost a week now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-20 21:48:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>Every single day for the past week comp games on Singapore servers (PSE1, NA region, PC) have been crashing and ping spiking for all players in many games. Just had a game where a massive ping spike happened in round 1, point B Hanamura with around 5 mins left. Everything started lagging and screens got frozen for everyone, everyone started freaking out in game chat, then after 5-10 seconds 7/12 players got thrown away from the game. Past few days whenever this has happened the game has eventually (Within 30~ seconds or so) kicked out everyone and then I get a message saying 'Server shut down due to unexpected error', but in this game that I just had the server didn't kick me and 4 other players (1 on my team, 3 on enemy team) and we had to finish the match. The kicked out players were able to talk in game chat after 30-40 seconds (From their game main menus) and they were all saying they can't rejoin the game. Servers crashing is one issue but just in general a lot of games have been having ping spikes where everyone starts lagging like hell at the same time. I have noticed that usually happens around final few mins of the match. Something like this, if it were to happen on one of the American servers, would result in a riot starting within hours on both this and the COW sub. Now I know Singapore servers are smaller and less important to Blizzard so it's understandable that the issue isn't fixed quickly, but it's been happening for like a week now and Blizzard hasn't fixed it yet, neither have publicly acknowledged the issue. Really hoping this post motivates Blizzard to fix this issue fast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a few years ago Netflix was praised for almost never cancelling shows, even their lowest watched shows which they cancelled, they gave them a final season as a goodbye. Fast forward 3-4 years and Netflix is now ridiculed for cancelling too many shows, even though they have massive competition incoming from the likes of Disney and others and need a lot of original content that has fanbases. They are cancelling these shows with loyal fanbases and losing long time customers because of that. I wonder what's their exact strategy here, continually upsetting loyal customers can't possibly be good for business, especially when they have such fierce competition incoming.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>With the original 2 year contract between Blizzard  amp; Twitch for streaming rights of OWL ending soon, what changes do you wanna see going forward?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-26 20:45:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>https://www.espn.in/esports/story/_/id/22015103/overwatch-league-broadcast-twitchtv-two-year-90-million-deal Blizzard signed a 2 year long deal giving Twitch streaming rights for S1 and S2 of OWL, now that that's ending soon, what do you guys think they should change or keep the same if they renew their contract with Twitch? I personally want 2 main things, I think Blizzard should start airing Contenders on the OWL league channel whenever possible, which they never do currently. It really is a shame to see contenders being promoted so little that it gets a couple of thousand of viewers on average when OWL is getting over 100k just on their main channel. Right now, it seems like Twitch forces Blizzard to re-air a certain minimum requirement of hours of OWL on the OWL channel but with contenders never airing at the same time as OWL and rumours that Blizzard might be forcing all teams to make Academy teams, imo they should start airing Contenders on the OWL channel whenever it's on instead of OWL reruns. Second thing I want is for Blizzard to come up with some way to allow streamers to restream OWL. Right now it's completely disallowed, but if they could come up with some way to allow it, like maybe sell the OWL pass through streamers' channels whenever they are restreaming OWL, it would hugely benefit the viewership of the league. They can maybe give a cut to the streamer if a viewer purchases the pass while watching them restream OWL or something like that. Even if this is just a simply bad idea, I'm sure they can figure something else out, but imo they should definitely try and figure something out to allow streamers to restream OWL. Right now when OWL goes live most OW streamers don't even bother streaming cause they know their viewership numbers will drop and a lot of them also like watching the league so they don't like streaming when it's on. If they allow restreaming, streamers will have the option to stream when OWL is on and potentially even get better viewership than they regularly do, while simultaneously getting more eyes onto OWL and potentially bringing in more money for it and themselves. This can also lead to Blizzard allowing their OWL players who aren't playing in the arena that day to restream OWL, make more money for the league, for themselves. Right now all their players are disallowed from streaming when OWL is on so they don't eat into OWL viewership, but imo they can add to more viewership if they were allowed to restream. Again, Blizzard should come up with a way to sell OWL passes through all their channels, maybe even give out tokens. Edit : I also wanted to see more quality options. Like they should definitely be airing OWL at a higher bitrate for the 'Source' option, like the MLG stream. Maybe make the current 'Source 1080p@60' a second lower bitrate option and also raise the bitrate for the current 720p@60 and the regular 720p. And also add a 1080p@30 option.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-30 17:08:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I think most of us here will agree that last year's performance was really bad and imo kinda painful to watch. Esports has kind of developed a tradition to have really unique and cool performances at the finals of all big events. Like the performances at TIs and League finals. But what we got at last year's OWL finals was an awful, last-minute thrown performance by an "Artist" whose music isn't really popular in the gaming community. Even the casters and hosts have taken jabs at that performance a few times during OWL this year. The finals will most probably be the most watched stream of the season, more people will likely be watching the finals than any of the other days of OWL S2 so I'm really hoping the OWL team can put together an entertaining event with an actually decent music performance.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facing a really weird and frustrating Low GPU usage and Low FPS issue only in multiplayer modes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-23 13:54:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>Edit : So I was just playing around with render scale and discovered that setting it to 150% instantly forces my GPU to work normally, goes to 90%+ loads and starts giving me 200+ FPS while I am getting 100~ FPS on 100% render scale and GPU load won't go above 40% on 100% render scale. So there is definitely something dictating the GPU to stay under 40% GPU load in Overwatch if at 100% render scale. This post was originally meant for /r/Nvidia but I'm copy pasting it here as I'm desperate for a solution and willing to try my luck wherever possible. TLDR : RTX 2060 won't go over 40% usage and is giving piss poor FPS only in multiplayer games' modes (Competitive Overwatch Ranked) which have 10~+ people on the map. Not bottlenecked by the rest of my hardware, everything was working perfectly until a week ago. So I've been facing this issue for over a week now, which is when i noticed a big FPS drop while playing Overwatch and looked at the top left of my screen to see that I was currently at 90 fps and it was fluctuating between that and low 100s, max 150~ sometimes. Rivatuner showed GPU wouldn't go over 40% (Fluctuating between 25-40%) load. Temps for the both the GPU and CPU were also much lower than they used to be (Because the CPU and GPU share a heat pipe in the laptop and also CPU was barely over 50% usage). These are my specs btw, I have a Lenovo y540 laptop, specs - i5-9300H (Quad core 4.1Ghz), RTX 2060, 16 Gb ram (8x2, 2666Mhz), 512gb NVME SSD that gives me 3.5~Gb reads and 2.5~gb writes. My regular Overwatch settings are everything on Low but Texture quality, Texture filtering and Anti-aliasing on Max. With these settings i used to get 250-300 fps on every single map, in every single regular game mode and GPU load was high (70s-80s-90s) with CPU load generally around 70%. So after I noticed the low FPS and low GPU usage, after that game ended I went into training range and my FPS was back to normal, 300 fps stable, drops at 280s-290s sometimes, high GPU usage, perfect. So then I went into a quick play game and as soon as the game started the load again dropped below 40%, CPU was still in 50-70% like it normally is when outputting high FPS in Overwatch. Temps were much lower. I thought about what could be the issue as I hadn't really tinkered with any settings on my laptop for weeks and there had been no Nvidia Driver updates, no updates from Lenovo or Windows updates. Only Overwatch was updated in the last week or two. So I switched to Apex Legends to confirm that it is Overwatch issue, and that's when things got really weird as in Apex too my GPU wouldn't go over 40% (In Apex actually, i did see it go to high usage for a few seconds in between, but the rest of the time it was stuck under 40%) and fluctuated between 25-40%. I was getting piss poor FPS, 50-60s is some places and Max of low 100s, while I generally got over 150 most of the time before. My Apex settings are mostly very low, I don't play this game much so I don't remember them off the top of my head. So after 1 match of Apex Legends, in which I noticed the same issue, I went into its training range and I started getting 200+ fps instantly, high GPU usage, butter fucking smooth, exactly like it used to be before. Then I tried another game and as soon as the actual game started (Not in the character select screen, where it actually did give high GPU usage) the GPU plummeted to below 40%. So now I believed it was an issue with my PC somehow as both the games were behaving the same way. Next day I tried reducing my Undervolt in Throttlestop, disabling Undervolt altogether, uninstalled XTU just in case it was doing something weird (Idk much about XTU, I just use throttlestop, I just had it installed). Removed my GPU OC in Afterburner, none of that helped. Then I tried OW again but decided to try an arcade mode (FFA Deathmatch) and surprisingly GPU usage was perfect while playing it, high usage, basically over 280 fps at all times. So I tried a QP again and it was back to under 40%. After that i tried a custom game from the game browser, a Sniper Headshot only FFA and I was getting perfect FPS and high GPU usage in that. Then I decided to try a few other tests. Started off with testing GPU in benchmarks and stress tests, worked perfectly in Furmark, worked perfectly in 3Dmark demo and worked perfectly in Heaven, exactly like it used to and is supposed to. Then I tried Metro Exodus and that was working perfectly too, stared a new game, 97%+ GPU usage, 50-60-70% CPU usage (Early on in the game it doesn't take much CPU), everything on Ultra, RTX On at second highest setting. Was getting around 70 FPS, tested for 5~ mins. So now I've determined that the GPU works perfectly in single player games, in benchmarks and in multiplayer games with low amount of players on the map, but as soon you get into a multiplayer game with 10~+ people on the map, GPU locks itself below 40% usage. Since then I've tried uninstalling my GPU drivers using DDU and doing a clean install of a previous version of the drivers **(THIS ACTUALLY FIXED THE ISSUE FOR ONE QP GAME OF OW, THEN IT CAME BACK THE NEXT GAME, ACTUALLY FML!)**, I've also tried the latest drivers. I've set the GPU to Max performance in NVCP, Windows is set to Max performance too. I've also rolled back drivers for WiFi. Rolled back to an older version of BIOS. I've rebooted my PC over 30 times in the past week trying to fix things. I've also disabled HPET (High Precision Event Timer) in Windows Device manager. I've Scanned and Repaired Overwatch, I've uninstalled and reinstalled Overwatch, I've tried 2 different internet connections, I've tried disabling every single software I have running in the back and I still haven't found a solution. Here's another batshit thing, i am actually getting high GPU usage and very stable 150-170 FPS in Overwatch if I switch to all Epic (Max) settings, which is pretty much supposed to be the best FPS this laptop can produce in OW on Epic settings. So Epic settings are somehow forcing the GPU to perform normally, but Low settings aren't and neither are Medium settings ( I tried that too). I've googled about this issue and I actually found a few old threads about it on Blizzard forums, people facing the exact same issue for years now, a few of them get it solved by doing random things like disabling HPET but a lot of them have never found a solution. Also, a lot of them face the issue on brand new hardware, but my laptop was giving me perfectly high FPS until a *week ago!* Also in my case, I am facing the issue in both Apex and Overwatch, two completely different games from completely different companies, running in different engines, only in multiplayer modes with a lot of people on the map, while AAA single player games like Metro are working perfectly, so are benchmarks and stress tests. And I'm clearly not bottlenecked by my CPU or SSD or Ram (I have a mere few softwares running in the back when playing, no Chrome, nothing heavy at all, get less than 50% RAM usage at all times when playing either of the two games). I am desperate for help, I mainly bought this laptop for online multiplayer games, I am not a huge fan of Single player games. Ofc I want to play some of them, especially the RTX ones, but mainly online multiplayer games. Reinstalling Windows is one of the last few things I have left to try but it is such a massive pain, I really don't want to unless I have tried every other possible solution. Any help would be appreciated. I'm also going to start a ticket with Blizzard support later tonight when I get home from work.</TEXT>

I was getting piss poor FPS, 50-60s is some places and Max of low 100s, while I generally got over 150 most of the time before. My Apex settings are mostly very low, I don't play this game much so I don't remember them off the top of my head. So after 1 match of Apex Legends, in which I noticed the same issue, I went into its training range and I started getting 200+ fps instantly, high GPU usage, butter fucking smooth, exactly like it used to be before. Then I tried another game and as soon as the actual game started (Not in the character select screen, where it actually did give high GPU usage) the GPU plummeted to below 40%. So now I believed it was an issue with my PC somehow as both the games were behaving the same way. Next day I tried reducing my Undervolt in Throttlestop, disabling Undervolt altogether, uninstalled XTU just in case it was doing something weird (Idk much about XTU, I just use throttlestop, I just had it installed). Removed my GPU OC in Afterburner, none of that helped. Then I tried OW again but decided to try an arcade mode (FFA Deathmatch) and surprisingly GPU usage was perfect while playing it, high usage, basically over 280 fps at all times. So I tried a QP again and it was back to under 40%. After that i tried a custom game from the game browser, a Sniper Headshot only FFA and I was getting perfect FPS and high GPU usage in that. Then I decided to try a few other tests. Started off with testing GPU in benchmarks and stress tests, worked perfectly in Furmark, worked perfectly in 3Dmark demo and worked perfectly in Heaven, exactly like it used to and is supposed to. Then I tried Metro Exodus and that was working perfectly too, stared a new game, 97%+ GPU usage, 50-60-70% CPU usage (Early on in the game it doesn't take much CPU), everything on Ultra, RTX On at second highest setting. Was getting around 70 FPS, tested for 5~ mins. So now I've determined that the GPU works perfectly in single player games, in benchmarks and in multiplayer games with low amount of players on the map, but as soon you get into a multiplayer game with 10~+ people on the map, GPU locks itself below 40% usage. Since then I've tried uninstalling my GPU drivers using DDU and doing a clean install of a previous version of the drivers **(THIS ACTUALLY FIXED THE ISSUE FOR ONE QP GAME OF OW, THEN IT CAME BACK THE NEXT GAME, ACTUALLY FML!)**, I've also tried the latest drivers. I've set the GPU to Max performance in NVCP, Windows is set to Max performance too. I've also rolled back drivers for WiFi. Rolled back to an older version of BIOS. I've rebooted my PC over 30 times in the past week trying to fix things. I've also disabled HPET (High Precision Event Timer) in Windows Device manager. I've Scanned and Repaired Overwatch, I've uninstalled and reinstalled Overwatch, I've tried 2 different internet connections, I've tried disabling every single software I have running in the back and I still haven't found a solution. Here's another batshit thing, i am actually getting high GPU usage and very stable 150-170 FPS in Overwatch if I switch to all Epic (Max) settings, which is pretty much supposed to be the best FPS this laptop can produce in OW on Epic settings. So Epic settings are somehow forcing the GPU to perform normally, but Low settings aren't and neither are Medium settings ( I tried that too). I've googled about this issue and I actually found a few old threads about it on Blizzard forums, people facing the exact same issue for years now, a few of them get it solved by doing random things like disabling HPET but a lot of them have never found a solution. Also, a lot of them face the issue on brand new hardware, but my laptop was giving me perfectly high FPS until a *week ago!* Also in my case, I am facing the issue in both Apex and Overwatch, two completely different games from completely different companies, running in different engines, only in multiplayer modes with a lot of people on the map, while AAA single player games like Metro are working perfectly, so are benchmarks and stress tests. And I'm clearly not bottlenecked by my CPU or SSD or Ram (I have a mere few softwares running in the back when playing, no Chrome, nothing heavy at all, get less than 50% RAM usage at all times when playing either of the two games). I am desperate for help, I mainly bought this laptop for online multiplayer games, I am not a huge fan of Single player games. Ofc I want to play some of them, especially the RTX ones, but mainly online multiplayer games. Reinstalling Windows is one of the last few things I have left to try but it is such a massive pain, I really don't want to unless I have tried every other possible solution. Any help would be appreciated. I'm also going to start a ticket with Blizzard support later tonight when I get home from work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Facing a weird low GPU usage and Low FPS issue only in online multiplayer games' multiplayer modes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-23 15:34:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>This post was originally meant for /r/Nvidia but I'm copy pasting it here as I'm desperate for a solution and willing to try my luck wherever possible. TLDR : RTX 2060 won't go over 40% usage and is giving piss poor FPS only in multiplayer games' modes (Competitive Overwatch Ranked) which have 10~+ people on the map. Not bottlenecked by the rest of my hardware, everything was working perfectly until a week ago. So I've been facing this issue for over a week now, which is when i noticed a big FPS drop while playing Overwatch and looked at the top left of my screen to see that I was currently at 90 fps and it was fluctuating between that and low 100s, max 150~ sometimes. Rivatuner showed GPU wouldn't go over 40% (Fluctuating between 25-40%) load. Temps for the both the GPU and CPU were also much lower than they used to be (Because the CPU and GPU share a heat pipe in the laptop and also CPU was barely over 50% usage). These are my specs btw, I have a Lenovo y540 laptop, specs - i5-9300H (Quad core 4.1Ghz), RTX 2060, 16 Gb ram (8x2, 2666Mhz), 512gb NVME SSD that gives me 3.5~Gb reads and 2.5~gb writes. Latest Windows 1903. My regular Overwatch settings are everything on Low but Texture quality, Texture filtering and Anti-aliasing on Max. With these settings i used to get 250-300 fps on every single map, in every single regular game mode and GPU load was high (70s-80s-90s) with CPU load generally around 70%. So after I noticed the low FPS and low GPU usage, after that game ended I went into training range and my FPS was back to normal, 300 fps stable, drops at 280s-290s sometimes, high GPU usage, perfect. So then I went into a quick play game and as soon as the game started the load again dropped below 40%, CPU was still in 50-70% like it normally is when outputting high FPS in Overwatch. Temps were much lower. I thought about what could be the issue as I hadn't really tinkered with any settings on my laptop for weeks and there had been no Nvidia Driver updates, no updates from Lenovo or Windows updates. Only Overwatch was updated in the last week or two. So I switched to Apex Legends to confirm that it is Overwatch issue, and that's when things got really weird as in Apex too my GPU wouldn't go over 40% (In Apex actually, i did see it go to high usage for a few seconds in between, but the rest of the time it was stuck under 40%) and fluctuated between 25-40%.

Edit : So I was just playing around with render scale and discovered that setting it to 150% instantly forces my GPU to work normally, goes to 90%+ loads and starts giving me 200+ FPS while I am getting 100~ FPS on 100% render scale and GPU load won't go above 40% on 100% render scale. So there is definitely something dictating the GPU to stay under 40% GPU load in Overwatch if at 100% render scale. Edit 2 : Blizz support basically refused to help as I am getting at least 60 Fps at all times. They consider that 'working fine'.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just a thought. They did a big round of Blizzard skins last year, nothing this year. They also cut down on Legendary skins for the Summer event and Jeff said to expect similar amount of skins for Halloween (4, instead of 6), so their Art and Cosmetics team might potentially be working on a big round of Nintendo X Overwatch crossover skins. Again, all this is ofc based on the validity of the rumour that Overwatch is coming to Switch in the first place.</TEXT>

Remember that a big number of player contracts are gonna expire with the end of this season and players are gonna move around to different teams. So it is a legitimate possibility that you might not get to meet your fav players next year at the homestand you are buying tickets for, even though according to their current teams and the schedule it looks like you will. Just a heads up. Better to be aware of this stuff before buying expensive passes than to be disappointed months later when players start moving around.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The new player experience of this game is absolutely awful right now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-03 12:55:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>You play a small nice introduction for an hour or so then you are thrown in this Hub pace with no direction at all on what you are supposed to do or how. Not even basic MMO guidance like Quest markers above the heads of the characters or simple guiding like 'Go talk to XYZ'. Also all these shops with items and stuff, most of which are named in a very non-standard manner, super confusing. I approached the character close to where I was spawned and clicked on different planets until it allowed me to go on a mission, in which I got absolutely destroyed along with the other 2 randoms within 2 mins. Had no idea how to continue the campaign I was playing before the Steam move happened, which I was an hour into, my character had just been thrown from a ship by the main villain and ended up really injured. The character got transferred but when I started the game I had to play this New Light introduction campaign and then was thrown in the Hub. After getting a headache trying to figure out what am I supposed to do I found this purple ball in the hub, played with it a few mins (lol) and then shut the game down and just played Overwatch for the rest of the tonight. Today I asked in the Discord server and some really nice people helped me immediately. Apparently I have to find and talk to this character named Amanda to be able to do campaigns. Someone also gave me a link to a 15 min basic guide video. What is this awful new player experience Bungie? How are you expecting to attract new players to your freshly F2P turned game when you don't even have basic guiding and tutorials in the game. How is any new player supposed to know what Glimmer is? Why is this Amanda character not the closest character to where a new player spawns in the Hub? You have this amazing looking game with great gunplay, pls do it better justice Edit : I do not approve of needing guides to learn the very basics of how a game works, because it's 2019 and all games should be doing a better job than that, *especially the ones going F2P after many years with a ton of content.* That being if you are like me and you are hooked on the slick gameplay already then you should probably read up [this starting guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Guide/Destiny2) by Bungie and/or [this video guide](https://youtu.be/LixYuJw9jjE) by the YouTuber Houndish.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why does the Eververse store not have regional pricing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-08 08:42:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry, I'm new to the game, hence not very knowledgeable. I asked around in Discord but no one knows the answer to this question. Forsaken, SK and SK Deluxe all have regional pricing on their Steam pages. SK Deluxe will cost me 1300 INR ($18~) but everything in the Eververse store (Purchases from which also go through Steam) inside the game does not seem to have regional pricing. Season Pass through the Eververse store shows up for 800 INR for me ($10~). Is there a particular reason why Eververse doesn't have regional pricing? Is there any chance this will change in the future? Eververse prices just seem really unfair, I can pay 1300 INR on Steam for the whole SK DLC and 4 season passes but 1 season pass or 1000 Silver through Eververse is 800 INR.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just don't like doing PvE content solo, it's boring. Haven't done Forsaken campaign yet, just bought it a week ago. Have played Shadowkeep till around the halfway mark but I'll be willing to redo that part if you haven't done it. Reply if interested.

    <TITLE>Some Important Info from the Dev Q amp;A that didn't make news rounds and people might have missed.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-08 11:41:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's the link I got from the COW subreddit, for anyone who wants to watch the whole thing - https://youtu.be/FCjSfyPaj14 Most important info that I haven't seen going around - 1st - OW and OW2 will be on the same client. OW2 owners will have exclusive access to all the heroes' 'New looks' (The new default skins), both OW and OW2 owners will have access to the 'Classic Default' skins for all heroes. For new heroes that will come with OW2, I'd assume they'll just have one Default skin and everyone will have access to those. 2nd - Only thing OW2 owners will have *exclusive* access to is all the PvE stuff and the 'New looks'. This includes Story missions, all of the PvE progression, Hero missions and PvE cosmetics (More on this below). 3rd - PvE will also have a Cosmetics Reward Progression system and 'A lot of comsetic rewards' in Jeff's own words. This I think they should have mentioned on the main stage but didn't for whatever reason (Probably business). 4th - On New maps and Heroes - They said that OW2 will launch with *multiple new* maps for all PvP game modes so at the very least 10 (5x2) according to simple maths. Of which they've shown 4 (Not including the ones they might've shown in the gameplay cinematic but didn't officially reveal). For heroes they said they'll release a bunch with OW2 (For a big impact) but not quite as much as how many OW originally launched with (21). They'll release at least 1 new hero before OW2 releases. 5th and last important thing I can remember from the video - The current hero ability upgrade system is only a small part of the PvE progression system that will be in the final game. Also, someone asked if heroes' looks will change depending on the ability upgrades they have equipped and they said no. Smaller but still important stuff for a lot of people -  #8226; They said that currently they have no plans to rework any existing hero but OW2 is still a ways away and such a big release is a good time to reconsider everything so their stance on reworks can change. Lead engineer said 'It's a pain in the ass' technically.  #8226; Hero missions will be playable on every single map that exists in the game with all the different enemy types they'll have (Talon, Null sector, whatever else) and with every single hero in the game. They'll have different objectives, 3 examples they said were 'Holdout', 'Kill the Lieutenant' and 'Escort'. Probably the types they are internally working on, not set in stone.  #8226; Story missions will have a curated roster, they are experimenting with more choices depending on the mission.  #8226; After all the things they cleared up, they gave another weird answer about OW being updated to the updated engine. Lead Engineer said that it'll get updated, doesn't know if it'll be the day-of (release of OW2) or before or after. Which makes no sense to me as it'll have to be the same day or how will corssplay work. The same guy himself said that it'll be a single client earlier in the Q amp;A.  #8226; Someone asked if original OW owners will get a discount on OW2 purchase or anything like that and Jeff said that no monetisation decisions have been made yet.  #8226; You'll be able to get into the training range with your friends while in Queue with the next PTR patch that'll come next week.  #8226; More PvE story content will release post OW2 launch.  #8226; No yes or no for Crossplay and Corss-progression, they said they are looking at it. Might've forgotten some stuff, lemme know.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Let vendors like Shaxx sell temporary Catalyst Scavenging Boosters for a high amount of tokens.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-18 11:25:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Having catalysts drop feels like one of rarest thing in this game to me(Especially some particular ones), let vendors sell Cata Scavenging boosters that temporarily (say for 48 hours as an example) increase the chances (say by 50%-100%, 1% becomes 1.5-2%, .1% becomes .2%) of finding catalysts. It'll also tempt (Not *force*, which is important) players to play different activities more in order to have a better chance of finding catalysts that drop from those activities. I'll gladly pay 500 Shaxx or Zavala or Banshee tokens to have a bit more control over acquiring catalysts a couple of times a month. Currently it feels like I have little to no control over finding catalysts and it's just a completely random (Because the chances for a lot of catas dropping is apparently extremely low) and extremely rare thing that happens. Vendor tokens also feel rather useless right now so this system will make them more important.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A PvP 'Madness mode' and a matchmade PvE activity with no exotic limits would be insane fun imo.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-25 06:27:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So many Exotics just sitting in everyone's vaults barely being used because they aren't meta or they are very niche. This issue is further amplified by the fact that metas can take months to change and a lot of Legendary weapons are as good or better than Exotics of the same weapon types, plus the weapons take mods which Exotic weapons don't. If the game had just one casual PvP mode (Even just in rotation) and one casual PvE mode that had no exotics limits, that would be fantastic imo. For PvE something like a new matchmade version of the Menagerie can be added or Vex Offensive can be brought back (Or both and others can be in rotation), made more harder to compensate for no Exotic limits. Reprised versions of existing activities is perfectly good imo. No Exotic limits will also further fulfill the God mode fantasy that is at the core of this game and allow for some truly crazy loadout building and experimentation. No need to have any special rewards, just an emblem will do but I won't say no to some special ornaments tied to rewards (Triumphs maybe?) for playing the modes. But I wouldn't want any actual new special weapons or armor pieces as rewards for such game modes as they'll be wacky af and forcing people to play such modes for exclusive gear won't be fair.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Wealth Of The Emperor Buff is bugged since new patch.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-16 06:15:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Don't know if this has been acknowledged by Bungie or not, don't know where I can check an official Known Issues list but this Buff is bugged since the new patch. I have 2 of these buffs consumed (Thought consuming a second one might fix the bug or something, worth a try) since Tuesday and neither have triggered yet in dozens of Crucible, Gambit and Strike games. Other people in the Destiny discord have been mentioning the same bug as well. I imagine this has something to do with the addition of a new currency also dropping the same way as these Imperials (Fractalines). I'm very close to fully upgrading my Chalice so this isn't a *huge* issue for me but I can imagine this'll be very irritating for other players who aren't close to fully upgrading their chalice. Especially cause Izanagi's is so meta and obtaining its Catalyst requires the fully upgraded chalice.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Pinnacle Weapons were too strong and unique to be Legendaries so they were changed to Rituals, but Rituals feel too mediocre to be special weapons.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-12 10:31:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>According to Bungie, Pinnacles Weapons too dominant  amp; strong to be legendary weapons and i agree with that. They also took up unique Exotic level perks and unique weapon models, which means they took additional resources but they did genuinely feel great to earn even through the grindy  amp; sometimes difficult quests and they were *actually worth using.* Rituals (Especially this season's) feel mediocre at best, not especially worth getting and also not very unique, their quests have also been toned down as a result. These weapons have also not shaken up the meta, let alone dominate it and this is likely not going to change (Either PvE or PvP). I am not a fan of the change to Rituals. But this change was also likely less resource intensive for Bungie (Komodo uses the same weapon model as 5 other Legendary/Blue Linear Fusion Rifles, only Legendary Linear Fusion that has a unique model is the new Sundial Linear Fusion) I loved the feeling of finishing a grindy  amp; stupid Pinnacle quest and to actually get a special, unique and powerful legendary weapon as a result. Rituals currently do not give this feeling and Bungie has also nerfed a lot of older Pinnacles to tone down their power level. Here's my idea to bring back Pinnacles while also making sure they don't dominate the meta for too long while also not being super resource intensive for Bungie - Release Pinnacles with a retirement timer on them, say 1 to 2 seasons long, after which the Pinnacle weapon will no longer be usable or acquirable. In the same patch the Pinnacle is Retired a new Exotic version of that Pinnacle can be released with a similar but more/less grindy version of the same quest as before. The Exotic version can have the same gun model and perk as the Pinnacle but maybe just a little more buffed up or with a small twist and the Model can have a few small tweaks (Maybe a new Ornament/Skin on it) to show that the weapon is an improved version of the Pinnacle. This way Bungie can have a Pinnacle and an Exotic with pretty much the same perk, quest and weapon model and hence the resource investment of only one unique weapon. People who'll miss out the Pinnacle as it will be timed can always just acquire and use the Exotic version of it so they won't miss out too much. As the Pinnacles will retire after 3-6 months they won't dominate the meta for too long even if they are really powerful. Next season a new batch of Pinnacles can come in to potentially shake up the meta once again. I wanna know what everyone else thinks of this idea and if anyone else has any other ideas to bring back Pinnacles. Rituals just feel really underwhelming to me, I have vaulted most of them very fast after getting them.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The design of the Grave/Emblem Room legit looks like the logo of Bungie's Marathon.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-16 18:15:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was one of the people who was completely dismissing the whole 'Marathon' in Bungie's tweet being a hint idea until an hour ago when i saw a thread in this subreddit by /u/Shibeeb claiming that the Grave room looks like Osiris's symbol, then someone else commented that it actually looks like Marathon's logo. Here's the thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/eplauy/the_last_room_of_the_corridors_of_time_grave_room/ He hadn't provided aerial screenshots of the room so i went ahead and got some. https://imgur.com/7j0dWOr https://imgur.com/BsfFpD7 Marathon's Logo - https://favpng.com/png_view/symbol-marathon-video-games-symbol-halo-4-minecraft-png/AeiLDs6U https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_(video_game)#/media/File:Marathon_(video_game).jpg I've never played Marathon or any Bungie game before Destiny 2, didn't even know it existed until yesterday, so I'm hoping someone more familiar with the game can give these a look. Maybe it's a preplanned Jebait that Bungie designed to release since the beginning, when they started designing this quest? But we also haven't figured out the legit way of solving this puzzle (We're brute forcing it) and looking back in time (Marathon) for the solution also goes along with Corridors of Time taking us back into time. Idk. Someone smarter pls give this a look.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-25 15:05:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>*Rant warning* Seriously, it's straight up insulting that you guys believe you can blatantly lie to our faces about the maps being genuinely improved (Or even changed in any substantial manner) and the playerbase will just accept that. Please don't try the same again next season. Rotating maps to make PvP feel artificially different every season is okay, it's barely acceptable, but at least don't bullshit us by saying your team took out the maps to work on them and then putting them back in with minor changes and no real issues actually being addressed It's especially insulting because you claim you need to 'take out the maps' while you fix them, implying that you believe that they are in such an awful state that you don't want players to play on them anymore before they are fixed, yet you are doing it on the seasonal cycle as if this is supposed to be actual 'content' for PvP and the issues aren't actually important in your eyes. Meanwhile exotics are being re-added asap (Mid season) once game breaking bugs with them are fixed.</TEXT>

Works in PvE too but obviously not that big of a deal there. Not sharing the full exploit for obvious reasons. Bungie will know where to find it. Post is for visibility so they hopefully take fast action, there's enough officially sanctioned bullshit in PvP already. Also pls Bungie, for the love of ~~God~~ Tess, Invest more resources in QA testing and bug fixing. The amount of big bugs in this season has been insane and almost comical.

    <TEXT>Maybe because of SBMM I wasn't ending up in lobbies with so many players like these before and now I am, or its something else but it's just Truth and Xenophage every game, almost every single invasion. Pretty much no counterplay at all, every invasion it is someone with Truth or Xeno and you just try to hide and if u hide well enough u survive otherwise you just die pretty much every invasion. SBMM in Gambit is not really based on skill, more so based on if you have Truth or Xeno. Is there anyone at Bungie except Dmg playing this game anymore? Especially Gambit and PvP. How do you guys can possibly think weapons like these and Gambit in its current state is any fun? I just don't get it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>It's been months now, Forges matchmaking is still broken.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-09 23:57:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been playing this game since it went F2P in October, Forge MM was broken then and is still broken now. I've seen this reported a while ago and a community manager even read and replied to that comment, yet no update regarding it nor has it been fixed. Like half the time the game tries to find you players to do a Forge with but randomly stops and puts you in Solo (Sometimes after mins, sometimes after a few seconds). Some rare times it'll put in more players after the run starts, but most often you'll just keep doing the run solo and probably fail because Forges are really hard to do solo. Just today it took me like 45-60 mins to get to do a single proper run for a Hammerhead (Which was an awful roll that I sharded instantly). Similar often happens in Crucible during Iron Banner when matches starts 4v4, 3v4 or 4v5 even though the game finder screen shows you that it has found a full lobby before the match starting, then 1 or more people on your team leaves instantly cause they don't wanna play 3v4 and I don't blame them. As a solo player with limited play time and someone who is still trying to get good rolls on most BA weapons (Which is a stupidly slow process anyway, especially compared to Menagerie or Sundial), the broken Forge MM has been a massive time waster *and incredibly annoying.* Also it would hugely appreciated if the process to acquire good rolls of BA weapons wasn't so slow and obnoxious in the first place.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-13 06:57:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>An Exotic Shell named 'Sugary Shell' that is acquired from doing Crimson Days Triumps. Hadn't seen anyone mention this at all and I myself found it only because I was looking into Triumphs. Decide to make this thread just in case any other New Light player is also not aware of this. Not a lot of time to acquire it before it goes away. Acquiring it is easy but just requires you to play inside the Crimson Doubles playlist a bunch (To complete 9 diff Triumps), one of them is to acquire all of the Crimson Days items Shaxx is selling (Which is very easy to do if you are doing weeklies on all 3 characters). There are also 3 secret Triumphs which *do not count* towards the Exotic Shell Triumps progress but are still a bit fun to do imo. You need to get 2 kills with Crimson, 1 Kill with Vigilance Wing after your teammate has died and a double kill with the Two-Tailed Fox (This one is a bit tricky so if you can't get it after a bunch of trying you can try messaging the enemy players at the start of every game and ask if they wanna trade Two-Tailed Fox Triumphs). Hope this helps someone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else feels like LoW's high Aim Assist makes its entire design a gimmick?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-16 20:24:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like LoW's high Aim Assist (80) just nullifies its entire design, reduces it down to a mere gimmick and is the biggest reason why it is so low-skill friendly and powerful. The entire design of the gun is supposed to be a shotgun that shoots bullets like a pulse rifle and you are supposed to control the bullets as they shoot but because it's a shotgun and you are so close to the enemy when you shoot, the high AA (Which essentially increases the size of the enemy's hitbox on PC)  amp; High recoil makes it so you don't really have to control where the bullets are landing and LoW is just like any other shotgun, just every shot takes a little bit more time to shoot but is also extremely/more consistent than most other shotguns. Now I don't have too much of a problem with how powerful LoW is just because I think Full Choke (and Mindbender's) is more problematic as it is available on Legendary weapons and is equally as consistent but it just upsets me that LoW's interesting concept and design is kinda ruined by such a boring factor like Aim Assist. I wish they would balance the gun out, tone down the AA but turn something else up so it is still equally as powerful but just requires a bit more skill and is more fun to use. I don't just wanna go near enemies and click in their near vicinity to get a kill, that's not very fun. Plus the gun looks very cool and the new ornament for it also looks very cool so it just sucks a bit that it is so boring to use.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I claimed it days ago, saw someone sharing theirs in Discord and I know less than an hour is left to claim it so wanted to help anyone who might still want it. Only issue is I can't figure out how to access it. I don't exactly remember how I accessed it before but I have gone through the entirety of Bungie's site in the past hour and can't find the code anywhere, I asked around a bit but didn't find an answer. Wasn't send the code in mail either. Just wanna help out. One of the better emblems in the game.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Really hoping to see Heroes that haven't been meta in OWL for a long time finally be meta with upcoming changes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-20 09:11:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>With Hero Pools coming and the new Balance philosophy that the devs are adopting (Much more aggressive changes, Wilder stuff, more experimentation), I am really hoping to see Heroes like Ball, Torb, Junk, Ashe, Soldier finally be meta at some point in time during OWL 2020. Ball and Ashe specifically, neither of them have been meta since their release and Torb has never ever been meta either. I just wanna see how far top players can push the skill ceiling of these heroes if they become meta and winning games comes down to having the better ball player, the better Torb player, the better Ashe or Junk or Soldier player. Even if they are only meta on specific maps. In any case, really hoping to see different heroes being meta every week with Hero Pools being introduced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In case anyone doesn't know, VODs for all games are available a few hours after a match has aired. Within a day or two they also add individual Map VODs so that's also very convenient. VODs aren't available in the MLG app, only in the OWL app so I was being forced to watch VODs on YouTube for the past 2 weeks. Not anymore. The player is very basic though, not nearly as good as YouTube, but the quality is really High and everything looks crisp.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Feedback for future Experimental Cards : Having a no-stakes QP style environment isn't good for testing Wild/Radical changes.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-26 17:54:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Currently I'm seeing people leaving games left and right, not taking it seriously at all. Now that wouldn't be that big of a deal testing smaller changes (Or in this case, where it doesn't look the change will actually go live), but what if they test a big change in the same environment then it actually makes through and then is bad in a competitive environment. Two small suggestions to tackle this - Have the same leaving penalty as the one in comp. If you leave a game, you get Escalating Suspensions from the Environmental Card. Have two rounds for all maps, just like we do in comp. Edit : Yes, this Card is for testing Queue Times but I was talking about future cards, what happens when they are testing character reworks, map changes or game mode changes and the goal isn't to test Queue Time changes? If someone doesn't wanna test the Experiment seriously at all then why should they be allowed to test it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>With OW2's engine upgrades and other overhauls that are coming, I hope they are also working on the Visual Clarity and on fixing the Visual Clutter problem.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-02 13:41:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have seen this issue mentioned time and again, casual OW players can't get into OWL cause it is hard to follow what's going on, let alone understanding the intricacies of Pro OW Gameplay. I think everyone here can also agree that even while playing sometimes there is so much visual clutter on the screen that it truly becomes hard to follow what's going on and what's/who's where. The main /Overwatch sub is so huge yet OWL has had struggled with a declining viewer count since the beginning, I think OW works as an esport but the Visual Clutter has created a barrier of entry. Today, because of the Valorant news, I'm seeing the same sentiment expressed about OW in all the discussions related to Valorant. That OWL is too hard to follow because it's visually a mess. For older viewers like most people in this sub who've been watching OW esports since year 1, back when the game used to be much slower in pace and also when there were a lot less Visually messy abilities, it is obviously not hard to follow but even still the Visual clutter is clearly noticable and it's easy to miss important actions on the screen during games. I really hope that the dev team is looking into ways to make the game easier to follow for OW esports and just making the gameplay less visually cluttered in general. I think one good place to start would be to rethink the whole idea of turning all the players' abilities on one team to one colour and of another team to another colour, the game is much easier to follow with its default visuals imo as all abilities look distinct and have different visual signatures to them, both for players on your team and on the enemy team. Still, a change to the colour system will be just a start imo, to make OWL more accessible to casuals more of the visual clutter will have to be toned down somehow imo. Maybe they can make a new spectator mode for OWL which has toned down visuals for less clutter. Idk. Hopefully they can do something about the problem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>With 31 heroes in the game, another big batch coming with OW2, new frequent and aggressive Balance Changes, New acc Ranked level restrictions really need to be raised and Patch Notes need to be added in the game.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-04 07:38:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know in-game Patch Notes are coming, Jeff said it himself, but they need to have a 15-30 second timer before the box can be dismissed so more people will actually read them without dismissing them. Seeing a little bit of Doc play OW recently  amp; Shroud playing OW last year, they both started playing Ranked asap (Shroud had to level up) and both, lifelong gamers, still were quite confused and baffled about game mechanics and what's going on in general. This is with 31 heroes in the game, this problem is only going to get worse with OW2 when another big batch of heroes will be added to the game. I really think Ranked's minimum level requirement really needs to be raised to 35, if not to 50. This will also help a little bit with the ever existing Smurfing problem. Also with frequent and aggressive balance patches now being a thing and a lot of players playing the game on  amp; off these days, they need to add a system where if someone hasn't logged on for a month then the game forces them to play 1-2 QP games so they can become aware and potentially familiar with any big changes to the game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>...and I just wanted to say that is extremely sad and disappointing to not have the regular Rituals this season. It's just plain sad. I'm not even angry at this point, just sad. :'( Grinding for Pinnacles and Rituals was by far the most fun I have had playing this game. I know people have already complained, Aztecross has already made a video about this and they've already acknowledged it but that isn't going to change that there aren't the regular Rituals this season. I was so excited to grind for rituals. Last season I had so much fun using Arbalest in Control and Momentum, grinding for Komodo, and Tractor Cannon in Gambit. Plus, Strikes are super boring and grinding for the Vanguard Rituals gave them a little life, even though it was for just a couple of days of the season. It made the launch of the season feel good. Pinnacles/Rituals are a core aspect of this game, taking them away is a mistake imo. It's like taking the quirk away from a Wes Anderson movie. Pls Bungus, fix this. Just bring back Pinnacles. :(</TEXT>

    <TITLE>If you want an easy Pinnacle right now, do the Ordeal this week at 970 PL.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-15 10:10:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>Most Pinnacles (Legendary Lost Sectors, Master Nightmare Hunts) are currently kinda hard for the average player because of the PL change but this week's 100K Ordeal Pinnacle is pretty easy. You can do this at 960-970 LL easily. You don't even need any special equipment, you can use anything as long you are using the required Champion Mods (I used a PvP Spare Rations roll I had with Unstoppable Mod and an Eriana's for Boss damage and Anti-barrier). Only a few things to remember -  #176; You have to finish it in around 15 Mins, don't go too much over that.  #176; When you reach the boss phase, use whatever you can (Your Super, Heavy Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher) to kill as many of the Vex enemies in the Dialogue phase before the Boss kills them. I used my Chaos Reach to kill almost all of them. It's really good as a safety net to end above 100k.  #176; In the Boss Phase, kill as many adds you can as fast you can, only do 2 plates in the second phase initially, when the add Waves slows down a lot (Or dies down, I'm not sure if it ever completely dies down) then do the 3rd plate and another wave of adds will release, kill them then the boss as fast as you can. Even if you are a few thousand short, remember that killing the boss will give you a few thousand points too (I think 3-4K).  #176; If you end at even 101K and at a .72 multiplier you should end up with over 100K by the time the 30 seconds of dialogues finish. If you are a Warlock, the new Felwinter's Helm is legitimately awesome for PvE content if you have it. Making this thread cause I have met a few people while LFGing for Trials who hadn't gotten this Pinnacle because they thought they'll have to do this Ordeal at 1000 and didn't do that cause it'll be too brutal.</TEXT>

Imagine seeing players in QP who can't get a Hard Light kill at optimal distance in over a second (Optimal TTK is .7 seconds) yet are rocking Glowing Trials Armor. Bungie thinks that's how it is supposed to be. Dmg also says to play Comp for 'more focus on thumbskill'. I wouldn't be surprised when they put the Artifact LL Cap in Trials  amp; it is like 1050 or something, just so Bungie can keep providing a crutch to Lost Sector Bounty Goblins.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How I think Hard Light should be rebalanced.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-19 11:35:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Wanna start off by saying that I don't think Hard Light is OP and I'm not gonna suggest any nerf that's gonna make it any less powerful in the hands of a capable player. I've been seeing a lot of the complaints and discussions about Hard Light and I also watched Drewsky's very informative video about it. From all that I've seen and from my own experience using Hard Light (Right now and before the Auto Rifle buff) I think Hard Light is just a bit too easy to use and can also be annoying in certain situations. The main reasons why it is so easy to use is because of its 100% stability, which helps with Aim Assist a lot too (Watch Drewsky's video about it if you want a deep dive explanation of this) and its big Magazine size. Its unique Perk which gives it bonus damage from ricocheted bullets also makes it annoying because of its huge Magazine size (And it also has very fast reloads if you empty the mag). The Max Stability, now with the removed Screen Shake, makes it pretty easy to constantly get the Optimal TTK with it, even if you are a rather mediocre player. It's not OP because you can't get a crazy low TTKs with it (Optimal TTK is .7 Seconds) or kill from crazy distances (Its Aim Assist is only active till the 30-35 meter range) that an Auto Rifle shouldn't be able to. In fact, something like Arc Logic (Which can get Rangefinder) is a more Dangerous/Powerful high-range 600 Auto in the hands of a capable player. The Max stability of Hard Light also makes it so that it currently has pretty much perfectly vertical recoil, which is an extremely good thing to have on Auto Rifles. The second thing is Hard Light's huge Magazine (49, compared to Suros' 36 and Monte's 43), which provides a bit too much forgiveness to the weapon, it's big enough that you do not have to worry about how many bullets you have left in your mag even after a full 1v1 gunfight. This is only one issue with it, its special Ricochet rounds which deal more damage (2x?) are also super annoying, if someone is behind cover you can relentlessly spray Ricochet bullets inside where they are hiding (Like all the closed areas on Burnout), making it extremely difficult for them to recover or move. Imo, a 10-20% reduction to the Stability of Hard Light and a 10-20% reduction in magazine size should make it a bit more difficult to use and tone down the extreme forgiveness it currently has in the hands of an Average player while not affecting its capabilities in the hand of a good player much at all. The Damage boosted Ricochet Rounds are really niche and gimmicky but can still be pretty annoying on certain maps (Like they were on Burnout last week) so maybe the damage boost can also be toned down to 1.5X from 2.0X? Not sure about that last one. I certainly hope they don't keep it as it is right now of nerf it too hard or Revert the 600 Autos buff completely (or at all really) because of all the Hard Light complaints.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 1-3-2 test, reducing Map ready times, adding an entirely new While You Wait system because of queue times, reducing the time bank on 2CP, what was all that for? We all know they have many new heroes in dev for OW2, Jeff himself just said it again today that they have multiple new tanks and supports in dev. Why didn't they fast track the Dev of any one of them in the last 6+ months since 2-2-2 has been out and queue times have been bad? Couldn't Echo have just been released later or just with OW2? I haven't played DPS in Ranked in like 2 months cause I get very limited time to play the game every night and I can't waste half of it sitting around in queues. Literally, no new hero release would have been better for the current state of the game than releasing what's looking like the best post-release new DPS they've ever released. DPS queue times are just going to get so much worse. I just wanna play all 3 roles again, tired of essentially being restricted to play less than half the roster because of the awful queue times. Won't be able to play Echo either, when she comes out on ranked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g08aub/riots_anticheat_software_vanguard_is_causing/ This important thread showing how Valorant's 'safe' kernel level always-on Anti-cheat is causing performance issues in other games was deleted by the mods of the Valorant subreddit. Clearly not just a regular old bug, multiple people in the comments reporting the same and this is after the other big thread about concerns over their anti-cheat in which a Riot dev claimed that they made sure it won't interfere in any other programs, yet the thread was deleted anyway. For those who don't know, this subreddit was created by Riot and they publicly boasted about how they handed over the subreddit to 'Trusted' people.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would giving all tanks a universal passive that prevents them from being hard Chain CCd help the current tank problem?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-13 21:13:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Double shield is still the most powerful tank strat in Pro play and is also very effective and common in most ranks while also being relatively easy to execute on a basic level (Unlike Goats). It's also one of the most boring strats to play and play against (Shooting shields for half the duration of a fight, if not more). Imo, a big problem with executing dive strats and a big reason why playing tanks is so un-fun is being chain CCd. You get frozen, hacked, rocked, punched, halted and a million other things one after another often making it very hard to disengage as dive tanks and making tanks like Hog (No mobility, no control of a shield, no personal barrier) very painful to play in general. Losing control of your character for 5+ seconds at a time is extremely infuriating, I don't think that would be an unpopular opinion. This isn't a huge problem with DPS and Supports cause you die way before you can get chain CCd for so long. Here's a clip from 2 weeks ago of Ameng getting Chain CCd for 10+ seconds. https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/fqj5nk/ameng_gets_chain_ccd_for_13_seconds_on_the_final/ I know they did something to address CCs already but that definitely wasn't enough imo. I feel like all tanks should have CC immunity for a couple seconds after they have just recovered from being CCd. I wouldn't mind if this was a game wide behaviour tbh. Idk how hard this would be to implement, probably somewhat hard but the Dev team has implemented a lot of complicated behaviours in the past so they probably could do it. They could also add a visual effect which clearly indicates when a character is immune from CCs. Idk what this would mean in terms of rebalancing but it would certainly make tanks more fun to play. They are the easiest characters to CC in the game simply because of their large Hitboxes. I don't play ball anymore cause sometimes the Chain CCs truly make me wanna rage quit while there is nothing else in the game that infuriates me much anymore and I know how much everyone hates double shield.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is there any official answer about why Echo Ult disallows you to change your hero during it?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-14 21:04:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Has someone from Blizzard officially said if it's an ability they intentionally gave her or if it was given out of necessity because of some tech reasons like a lot of people were guessing? It just feels a bit pointless and frustrating. Echo's kit is already so strong, it doesn't feel like she needs this ability but if it is a technical reason it'll be understandable. Edit : Jeff confirmed it in comments, it's a technical limitation. "this is a technical limitation related to how many heroes can be loaded into memory at one time."</TEXT>

    <TITLE>New Nano confirmation option is a great QoL change for Ana, now can we please also get friendly outlines.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-15 00:33:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Currently the 'Friendly Outlines' option in the game only provides outlines for allies through walls but not when they are in your LoS, I often find myself missing my shots as Ana cause Ally characters blend with environments or with each other easily and frequently. This option will also be helpful for Baptiste and for any future hero that requires you to shoot your own Allies. Edit : Turns out that the Hero Specific settings for this option aren't sticking so even though I had set my Ana setting to 'Always' I was only getting outlines through walls because my Universal setting was set to 'Occluded'. Now everytime I play Ana or Baptiste I'll have to change the common setting to Always from Occluded, hope they fix that soon.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>One of the dumbest coolest niche Echo interactions I am hoping to see one day in an OWL game is double Sigma Ult.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-16 09:18:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Been thinking about all the cool niche stuff that's possible with Echo's ult. A Sigma Ult inside of a Sigma Ult  amp; so many other bullshit cool niche interactions are possible with Echo. Like potentially 2 reins shattering from opposite sides so the enemy rein can't block both (Or maybe can if he has crazy fast reactions, maybe Oge can) or double dva bombs to send a team into hiding and then bombing inside the area where they are hiding. 2 hogs Sandwiching enemies between 2 whole hogs. Double nano on a single target. Twice the Torb goo. Double amp matrix. All of this would also be really rare and difficult to execute so it won't be broken or anything but will also make for some amazing OWL clips. Also been thinking about Seagull's state of OW video and Echo's design (Also the CC nerf patch experiment coming soon) and even though it is unlikely that Seagull's video affected the hero design direction change but it is good to see a new hero with no CC, having special shield busting tech, traditional FPS based design with OW magic sprinkled on and no stupid 'Press Q to win teamfight/get confirmed kills' mechanic like Sombra or old Doomfist ult. She also has hard counters like Hitscans but also can play arround them by flanking and by using her E. This kind of hero design (Also Sigma, who is one of the most fun tanks to play imo but he does also have 2 hard CCs) really makes me excited for the new batch of heroes coming with OW2. Less CC, more hard to learn and to master mechanics (Like Sigma's left click, Echo's left click, right click and Shift).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some OW2 news/announcements might potentially come soon.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-01 01:23:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>OW2 is heavily rumoured (This is pretty much confirmed short of being officially announced) to be a launch title for next gen consoles and Xbox is set to be doing an event on May 7th which is officially confirmed to be about showcasing games from partner companies (from Non-Microsoft owned studios), like AC: Valhalla. If something from OW2 is not shown at this event (As Activision generally does promotional and content/cosmetics exclusivity deals with Sony rather than Microsoft) then Sony is also heavily rumoured to be doing a big reveal event in June, so we might get to see something there. Another thing to note is that AC:Valhalla's marketing straight up says it is coming Holiday 2020 and it'll be on Xbox Series X so it looks like next gen consoles' release isn't being delayed after all, which was a big worry with Covid-19 affecting production. OW brought in a billion dollars in revenue in 2016 and a big part of the success was on Consoles so I definitely expect to see OW2 being showcased at one of the two companies' events.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What can realistically be done to make Orisa more fun?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 14:14:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday, the FOCC tourney happened which had Orisa banned along with Mei and Brig. I didn't see anyone complain about Orisa being banned in Twitch chat or in threads about the tourney on this sub. It's clear that a lot of people in this community don't like playing against Orisa or as Orisa (among all the main tanks), which also makes it so that people don't like seeing her played in OWL and other tourneys. Orisa not being very fun to play for most Tank players is also something that probably affects the Tank queue times a bit as people feel like there's fewer options and styles to play for a Main Tank role (Rein and Winston mainly, as Sigma is mostly an off-tank now and Ball is very situational) and no real high aiming-skill based main tank. Imo Orisa can probably be made more fun without needing a big rework (Unlike something like Mei or Brig or Moira) and is probably one of the very few things that the balance team can do to help tank queues in the near future as more tanks will only be released with OW2. I think one of the main problems with her being un-fun to play is that her primary fire is rather boring and unsatisfying. It can be somewhat lethal up close but that's about it, you rarely are in situations where you can 'Pop-off' with her even if you have the mechanical skill to do so. Her clip size is too long which makes it so that you rarely have to think about reload management, she doesn't have any recoil nor crazy random spread which makes it so that you are quite simply tracking enemies while mostly sitting around in one spot (Not enough Busywork). If there was more of an aiming skill requirement then I feel like players would feel less bored sitting in one spot. Her primary also doesn't have the same satisfying lethality as someone like Sigma or Baptiste, two characters who also require more aiming skill than Orisa but also aren't DPS. Sigma imo is the most satisfying tank to play in the game and a lot of that has to do with how satisfying his primary is. When it comes to playing against Orisa, I feel like Halt is the main problem. It's a very strong CC ability that is extremely annoying even when it isn't being used to combo and win team fights as you are constantly being displaced hard from your position every few seconds. When teams do manage to combo with Halt, which isn't something that's very hard to do even in Gold-Plat, it can straight up win team fights and as more  amp; more abilities have been released (Looking at Sticky bombs) that combo well with Halt it has just gotten very obnoxious to play against. I feel like maybe its Radius size or CD or effectiveness need to nerfed, like maybe its pull effectiveness can be made dependent on how far the enemy is from the Halt orb. A change like that will make it so that it isn't easy to bunch up multiple enemies so close together on a small CD. My suggestions are probably not good but I definitely feel like Orisa needs to be looked at by the balance team and can be made more fun to play. Maybe other people can comment better suggestions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some System and Technical questions about Y4/Future of Destiny that weren't answered in the Q amp;A and I hope get answered before fall DLC.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-10 00:03:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>Social Systems - Nothing was asked or discussed about this game's social aspects and features in the reveal stream or Q amp;A. This game's social features are very barebones and anti-social by design. Unless you have IRL friends who play the game or you go to a 3rd party source (Discord) to find people to play with it is very difficult to make friends within the game. Random people never use in-game voice chat, text chat is barely ever used by randoms, probably because they are disabled by default. There's no 'Histroy' social tab to send friend requests to people you just met in a match made activity. No match chat to allow banter with people on the enemy team during PvP games like in Overwatch. Most of the time, as a Solo player, this game feels like a Single Player game and all the actual players feel like bots because no one ever talks or socialises. Is anything being to improve social systems of this game? Vault - Nothing was mentioned about The Vault's limited capacity and lack of filtering options in the reveal stream or in the Lupo Hoster Q amp;A. Can we get an answer if changes are coming in the near future or even in Y4? Issues with The Vault is one of my biggest dislikes/frustrations with the game. Auto-deletion of Blues - Luke was asked this question and he kind of dodged it (I'm not sure if that was a 'No' or Not) by saying that in far future they possibly plan on making Blues and Green a real thing. Is the option being added back come September or in Y4 or not? Technical questions - Luke was asked about Ray-Tracing and he said that's something the Technical Lead will be able to answer much better. That pretty much confirmed to me that Ray Tracing wouldn't be coming to the game. That's completely fine with me but I wanted to ask about Anti-aliasing and potentially DLSS 2.0. It's no secret that the game has poor Anti-aliasing solutions so if the game is going to continue for years more to come, is anything going to be done to fix this issue for PC? Is a better Anti-aliasing solution coming to the game in Y4 or ever? DLSS 2.0 is also an incredibly neat feature that's most likely going to be adapted by most major games coming on PC from here on out, is Bungie looking at adding that to Destiny or not? Destiny is designed to be a very pretty game but the poor AA solutions on PC really hinder the experience, at least for me. A lot of the most beautifully designed weapon and armor models have great detail to them that's ruined by the Jagged edges or the poor AA. I know it's not something that is a big deal for a lot of people but it is for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Same exact situation. Had my 3T for 3.5 years and then a few months ago I got an issue with its screen where a small Purple roughly semi-circle stain appeared on the right side. With the middle of the stain being a lot darker/blacker. I didn't know what happened, tried putting it in rice, didn't get fixed. I thought it'll be fine, can totally live with a little spot on the edge of the screen but then the stain just started growing every day and within a few weeks the entire screen went purple and then slowly went completely black. I can get it fixed eventually but OnePlus currently has service centers shut down and I know they'll charge easily over $100 for a new screen. For the last year, I was planning on replacing my 3T with a top-end next-gen phone with a 120Hz Amoled screen but as of right now only the 8 Pro has that kind of a screen and I do not like the 8 Pros battery life and there aren't any other good 120Hz Amoled options. While there are legit flaws with the Nord, the most important things to me in daily use are the screen, battery, design (I actually like the Nord's design, it would have been neat to have a metal frame but plastic isn't a big deal, will most likely put it in a TPU case anyway), clean and snappy software which it all has. Mono speaker hurts but most of the time I am using my phone with wireless earphones anyway. Apps will open a smidge slower than phones with 3.0 storage but that's a really small thing to me. Even with all its flaws, my other option is to spend way more and get worse battery life with the 8 Pro and no other major improvements to the features I care about or spend a little more and get the RealMe X2 Pro. Which despite its better internals will still make me feel unsatisfied in daily usage due to its software and software support.  #8203; I used to be really into having top-of-the-line specs in my phones and tablets but over time I realized that top-of-the-line specs aren't as important as day-to-day experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Personally, I feel completely fine about OnePlus re using a design. Just grinds my gears when they act like they are so unique and bespoke. The core fundamentals of modern marketing will frustrate you to death, they are scummy by design. Try and focus on the products and what matters to you. I don't remember the last time I went on a site to purchase/check out a phone and didn't immediately just click on the 'specs' button. Don't look at the marketing, don't be bothered by it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a lot of people wanted a new flagship killer from OnePlus when they heard that they are making a $400 phone again and OnePlus leaned into those expectations and turned it into Hype. Reality ofc is that they couldn't make a flagship killer even if they wanted to cause it would cannibalize their own flagships. For a phone made to target the Indian market and EU it is pretty good for its price, nothing much more and nothing much less.  #8203; Purchases are going to be dependent on different people's different use cases, a lot of Indians apparently play games like Fortnite, COD, PUBG daily on their phones so for them this phone might not be the best choice in this price range. Some people really care about the best camera possible for the price so they might wait for the Pixel 4a. Some people really care about the best internals for the price and then they install custom ROMs as soon as possible (That used to be me too). Someone might have experience using wireless charging before and they might not wanna go back to regular charging anymore so Nord might be a no-go for them. This phone is certainly not the level of 'Complete packages' that OP and the Nexus line used to deliver in the past but it is pretty good for what it is and what it costs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>T-mobile seems to really fucking love the OWL. They sponsor OWL itself, they sponsor the OWL talents' personal podcast and now they are also going to sponsor a team within the league.  #8203; Just a couple of weeks ago GoldenBoy was on a Twitch podcast where he told a story from 3 years ago (Before OWL's first season started) about how he was told to plug-in T-mobile's name any way he sees fit during a live OWWC desk hosting segment and the way he did it made it a popular meme which T-mobile execs really liked and because of that they decided to sign-on as a sponsor for OWL for 3 years. Still, I would've thought they must regret that deal now seeing that OWL hasn't been doing as hot viewership wise this year, apparently not I guess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; That may eventually become the norm, but we're not there just yet. It has already been becoming the norm for years, TAA is the best form of AA other than DLSS itself and is implemented in a lot of AAA games. Almost all PS4 games from the last few years use it. If a game supports TAA then it can support DLSS 2.0.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not at all for now. Just like Netflix/Amazon Prime, any big subscription service needs a growing period where it is offered for 'Too good to be true' prices. So Microsoft will keep the price low until they have a massive sub-base. Eventually, the loss evens out due to the sheer amount of people not using the service enough for how much they pay for it and with the company slowly increasing the price over time. I fully expect Microsoft to keep the cheap prices until Game Pass is 5-10X bigger than it is now, then they'll slowly start increasing the price $1 every few months/every year.</TEXT>

Perhaps It wasn't clear but I called Nvidia a cunt cause it is rumored they'll be limiting DLSS 3.0 to Ampere cards even though an update to DLSS which'll make it work on any TAA game does not sound like it'll need new hardware that the 20 series cards already don't have, so they'll be artificially limiting it to Ampere cards to boost sales.</TEXT>

It definitely can and does make a difference in speed and battery, if you have a bunch of apps open in the tray with active processes (Like they are downloading files or something like that) then clearing the tray will reduce processor load and reduce battery drain.

After every match, u get 3 thumbs up/upvotes of sorts to give to either teammates or players from opposing team, meant to give for playing good, teamwork, leadership, sportsmanship, etc. Based on how many Average Endorsements u get per game ur endorsement level goes up/down from 1 to 5. Most players are level 3, level 1 players generally tend to be really toxic people or they leave games a lot (Leaving games/DCing has a big hit on ur endorsement level). Level 5 players are and are generally support mains.  #8203; Every couple of weeks or so you get Lootboxes based on ur endorsement level, someone took the pop up message u get when u r awarded the loot boxes and changed it to show a concept they thought of.  #8203; Endorsements were originally added to help combat toxicity but after the initial few weeks, people stopped caring about their Endorsement levels cause they don't really reward anything special.</TEXT>

With all the MTX, it screams 'I'm a F2P game'. You need something really appealing and unique to be able to sell it for money while also stuffing it with MTX to the brim in this day and age. At least this game's failure is being talked about, another game that seems to have failed recently is 'Disintegration', which I first saw in one of them live conferences that have been running all summer. Something like the Future Gaming Show or the PC gamer show. A rather expensive looking AA Sci-Fi RTS FPS game that I first mistakenly thought was a game mode within another upcoming game called Outriders (Probably because I watched a lot of these conferences in the background and wasn't paying full attention). I saw a couple of big streamers stream Rocket Arena (Might've been sponsored, don't remember) but I've not seen anyone talk about Disintegration or seen any streamer stream it and it barely has like 100 reviews on steam. Even though it was shown in multiple different game conferences this summer.</TEXT>

Once people become accustomed to these services, which I think might happen with the success of Xbox's streaming service, people will forget Stadia's shortcomings of the past and use it if it is good at that time. US might not be the focus market for any of these services though, not any time soon at least. Countries like India where PC hardware is obscenely overpriced and is only getting more expensive and gaming has insanely blown up in the past few years in the form of mobile gaming (And one of the biggest selling points of these streaming services is mobile gaming), these services can become super successful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk dude... $50 difference but u get the much less powerful 730g, 60 Hz screen instead of 90 Hz (Which is a huge difference imo), smaller screen and a 1000 Mah smaller battery (And faster charging on Nord). Plus, even with what all brilliant things Google's camera software can do, having 2 decent ultrawide lenses on Nord can't be matched with software alone on the 4a.  #8203; I appreciate there is the option of the 4a, a phone with a flagship quality main camera but all the other trade-offs are too much. Still pains to this day that Google never bothered investing in their own mobile manufacturing so they could manufacture better hardware for cheaper and offer more competitive products. Imagine a Nord competitor from Google with very similar hardware/specs but Google's Pixel version of Android, better software support, and superior camera software instead.  #8203; Guess I'm going to end up buying Nord. Feels like a compromise but I don't see a better option right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Overwatch is also limited to 60 FPS when you aren't in a game which helps regulate CPU/GPU temps and also frees up load which makes sense as most people are generally surfing the web/doing something else while waiting for a game. Modern Warfare takes it a step further and allows you to set a Max FPS for just menus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;its always a picture of overwatch's loot box It is because Overwatch's lootbox system's success in its launch year was revolutionary within the gaming industry (Even though OW had nothing to do with the invention of the Loot Box system), it brought in an obscene amount of money so a lot of other companies instantly jumped on that train. They obviously tried to push it more and more out of sheer greed, to the point where Battlefront 2 happened and everything came crashing down. Not to forget that OW's initial loot box system was also a lot more greedy and controversial, which they fixed in the first few months following the launch of the game. Once the Lootbox system became too controversial and regulatory bodies also started getting involved, around 2-3 years ago, Fortnite found massive success in its battle pass + shop system so then everyone started copying that. People kept paying more and more so companies started pushing the system harder which has now resulted in that system becoming just as awful as the Loot Box system became at the height of its greed. Worst offenders being Valorant and Destiny 2 from what I've seen. I'm legit a bit worried about what Activision is going to do with OW2's monetization, we have had it so good for the past 2-3 years and I feel like it is all going to be ruined come OW2 launch. I feel like OW2 PvE content is going to be $30-60 (Maybe they'll give 1 Battlepass season 'free' with that) and on top of that, they are going to sell 2-3 month-long Battlepasses + also have a cash cosmetics shop.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cause when the game launched the word 'Lootboxes' wasn't hated as much, as more and more games started copying the system and made it scummier and scummier they started changing the name up in an awfully poor attempt to try and distance themselves from having 'Lootboxes' in their game while also trying to bring some semblance of originality to it. lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So many people in this sub just casually ignore 60 Hz Vs 90 Hz when comparing different phones, makes me think that they have never used a higher than standard refresh rate screen/monitor. My PC has a 144 Hz screen and I can tell the difference when a game is running at 60 or 70-80 or 90 and the difference is massive. To just casually ignore the absolute ass of a screen on the iPhone SE, either all these people are insanely into mobile photography (Photos they then must be appreciating on their PCs as the SE's screen is awful) or they simply don't realise how important a screen is in a modern phone. I personally wouldn't even pay $200 for an iPhone SE with a screen that ancient. I think Samsung has $200 phones with 1080p Amoled screens that would be way better than SE's.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Prime Video content randomly stopped playing videos in 1080p in all Chrome-based browsers.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-03 11:09:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a Lenovo laptop with a 1080p screen, 100 Mbps broadband connection, and am on the latest Windows 10 2004.  #8203; Started a few weeks ago, out of a sudden Amazon Prime Video content stopped going above 'HD' (720p according to Prime Video) in Chrome Beta my regular browser. Couldn't figure out what was up and I was in the middle of watching a show so I just tried Firefox and things were working perfectly fine on it as usual (videos running in 1080p HD) so I didn't think of it much, just Prime Video being finicky like it sometimes does. But then I couldn't get the issue fixed later so I installed regular Chrome and faced the same issue there and gave up.  #8203; Weeks later, I am annoyed using Firefox just to watch Prime Video content in full HD and want to fix the issue if I can. I couldn't find any similar issue or solution upon googling. Today I tried installing Chrome Dev, tried Edge browser (In which playback won't go to even 720p 'HD' for some reason), tried Amazon's Prime Video app from Microsoft's store, and in none of them is playback working in 1080p (Though if I download any show or movie in the app it downloads in Full HD somehow). Idk about the Prime Video app but I know the Edge browser is also based on Chrome code so the issue has got to do with Chrome. I also tried the old Internet Explorer and Prime Video content is playing perfectly in 1080p on it just like it does in Firefox.  #8203; To try and fix the issue within Chrome itself I tried updating Widevine protection in Chrome://Components but there is no update. I tried disabling 'Protected Content' in Chrome settings, rebooting PC, then re-enabling it and rebooting PC again and that didn't fix the issue either. I also tried deleting all Prime Video site cookies and data but that didn't fix the issue either.  #8203; I'm out of ideas and if anyone has any suggestions, I am willing to try.</TEXT>

There was a post about Denovo DRM affecting FPS and loading times a while ago, it was a video but a lot of important aspects of the process weren't shown. It is not even about lying or anything, my main concern would be human error. I don't much doubt that Vanguard affects performance in some way if you leave it On but we need someone like LMG or Battlenonsense do proper testing instead of some random Redditor to know exactly how it affects performance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not 'No Gaming' but if you are going to be playing modern 3D games like PUBG mobile, COD mobile, Fortnite then don't expect high FPS even at low graphical settings. In MKBHD's new video about this phone, he says that the processor struggles to maintain a smooth and snappy experience even in regular usage. With new security updates every month, a new Android version update every year, and more graphically intensive games coming out regularly, the phone is definitely not going to be good for gaming. Maybe if you play very simplistic games. Idk what's the requirements for emulator games but I'd expect it to be on the higher side.</TEXT>

Off-topic from mobile gaming, if you do game on PC and use a high refresh rate monitor then you'd probably be happier with a 90hz screen on ur phone than a 60Hz one.

    <TEXT>Imo, one of the worst things you can do to a modern phone screen is to slap a screen protector on it. Ruins the feel and responsiveness of the screen, plus you already have the Gorilla Glass which doesn't get scratched easily, and even when it does the scratches are hard to see/feel and 'fade away' a bit after a little while. Cases and all I still understand but Screen protectors I just don't. Maybe if you are really irresponsible and constantly put your phone in your pocket with keys and other stuff. Maybe.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unpopular opinion, JerryRig's snapping test doesn't mean much because it has no solid real-life reasoning behind it. Dropping a phone from 4-5\~ feet makes sense as that will be the height most people would drop their phones from while using them, scratching phone screens with keys makes sense as it is common to accidentally put ur phone it ur pocket with keys.  #8203; If you consider from a real-life scenario perspective, Zack (I'm not sure if that is his name) is stronger than most people and he still has to put a lot of force to break the phones during his test. The test really doesn't have much in terms of practicality behind it. A much more practical test would be to 'accidentally' sit on the phone.</TEXT>

HZD PS4 version was thoroughly polished, this apparently was outsourced and clearly seems to be rushed. This isn't really a console Vs PC issue. Death Stranding runs fantastically on PCs, no issues. Straight up better than the PS4 version. You just Buy, Install, and Play it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The AAA industry has had some real issues in the past decade or so trying to make simply Funny games that do not take themselves seriously at all cause they are chasing after the movie industry, trying to prove that games can be just as much serious and dramatic as the most prestigious movies. It's a sign that the industry itself is still rather immature even though the financial status has grown massively in the last decade. Not comfortable being who they are, holding themselves back creatively to prove things that they don't need to prove at all. I do believe that we'll see some change regarding this in the games to come this decade. Fable is already coming back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a laptop with an i5-9300H, 16gb ram, and an RTX 2060 and I'm getting around 60\~ FPS in open areas at 1080p. I haven't had any weird graphical glitches as some other people have had but I do feel the constant stuttering every few seconds that Digital Foundry mentioned and some of the Cloth, Facial, Foliage physics/animations are definitely a bit janky/rough. Especially the new dynamic foliage feature they added for the PC port for all the shorter foliage, as DF mentioned it seems to do this weird deformation animation thing and seems to be locked at 30 fps which definitely makes the game feel a bit janky. The game also tanks in FPS for a few 100 ms every now and then when it is trying to load a new area which adds to the jank. Had one crash right after the game finished compiling shaders but other than that no crashes. I'm going to keep playing for now but if I start facing any graphical glitches or crashes like others are facing I might stop and wait till they polish this port with updates. I really hope they are committed to this release and polish it with updates, that they don't just push fixes for some of the bigger issues and stop. Would be *really* neat if they added DLSS 2.0 support seeing that the game already has TAA and Death Stranding already has DLSS 2.0.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; So how exactly does it going about to reduce stutter? I haven't tested the mod myself yet but what it claims to do is provide better frame pacing compared to if you limit FPS with the In-game FPS limiter or RTSS or Nvidia Control Panel. There are different ways games and softwares can handle limiting FPS and generally, RTSS/NvidiaCP tend to be better at it than in-game frame limiters. This game especially seems to have a poor in-game FPS limiter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100%. Since the initial announcement years ago I wanted and was expecting a Single-Player story focused Avengers game with an original story, cutting edge graphics, VA, great dialogue, and what they have put out is a Destiny style online game with rather unoriginal.....everything?  #8203; Even the roster of characters they have chosen is awfully uninspired, except Kamala, they just copied the original movie roster most likely because those are the most known and marketable characters, with Spider-man added on top (Who is also a blatantly unrefreshing pick of a character) and even that's butchered to hell due to awful anti-consumer practices. Such an insanely wide range of characters to choose from between other popular Avengers, FF4, X-Men, Inhumans, and other characters from the Spider-Verse and they chose these.  #8203; I would have been more interested in this game's roster was, Idk.....Off the top of my head....if it was a combination of characters from maybe Mr. Fantastic, Sue Storm, Doctor Strange, Rogue, Jean Grey, Kamala, Black Panther, an older Hawkeye maybe, a version of Venom turned good, Vision (He has so many cool abilities, would have been way more fun than playing as Hulk just smashing things), Scarlet Witch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Probably not for a decade or so. I'd say in 3\~ years it'll become the standard. The new consoles are already being heavily promoted as having 4k standard, even though most AAA games on them will run at 30-60 FPS (RTX limitations are probably going to hold them back quite a bit). In the past 2 years, the 2 best selling new cards have been the 1660ti and RTX 2060 which are *almost* good enough to run any new AAA game at 1440p Ultra settings without RTX On, this year's 30 series replacements for these cards will most likely be able to run any new game at 4K Ultra without RTX and 1440p Ultra with RTX at 60 FPS.  #8203; The next major refresh in 1-2 years will then most likely push 4K to become the standard as the best selling cards will be capable of it, and as usual, Consoles will follow 1-2 years after that with similarly powerful cards in the PS5 Pro and the Xbox Series Xcess or whatever they decide to call that.  #8203; By that time 4k monitors will also become much more affordable and 6k-8k ones becoming the new high-end/cutting edge monitors.</TEXT>

I might try just replacing the glass which is like $4-5 Ok so I did some googling just now, I've searched about the issue before but I didn't specifically search with '3T' in the query so that must have been why I never found anything on this issue, but now I've found multiple reports of the same issue on 3T.  #8203; [https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/9scpv0/purple\_bleed\_on\_screen\_grows\_continuously/](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/9scpv0/purple_bleed_on_screen_grows_continuously/) [https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/purple-spots-on-screen-suddenly.846268//](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/purple-spots-on-screen-suddenly.846268//) [https://forums-images.oneplus.net/attachments/1284/1284725-0ee11f9243e9ff6d4d056aac30a2edce.jp](https://forums-images.oneplus.net/attachments/1284/1284725-0ee11f9243e9ff6d4d056aac30a2edce.jpg)g  #8203; This is the exact issue I had and I'm sure this is what u r facing too. Unfortunately, It is pretty obvious this is an OLED panel dying issue (Through damage somehow, either moisture or heat or too much pressure), and replacing the glass will not do anything to fix. And yes, the touch still works on mine too. Which makes sense as only the OLED panel seems to have died. The phone itself will continue to work properly even after the screen goes completely black. You can access ur phone on ur computer through screen mirroring software, the one I found the best is called Scrcpy. It doesn't need to be installed on the phone, only on ur PC. You only need to enable USB Debugging in Settings of ur phone and you'll be able to access the data and apps on ur phone through it. Just plug the phone to PC with USB cable and launch scrcpy, even when the phone is locked you'll be able to unlock it through the software. Though, every time you unlock ur phone using scrcpy the connection breaks and u will have to relaunch scrcpy to further use ur phone. It's good enough to back up all ur data on ur PC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Blizzard doesn #8217;t really do a good job at coordinating their game development with their competitive scene from past history. As long as I've been following Blizzard they've seemed to be a very departmentalized company, lots of different departments that don't often communicate with one another due to whatever reason. I started watching OWL properly starting last season and I've been constantly perplexed as to why they don't announce new stuff during OWL. I remember Havana teasers were first being released on Twitter and then later being repeated during OWL broadcasts the same week, why not just show the teasers for the first time during the broadcast? Let people know beforehand that something will be shown during the broadcast or at least do the final map/hero reveals during the broadcasts. The entirety of last season I used to think that the OW dev team and the OWL teams are completely separate and don't work with each other much at all. No idea why but that's just how things seemed to be. That the OWL team just simply followed  amp; adjusted around the OW dev team's schedule and decisions. Only this year it has seemed like that might not be the case with how they handled all the Hero Pool changes. Perhaps that did use to be the case until last year and things changed a bit starting this year?</TEXT>

It was before I started playing the game but I think they once did a random dump of Blizzard themed cosmetics along with the release of BlizzardWorld, they also used to release 6-8 legendary skins per event back then compared to 4-5 past 1-2 years. The team has grown a lot in the last 2 years apparently but they've also been working on OW2 along with OW during this time so I can see why we haven't seen a lot more cosmetics. I think they have been working on a lot of cosmetics that'll be exclusive to OW2 owners (Locked behind PvE), so hopefully, there's a big influx of new cosmetics when OW2 launches.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Idk what to do, it is the only 'major' issue I am facing. My game doesn't crash (Only once every time I recompile shaders), I am getting 60-80 FPS with High\~ settings, I am not seeing any major graphical glitches like a lot of other people are seeing, I am not really bothered by Aloy not walking straight, Not bothered by hair physics being broken above 30 FPS, I only see stuttering when the Quest updates pop-up and when I am entering a diff area (FPS just tanks for a second or two but it is fine) so even that's fine. The only thing that is *constantly* bothering me is the Foliage shimmering. The game just has so much foliage that more than half my screen is shimmering during most of the gameplay.  #8203; I've tried all texture settings (Yes, recompiled shaders for all of them), all model quality settings, all AA settings, multiple different % of Nvidia sharpening, all shadows settings, even tried DSR, but I can't get rid of the Foliage shimmering. I'd even be willing to completely disable all foliage to get rid of the shimmering but the game doesn't allow that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not even for the patch I imagine, as they'll provide the same patch to Deluxe Edition owners too with AWE release. They'll probably just grey out 2-3 quality features for non-Ultimate Edition owners What an absolute shitty thing to do. Launch of a new console gen seems to be bringing out the worst of the gaming industry's anti-consumer practices. Sony running around with an open purse to get as many exclusivity deals as possible, publishers double-dipping to provide updated versions of games that should be free. The worst thing about this Control Ultimate Edition bullshit is that even when you do buy the new version and get the upgraded PS5/XSX versions, they won't have all the graphical features/Frame-rate capabilities that the original PC version had in the first place. Simply cause these consoles don't seem to have much/any dedicated AI computation power like RTX cards have. Remedy will likely put small RTX touches here and there. So all the 'free upgrade' will probably be is allowing players to select 4K and 60/higher FPS settings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It doesn't work, I have a 1080p Monitor and I tried running the game at 1440p, 1527p, and even 4k using Nvidia DSR and even at 4K, it doesn't completely eliminate the shimmering. I've tried every single texture, model quality, AA setting, even tried multiple different values of Nvidia sharpening with diff AA settings and the shimmering just doesn't go away. With DSR 4k I can't even get stable 30 FPS with my RTX 2060 or I'd play on 4k just cause the shimmering is so bad on 1080p. I think the shimmering has something to do with the lighting as it gets especially bad when a patch of foliage has extra light shining on it from a fire lamp and it *completely* goes away when the weather changes and it starts raining.</TEXT>

When games, drivers, DX12, etc are more optimized to take advantage of it. Right now for most people, in most games, it shows a negligible difference turned On vs Off.

    <TEXT> gt; I might be one of the lucky one Therein lies the entire issue, the whole port is so fickle that for some it won't even boot and for some people, no major issues are occurring. There's also no solid info about why it is crashing for some people so badly and why it works fine for others. If such info was available it would be easier to recommend the game to people by just telling them "Hey, buy it if you have XYZ CPUs/GPUs but wait to buy it if you have ABC CPUs/GPUs cause the game currently crashes/has major issues on that hardware". I am personally facing the issue of horrible foliage shimmering that a bunch of other people are also facing but at the same time, a lot of players aren't facing at all. This has forced me to stop playing the game for the time being and wait and see if Guerilla can fix this issue with patches in the near future.</TEXT>

Though the thing that would hold Epic back is that they are making sure to continuously repeat that they will not take a special deal here like the rest of the big companies do, they want laws to change here. So if they go back on their word, a lot of people will hate them for it. Though I do think they do not intend to, they are losing way too much money and making way too big of a deal of this to then just take a special deal.

    <TEXT>Same. For most games Epic has given out for free, I claim it thinking 'Maybe I'll play it some time'. It is still good for the devs though. Even if they have just 1/5 people who are claiming their games but do not have express intent to play them actually play the games, that's potentially a ton of new players who might be a lot more excited to play newer games by the same devs/sequels to that game or just spend money on MTX within that game. Then you also have a ton of people claiming these games who actually do have express intent of playing them but might not have bought the game yet cause the game wasn't high enough on their 'to-play' list or the game was older and newer games in the same genre had been more appealing to them or for some other random reason. Insanely good for Indie devs for sure. And Epic pays them on top of everything. Epic is also getting a lot in return, checking their store to claim Free games every other week has made me use their store a lot more (Even though I don't play Fortnite at all).

    <TITLE>Pleasantly surprised by the Nord's battery life.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-17 10:40:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just plugged in the phone for charging after almost 23 hrs (From 100 to 2%). Got the phone yesterday and was really worried (Was considering canceling the order) as I had been seeing quite a lot of reports/reviews on Amazon and on the OnePlus forums about people facing issues with the Nord's battery life, charging speeds and heating while charging. One of the main reasons I got the Nord over a couple of other phones I was considering was the juicier battery and I am happy that it is doing better than I expected. Had a 3t before this and that was doing really bad in the last year or so I used it, gave 2.5-3 hrs of SoT. [Got almost 24 hrs out if it with medium usage. ](https://i.imgur.com/upgSbU0.jpg) [Over 7 hrs of SoT as well. Display at around 60% brightness on average.](https://i.imgur.com/wi2rvG7.jpg) Not super happy with the performance though. Scrolling through Twitter  amp; YouTube can be rather choppy at times. It is like the apps themselves or the system is restricted from preloading data before so the data loads only when you scroll further, resulting in a bit of lag. The camera performance is also rather mediocre in low/indoor lighting. I don't use camera much so I don't care a lot (At least it does rather well outside) but I still hope they can improve the quality soon with some updates.</TEXT>

I am just so tired of the game being so shieldy all the time. Idk how to fix this issue, I'm just a filthy casual, but reverting the Hog change would just make the game boring again. Maybe all tanks should be more lethal. That's a lot more fun than than being there mainly to just being there to make space, to mainly just up ur shields and for your Ults.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The big issue with this design, the same issue that the current OWL graphics also have is that they don't focus on the players, don't put their photos front and center and instead focus on the characters. Characters that a vast majority of people watching OWL already know and love but they are still put front and center because the OWL purpose philosophy seems to be that its main purpose is to promote the game and not itself, not its players, not its storylines. If you look at every successful major esports league/event graphics, say TI for example, they all put massive photos of the players on the screen. Really good quality photos that instantly show some personality. They even have full team photos edited to look like they were all posing together. In OWL they have these super artificial photos of the players, that they barely even show in full, where the players all look like they were having an awful time at the photoshoot, look super stiff. They basically all look like high school photographs. Hell, if they really want to put the characters on display so much then make edits where all players are posing back-to-back with their main heroes, looking at the camera. Also, the font they use in OWL graphics looks rather cheap. Looks vertically stretched and inelegant. Which is kinda the opposite of what OW looks like, all text in OW looks super slick and modern. The graphics design overall just feels rather bland and inoffensive. LEC graphics have a street arty style, TI graphics have a fantasy based design. The graphics could use a bit more style for sure.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Does scrolling in the Twitter app feel rather Janky on the 7 and 8 series phones too.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-19 05:21:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>Scrolling in the Twitter app on my Nord feels rather Stuttery and Janky, it didn't feel like this on my 3T. Is it that it was just as Jittery on the 3T too but because it was 60 Hz it wasn't as noticeable and it feels the same way to other people on the 7 and 8 series phones (Which also have high refresh rate screens) too or is this an issue with the Nord itself. Rest of the phone feels super smooth, scrolling in almost all apps feels perfect but scrolling in the Twitter app just doesn't feel smooth at all. Wondering if maybe OP has restricted the performance on the Nord for better battery life and that's affecting how fast the phone loads media previews and images while scrolling in the Twitter app and maybe that's causing the issue. Then again, scrolling in Relay for Reddit feels smooth even with HD image and Gif loading enabled. Scrolling in YouTube feels smooth for the most part with occasional stutters while scrolling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So a little update just because I know that battery gets better after a couple of cycles, I'm now getting around 10~ hrs of SoT per cycle. Also I discovered that Twitter stuttering and being a bit Janky is an issue with the Twitter app itself and it performs similarly on more powerful flagships, it also doesn't support high refresh rate so that's why it feels extra stuttery. I moved to a 3rd party Twitter app that I used to use a while ago and that works smoothly. The Camera I hope they fix, the biggest issue with the OP camera app seems to be that it over exposes all photos by a lot. Even when I turn down Exposure to minimum possible the photos still look a bit over exposed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But isn't that something they did last year too? I was dropped in a 15 min introduction mission when I started the game last October and then it went to shit. No guidance, no idea what to do from there, no main quest line to follow (Game was pushing the Shadowkeep storyline on me which made no sense whatsoever), 100 different terms hurled at you with no real tutorial on what means what and what does what. The main campaigns of Destiny 2 were hidden in some back corner of the player landing zone for some reason. Also, the best time I had playing the game was the first month or so when I had all the campaigns to do, all the exotic quests, raids and all to do for the first time. With so much stuff just simply being removed, by far the best part of the experience of playing Destiny is getting severely shortened. They are removing some of the coolest stuff in the game by removing the Whisper and the Outbreak missions, playing them for the first time was some of the best time I had playing this game as a new player. Those and the Leviathan raid. I feel like the new players they'll gain with the new expansion will get bored much faster than I got bored once I finished most of the content in the game.</TEXT>

DF's analysis of some of the footage shown of PS5 games from their press conference is very similar to this analysis. Using lower resolution assets for reflections, LoD limitations and select graphical points on any given area where Ray Tracing is applied. Pretty good solution overall, adding the most noticeable parts of Ray Tracing to the games while leaving a lot of the subtle yet performance intensive stuff that current RTX games do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I'm a little nervous about the performance over time though Tip from personal experience, every couple of weeks turn the laptop off and blow into air vents (With compressed air if possible, blowing with a straw also works fine) to clean them a little, you'd be surprised how much dust gets collected in them. Then every 6 months or so open the laptop and clean the fans properly. My laptop is about 1 year old now and I cleaned it for the first time a month or two ago, my temps had slowly crept up by 10-15 #176; and I just didn't make the connection that it must be due to dust accumulation, I just thought it is the summer heat and no way could so much dust and lint acquire in the laptop in less than a year to cause the temps to increase that much but there was a lot inside. Keeping the laptop cooler will definitely extend its life by quite a bit. And, that CPU + GPU combo was very popular in last year's mid range Gaming laptops. 9750H (6c12t) has bad overheating issues but Intel pushed it really hard anyway by offering it at very similar prices to Laptop manufacturers to their 9300H (4c8t) and heavily promoted it to consumers as being way better for Gaming. So the 9750H+1660ti was the most popular combination in Gaming laptops last year and when I was looking to buy a Laptop last year most Laptops had that and most people were recommending that, fortunately the one that I got had customisation options on the manufacturer's site so I got a combination of 9300H+2060 (-$50/+$50) instead for the same price. Risky decision at the time as on paper 9750H sounds way better than the 9300H while 2060 sounds only marginally better than the 1660ti but the real life differences have turned out to be very different. 2060 is actually able to run most RTX games at near Ultra settings with RTX On at 60~ FPS thanks to DLSS 2.0.</TEXT>

I turned every performance intensive setting to 'On' or the Highest option available except Textures which I set to High (Game will not allow me to enable Ultra textures which probably means 6gb Vram isn't enough for that) and LOD (which I left at High). TAA enabled, AMD CAS enabled (Game looks kinda blurry without it being enabled), Dynamic Resolution disabled, DOF at Low, Bloom Off and Motion Blur Off. At default 'High' settings I was actually getting between 70-80 FPS but as I turned most of the settings to Max the performance slowly started dropping. During gameplay I am getting 60-65 FPS most of the time with occasional dips to 58-55 but during Cinematics the game will occasionally tank down to 40~ FPS for a second or two. My issue with the graphics of this game is its Art style, what an absolute dull ass looking game. Do you get more vibrant colours if you pre-order the darn thing or something? Reminds of the dull palette of Phase 1-2 of MCU (Particularly CA Civil War). I even turned up the Vibrance in NVCP to 75% and it barely helped. As far as Photorealism goes, the game looks pretty good, not cutting edge like RDR2 or Metro Exodus but good enough. Iron Man's armour looks particularly flat though, even with all Shadows, SSR and everything else turned to Max. Reflections/Lighting seem to be the issue. Game could use RTX and DLSS. They should also fix their Exclusive Fullscreen cause I don't think Windows Task Bar can just pop-up on Windows Key press in Exclusive Fullscreen modes but it does in this game like it does in Windows Store games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Funny AAA games are making a comeback, I'm happy. So tired of every AAA game trying to be super dramatic and serious.</TEXT>
