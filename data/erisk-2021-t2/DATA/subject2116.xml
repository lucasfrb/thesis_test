    <TEXT>I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm new here, but hopefully you don't mind my opinion. The fact that people will get online and be hurtful to people they don't know (because....yes?) is absolutely awful. I hope you and the other mods can put it behind you and don't let those people get you down. That's just horrible. I hope you feel better soon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely understand. You have to take care of yourself first. You and the other mods. People who think it's okay to hurt people for no reason should just go back to their corners and be ignored. I'm glad you're feeling a little better. Hopefully you'll be 100% soon! :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cutsiewolf if you are really sorry and want to change one thing you could think about doing is helping the people you said you scammed get their stuff back. I've never traded you but I think it would really help the people who did trade with you and lost their stuff. In my opinion that could be one way to start to apologize.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, but there are a lot of people who are still very upset with you about your actions. Maybe try to find them, reach out to them and apologize personally. Unfortunately, I've seen more than one person say that they have been scammed by you. You might be able to look through the comments but either way I'd try to find those people individually and do whatever you can to make it right. It will however be up to them whether they accept your apology so you have to be ready for their decision either way. But if you want to make it right think of starting there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, if that's the only person who you scammed, you need to find out why other people are upset. All of these people aren't mad because you scammed just one person. There has to be more. Hurtful things said? Harassment? Find out why people are angry. You won't really be able to apologize if you don't understand the reason. It will be hard, but that's okay. It will show people that you do want to change and if that's the case that's what I want for you. But please put yourself in the shoes of the people who are upset. You can do this. There are other comments down below and there are other threads of people who have spoken with you. Just start there. I think people will be more willing to give you a chance than one big apology. Final decision up to them though. Best of luck.</TEXT>
