    <TEXT>It just hit me that what if seeing the world as pointless since we all are going to die and be forgotten any way isn #8217;t mental illness or some other problems but instead the truth, and people who see a point of living and working every day like every single normal human routine are the ones who are delusional and can #8217;t accept reality. BTW This doesn #8217;t mean I #8217;ll kill my self but rather live it for someone whom i care for to make their fake life better while it lasts.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Are these normal thoughts orr ... TW**</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Every time is see a gun i think how would it feel inside my mouth or aiming at my head. I #8217;m not thinking about using it i just have thoughts about it, just like when i hold a knife i wonder how would it feel if i cut my self with it, some times i just take a knife and put it on my rest I don #8217;t move it or anything i just do it I don #8217;t know why. Once i had an old knife that wasn #8217;t sharp and i put it on my nick and started moving it, it strangely felt good it didn #8217;t cut because its old and dull. Same with hot drink i think how would it feel if i pour it on my skin or even a lighter how would it feel if i burn my self its like all i think about every time i see something dangerous like on a high place what would it be like if i jump or on a cross walk what will happen if i just jump in the middle of the road. It #8217;s like this all the time some times even without any reason i just think about punching the wall with all my strength. Thank you if you read every thing sorry for writing too much.</TEXT>
