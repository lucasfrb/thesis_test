    <TEXT>Arguably he's one of the steals of this season. I didn't expect him to play this well. I do agree that we should draft another RB just in case Beast Mode leaves (hopefully not). But I can also see Rawls being with us for the long run (if the stays healthy).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i think there is only little things that they can tweak like the amount of vehicles in rush and how they spawn. So far they've nailed the sound design, the gameplay is pretty smooth and the visuals are crisp. I don't think i've seen any other game developer other than DICE that makes beautiful looking explosions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>True, but I'm thinking about the long term. Age will eventually get to AP at some point and he's 31 so, we might as well focus on the O-line. Plus it's one of the major flaws we have in our offence. I still can't stop thinking about the divisional round against ATL. We can't have people tripping up our QB's, especially when it's in our end zone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can barely notice the customisation when your looking at the gameplay. Honestly, people need to chill out. The new mechanics they've introduced will have more of an impact in gameplay rather than some cosmetics. I don't think the customisation will be too over the top. As long as it's WWII era gear then it should be fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's just something about this game that doesn't satisfy me enough. The last COD's I played that were fun were MW3, BO1 and BO2. MW3 was fun cause of infected and BO1 was just overall a fun game with a good campaign, addicting multiplayer as well as the zombies. BO2 was pretty much all for the league play for me and a bit of the zombies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey, I'm pretty new to this subreddit I wasnt sure where to go to get advice from this but, I was thinking of getting a keyboard with 66 keys. Now I wanna play some certain songs like OST's from movies but, I think composers use more than just that. Is it still okay to use and play with 66 keys? Would appreciate the help thanks</TEXT>
