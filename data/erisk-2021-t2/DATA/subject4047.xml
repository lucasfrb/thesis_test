    <TEXT>I have spent a total of 170,000 gold, 17 re-rolls, on my visions iOS-8 bonus. They have all be crap, many repeating back and forth, until I came across this. It is an AMAZING bonus. But I'll need to replace 2 already existing iOS-8 he has equipped, and won't be able to get the full bonus till he is level 50. So do I pass on this or is this iOS-8 bonus hard enough to get that it is worth waiting till 50? F me. http://imgur.com/RsifvZc</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was brought up in another thread with a different topic and I wanted to fill anyone in that might not be aware, considering it can be a bit misleading due to achievements. While you can only have 50 in game friends, you are however able to have way more then 50 Facebook friends. Not sure what the limit is as I have not reached it nor did Netmarble divulge that info. The benefit to this is being able to receive as many Assemble Points as you have friends sending them. There is no max on how many you can receive in a day. There is no max on how many you can claim in a day. There is only a max as to how many you can have in your, let's say, 'wallet' at a time. Which is 2000. TL;DR - 50+ FB friends = more Assemble Points http://imgur.com/pmJ3WqE</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-06-18 07:47:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>With the war for natural resources in Irift continuing to rage on, the country of Mygamia is being reeked havoc upon by the debris shortage crisis. With 8 states already at alert level 40 and 9 more on the brink, the country has seen better days. Thinking about it now takes me back to the early days where dimension debris was vastly abundant due to the fact that society simply didn't know what the heck to do with it. Only for the good old fashion gear to make way to energy particles, fibers, nano technology, and magical essences. As if that wasn't bad enough... The future had to chug along and bring us dimensional debris. The bane of this countries existence. If I could leave this country, I would. However, my hopes for the debris being more dimensional on the other side, are not good. This crisis will, if not already, bring this world to its knees. This is news station... Uh, subject4047...

    <TITLE>Speedster Investment Advice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-30 04:55:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>In a situation were I have a lot of Speed hero items saved up (Norn Stones and Gear Items), and would like some advice on who the best Speed hero to focus on is in your opinion. Being one Biometric away from unlocking Black Cat leaves me with almost all of the Speed heroes unlocked (assum I'll be unlocking her tomorrow in from an Ally Shift). So far the only speed hero I have invested in is Spider-Man, who is well off. I gave a little bit of love to DareDevil also. Initially, I was planning to invest in Black Cat. However, I did some searching around r/MFF and it seems that some individuals are disappointed in her abilities. Because of that, I am now leaning towards Gamora, who I just decided to grab from the Honor Token Shop with some of my many saved up tokens. Yet, I am still indecisive. Any one willing to help push me one way or another on the fence would be greatly appreciated. P.S. Doesn't have to be between Gamora and Black Cat if you find another Hero to be a better investment in your opinion. http://imgur.com/b21Bnq2</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-08-06 07:06:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Marvel Universe, both comic and cinematic, the heroes and villains have teamed up to fight their respective foes. Many of times, it has been done in very unique ways. For instance, Hawkeye shooting and arrow with Ant-Man on the tip of it and just as it hits its target, Ant-Man grows big and punches the fool. Also for example, when Captain America uses his shield to deflect Iron Man's energy beams to hit multiple targets in a circle like the two did in the first Avengers movie. This in mind, I want you to think of the "Purple Button" attack (as some have accurately titled it) that becomes available when you have a special Team-Up bonus. The one where the heroes in the team-up bonus all blindly attack a target with a particular skill set by the developers. I thought it would be fantastically swell, that when the "Purple Button" attack was activated, the heroes/villains in the Team-Up Bonus would all attack, but in a unique cooperative manner as I have mentioned above. Looking at how **many** Team-Up Bonus' there are, you can see the potential for some really fun creativity in the way teams do a "Mega Cooperative Attack" together. Any ideas for cool Team-Up Mega Cooperative Attacks? (That's what I'm calling it now I guess) disagree? Agree? Let's discuss.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of you may have already noticed this, but I just figured it out and thought I'd share my finding with those that did not know. Sister Grimm does both ranged and melee basic attacks. When you're at a distance from the enemy she sends out purple/pink energy bolts from her staff and hand. When she is up close to the enemy, she attacks by swinging her staff and hitting the enemy with it. I just got her a few minutes ago and was surprisingly shocked when I used her in a mission. It is really unique and cool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have come across a specific bug twice in the last few days that really jacked up my VS for the day. When I chose 3 heroes to go into a fight against the new Iron Kingpin, the fight starts and the three heroes that I chose are not the heroes in the fight. Instead of the 3 heroes that I chose, some magical force switches them out for my #1 team. (Who got obliterated due to being my $#!+ team for Arena bait) once you go back into the character selection screen for VS, the characters that I selected were grey'd out and unavailable to now use. When it happens... There literally nothing you can do. Can't restart the game, nothing. You just have to fight it out. I sent NM a ticket about the bug. Till it is fixed I wanted those who were unaware to at least know about this magical force. Good day SIR.</TEXT>

Ironman would go to use his repulsor shot that breaks your attack but just before he gets it off, my UltronPrime uses his jump and stomp attack That also breaks. In that brief moment while Ironman is half stunned from Ultrons breaking attack, a red circle appears under my UltronPrime as if there was a damaging projectile falling from above. then my Ultron gets hit with a laser from above. Question... What is this laser from? ironman doesn't have this attack as far as I'm aware. Is this his uniform bonus that I have never known about since playing since game launch? Am I retarded. Never mind don't answer that please. I already know THAT answer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just used Cap. falcon in a Team-Up battle and got to thinking... There are a few characters who are better off using their basic attack then certain skills. Some are: Drax - basic instead of 1 amp;2* skill Red skull- basic instead of 3* skill (maybe others) Cap. Falcon - basic attack instead of 1 amp;5* skill Yondu - basic attack instead of 1 amp;3* skills Anyone else? In my opinion, a character shouldn't benefit dps wise from using their basic vs a skill.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-01-24 03:23:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Over the last month or so I have noticed a correlation between who I get matched with in MP and who I start the game with. For instance, if I start an MP game with a 5 star, I'll get matched with a 5 star 90% of the time, and every now and then a 6 star. Same thing goes if I start with a 6 star character. I'll get paired with other 6 star characters. It's quite frustrating, especially when a single 6 star level 60 can carry an entire match and I'm trying to bang out my low level toons. I put in one of my 28 6 star toons and I look for low level characters to carry and all I get is other 6 stars. Anyone else feel this mechanic should be reworked?</TEXT>

What do you think the 6 star skills will look like (or you would like them to look like) for the remaining 16 characters in the game who have yet to have said skill implemented. For convenience, The 16 remaining are as follows; Green Goblin Yellow Jacket Giant-Man Vision Ronin Falcon Nebula Wasp Red Skull Yondu Bullseye Our LORD and savior (M.O./S.P.I.D.O.K) Destroyer Elektra Black Cat Hawkeye</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone around these parts know of an easy way to make a few bucks online to buy juice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-16 03:05:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a non-traditional college student living on campus that due to recent circumstces was left with .60 #162; in his bank account and the penny I found in the cafeteria the other day. I ran out of juice weeks ago and have been bumming cigarettes off people. They are absolutely disgusting (smoked Newport 100's for 11 years and vaped for the last 2). One kind lovely lady even spared me a tank of juice. I'm going out of my mind. I have a high milligram nicotine addiction. Picking shorted out cigarettes out of ashtrays is draining every ounce of pride and respect out of myself. I arrived in this tiny town in the middle of nowhere this semester and have applied to every business close enough to work with my schedule. No luck so far. Now I'm not asking for a hand out here. If I was I'd head over to r/vapeitforward or the other one where people ask for help. (I find nothing wrong with that, just have a really hard time asking people for things) I don't feel bad asking for advice, though. My question is, does anyone know of a good way to make a few buck online (surveys, reward apps, etc) so I can hopefully order some discount juice. (16 dollars for 100ml at bluedotvapor! Crazy!) I would be greatly appreciative of any knowledge. Thanks in advance. TL;DR - Anyone know of a way to make a few dollars online (surveys, reward apps, etc) so a desperate man can buy cheap discount juice online?</TEXT>

However I have about 70 GUK's. Every character is at gear level at least at level 9 and we're all leveled up before the free +5 gears update. My bottleneck used to be DD, but once the 6*'s started rolling in and I did A LOT more ~~team-up~~ co-op. Now that I have all but two farmable character at 6/6/60 there isn't much reason for me to do story. I've been on Botha sides of the bottleneck. Truth is, your on one side or another. It just so happens to be the scrubs are at the DD bottleneck ;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've be thinking (not a normal occurrence)... I wonder if the Civil War Event is going to end in an intentional drawl/tie crafted by NM. A few things that make me think this are the fact that Feige and other Marvel heads keep repeating that their goal was to make the audience torn between sides, with no clear right and wrong side. ~~My other though is CMNN saying there will be no difference in rewards upon event ending.~~ **(correction: this statement made by r/CMNightNurse was in regards to the event that held voting on the forums, not the in-game event)** Lastly, the thought of many people being annoyed they didn't win and missed out on rewards others received. Kind of far fetched to think the dev's have a guaranteed tie in mind but something to chew on. What do you folks think? **[EDIT]** poor research.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA - *IMPORTANT* regarding accidentally pressing continue after losing to World Boss.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-30 07:59:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL;DR - if you are fast enough, and I me fast (before the flashing animation finishes) you can force close and cancel out the spending of the 300 crystal. Just yesterday I was playing the game on auto pilot and rummaging around in my cavern of a brain. I tight to myself, "I wonder how long it will be until we get a rage post on the sub from someone who accidentally pressed the continue button after losing to a World Boss". Welp, I no longer need to wonder, because seconds ago it was about to be me. I had just lost to Thanos because I was only half paying attention (watching the new CowChop channel, it's awesome, check it out). I let the defeated screen sit there for a moment. When I averted my attention back to the game I, for some ungodly reason, pressed the GREEN button, which is the continue button costing 300 crystals. Literally , the instant I pressed it and the flashing animation started, I double clicked the home button and threw the app into the abyss of force closed games towards the top of the screen. I was instantly filled with adrenaline. Red faced, pounding heart, utter RAGE. I was going to run over here and post the aforementioned RAGE post but decided it more pertinent to check my crystals first. Low and behold, They were safe and sound. God bless your knuckles, and may your thumbs be ever swift fellow fighters. Good day. P.s. There really needs to be a, "are ya' sure this is how you wanna waste your money?" Dialog box.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Another BD bug or new skill? (Different then the one currently being discussed)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-05-23 23:32:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I understand there is another discussion going on regarding Black Dwarf's 3rd phrase skills being used out of order. While I have been experiencing that nonsense, this is not that. This odd bug or new skill has been happening to me when fighting Black Dwarf. It usually occurs during his 3rd phrase. Instead of doing his normal charge where his telegraph displays and then he runs at the player, he starts his charge and then ends up on the other side of the arena as if he teleported through me al the while doing damage. It happened on my first run, but I chalked it up as a weird lag glitch. Then it happened a handful more times. I considered maybe it was lag, but I'm playing on an iPad Air II and have never experienced any lag issues as well as the fact that there are no other lag type issues occurring during the match. And the "telecharge", as I've coined it, doesn't look jenky as if it were lagging out. It looks smooth as if he were meant to be... Entering my body and then...leaving abruptly. Anyone else experience this?</TEXT>

But I'm a collector and am probably not going to be able to get him now. OR I could have gotten a 6* ticket. Super sad face right now. I also bought a x10 card pack and got another heaping, steaming, load of dog shit. A legendary SHIELD #8. I've been digging around looking for the Civil War #3 or 4 with no luck. I have an alternate account that I made when back when new player rewards came in a patch(wanted to check them out).

    <DATE>2016-06-04 04:51:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I only really started noticing this the last month or so. I've found that the day after TimeLine resets that I cannot find an opponent that gives 69 points. The highest I can find is 78, regardless of the point value of the opponent. Even when my opponent has 5x my current total point value they are still only listed as giving 68 points. However, on every other day (even the day **of** reset), an opponent with 5x my current total point value is a guaranteed 69 points.

    <TITLE>So... Zero cooldown Tier 2 Antman is a thing in BW now.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-15 06:02:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me preface this with a question. In live battle world, when the little speech bubble disappears mid battle, does that mean the opponent has left the match? Anyway, I just fought someone with a decent team. Proxima/tier2 Ant-man/tier2 cap/ and some others I can't remember. I rinsed through his team and got down to his tier2 Ant-man. This Ant-man had ZERO cool-down on his 5* skill, leaving me completely unable to hit him. He would pop it and fly around, it would finish, and he would pop it again. Not only that but his tier 2 passive was re-proc'ing before it even ran out. Two thoughts, this was either an AI bug that somehow happened after the guy left the fight (hence the question at the beginning), this guy has a bugged ant-man, or the gentleman was flat out cheating. The match ended in a stalemate. He couldn't do enough damage to my carnage before he grabbed a heal blob, and he could touch my Loki in his shield. I don't know wether to be hella pissed off at finding a cheating scrub lord, or relieved that it's a bug. What do you guys think.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>https://imgur.com/a/rWnRe Around the time I got my first Octobot and got the battle doctor octopus screen I sent Spider-Man on a mission related to starting that part of the even (yellow exclaim action point). I don't remember exactly what the mission was but I swore it was to fight doctor octopus. Well the spidey mission just ended and I got the cut scene where doctor octopus is defeated and kneeling on the ground. It went through the dialog and I got a new mission to delete him 2 more times. But I haven't received any of threaded for defeating him. I didn't get the MJ token and there is not green check mark on the reward check sheet for the first fight. Also can't figure out how to fight him again. I'm training BC and Wasp, do I need to wait for them to be done training for THEM to fight? I'm lost. Anyone experience this or anyone that c help would be greatly appreciated. Ty in advance.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-19 18:22:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Similar to Sharon 13's exploitative 5* skill, you can achieve infinite Immune to Damage with our boy Bucky Barns as Captain America. By canceling his 3* skill, 'Cover Fire' with any other skill, you can trigger the uniform bonus without triggering the cool-down on the skill. It takes some good timing, maybe even more so then with miss 13, but it is possible. I have not seen it mentioned 'round these 'ere parts so I figured I cue in those who haven't already figured this out. Cheers boys. 'Ave a good day. :)</TEXT>

I just lost my first timeline battle in, quite possibly, a year. I have not noticed much of a pattern change but I **have** noticed that every character seems to have an invincibility proc. there is a lot less one shotting enemy AI in timeline because of this.

    <DATE>2016-08-21 21:54:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello all! We are **True Marvel**. We are always in **the top 20** and are so very close to breaking deep into the **top 16 for the tournament**. **Are you able to clear all AB days** (or almost all except combat but score 1.7m+) and are part of an inactive alliance and want a shot at the alliance tournament? **Then we are looking for YOU to make that magic happen!** We are a highly competitive level 30 alliance. We have many pros here that score well over 1.76m a week. We are most importantly a family and a brotherhood. When you are strong together, great things can happen. We are friendly, highly helpful, and knowledgeable. **You won't be asked/pressed to force close. We just ask that you complete AB every day.** We post daily videos and detailed guide charts and are extremely organized. **We are also an ENGLISH speaking alliance. We also use LINE.** This is important for communication. We do not require you to actively use Line daily (though it is fun and encouraged), but check it a few times a day for key points of communication. We have a brother alliance **MARVEL GODS** whom we rotate out members as needed for many reasons such as vacation, emergencies, or planning ahead for any reason. **If you want to join us but you score between 1.4m and 1.7m you can join Marvel Gods until your scores improve then you can move to True Marvel.** We also have many members including myself who are able to do Infinity Thanos x5 and have videos and guides for that as well that are available for members. So if you are an awesome, fun going, swell fella or gal looking to be ultra competitive, and be a part of one of the best alliances in the game, **PM me on Line: mohamedelagaty and/or theembodimentofswag.**</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've experienced a bug where I didn't receive any of the gold that I got as a reward for the black order rifts. I first noticed it after doing 3 of them. My gold was still at the same amount that it was before long the rift. So I decided to test it with the two remaining entires I had. Turns out I would receive the rewarded gold, but once my game restarts, the gold I was rewarded is gone. I took pictures of each stage. 1. The amount of gold I have originally 2. The gold I'm rewarded 3. The new amount of gold 4. My gold after restarting game http://imgur.com/a/2rTiX It pretty frustrating missing out on around 600k gold d if anyone else is experiencing this bug, I suggest you send in a support ticket.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-10-27 06:21:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm currently stuck in a secret (well know I have no idea) underground room in Maltic. It's in one of the houses(forget which one). In the house there is a button that moves a crafting table to a ladder that leads down. Down there are barrels of whiskey and some kind of Pinot. Then, in that room, there is another button that moves a block in a fountain that leads down again into a mycelium covered hole. In this little space are two signs. One reads "the only way out is DEATH". The other sign makes no sense to me, but say, "H IL PEPER D". There is a stone button that opens the hole you came through but it is too high up to get out through and I can't teleport up there (mage). I tired googling everything I could think of and scoured the official WynnCraft forum and can't find anything that helps. Does anyone know of an alternative way out other then killing yourself? Also, is this little secret area even well known? I couldn't find any information on it online. Any help would be greatly appreciated. TL;DR- Stuck in secret underground room in Maltic. Any other way out than Death? Help pls.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just drank a 5-hour energy and found myself writing a short novel of a review in the Apple AppStore.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-28 00:21:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wanted to share my review. I need to get this off my mind. If it was not for this game being Marvel centric, I would never had taken a second glance at it in the AppStore. I continue to play as a non spending player because I believe Tiny Co doesn't deserve an ounce of our money, and as I mentioned, I love everything Marvel. I love the Marvel universe and its characters so much that I am willing to continue playing a very mediocre sim game who's developers practices I hate, all the while it giving me a headache. Review; "Forget the bugs, glitches, and literal lack of game play, this is the most exploitative game I have ever come across and the fact that Marvel properties are associated with it disgusts me. It's a through and through pay to do anything game. The player is teased with shiny new items, then given an unrealistic timeframe to achieve said items, coaxing them into spending money to speed things up before they shiny items disappear for good. I've dedicated a fair amount of time(no money) to this game as I love everything Marvel, and event after event, I feel nothing but disappointment. Even if one were to go the pay-to-do anything route, the price for artificial digital goods are unreasonably high. The highest I have ever seen in a mobile game. For anyone who takes the time to ready this(realistically no one, lol), and you are looking for an amazing Marvel mobile game to play, check out Marvel Future Fight. I can't recommend this game enough. Not only is it a fantastic beat-em'-up RPG with amazing graphics, but it is also the most generous game I have ever come across since the inception of mobile gaming and micro transacts. Over the span of almost two years, In the entire game there have been only 2 completely pay walled characters, who are genuinely cheap to get if you wanted to spend money. The amount of giveaways and gifts received are insane. Almost to the point where any business major would scratch his head thinking how the devs make a living. It's also fairly easy for a new player to come along at this stage of the games lifespan and catch up to other players who have been around for months. With amazing monthly updates, I find myself and my amazing group of friends (my alliance) eagerly anticipating the scheduled updates bringing new characters, new uniforms, new game modes, and QOL improvements. Not only all of this, but the MFF community has a great place to congregate. /r/Future_Fight. The Community Mangers are very active and great at relaying information to and from the developers. It's a great place to kick it. -end rant P.s. Seriously... Avengers Academy's shady practices and extreme pricing should be cast from earth into hell with dormommo. " TL;DR- made long review in AppStore. I play cause it's Marvel related. If you're tired of the bs too, check out Marvel Future Fight along with its great subreddit /r/Future_Fight. You won't regret it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[pondering] why do some skill attacks with multiple hits register as one hit and some register as multiple hits.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-09 05:41:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>For instance, take Yellow Jacket and Gwen Poole. Yellow Jackets 6* skill has him zip passed the target doing a single bit of damage 3 times before settling in the air for one massive beam attack. Then we have Gwen Poole's 6* skill. She throws two buttons. When each button hits its target, it is a considered a single hit separate from the other baton and the damage dealt from the explosive presents she drops. You can see this difference when using a damage increase proc on an obelisk. When the damage increase proc on Yellow Jacket initiates on the first hit of his 6* skill, it continues to stay in effect throughout the entire animation. Subsequently all 3 passing attacks and the large beam at the end of the animation. Whereas for Gwen Poole, if the damage increase proc initiates on the first hit of her 6* skill (the first baton), it will deactivate on the second baton hit and not stay in effect for the remainder of the skill animation or the remaining damage dealt. This is less of a question as it is me pondering out loud and looking for discussion. The answer is obviously, because the developers designed it this way. But the question I pose is why? Why have some multi hit attacks register as one hit while others register as multiple separate attacks.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-11-10 10:19:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>The first mastery star gives 'remove debuff from entire team' passive for 20 seconds and has a cooldown of 30 seconds. This doesn't change until the third mastery star where the cooldown drops from 30 to 25 seconds. After that, consecutive mastery stars don't change the passive. I just noticed this tonight as I was working on her. I'm surprised I haven't seen discussion regarding this. Maybe I just missed it and I'm beating dead horse. What are your thoughts on this? Is it laziness? Where they at a loss for something better? It seems so underwhelming for a Black Order character to have this kind of discrepancy with their leadership passive. Granted Malekith's passive has a longer cooldown, but even he has an energy defense buff that incrementally increases with each mastery.</TEXT>

I just did 5 of them bringing me to the 10 you need to do to automatically get Groudon (or the guaranteed epic). In those 10, x10 drawls... I pulled one epic. Groudon. Lol. Either really bad odds or just terrible rng luck. [edit] I take that back. I did pull another epic. Actually duped it too. It's so shit that I forgot I even pulled it. I pulled a Melloetta, and in the next drawl duped her. She's not the worst... but she's pretty shit in my experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I may be going crazy but hear me out for a second. The other day I was dicking around in game. I clicked on something and was able to view upcoming pokemon, I.e. Diancie and them. I just now wanted to go back and check them out as I wasn't on my break at work. I can't find what I was looking at! Am I making up memories or is there some sub menu or rank menu that shows some of the upcming mons. PS, is Sylveon a ledge? Why is it so poop?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-05 05:05:53</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm making a mid game Ice team. I just managed to pull a good personality regice and a neutral personality Kyurem in the snow weather we just had. My questions revolve around the third member of this team. 1. Who is the best in the game to match with these two. 2. Who is the best from the ice pokes that I have.  #8226; Aurorus  #8226; Lapris  #8226; Vanilluxe  #8226; Super Abomasnow (who I have on another team but willing to use him in this ice team)  #8226; Weavile Thanks for any help folks.  #9786; #65039; Edit- I'm now seeing that kyurem is pretty shit. I'm surprised. I expected him to be a lot better then a B on the tier list. Bummer. I see that he is good for trading in for the white or black version. Also, what's up with slacking. His skills say self stun and self dizziness. Does he stun himself or the enemy?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-07-14 11:41:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I set an alarm to wake up early today to try out the 4 tickets I had to try and catch registeel in advanced Myst. Upon entering, what do I see there but a registeel, without using a single ticket. I catch it, and quickly goto check its perso. -p.def +sp.atk. I don't know what he uses yet so I'm thinking this could either be great or horrible. I check and the skill I click on says he uses p.atk. So bummed. I had 2 catches and three tickets left. I figured fuck it. Let's see if he pops up again, having no faith that he would. I use the auto catch for the remaining two and who pops up on the next set? Registeel! Whoo hoo! I quickly catch him, this time using only 6 pokeballs. Than, the moment of truth, to check his perso. And it's... -p.atk + Sp.atk. Now I'm super bummed. So now bummed and curious what this guys skills are even like I goto take a gander. And what do I see... Only one skill is p.atk and the rest are sp.atk?!? Well now Im just confused. And maybe a little hopefull. Anyone able to clear up registeel's type of atk that he uses? Is it both? Is one a typo? I hope he uses so.atk and it's a typo. Thanks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Updated iOS by accident and only had an old back up. Lost 6 months of data.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-02 03:28:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been getting the nagging "would you like to update" prompt for the last few months. I always ignore it. But today when waking up from a nap my finger slipped and accepted the update. I panicked and the only thing I could think of to stop it was to force turn off the phone. I did this and when it turned back on there was again a progress bar. The progress bar finished and than I was left with the "charging cable and iTunes logo on a black background" screen, and it had the URL for the apple support page. I plugged it into iTunes and it forced a restore. I couldn't get back into the phone nor just go ahead with the update. Nothing I googled or tried from my 7+ years of iPhone tinkering worked so I said f*** it, restore. I wasn't sure of the status of my iCloud back-ups. I though I might be boned by a few weeks, at worst a month. But I got hit with; "January 31st 10:35pm" back up. I tired other iCloud accounts I have to see if I had something more recent on them. Nothing. So I updated from my old ass back up. It wasn't so much the apps I lost. It was more so the notes(which some were extremely important), the text messages(new phone numbers), and most importantly the photos(specifically the rare moment photos I took of the family dog who is very old and soon to pass away). This back-up was so old my background was still an image of my ex lol. Idk... I'm super bummed right now. It feels like a 6 month chunk of my life was just ripped away, never to be remembered through photos. An important 6 months too. I'm almost certain there is nothing to be done at this point. Grasping at straws I figured Id reach out to good ol' Reddit as a last ditch effort. Thanks in advance friends. Sorry for being long winded. [edit] I'm confused now. My contacts that are more recent than Jan. 31st are still saved in my phone. How are contacts saved still and not photos.</TEXT>

My best team consists of; Flash Origin Groudon Ground plate Arceus Flash Mega Garchomp With a total CP of 1.916m My next is; Flash Regigigas Melloetta CharX (he's in rotation with other mons) I have a bunch more legendaries who are just currently being worked on. I play every day and I'm super active. If anyone has any spots open and is looking for a new member, please drop me a line. Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As of right now there are three characters in game that are now locked behind a lottery pull. This is awful practice. NM isn #8217;t stupid, they know this. Of course everyone is going to be up in arms. What is they had plans to say... idk, put three character behind the x20 bios to help increase rev. But they knew everyone would lose their shit. So, instead they do this chest nonsense, so that when everyone complains they can say  #8220;okay we got rid of the chest and just threw them in the x20 daily bios #8221;. That way the sting of 3 new characters locked behind a pay way is lessened because it #8217;s not as bad as RNG character pulls. TL:DR- is this move on purpose? So when they  #8220;fix #8221; it we #8217;re happy with their shitty original plan?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The last 5 token packages that I bought always gave me double tokens. 6 thousand instead of 3 thousand. I posted about this before with pictures documenting me going from zero token - buying the package - than having 6k tokens. I just now purchased the package again and this time I only received the advertised amount (3k). Was this ever officially acknowledged by the devs? My last post about this package had half the comments saying they had never heard or seen it happen and the other half, like myself, claiming otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just tier-3 #8217;d my cap who I #8217;ve been sitting on for a few days. I wanted to wait until I saw the other two first. When you advance a character to tier-3 it plays this sweet ass animation of them doing something cool. Cap is all in slow-mo, walking towards the camera and popping his IW shields out. The background is all red white and blue patterns like when he uses his t3 skill. It #8217;s badass. I wish I could replay it. If I knew I would of started my recording. Anyway, just thought I #8217;d share as not many have tier-3 #8217;d anyone yet and those who have haven #8217;t mentioned it on here. Enjoy the patch boiks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tier-2 ticket From the 3-year anniversary check-in reward continuing to pop up at first open of daily rest.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-25 07:01:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this has been going on for a few weeks now. When I launch the game for the first time after daily reset, and the check-in-rewards pop up showing what was received for the day and sent to my inbox, it has been showing the tier-2 ticket. However, no ticket is in my inbox nor in my inventory, and I am fairly certain that this true-2 tier-2 ticket in question was legitimately received weeks if not over a month or two ago. I've recently been playing on a new device as my daily driver is temporarily out of service, and th is temporary device is deathly slow. Around the time I switched devices is when I noticed this issue, which seemed of to me at first, however I don't believe they're is any correlation. Is anyone around here experiencing anything similar?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Usually I totally agree with you. I #8217;ve just never seen the little product window as a display of the products count. I #8217;d pick that one up, see the little things in there, and then look to see the amount on the package. My point is, when you see a product who #8217;s little widow only shows two items, you don #8217;t assume there #8217;s only two items in. So why when you see a product with a bunch of items in the window would you assume that there are many more.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the problem is It just comes down to personal perspective. I don #8217;t see myself ever being fooled by this specific one because of the way I interact with said products. Therefore I project my experience on others and expect them to have the same thought process. And to be honest, I was having a hard time following what I wrote as I was thinking it, ha. I #8217;m trying to type out an answer to your question as I figured it out for myself. As I said usually I #8217;m on board with 99% of these post.

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been playing since the very day of global release. Missed a handful of days over the years. I was looking at my friends list the other day and found 20+ people who hadn #8217;t logged-in to the game from a month to 2 years. Lol. I started cleaning that shit up. It felt kind of bad though. Some of them were people that I first started playing the game with when co-op came out. I actually kept a few in the off chance they come back some day. Went from receiving approximately 400-500 points a day to... well, idk. A lot more then that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My boss, the owner of the bar I tend, is the judge of the small town I go to school in. One night I over heard a gentleman talking about how every time he comes to the bar he pees on the rolls of toilet paper in the men #8217;s bathroom. I told my boss about this. Apparently he was the judge who presided over his drug charges and ultimately convicted him. He was considered a VIP (very intoxicated person) one night. I escorted him out. Hours later He was found by some patrons behind the bar in the ally way. He was unconscious laying in a puddle of his own urine.</TEXT>

And it was fun learning about them. Also... any character that would have game changing mechanics. Maybe silver surfer? I mean along the lines of sentinel, quick silver, Doctor strange, etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two weeks ago my older brother committed suicide. He got in a cold bath and swallowed 5 bottles of pills. He was Found with no pulse. The EMTS managed to resuscitate him. He was then rushed to the ICU where he was intubated. After a day or so of him in a coma, we decided not to pull the plug and move him over to the Neuro-science unit to hook him up to a continuous EEG to try and determine the amount of brain damage. 2 weeks later to now and I have my older brother back. Albeit with some seemingly serious brain damage. The worst part of all of this situation, my family and I don #8217;t believe he learned anything from this experience. There is a genuine concern among us that he damaged he prefrontal cortex. Then today... I had to put my #1 girl down. A 7lb., almost 15 year old yorkie. I had to hold her as this vet injected poison into her vein. Hold her as she cried and yelped as the drug slowed her tiny beating heart to a stop. It was horrifying. She fought till the last second. The part I can #8217;t get over is she wasn #8217;t just a dog to me. She was a family member. Everyone #8217;s favorite family member. She had a personality. She may as well of been a person. And I had to decide to kill her. What right do I have. It makes me sick to my stomach. I #8217;m the type of person who #8217;s wears their heart on their sleeve. I #8217;ve never had a good poker face. Only when I #8217;m bottling and caving in on myself have I ever been able to pull off emotionless. And even then, you can tell something is wrong and I #8217;m bottling. I say this about myself because after going through all of this I have to try and be a productive member of society. Going to work and acting like I am emotionally okay is eating away at me. So hear I am. Venting on r/sad. I find it kind of pathetic.

    <DATE>2019-05-21 21:58:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m dying to know where Trevor got that shirt. Close to the end of the video I realize I have the exact same shirt. Then I look down and think,  #8220;oh shit! I #8217;m *wearing* that shirt! #8221; They #8217;re identical... from the  #8220;Jersey #8221; fabric material, the color of the fabric, the collar style, the button color and style, to the stitching around the sleeves and collar. It even has that specific stitching that his shirt has around the buttons with that extra line of stitching under the bottom most button. This was a weird realization to me. Which I #8217;m sure won #8217;t be weird to *anyone* else. [picture for posterity. don #8217;t want my future generations being labeled as non thorough. ](https://imgur.com/a/HeiPwRX)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been playing since global. And have missed approx 10 days of logging in since. On top of that I #8217;ve spent a bit of money. I #8217;m no whale but I am a couple thousand points away from vip 9. My point is I #8217;ve been playing a long time and have accrued a lot of characters. I only made it to level 75 though. There #8217;s people making it into the hundreds. Really the key is to use your crappy characters on lower levels and save your one hit wonders for high 30+. Using one tier 2/3 at a time is also key. Edit: don #8217;t sweat it. All of us old heads were in your shoes at one point. Part of the fun is the journey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s why it IS useful. You can only see two tiles up. For instance, say you want to hit every red flag to maximize how many good relics you get (which is what I do) you need to be able to see past two tiles in order to know which path to take. That way you don #8217;t hug the left if their are red flags on the right.</TEXT>

I #8217;m going to most likely be buying all of them anyway as skins are my favorite part in any game I #8217;ve played (specifically Marvel Future Fight).

    <TEXT>This was super clutch, thanks for the tip. I never paid much attention to Soren, as far as experimenting with teams and researching good team comps goes. I just used your recommended team instead of my normal campaign heavy hitters and went from 42.3mil to 127.3mil. A drastic increase. The key is getting Warek behind Soren, and timing Lucious #8217; alt to keep Warek alive. It took a few tries but it #8217;s pretty simple to get down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The part that annoys me the most about Lit mobile ads is that it #8217;s a dramatization if an influencer opening a product package sent to them from a company. Yet it #8217;s never made clear that it is fake. It #8217;s predatory to younger audiences who don #8217;t have the wherewithal to realize it #8217;s not their - best friend streamer guy they #8217;ve never met and doesn #8217;t know their name - opening a hot new product. All I wanna know is who tf is ME! These  #8220;influencers #8221; say  #8220;Lit mobile just sent ME a package... #8221;, yet their faces are cut off and they never explain who the fuck they are. That #8217;s because they #8217;re not influencers, or streamers, or youtubers. They #8217;re interns, paid actors and marketing staff doing VO of someone handling their product. Their ads are akin to the  #8220;Real People #8221; commercials that Chevy ran.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depending on the circumstance, I #8217;m rather quick to violence myself. Even more so when I was that kids age. And I #8217;m the crackeriest cracker you #8217;ll ever meet. However, Back to my original question. I asked you to elaborate. What did your statement about reinforcing black stereotypes have to do with me loving when racist white kids get their ass beat outta their mouths. The only conclusion I can come to is you thought I was black when you read my comment. That you were implying I myself was emboldening the stereotype that African Americans are quick to violence because I, a cracker so cracker I #8217;m clear, love watching racist white kids get their ass beat outta their mouths. That #8217;s what I wanted you to elaborate on. Not *what* you said, but *why* you said it. Edit: just noticed you #8217;re username.  #129315; ironic coincidence.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m 31 and need to put this feeling I #8217;m having into words. For as long as I can remember Ive felt a gut wrenching feeling of sadness whenever I see a heavy set person be denied food in a matter similar to this. Never skinny or fit people though. I don #8217;t know *exactly* why this is. Grasping at straws here, I think maybe it #8217;s because they #8217;re heavy and my brain assumes that they #8217;re **extra** excited for the food. So when the situation goes awry they become **extra** upset with whatever the situation is because they lost the food they were so excited to eat. Knowing what it #8217;s like to have something you #8217;re excited for knocked out of your grasp like I can emphasize with them. Only it #8217;s even worse for them. Generally mocked by the public for their weight, heavy set people already feel enough embarrassment. I could just imagine... a young heavy set woman out on lunch. She Goes to sit down onto a bench with her slice of pizza that she is wildly craving (both because the reward center in her brain is intertwined with unhealthy food and the fact that she #8217;s extra hungry cause her body needs extra food consumption = extra craving!). But as she sits, the bench buckled under her weights and collapses throwing both her and her slice of pizza onto the grass. Now... if that were me, my ass woulda 10 second rule #8217;d that bitch. But I can imagine this imaginary woman being ashamed of her weight and being ever conscious of the people around her and their (existing/non-existing) opinions so she quietly slinks away from hawking eyes, leaving her sad little slice of pizza behind. And now she #8217;s hungry **and** embarrassed. Sorry, just had to figure that out here for myself. I #8217;ve been experiencing this for 31 years now and have never given this phenomenon a presence in my conscience. Anyone else #8217;s brain do this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol. I figured it was obvious that humans didn #8217;t produce microchips with their bare hands. And with limited title space didn #8217;t think I needed to add such caveats. The second half of your question sheds more light on a possible answer however. Based on your comment about the length of existing transistors, it #8217;s seems as though we #8217;re backing up against the physical limitations of how small they can already be. Thanks you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. Can you at least see where my brain is? I was asking based off the assumption that microchip advancement was hitting its limits due to us not being able to make them any smaller. But based on what your saying a transistor couldn #8217;t be shrunk down. Since A transistor is already so few atoms and we #8217;re not shrinking those atoms where removing them. I think this question is more suited for a science fiction reality where laws of physics do what the writers want like in the move ant man.</TEXT>

Not until I googled  #8220;iPhone stuck at Apple logo after uncover #8221; did I find this reddit post.

    <TEXT>I #8217;d got this game on day one of its global launch, as I discovered the beta window two weeks too late. I maybe missed 7 days in almost 5 years. Then around January I decided to take a bit of a break. Started playing a new game, had a new girl, holiday stress etc. I popped in on updates to look at what was up but didn #8217;t play more then a few minutes. (I was dying inside as a uniform completionism, I #8217;ve missed so many cool uniforms the last 5 months) I recently decided to come back. It was ultimately the epic quest and me drooling over uni #8217;s that I wanna play with. Anyway, I say this cause it really did a refresher on the game for me. I #8217;m no longer burdened by the feeling of doing chores. If I don #8217;t feel like playing that day I don #8217;t. Or just hop in and get log in bonus. A break can be good. Plus some sweet ass returning player rewards.  #128077; good luck bud.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Two questions; Anyone know which tier-3 skills change based on the characters uniform. For instance Spider-Man has 3 alternate tier-3 skills depending on his uniform. Infinity war #8217;s iron spider and prior have the same skill, then far from home is different, and then far from homes stealth suit is a bit different. Are there any others? Second; does anyone have a list of the character skills that change when the skill icon is held in? For instance Sabretooth without uniform. TIA  #128522;</TEXT>

Which of these starred uniforms would you recommend me getting. *i don #8217;t have namor unlocked yet* [uniforms ](https://imgur.com/a/arGTZUc) I took a couple months break, after playing for over 4 years straight, starting around Christmas. Before the break I was a uniform completionist and collector so it #8217;s killing me not having some of these uniforms. I want them ALL. But for right now I #8217;m just dipping my toe back in and don #8217;t feel like blowing money and can only get one more after just buying Odin. Thanks for any responses.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks a ton for responding. This is killing me. I can #8217;t decide. Of course during my break they #8217;d release uniforms for the most op characters in the game that I have maxed out. So when I get back I want to get them all. I #8217;ve been leaning hard between silver surfer (working on T3) and scarlet witch (don #8217;t have uncanny). But then there #8217;s cable, who is an absolute pissing fountain of pain, Jean grey who still hasn #8217;t been knocked from her own tier on tier lists, quick silver who spins heads at break neck speeds while eat a hotdog, Apoc who I felt was garbage since day one and in need of a mini skirt, Wolverine who #8217;s 5 star skill does like 180 hits vs 90 on his new uni, and then the ones in the  #8220;badass looking #8221; group. Red hulk, punisher, redskull, cap, and doc oc. Ultimately, I #8217;m asking myself, do I want to make my op characters more op or make a sh #239;tty character suddenly viable for shadowlands.  #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039; #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039; #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039; #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>THATS exactly what I was thinking along the lines of scarlet. I was bummed out that I missed two of her as she #8217;s my favorite hero AND she #8217;s stupid op. In fact I #8217;m a day or two away from her T3. But I #8217;m like... if I wait they #8217;ll probably come out with a better one for her show and then I won #8217;t care as much that I missed these two. Me too on the badass unis. Before I took that break I had a comprehensive 197 uniforms out of something like 210. Making a shitty outdated and outclassed hero good again is my favorite. Gives me a reason to use them and typically makes them look awesome. Lol cable is a squishy lil hoe. What to do what to do. This shouldn #8217;t be this difficult. Question: I know colossus IS meta for timeline, but I don #8217;t know why. How come?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m still so confused by the patch notes time of maintenance. It says local time at 2am on 7/21/20. What is the local time for? Shanghai? China? Cause google says they #8217;re located in Shanghai which apparently has the same time as me. Which is 3am 7/21/20. Based on that, maintenance should of been an hour ago. So is it China then? Wait how #8217;s that possible, China is 12 hours ahead of me. They #8217;re already past the date and time.  #129318; #8205; #9794; #65039; someone help me. My brain has stopped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wait ah minute... maintenance used to always be at 4am for me. East coast US. When did they change that? Someone last update told me the patch notes were based on Lilliths local time zone. I actually did look at the am/pm on a military time conversion chart to make sure my mental conversion wasn #8217;t off. But I was assuming it was 2pm-4pm for another time zone since maintenance always used to be in the middle of the night for me. Ultimately the patch notes need no conversion. They are as is. They just changed when they do maintenance and I confused myself. Thanks for the reply.</TEXT>

Netmarble unabashedly finds more and more blatant ways to dig deeper into its player bases pockets.

    <TEXT>He really was. Especially for co-op. Me and a group of guild mates would do this thing where one of us would use Goliath to carry the fight and then bail last minute so he could be used again. Then we #8217;d take turns each with our own goliaths until we all cleared out our entire roaster in co-op. Which was a long and difficult task considering 6* characters were relatively new and the entrance requirement was 4* I think. It #8217;d take us over three hours to do it. But we had a lot of fun. Damn it #8217;s been a long run since global launch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I have Arthur #8217;s furniture at 3/3. I #8217;m using him in the tower and trying to pay super close attention to when it procs. But I can #8217;t see it or it doesn #8217;t happen. As I understand it, to put it simply, after he uses his ultimate ability, the next character to die doesn #8217;t die and instead receives a shield, right? If that #8217;s how it #8217;s supposed to work it ain #8217;t happ #8217;n. Instead he gets his ult off and the next hero to die... well, just dies. No shield, no death saving animation no nuffin #8217;. Or I #8217;m doing something wrong. Anyone wanna weigh in here? Some advice? A correction of my understanding of his 3/3 furniture? Maybe some footage? Thanks in advance</TEXT>

Far enough in the game to be level 165 and not know how to change wallpaper at the whale in despite having already done it with other rooms. How odd There #8217;s two ways to do it. If you have an entire theme collected you can do it with one button. It #8217;s under  #8220;themes #8221; when editing a room. If you don #8217;t have every piece unlocked of said theme you can #8217;t change it with one button. The second way is to do it manually. Change the wallpaper and all the furniture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn #8217;t get it at first either. But then I figured out the grift. It #8217;s a way (or presumably *was* a way) to ultimately purchase items in game that cost real currency with diamonds. People who abuse it do so by purchasing something that costs real world currency. Say for instance a dimensional hero (which costs 50 usd at seemingly permanent discount). But then they refund it through google or Apple. Because they #8217;ve now refunded it, Liliths system subtracts from their diamonds the refunded amount (50 usd worth of diamonds). At this point they have essentially paid for a dimensional hero with just diamonds. However in this guys case, it seems as though Lilith has gotten wise to the grift and has deducted his diamond count more then 50 dollars worth of crystals (the price of a dimensional hero) in order to deter this being done again in the future by him or others. It #8217;s their punishment for him grifting Lilith.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ha, I love you speaking with authority at chapter 12. Shem and Belinda were extremely useful well before dimensionals. Problem is they fall off at later stages. However you are right that they are slightly *more* useful now with dimensionals as in late game they can be fused without potentially messing up comps that need x hero + dimensional, cause chances are your not going to be using a dimensional + Belinda/shem in endgame.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1500 crystals left after buying storms uniform. Was going to get Namors uniform since I missed it during my break but now we #8217;re getting hit with all these sneak peeks and the update is right around the corner. Since my stark stash just ended and because of losing my job due to the virus, I literally can #8217;t afford to renew the stark stash, (definitely not with a -$9 account balance) so all I #8217;ll be going on forward is the free crystals we get from check-ins and timeline. Would you get Namors uniform, or hold onto the 1500 crystals and wait for the update? Thanks in advance. I can #8217;t make up my mind.  #128077;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks bud. I #8217;m gunna take your advice and wait. It #8217;s a tough call considering there #8217;s a handful of meta uniforms that I missed cause I took a break starting around Christmas time. I had gotten Namor from the welcome back rewards and was going to work on him soon. (Just finished silver surfer and beta ray bill and am gunna finish Medusa today) guess I #8217;ll hold off and see what comes from the update. Thanks again bud. Hang in there. I think we #8217;re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just know that your not alone. A lot of us are really struggling and trying to make due with what we have.

    <TEXT>I #8217;m having a hard pin pointing exactly when I need to use my silence skill on this new frost beast. Today is speed hero so I #8217;m useing Hawkeye Ronin as a swap out silence guy. Do you do it as soon as he jumps to the middle? Do it when the notification pops up? When his health bar get the blue boarder? Does the time that silence (ex: silence(4)) is active have to be taken into account? Thanks in advance for any help.  #128077; Edit: nevermind, I #8217;ve figured it out. Incase anyone else was wondering, the game literally tells you when to press it. The skill that has silence on it starts pulsing with a purple glowing ring telling you it #8217;s time to use the silence skill.  #128077; Edit2: apparently it works when it wants to. The purple glows starts happening on the skill with silence, you tap it immediately, and it cancels the roar and the buff for the frost giant. Success! It worked! Then you get to the second stage of the roaring buff and you tap the skill when it starts pulsing purple. Only this time the frost beast freezes for a second and then does the roar. Not success. What #8217;d I do wrong you ask. Whelp, I can #8217;t answer that. Idk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I need some advice. I am inept at making decisions for myself. Due to the release of blade new uniform, there are a handful of other uniforms on sale currently. A few of them I have my eye on. Yet I can only purchase one. (I #8217;m a 5+ year veteran who previously collected every uniform and due to Covid I am out of work with a -19 dollar bank account, so I #8217;m currently 100% f2p which is why this decision is so hard for me to make) Namor Phoenix 5 - I have him at lv70 and can eventually tier-3 him. However I #8217;ve been reading that he is pretty useless without a ctp of rage, which I have yet to get one. And if I ever do get a ctp of rage, I don #8217;t know if I can justify giving it to him. (Honestly it #8217;ll probably sit in my inv. Cause I #8217;ll be too afraid to use it). He would be useful as a late stage SL clear, and a day of ABX. Red Skull secret empire - I am currently able to awaken him since that event were we could rank characters up for free. He would be a huge help for Squad Battle as I currently have no one in that Vibranium spot to get past even 500k, he #8217;d be another late stage Shadowland clear, AND possibly help me on a single ABX day(I think) and another late stage proxima clear(?). Ghost rider king or hell - this boi is similar to Red Skull in the sense that he would help me complete another Squad battle mission, help me on a single ABX day, late stage shadowland clear, and be another Ebony clear. Plus this uniform makes him SO bloody good at tier 3. A cheap their 3 to boot. Then there blade. Dunno if he #8217;s any good at all. Gunna watch Cynic #8217;s video. As a completionist and long time uniform collector it pins me to miss out on one, especially considering it takes an OG character who is unplayable and makes him decent. Lastly I could ignore all of these and wait for next update and try to not miss out on the next  #8220;ghost rider or Dormammu tier uniform #8221;. Holy shit that #8217;s a novel, Sorry. Thanks for any advice in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I appreciate the detailed response. It #8217;s exactly what I *needed* to hear. I #8217;m going to take the next few days of the sale and mule over your (and others) suggestion to wait for Black Friday. If it wasn #8217;t so close I wouldn #8217;t consider it, however it is right around the corner. My only reservation is my immense lack of trust for Netmarble. Since there is a monthly update inbetween now and BF I wouldn #8217;t put it past them to put only certain uniforms on 50% sale (if they do it at all). For instance, they come out with some awesome uniforms next update and then on Black Friday this current patch and the next patches uniforms are regular price. While I #8217;m thinking there is a small chance of them doing this, I **do** have faith in them fucking us in some other form. Again, I appreciate you taking the time to respond. Thank you. I #8217;ve been taking this game a little too seriously lately as it #8217;s one of the few respites I have from constantly filling out job applications.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dormammu #8217;s paralyze debuff in ABX</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 04:05:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been testing out Dormammu (a few mats shy of T3) on today #8217;s ABX in an attempt to utilize his paralyze debuff on his 3rd skill. I #8217;ve noticed that the paralyze debuff does not proc until the animations 2nd explosion (the explosion following the planets explosion). This debuff takes a full 6(!) seconds from the moment you press the skill icon to the moment the debuff procs. [The skill animation can be viewed here](https://imgur.com/a/YMTTx4n) Considering there is a very narrow window in which to successfully land this debuff, which lasts a total of 3 seconds, it is very difficult to use this debuff against the ABX frost beast during the month that it is weak to the paralyze effect. I have managed a few times, with some **very** precise timing, to disrupt the frost beasts roar. You need to use Dormammu #8217;s 3rd skill almost immediately after the frost beast lands in the center of the screen. And even then your not guaranteed to land the debuff. I hope this helps anyone who may have been confused thinking Dormammu #8217;s paralyze effect was not working. And if you have additional advice please leave it in the comments. Stay cheesy  #128536;</TEXT>
