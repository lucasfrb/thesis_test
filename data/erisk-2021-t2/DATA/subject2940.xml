    <TEXT>Exactly. I saw a clip of a man on a talk show who was the victim of domestic violence: he was locked into his apartment by his partner and forced to jump out of a three storey window, breaking both his legs. When he told his story, the crowd laughed. The talk-show host (I can't remember his name) hit the issue spot on and said: "The truth is, if there was a woman sitting here telling us this story, no one would be laughing." I can't imagine how humiliating it would've been for the guy to have been laughed at :/</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This post is totally unfair. As an Australian, I have had lots of exposure to Indigenous Australians. They have a huge number of issues just within their own people, let alone with what they have to face against white people. Leave this woman alone. Indigenous Australians are a minority group and the majority of the population has a very, VERY negative attitude towards them. Particularly for Indigenous Australians who are in the workforce and supporting themselves, they face a strong stigma from both other Indigenous people and White Australians. I love memes and tumblr in action, but this post completely takes her life out of context as well as the strong possibility that she may also have psychological issues. Please don't posts sensitive things like this, Aboriginal people receive enough social stigma without people taking the piss out of a woman not wanting to leave her home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no, that was deliberate. That's called 'accepting the possibility that others may have valid points' and accounting for that likelihood ahead of time, and, last time I checked, I don't need "an alt account" for that regardless. Not everyone is so egotistical and arrogant that we have to create another account to agree with ourselves. P.S If i did have an "alt account" and I wished to comment I think you can guarantee that I wouldn't virtually quote my own comment and put it in my new comment, that would be rather thick wouldn't it?</TEXT>

Argh, she's just cringe af. Seriously, Cho has no personality, she's one of the most 2D characters in both the book and the movie; although I do believe that JK Rowling didn't really try to characterise her fully anyway. Also (partially) the fact that he would choose Cho over all the other cool gals he knows and then after finally going out with her after what feels like an eternity of him getting butterflies in his stomach he FUCKS IT ALL UP. And then has the audacity to question Hermione about girls and STILL be confused. Are you serious Harry, you were a damn insensitive arse. its pretty obvious why your date turned to shit. 4. harry's inability to just lie about stuff like when he didn't just lie to Dobby about not going back to Hogwarts</TEXT>

    <TEXT>hey dude, in year 12 currently, studying architecture at USYD from next year :) Anyhow, I would advise that you use sketchup make/pro; the other programs that I know of for building are quite complex (eg Revit, Autocad). Sketchup on the other hand is much simpler, and all though it may LOOK shit when you create a building on the program you can use (free) programs like Visualiser to render the building. As for model materials, I personally feel you should use materials that best reflect the textures and the "weight" of the building, so give that some thought. If you can make more than one model, I don't see why you couldn't make one model for the Hanok and then do a cross section to show what's inside. I did something similar for my design portfolio project but unfortunately they didn't let us use models. Good luck with your project and with year 12!! Hope these suggestions help :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello, this sounds like my previous relationship! I went through something very similar actually: after my boyfriend cheated on me, I immediately suspected and accused him multiple times, to which he denied the validity of my thoughts and frequently intimated I was essentially an asshole for suggesting such a thing in the first place. First thing: When you accuse someone of something you know they have done and they try to deny the validity of your thoughts by implying you're crazy, touched in the head and so on, that is called gaslighting. And it is considered a form of abuse. Like you, I also took my partner back. Bad move. He treated me badly, albeit in subtler ways the second time around, again similar to your partner. Anyhow, there is plenty you can take from this. Firstly, you were abused, make no mistake, and I recommend that you find an outlet for expressing your emotions, be that sport, talking to friends/family, a hobby, or therapy. For me, the pain is still fresh from the relationship but if you actively work everyday to make yourself feel better, you WILL make progress. Don't let a destructive person ruin your relationship AND your mental health, too. Secondly, the answer to your question is no. Does it happen a lot? Yes. The honest truth is, dating for young people such as you and I is incredibly fickle. People are assholes at our age, and unfortunately cheating behaviour as a young adult tends to persist as one gets older, too. But, there is hope. Next time you find someone who takes your fancy, don't rush into things. Really take your time to get to know them (and them you), and make sure you know what you're getting into. Even then, don't be too trusting. Don't automatically assume the best of someone, especially in the honeymoon phase. And more importantly, don't give people a second chance. Regardless of what people say, cheating is never excusable, and anyone who does it once while do it again. Stay wary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow, I can not even begin to thank you enough for this comment! Thank you for taking all this time to reply, it's very in-depth and helpful. Thank you for also telling me im not over reacting to the events, that in particular means a lot. Your comment about his lack of empathy and compassion was particularly strong for me, because I remember now what he said to me when I questioned him about re-downloading the dating apps: "I considered your needs, I just decided mine were greater". Dick. He also never really said sorry about anything except the cheating, it was always "im sorry you feel that way", not "im sorry I hurt you", or "Im sorry I've made you feel that way". Thank you for explaining the whole lovebombing cycle to me; I have never heard of that before (so I can say i've learnt something today). I also think you would be right about the narcissist thing, especially as I used to type in the way he acted with me and compare them to similarities in the way narcissists/psychopaths etc act, although I always denied fully associating any of those traits with him... Again, thank you. I will be taking all the advice on board and I really appreciate all the time you spent writing this response.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the advice! You #8217;re very much right about the fact that I #8217;m emotionally maturing; I have definitely learnt a lot about myself and the world since coming out last year. That being said, this issue is not just a personal one, it #8217;s also a deep sorrow for the poisonous and toxic culture that we have allowed to perpetuate in the gay community. We are a people who have been marginalised for such a long time, and to see how the gay community puts people into boxes and shamed them is devastating; people have died for being homosexual and people have died to advance our cause. It is atrocious that we throw that away by being toxic and nasty to each other. I see this particularly from my viewpoint as a brown person who is gay in a white society. The honest truth is, I like the way I look, but the way brown men look just tends to be different to the way white men look, so I was never even in the running for meeting society #8217;s expectations for how I should look (because it #8217;s a white persons game). What I don #8217;t appreciate is how this ties in to being seen as lesser in the gay world, it #8217;s proof that racism is still very much alive when someone like me, with my darkish-olive complexion, short stature and relatively slim body is automatically placed into a lesser category. These are things people need to be made aware; gay people already have a much higher suicide rate when compared to Hetero population, so let #8217;s not put up more divisions to eliminate any possibility of a welcoming and inclusive community. Anyway, enough rambling from me. Thank you very much for your response, I really appreciate the time you put into it. Bless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m the same age as you with the same opinion! Love this. Realistically, the gay community is like every other community in the world: there are a lot of sheep and a lot of followers and these represent a large portion of the people in that community. I always like to allude to a bell curve when thinking about it: the values closer to the average have the highest frequency. Because the gay world is hyper sexualised by both gay people as well as by straight people, the  #8220;average #8221; tends to reflect that. However, as is with the bell curve, there are still plenty of people who deviate from the overly sexual mindset. I myself am one of them. I have gay friends who are similar to me and I have gay friends who are very sexual and more the  #8220;typical #8221; gay. It #8217;s just how it is. But do keep looking. As a fellow 19 year old male I think we can both agree that we #8217;re at an age where we #8217;re still learning a lot about the world and I think this is just another situation where we will find what we are looking for in time and with patience.

In Australia, in your intern year you generally get paid $65000 a year (roughly), which is just over 50k USD and usually work between 48-55 hours a week. Only a very small percentage of interns regularly work more than 60 hours a week. I can #8217;t believe how little US residents are paid to work, what, 80-90 hours a week on average?

    <TEXT>Somewhat. Sydney is the second most expensive city in the world (I think behind Hong Kong) and it #8217;s very sprawled so you generally have to commute to where ever you #8217;re working, which certainly adds costs. In addition (not sure if it #8217;s the same in the US), interns do hospital rotations so they don #8217;t spend all their time in one hospital which would certainly complicate commuting. On the other hand, our student debt is minimal compared to US graduates and it doesn #8217;t accrue interest. So I do think we have it better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am from Perth, which is where the Nobel prize winning Barry Marshall lives. He has developed a new technique that allows you to diagnose IBS through gut sounds, which require (I think from memory) an overnight sleep study. Research is still ongoing but it looks very promising right now and he is doing more trials with humans currently. Obviously, the  #8220;listening #8221; procedure is minimally invasive compared to traditional techniques used to diagnose IBS. In addition, it would allow much faster diagnosis of the disease as the simple overnight study is enough to determine the health of the gut. Very exciting!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t understand the American health care system. For those of you who are in North America, I don #8217;t think you guys realise how different the healthcare field is there to much of the outside world. The first thing I notice is there are a whole slew of jobs in the US that I have never heard of, and in each  #8220;traditional #8221; occupation there seems to be a lot of  #8220;stratification #8221; of professionals (an example being having Paramedics, but then EMTs with a smaller scope of practice and less training). I find it odd, to perfectly honest. I don #8217;t think prescribing independently and practising independently and doing god knows what else independently should be a valid option for most professions. After all, all healthcare degrees are hard, but I think we can all be honest and admit the MD is the hardest; realistically, I don #8217;t think every profession should have some sort of  #8220;prescribing #8221; option or some  #8220;ability to treat independently #8221; option. Doctors go to medical school for that reason, and I feel that allowing each profession to encroach on the physicians scope of practice will only encourage division amongst health care practitioners. Furthermore, I thought in the 21st century we were supposed to be moving into a healthcare model that advocates  #8220;a collaborative health care team centred on the patient #8221;? My take is that means that there is greater recognition in the 21st century of the important roles each type of health care practitioner plays in patient management, and implies that each practitioner has something unique to offer. I don #8217;t see that with advocating for an increased scope of practice in every profession. With the exception of pharmacist prescribing, I feel that the current trend I see in the US is all the professions moving towards having a doctor-like scope of practice. Why cant we just acknowledge that certain professionals have a different scope of practice? I feel that the constant expansion of scope of practice completely forgoes the fact that each professional has something unique and distinct to offer in practice, such as pharmacists being medication management and nurses being ongoing care. Here is my message from a country with a totally different system: everyone in healthcare has something valuable and distinct to contribute to patient management. You don #8217;t need to become a doctor or a prescriber to be worthwhile to the wider healthcare system.</TEXT>

The truth is,people with gay parents are an extremely small minority, so it is unsurprising that the kids of gay parents would feel a lot of pressure to be perfect. It's one of those things that people seem to be ok with on the surface but they really aren't. I live in Australia which is one of the worlds most developed countries yet in my state me and my (gay) partner couldn't adopt a child unless a social worker went back to the parents who gave the child up for adoption and got their permission. This only applies to gay people, and not any other minority. While this may be the case in San Francisco, you notice that there is not a great amount of emphasis placed on setting in the show; it could be anywhere, especially to an outsider from America. As a result, you can imagine that the show is written to resonate with the widest audience as possible, and not just those who have grown up in liberal San Francisco. Statistically, San Francisco would represent the extreme end of the bell curve for liberal values and LGBT rights in the world; the vast majority of people who watch the show will not be from there and as a result, they are more likely to have had experiences that may see synchrony with Courtney's feelings. I don't think Courtney is a bad person. She has done horrible things, yes. But ultimately, she is a young woman who belongs to several minorities who just wants to fit in and blend. Not an uncommon theme amongst teenagers and a theme that is certainly very prevalent in 13 Reasons Why. When I came out, I had so much extra pressure put on me due to the fact I already had a gay brother. I had to worry about how people would perceive us and I felt constantly anxious about appearing like a dysfunctional family. So I invested everything into being as perfect as I could be: I was like Courtney in the sense that I was popular, academically smart and participated in lots of activities. Whether those pressures are real or not is irrelevant, because you don't want to be the one that causes pain to the rest of your family, so you preempt it and try to protect yourself. I don't think Courtney's experience should be underestimated, I feel that she has more than enough to deal with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I hardly agree. It's not "because they are women", it's because medical literature and clinical practice has not researched enough into the possibilities of behavioural/psychiatric changes due to female reproductive hormones. Women are generally treated much more seriously by healthcare professionals, tend to have better outcomes, and grow up in an environment that gives them the freedom to express any concerns with their health. Please do not imply its a "women's thing"; as a male with former mental health issues and a current healthcare student mid-way through my degree I can not begin to tell you how much it frustrates me that men do not have the same things as I listed above, not to mention that diseases that predominantly affect women tend to have much more research funding and consequently much better outcomes for their sufferers. I understand that it's difficult for women with their menstruation, hormones, birth control etc., but please don't automatically cry sexism in health care. The reality is just that women have extra layers of complications in their body due to their ability to bear children which is compounded by the inherent complexity of the human body, man or woman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly I agree with this. I dated someone who I suspect was a sociopath and I was nearly driven to the edge of suicide. He/she will play games and will make everything about them. I understand this is a sociopath reddit and "sociopaths have feelings", but realistically, does that mean she has to tip toe around him because of it? My ex certainly didn't tip toe around me, except when he was out fucking other people. If he isn't going to make an effort to make you happy, you don't need to do the same; it goes both ways and regardless of what people on this sub say I think most people would agree. If you think its because he "wants something"- trust yourself. Most people's instincts are strong enough to be able to recognise that type of nuance in a person and you should run with it because you're probably right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm feeling upset about the start of this episode. 13 Reasons Why is a great show and it does a great job of promoting awareness of mental health issues, but Jessica's spiel at the beginning has rubbed me the wrong way. I strongly disapprove of the way jessica says "boys get to choose their own identity". We are in an age where we are supposed to be enlightened about the realities of the world, yet here they go with Jessica stipulating that boys have it easy and girls have it hard. The world is never black and white, there is no "easy". The idea that boys get to choose their identity is false. The idea we aren't judged on our looks is false. From the age of 11, I have had my looks picked apart by both males and females, and I known more than anecdotally that this is true for many other males. Males are under so much pressure to be the "alpha male", and when you fail in any one aspect, such as being too short, or too fat, or too weak, or having too small a penis, you are picked apart, and you become a nothing, a laughing stock. I have often said that I feel lucky to be gay. In the gay world, I can be who I want to be and I have the genuine ability to express myself. Straight men on the other hand are forced to adhere to codes and conventions, and they are extremely rigid and specific. And harsh. And ultimately unattainable. This is a show that has influence. It is irresponsible of the producers to allow things like this to be said. This spiel of Jessica's ignores the slew of issues that men face, and I am inclined to believe that younger, more impressionable viewers might come under the impression that men "have it easy". We do not have it easy. Why can't the media ever reflect that both men and women have problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s a good point actually. However, the show shouldn #8217;t be so flippant about having characters say things that minimise the difficulty of being a male. I #8217;m a staunch feminist, so I love that the culture of  #8220;slut shaming #8221; and other predominantly-women associated issues are being explored in the show. However, the problem with subtle discussion of male issues is that it relegates the issue itself to the periphery of our awareness; something that #8217;s there, but not something that #8217;s threatening, or important, or anything. Like I #8217;ve said, I #8217;m gay, so in many respects I #8217;m like the bridge between women #8217;s issues and men #8217;s issues. My feminist beliefs are shaped by the knowledge that gay people (particularly men) have been discriminated against because we seem  #8220;like women #8221; compared to the straight population. On the other hand, I am still male, and so I have also experienced the crushing pressure that comes alongside that. Having to be tall, athletic, sporty. Having to be financially successful and competitive and strong all the time. The only character in the show that really shows the difficulties of not fitting in to the  #8220;perfect boys club #8221; is Tyler, who is repeatedly bullied and ostracised. My overarching issue with this is that male issues are never represented in media and film, despite them being just as present in the western world. It #8217;s not good enough to always be on the periphery anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that the show does make men look bad, but Sheri #8217;s comment is so, so true about the reality of things. No one expects to get raped by a schoolmate; that #8217;s why the character of Bryce is so shocking. He #8217;s not some street thug who lurks in dark alleyways. He #8217;s an upper-class, white jock who seems personable enough. No one would expect him to be a rapist, and that #8217;s a big point that the show makes. I really love Sheri, and I could honestly have punched clay for saying something so dumb. Blaming a woman for getting raped is like blaming anyone for having their trust abused or their safety violated. You wouldn #8217;t do it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's also because people are used to the image of women being "penetrated". People generally don't think of men being "penetrated" sexually so it seems more alien and foreign to people. On the other hand, anal rape is more likely to be of serious concern than vaginal rape. Obviously, women can get raped anally as well, but the ass is not very well suited to penetration. It is not as well lubricated as the vagina and not nearly as stretchy. For this reason, anal rape is generally more severe (with regard to physical health consequences), particularly with straight men who have (probably) not been penetrated anally before. As a gay person, it was incredibly painful for me to be penetrated by a partner after stretching for months, so I can't imagine what it would be like to be raped without ever having receiving something in that end. Source: I study and work in healthcare. Additionally, am gay, Additionally, a friend's brother was raped in the past and he suffered from a bowel perforation and nearly died.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Male rape is very under reported unfortunately. Every now and then, there will be a big blow up in the media, and you #8217;ll realise just how under reported. For example, in Australia, huge amounts of victims spoke out about being sexually abused by catholic priests. 90% of the victims of the priests were boys. It happened at school too; I heard a story about it when I was in year 9, and then after I left someone was gang raped (in a manner similar to Tyler) and suffered serious injuries. I went to a prestigious school, and yet I know of at least 2 stories of serious male rape within five or six years. And those are only ones I heard about, who knows how much worse the problem is? The same deal happened with indigenous Australian boys who went to a special school in the 1950s-1970s, there was serious rape going on there too, and most of the victims were boys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, like I said before, the anus isn #8217;t nearly as suitable for penetration compared to the vagina. This makes it very susceptible to traumatic injury because the tissue in the anus and colon is not as strong as vagina tissue (nor as well lubricated). If perforation occurs in the anus or colon/rectum, aside from the painful aspects of the condition, you are very vulnerable to infection (mainly bacterial), because the anus doesn #8217;t really have any specific defence mechanisms to inhibit bacteria going IN. So obviously, if bacteria migrate to the tear and enter the blood, then the infection can very quickly become systemic and you may go into sepsis and die.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can I just say though that I feel Skye #8217;s diagnosis of bipolar is classic tv psychiatry? Her symptoms fit borderline personality disorder much better than bipolar, particularly with the consistent self harm, the feelings of  #8220;not knowing who I am #8221; and her rapidly changing emotions. Even though people use the term  #8220;bipolar #8221; to mean someone who fluctuates wildly between two different emotional states in everyday language, actual bipolar disorder diagnosis requires each episode of depression and mania to be at least a week long (per episode).

    <TEXT>If you #8217;ve only just started high school, I would recommend waiting a little longer before coming out. Regardless of what people say, kids are cruel and they can make life hard for you at that age. For now, just focus on enjoying your life, finding yourself, and your studies; there is plenty of time to be gay once you #8217;re a bit older (16/17+). I know it #8217;s hard, but we #8217;ve all been there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very well written- although again I think that the level of sexual freedom for gay men is overemphasised. I generally find that the most  #8220;out #8221; gay men are the ones who are sexually free, those of us who are from conservative families much less so. You #8217;re also underestimating the impact of social constructs of sexuality in gay culture, particularly the dichotomy of  #8220;top #8221; and  #8220;bottom #8221;. The idea of gay society being divided on the lines of  #8220;tops #8221; and  #8220;bottoms #8221; is probably one of the worst things about gay society in my opinion (as a gay person), particularly because being a bottom (or being assumed a bottom by others) often carries with it condescension and being treated degradingly, which is also depressingly anti-feminist. So yes, some men in the gay community might be very sexually free, but a lot of these men are more akin to the  #8220;privileged #8221; or top of the hierarchy gays. People like me, who are short and skinny are almost always relegated automatically to the role of bottom, and most men are unwilling to bottom for us because we #8217;re seen as lesser. It #8217;s very painful, let me tell you- I was in an abusive relationship previously where I was always expected to bottom and it was seen as something degrading. Even now, I can #8217;t have sex with my lovely boyfriend because I #8217;ve become so use to the notion that bottoming is degrading that I don #8217;t receive any pleasure from sex at all anymore. While my case is a little more extreme because of the past abuse I suffered, this, I gather, is not actually too uncommon a situation for gay men to experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It is discrimination. 25% of HIV cases are transmitted to and between straight people, yet there aren #8217;t any restrictions on them from having sexual activity for over a year. What stinks about this is that two gay people could be in a monogamous relationship long term eachother but that a straight person could theoretically do none of these things and still get a pass. It #8217;s disappointing, because it perpetuates the message that gay people literally have  #8220;tainted blood #8221;. Additionally, the  #8220;abstain from sex #8221; thing isn #8217;t just from anal sex, it includes oral sex as well, which is statistically very unlikely to transmit HIV to anyone. It #8217;s discrimination presented under a very careful film of being health precautionary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thankyou! I am in a committed and monogamous relationship (and am gay), and I hate how we are painted with a tainted brush. What disgusts me is the fact that 20-25% of HIV cases affect straight people; this is a large minority of people for blood banks to ignore. Obviously they ignore because they need blood and straight people are the majority but it is still disgusting; the idea we have tainted blood is archaic and proves that our relationships still aren #8217;t considered equal to straight relationships.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would hardly call it a vast majority, if you randomly took a group of four people with HIV then three people would probably be gay and one would be straight. That #8217;s not exactly a huge margin. Ultimately, I don #8217;t mind there being stringent guidelines for this sort of thing, but they shouldn #8217;t just apply to gay people on the basis that they are statistically more likely to contract HIV, when a fairly large proportion of cases are contracted by straight people. Not to mention the fact that things like even oral sex between men counts as  #8220;sex within the past 12 months #8221;- websites specifically dedicated to HIV say that the chances of transmitting HIV via oral sex are extremely small. Why should this (comparatively much smaller) chance not be taken when straight people have less stringent blood donation guidelines when they make up 1/4 of all HIV cases?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m not usually one to cry discrimination because I #8217;m a very scientific person - I #8217;m actually just finishing up a degree in medical science this year. My issue with blood donations isn #8217;t the fact that homosexuals have such stringent guidelines placed on them- this is important to maintain quality of blood. However, around 15-28% of all HIV cases are transmitted between straight people (depends on how the research was undertaken, and when, what statistical analysis was applied etc). While yes, this is a minority in lay people #8217;s terms, this is a large number of people in medical terms. I just feel that straight people should have stricter guidelines. The idea that gay people can #8217;t engage in oral sex then donate blood when a large body of research shows that the chances of contracting HIV from oral sex is minimal when straight people make up to ~25% of all HIV cases is where the discrimination lies. Ultimately the blood donation issue isn #8217;t active discrimination. It #8217;s passive discrimination; the Red Cross have taken appropriate risk for gay people but not necessarily applied it elsewhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Given that I #8217;m just finishing up a medical science degree which includes extensive training in epidemiology and biostatistics, I #8217;m going to venture in and say, yes, I do understand math. If you would have read the comment, you would #8217;ve noted that I #8217;m fine with their being stringent guidelines for gay people because yes, the do make up the majority of people affected by HIV. However, the fact that a greater proportion of gays compared to straight people are affected by HIV is not important compared to the actual number of people afflicted (the incidence OR the prevalence depending on what exactly you #8217;re studying). In infectious diseases, 25% of people with HIV not being screened as thoroughly for the disease as the other 75% is a BIG margin. The Red Cross don #8217;t do this because they hate gay people, they do it because obviously they need at least some levels of blood in the blood bank. Again though, if you #8217;d read my comment you would have noted that my biggest problem with this is that straight people aren #8217;t tested rigorously ENOUGH, and also that a gay person engaging in monogamous oral sex (which has an extremely minimal chance of transmitting HIV) is barred from donating blood when a straight person could be promiscuous, have anal sex but then still donate blood. Ultimately, this is an unfortunate consequence of the HIV/AIDS crisis, and many people are still convinced that all gay people are promiscuous and unsafe in their sexual practices. There are other countries that have lower deferral periods for gay people regards blood donation, Japan for example has a 6 month deferral while the UK has 3 months. We #8217;re not asking to be able to walk in, sit down in a chair and donate blood, but we #8217;re asking to be able to donate blood without having to make unreasonable personal lifestyle choices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s not necessarily that they believe that our blood is tainted, but it #8217;s more the social message it sends. It perpetuates the idea that all gay men are inherently promiscuous and unsafe in their sexual practices; this is a reputation we don #8217;t deserve and is hurtful to many of us who have been in stable and long term committed relationships (I am one of these people). There are many countries with a smaller deferral period and there are countries that don #8217;t discriminate between your sex life regardless of whether you #8217;ve had sex with a man or a woman, they just look at whether you #8217;ve been safe and that #8217;s the main thing. I #8217;m not wanting the ability to walk in to a clinic, sign a paper and give blood on the spot, but what I am looking for is the ability to give blood without making unreasonable expectations on me (and my partner). 3 months deferral (like in the UK) I #8217;d be happy to do, even. If they aren #8217;t going to make testing of straight people more stringent, then the only way to please us gay people is to slightly relax the (to be fair, very strict) rules on blood donation. On the other hand, I #8217;m not a healthcare policy maker, nor do I intend to be, so I leave the exact ifs and buts to people who are more legally minded than I. I just want to treat people in peace. :P</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, which was a shame, and a missed opportunity. Unfortunately Australia is a powerhouse for medical research but tends to take a while to actually be progressive in their clinical practice. One of my favourite examples is that in many countries pharmacists prescribe or change dosing of medicines independently of doctors and this has been repeatedly shown to reduce adverse effects associated with drugs, yet we aren #8217;t even close to getting that sort of legislation approved here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand that, but surely you see that that #8217;s the problem? All gay people are grouped into that- why do we deserve to be put on the blood donation back burner with those who are literal prostitutes if we are in monogamous relationships of safe sexual practice? Why can a straight person be relatively promiscuous yet gay people are unable to donate regardless? I don #8217;t mind restrictive legislation but it needs to be leveled out to reflect that a straight person having sex with many people is more likely to have HIV than a gay person who is in a long term monogamous relationship. THATS what really stinks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair though, coming from an Australian outsider point of view, being judged by extracurriculars does seem like a very flawed system. Some people need to devote all their time to study to be kickass at it, and others might not be able to participate in very many extracurriculars because they have a poor family and need to work. The whole point of extracurriculars is that they are extra to the curriculum, and I hardly like the idea of people doing all these extracurriculars just because they need it to go to a competitive college. On a side note, I do think kids need an opportunity to be kids. I went to a school that forced us into a lot of extracurricular stuff and, yes, even thought it does help make you well rounded, I regret doing them now. Why? Because I never ever had a seconds peace. I don #8217;t have holidays because I live on a farm, and then I never had any R and R while I was at school either - it was always go go go. I #8217;d go to choir, or community service, or hockey, or swing band, or SOMETHING and all my friends would be going out and socialising together while I was toiling away in some lame extracurricular that I rarely enjoyed. I did extracurriculars because I #8217;ve lived to a expectation of perfection most of my life, and because people told me it would look good on my resume. It doesn #8217;t. If I had my time again, I would #8217;ve done less extracurriculars and tried to actually experience and enjoy being a teen, rather than being Uber competitive 24/7.</TEXT>

Is that because we ingrain our societal expectations into young boys that masculine=good, feminine=bad, or is it because they genuinely just want to be masculine? Who knows?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In some sense that #8217;s true, but keep in mind that masculinity in animals generally refers to a discrete set of behaviours (e.g protecting the young, attracting the female). In humans, masculinity is an (increasingly difficult to navigate) spectrum and is not discrete - many of our physical objects are  #8220;codes #8221; of symbolic meaning. A male animal would not feel opposed to wearing a dress because wearing a dress is not inherently anything. But in human culture, we have coded wearing a dress as something feminine, so therefore men will generally avoid wearing dresses. A big part of this is a problem because it creates a very large social pressure for men to fit into a tight box of behaviours and attitudes lest they be labelled feminine. Human life is far too complicated for us to still be organising people into narrow categories.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're misinterpreting what I've said. I call myself a feminist. That means I align myself with the ideology of feminism. However, someone else comes in and smears the name of feminism by using the term inappropriately to excuse her bad behaviour. This is ridiculed by many and causes people to have an interpretation of feminism that does not align with the actual ideology OF feminism and instead believe it means being a nasty bitch. Therefore, when continued media gives feminism a bad name (as it has lately), I shy away from the specific designation of being a "feminist" as it immediately draws a negative (and incorrect) interpretation of what that means. This says nothing about whether or not I continue to espouse the ideology of feminism itself. Feminism is just a word when it comes down to it, and it's a word that today has negative connotations that is at odds with its actual purpose. On another note, Serena didn't scare me out of my principled position. I'm not in support of Serena, I'm extremely angry at her for being a bitch and playing the "I'm a woman and black" card. You're going to find it very hard to prove scientifically that the judge was specifically discriminating against Serena because she's a black woman, and you're going to find it even harder to prove that this is a common occurrence in sport for other women. So if you can't prove anything? Take it on the chin and roll with the punches. She's worth like $65 million dollars and needs to get over it. She was acting badly and is accusing someone of being something that is incredibly difficult to prove.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No? My point is I don #8217;t understand why people bother posting things like this that happen in the balkans in this subreddit. All it does is ignite angry people. that #8217;s not something I think we should encourage. Look at half the comments on this post, and on other posts about the balkans. There are constant arguments about Kosovo, and ethnic heritage, and  #8220;who did what #8221; during the war, and  #8220;who was most affected #8221; by the war, and not just the recent war, wars going back to the 16th century. People from the balkans, and the balkans itself are very precarious because the things that keep it relatively peaceful today are very, very fragile. If I didn #8217;t know better, I would almost be inclined to say it #8217;s trolling because it #8217;s entertaining to see the arguments unfold. I know that #8217;s not the intention, but I know that the moment I see something about the balkans on this subreddit, there will be bitter fighting and nationalism in the comments. I #8217;m from the Balkans, so I #8217;m used to people being this way, but I hate that people who aren #8217;t from there will end up having that same association as I do. On a related note, I #8217;m not sure why I #8217;m being downvoted? I don #8217;t think wishing for a peaceful subreddit is a bad thing. Sometimes it #8217;s nice to come onto a subreddit and just look at pretty pictures of countries, rather than always having things that happened years ago thrusted into our faces and reminding us of the realities of the smouldering wound.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>On Lachlan Watson (Suzie)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-31 12:43:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a wee bit confused. I'm gay but I'm not really overtly familiar with non-binary people, though my understanding is that in his case it refers to someone who is essentially gender non-conformist and doesn't neatly fit into male or female gender wise. However, I am a little confused by his character in the show. For one thing, (I'm assuming he was born a male), his voice will eventually break and he will develop a skeletal structure that resembles that of a male. Currently he can pass as a woman quite easily but as he is 17 I doubt that that will last. But his character on the show is obviously a woman; so how does that even work? Are they going to have to kill him off as a character once he develops a conspicuously male physique? They can't have "actually, Suzie is male!" as a plot device because it wouldn't make sense in regards to anything in the entire show. OR am I just completely on the wrong track, and Lachlan was assigned a female at birth but identifies as a male? Or is Lachlan in actuality intersex? I'm just confused and wondering how this will tie in with Suzie as a character, because it would obviously be a very weird plot device for Suzie to turn out to be male in the next season. I have no problem with how Lachlan identifies obviously, I'm just seeking a little clarification on how he identifies and how that relates to the biological aspect of his identity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the explanation! I also did a little bit of digging and found out that the real life Lachlan is biologically a woman but has had top surgery to reduce the emergence of breasts. He identifies closer to a masculine identity and thought he was a trans man growing up but as he got older he discovered the non-binary paradigm fit him much better. I #8217;m really glad that he (and your friend) are being true to themselves in a world that often demonises people for being just that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe; apparently before Lachlan was cast the character of Susie was intended to come out as trans. I #8217;m not sure if that will happen any more though as Lachlan seems to think he #8217;s changed the producers idea for the character. I also did some research and found out that he is biologically speaking a woman, but has had too surgery to reduce the emergence of breasts, so growing an Adam #8217;s apple and developing a male physique for the character shouldn #8217;t be a problem. :) EDIT: top surgery</TEXT>

After all, the producers have someone who is legitimately non-binary in their cast who I think is attracting them lots of positive attention. I actually sort of like the idea that Suzie #8217;s gender and/or sexual identity is never explored: it would provide a refreshing perspective for an openly LGBT or non-binary character to not have an overarching plot line that focuses on that aspect of their identity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed! It #8217;s sad that we put men into these minuscule boxes of how they can and can #8217;t act. It #8217;s so pervasive that most men are hardly aware of it- yet you see them all the time defending themselves the second they do something  #8220;unmanly #8221;, or they try to hide it. I feel pretty lucky to be gay because it means I #8217;ve never had a choice to be a part of that paradigm in the first place. I like sport, but guess what, I also like art, and the performing arts, and pretty plants. Not ashamed of it at all! Why would I be? Those are all equally valid and interesting things. If someone says any of those things are feminine- great! Feminine isn #8217;t a bad word, so I #8217;m not afraid of being labelled that way if people are inclined to do so. Irl, most men don #8217;t feel that way though and will do anything to avoid being compared to a woman (oh, the horror)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No problem! I appreciate that you #8217;re at least aware of these ridiculous expectations. I will say though that I #8217;m a gay man who grew up on a farm, so I could certainly say I could deal with hard labour. On another note, being gay doesn #8217;t actually have really anything to do with testosterone. Testosterone as a circulating hormone is pretty important to a mans health - gay men aren #8217;t just these walking hormone deficient people, otherwise they #8217;d all be sick. Testosterone isn #8217;t really a behavioural hormone as much as it is a regulator of sex drive, it #8217;s main impact on behaviour is aggressiveness. The primary biological difference between gay men and straight men (and this does not always occur, some may have this and others don #8217;t) tend to be differences in brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, this person does make some good points. It seems like Americans really like putting people #8217;s ethnicities into a colour box. I don #8217;t agree that coming from Europe automatically makes you white, because really, what the fuck even is white anyway? People often associate whiteness with fair skin, but also wealthy, coloniser societies and Christianity. My family are Bosnian. Bosnia is Muslim, poor and my skin is brown. I don #8217;t feel white, yet Bosnia is in Europe. Similarly, I #8217;m friends with many Iranian people who are white-skinned, yet they don #8217;t feel any less brown. But this isn #8217;t something we usually have to consider in our home countries in the same perspectives as America views us. We know that skin colour is diverse and that cultures are also diverse, so really, what #8217;s the point of designating people as white, brown, black and yellow? Who gets to be the gatekeeper for these things? Something I #8217;ve found very hard to cope with in life is dealing with people arguing with me about my right to call myself white or brown, as though my designation in society is entirely up to everyone else (which is obviously made 100% more confusing by the fact that everyone says something different lel) and that it #8217;s actually important in the first place. I refuse to answer colour questions when people ask me these days because I #8217;m tired of acting like I belong to some mythical racial meta group when I could really just tell people exactly where I #8217;m from in the first place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But that doesn #8217;t explain how people sort certain nations into those groups in the first place. Going back to my previous example, If I were to rob someone, I would probably be described as a brown man of short stature and thin build. But then, in another situation, if I were to meet someone, tell them I #8217;m Bosnian, and refer to myself as a brown man, they would act like I #8217;ve just said something crazy. Sure, describing people by their skin colour could help police in a crime scene, but how does society grouping people #8217;s colour based on their country or continent of origin (e.g Europe, Asia) help anyone when every population is diverse in appearance anyway? Either way, you notice that #8217;s not something that #8217;s done in many other parts of the world. Yes if you are robbed you would describe the appearance of the person, but in every day life you wouldn #8217;t have people debating which category you belong to and being like  #8220;well hmmm, your skin is brown and you #8217;re from a Muslim country, but also the country is in Europe so hmmm I #8217;m not too sure where to place you #8221; and so on. Like, it #8217;s just so stupid! Something I #8217;ve noticed is that when America collects statistics about its cities and towns, they tend to have statistics like  #8220;X town is 75% White, 7% Asian, 9% Black and 9% Hispanic #8221;. Honestly, I think that #8217;s barbaric. In Australia for example, when statistics about the various ethnic groups are collected, the government bases their statistics on country of birth, how you see yourself and what languages are spoken at home. So a given suburb might have  #8220;10% people born in the Phillipines #8221; or  #8220;29% of the population speak a language other than English at home #8221;. I much much prefer that than belonging to some weird skin colour but also pseudo-ethnoreligiogeographical category that #8217;s not only arbitrary but doesn #8217;t actually seem to be well defined itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats so ridiculous. In Europe, people don #8217;t define the natives of a nation by their skin colour, they just see them as a European person with brown or white or black skin. It #8217;s not actually like you #8217;re a different race. European American is totally valid because it is far more accurate than  #8220;white American #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Why refer to that at all? I think it's pretty obvious that that was a hypothetical statement, hence why I said "if I were to". When talking to people, ethnicity, race and nationality do have a tendency to come up a lot, especially if you are a person of ambiguous racial appearance.  gt;You seem to imply people do this in anything other than specific settings Well I can't account for your experience, but I know that for me people have constantly questioned it. I also know that that is the experience for many other people of ambiguous racial appearance.  gt;How are statistics barbaric? I never once said statistics were barbaric. I love statistics. I was criticising how Americans collect and utilise their statistics, which is more an issue with data collection and sample design than the actual concept of utilising statistics to understand people better.  gt; a sociopath that's a bit to obsessed with skin colour You're literally pulling random words out of your hat now. Sociopathy is defined as a "mental condition in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong and ignores the feelings and rights of others". Your argument that I'm being too emotional about this issue would therefore indicate that I'm the exact opposite of a sociopath. I don't appreciate you using such strong and unkind words for a simple discussion, especially when my supposed "obsession" with skin colour is more to do with the fact that, for my whole life, people have been obsessed with my skin colour and what it represents me as. That's not something I enjoy (clearly, otherwise why would I be writing this) and for that reason I am sharing my experience of race that I know many other people have also experienced. You also act as though I'm against all designations of colour. Advertising to black people because they have physiologically different types of hair expression isn't racist in any form, nor is advertising tanning cream to people of white skin colour. But that's part of my point precisely: you don't see tanning creams being advertised to *Europeans*, you see them being advertised to people of *fair skin*. After all, not all Europeans have fair skin, and many other people of other continents also have fair skin. So that brings me back to my original point of how in hells name do we think its ok to define an entire race by whether they're from Africa, Europe or Asia or America? The diversity in the human race is large between different countries but also within populations. I'm brown coloured and most of my family is brown coloured, but I also have blood relatives who are blonde and blue-eyed, yet they are still pure Bosnian. In the categories of race constructed by society, does that make them any less brown or more white than I am? After all, they still experience the exact same culture as I do. Yet in Europe, we don't assess things that way. That woman is a Bosnian who is blonde haired and blue eyed. That man is a Bosnian who is brown skinned and dark haired. There's no question of *wow!!!1 Are they brown or white aha I wonder how they identify themselves lol I guess they must be white as they're Europeans but also that dude is pretty dark lol!* We just *are as we are*. The use of categories like white and brown is totally arbitrary to anything because most ethnicities exhibit a diversity of skin colour within their own populations and it implies that cultures, populations, nationalities and ethnicities are far more homogenous than they actually are.  gt;It's more pc, but it's not a more functional model Which is literally an assumption you've just made off of nothing. You act like your system is far above the European and Australian system, yet you fail to look at the fact that it's a system that works well for nearly 800 million people. Besides, you talk about people being a melting pot, which is exactly why using designations such as "brown", "white" or "black" **is** barbaric. After all, if people are coming from such a diverse set of cultures, what becomes the dividing line between white, brown and black? Who gets to decide who's who? Are two brothers of African and European descent automatically white because they have European blood? Are they automatically black because they have African blood? Is one **more** black or white than the other because they have a different coloured skin tone? It becomes very murky waters when you start applying these strange "rules" to what a race is.  gt;What kind of sick person are you? I'm just as sick as every other person. I'm equally as sick as every fair-skinned person who told me I wasn't allowed to identify as white because I have brown skin. I'm equally as sick as every brown-skinned person who told me I'm not allowed to identify as brown because I'm from Europe. I'm equally sick as the many people who have met me and said "are you brown or white?". I'm equally as sick as the people who seek to debate with me about who I am, and what category I truly belong to. EDIT: And to add to my previous comment: all you #8217;ve done is just confirm what I #8217;m saying. You say that many Americans are highly mixed and therefore it would be too difficult or impossible to identify as  #8220;Bosnian French Italian Irish Arab American #8221;. And that is exactly why the categories of white, brown and black are ridiculous. If someone of that ancestry has brown skin, then they should be allowed to refer themselves as a brown person, where  #8220;brown #8221; refers *entirely* to the colour of the skin. Not have some stupid checklist where it #8217;s like  #8220;oh well yes your *skin* is brown but you #8217;re not Muslim and you have some European heritage so sorry no you #8217;re not allowed to claim this title #8221;. Skin colour is skin colour, and if we #8217;re still going to use terms such as white, brown, black and yellow, they should actually refer to skin colour, not some weird notion of culture, religion and place of origin like it is in today #8217;s society.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I am aware that people are able to respond how they want. I am sharing my experience of how these labels have been damaging to me and also to many people close to me. You keep saying that no one is trying to choose how I identify, which shows you #8217;re not even bothering to read what I write because that is exactly what I have experienced my entire life. Maybe not on this particular reddit post, but in real life in great quantity? Yes.  gt; not try to blame a whole fucking country I haven #8217;t blamed America at all. I have criticised one particular of aspect of something that is an American phenomenon. That says nothing about my belief in the progressiveness of Americans.  gt; claim that Americans are the  #8220;real #8221; barbarians Again, something I have not once claimed. Are you actually capable of comprehending english? I said something that is commonplace in America is barbaric, not that Americans are barbaric themselves.  gt; xenophobic I think the xenophobe here is you. You have demonstrated that you have subzero empathy for the experiences of others and a complete unwillingness to listen. Even worse, you have shown a completely inability to comprehend argument and engage in meaningful discussion without regarding others as sick and mentally ill. Plus, you have shown yourself to use a huge number of words that you clearly don #8217;t understand yourself and require others to define them for you.  gt;identitarian  #8220;they share common ideas: the undesirability of Islam and the need to stop mass immigration #8221; I #8217;m literally a person from a Muslim country.

    <TEXT>Nah I really like a lot of the things about the game. I think the catching mechanics, graphics and overworld Pok #233;mon are fantastic. I also really love the return of following Pok #233;mon and the ability to ride them around. On the other hand, I think we certainly could have asked for more in regards to the postgame; people do every year. And every year Game Freak manages to not give us what we want. People are always asking for expanded regions or a second region to go to but they never do it. I think they need to get off their asses and actually start listening to their fans. It was the same deal with following Pok #233;mon, every single game after HG/SS we asked for following Pok #233;mon, and they never followed through until now. I don #8217;t doubt that people would complain either way, but I do feel that including a game with only 151 Pok #233;mon and one almost completely unchanged region after 20 years is very half baked of them.</TEXT>

The ideal position to be in for proper singing technique is standing stationary, with feet shoulder width apart. She clearly can't do that when she's moving so much. Sure, you could say "people in musical theatre shows can do it", but musical theatre singers are typically the absolute cream of the crop when it comes to vocal technique and they are usually older and far more experienced than Jojo is.

    <TEXT>Youth is a state of being, not a  #8220;look #8221;. I have a cousin who just turned 30 who has a six-figure income and she pisses all her money up against the wall getting expensive things to show off on Instagram. She #8217;s still living at home and has zero money saved because of it, and the things she buys with her money (Gucci clothes) don #8217;t even look good: she just buys it so she can tag the brand in her photos. It #8217;s embarrassing and sad that we #8217;ve gotten to that point in the world. I practically yelled at my mum the other day because she said a woman in the social pages of the newspaper was tipped to be the  #8220;next big thing #8221;. I checked her Instagram and she has 6k followers, and calls herself a  #8220;yummy mummy #8221;. Every single photo of hers was dedicated to showing off what she has, being materialistic, and her boobs. I #8217;m sorry, these aren #8217;t the people we should be venerating. Healthcare professionals, policeman, firefighters; these are people who do dangerous and life saving work every single day, yet we #8217;re overlooking these people in favour of  #8220;influencers #8221; with a boob job. Another thing that really ground my gears was seeing Jack Kelly (Maddie Zieglers ex boyfriend) being labelled a  #8220;voice of change #8221; and a  #8220;modern day icon #8221;. Nope, sorry, he #8217;s Maddie zieglers ex, that #8217;s the only reason people know who he is. Nothing else. Don #8217;t try to paint these influencers as though they #8217;re actually doing something good for the world. I #8217;m happy that these people are making money out of Instagram but to try and paint them as though they #8217;ve actually done something amazing and charitable to earn their reputation is toxic and repulsive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure about firefighters because I haven #8217;t really had much contact with them but for doctors, all the time! Here is a quick summary of the last time I went to the doctors (general practice): - doctor was physically and verbally assaulted by a nasty old hag who claimed that  #8220;doctors are only in the business for money #8221; (from what I could glean from the conversation, she was an obese woman who didn #8217;t want to accept her doctors advice for a healthier lifestyle) - a woman in the waiting room complained that the doctors were late and that (literal quote)  #8220;GPs dont really do anything any way #8221;. Then proceeded to say  #8220;they go to medical school for years only to just refer you to a specialist anyway it can #8217;t be that difficult to complete a standard consult in 10 minutes #8221;. Numerous people in the waiting room agreed with her and I was just sitting there like  #8220;what the fuck #8221;. Several people also intimated that the doctors were late because they are incompetent and sub-standard doctors, and that that #8217;s why they are in general practice in the first place. This was just from one trip to the doctors office! I have so many more stories of doctors being treated like shit, and even more of nurses being treated poorly, because they tend to be the least valued of health professionals. It makes me so angry; just to have the ability to access healthcare is a luxury that so many people in the world don #8217;t have, if you don #8217;t respect the people who treat you, then go out and treat yourself and see how long you last.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just saying!! I #8217;m not Albanian myself (I #8217;m Bosnian/Croat though I do have a little bit of Arbanasi blood as well (Albanian immigrants into Croatia from 1800s). My question is, is it worth learning the Albanian language? Is it really difficult? I know of this thing called the  #8220;Balkan sprachbund #8221;; supposedly all the Balkan languages share certain similarities with eachother despite belonging to different groups because they are all in such close proximity to eachother. So given that I speak English and Croatian, would it be difficult to learn Albanian? I really love Albanian culture and I wish us South Slavs could take a leaf out of your book and learn to respect eachother with our religious differences :( thank y #8217;all for your time</TEXT>

At the same time,  #8220;white people #8221; think it #8217;s ludicrous that I would ever call myself white, given my skin colour... isn #8217;t white. Plus, our culture is so different. Coming from the Balkans it #8217;s very hard to fit into that  #8220;white #8221; mentality you see oversees because us Slavs were never colonisers, nor were we ever great world powers. For the most part we were oppressed and controlled by a Muslim empire. I think we fuck peoples ideas of  #8220;white #8221; and  #8220;brown #8221; up a lot too because there are lots of ethnic Muslims from the former Yugoslavia which disabuses people of the notion that europe is entirely indigenously Christian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There #8217;s a theory called the  #8220;Gay Uncle Theory #8221; when talking with respect to homosexuals in an evolutionary biology context. As you said, homosexuals wouldn #8217;t normally have children, but the fact that people continue to be homosexual at a consistent rate counters the established concept of natural selection, which would predict that the 0 reproductive success of gay people would result in the trait of homosexuality to be expressed progressively less until its bred out of the population. However, that hasn #8217;t occurred, so it #8217;s theorised that the  #8220;gay uncle #8221; may therefore assist other people #8217;s children in survival and development by providing them with extra resources, therefore effectively allowing the gay genetics to carry on.</TEXT>

I think it was great having her on the show because she provides a great role model for young black girls, instead of just encouraging these sassy, diva type black women to be on the show (e.g. Black Patsy). Holly is a highly educated and classy woman who has come from (what I assume to be) a very humble or poor background (she mentioned she was from the Bronx, given that she would've been growing up in the 70s/80s I assume she would've been poor) and made something of herself through hard work and perseverance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sadly it's mostly limited to Croatia (and Slovenia which is kinda half-Balkan anyway). Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo are still lagging behind unfortunately although tourism is starting to pick up in Bosnia which is fab because it's also a really beautiful country. And yes, things were terrible. It was a very complex war and most people who are old enough to remember it are still traumatised unfortunately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mayb, but I guess I just don #8217;t like taking those chances. Even so, I just feel like our lives should be more separate at this stage. We #8217;re dating, not married. My friends aren #8217;t his friends, his friends aren #8217;t my friends, my family isn #8217;t his family, and so on. We #8217;re getting to know eachother, and I like to feel like there #8217;s some degree of separation until I really get to know someone. I don #8217;t want to take things fast and have this person grow into every aspect of my life, I want it to happen slowly. I don #8217;t want to get swept away into this person.

    <TEXT>I have a very negative opinion on bodybuilding. There are a number of seriously unhealthy activities that bodybuilders carry out that endanger their health. Not to mention the fact that bodybuilders get big to look big. I think it #8217;s dangerous to have so much self focus on ones body to the point where you are doing anything to gain a couple of extra kilos, etc. bodybuilders do not have a  #8220;natural #8221; body, they push things to the extreme. You #8217;re right to be scared - the bodybuilding industry is probably one of the most toxic industries out and as a healthcare worker it disgusts me beyond belief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The "expensive university" thing is more of an American thing than elsewhere, me thinks. In Australia we have the "sandstone universities" which are sort of like the old universities which are stereotyped to be attended by all the private school white people. The difference is that in America to go to an Ivy League or another high up university you often need to not only be very smart but you also need to have significant funds to put you through. That's not the case in many countries like Australia; I can go to almost any university in Australia and it will cost me the same amount of money in tuition (i.e nothing upfront, and the amount you pay for your study only increases with inflation and doesn't accrue interest). I think that's a big problem with these institutions in America - they actively segregate people based on their socioeconomic status, and that perpetuates the socioeconomic structures you have in society and allows it to thrive (for the people at the top).  #8203;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just wish that someone could #8217;ve told us that not everyone gets to look  #8220;like a man #8221; when I was growing up. Sure I knew there were short people (and I certainly didn #8217;t expect to be short given my giant family) but even then I always expected I #8217;d grow and develop into my body. I assumed I #8217;d put on muscle and develop a frame and a presence. I #8217;ve barely put on weight or height since I was 14. I don #8217;t want to make this a pity party because there are so many things in my life I have to be grateful for but I do have BDD and I think a big part of developing that was the fact that I laboured under the illusion my whole life that I would develop into something that actually resembled a man. So when I was being bullied in school for my acne and, unfortunately, some features that are common for people of my race, I always imagined I #8217;d grow into them properly and grow to a point where people wouldn #8217;t see me as a target. :(</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Race ideology is complex in the US because it makes an overwhelming effort to define people and ethnic groups by their colour. The idea of a  #8220;white #8221; race, a  #8220;black #8221; race etc is all pseudoscientific. Yes, there are obviously differences in skin colour, but the US creates rules whereby you can only identify as a  #8220;skin colour #8221; if you come from a certain country, regardless of whether that is your actual skin colour or not. Like, skin colour VARIES greatly WITHIN populations. It #8217;s not like every black person is the exact same shade of colour. Not only that, but by creating a  #8220;white #8221; race,  #8220;black #8221; race etc you imply that there is actually a connection between the constituent ethnicities of that race. Like, what? Someone living in Lebanon or Turkey is going to have a very different life from someone growing up as ethnically British in the UK. It #8217;s stupid to group people into these incredibly ill-defined and overtly general categories when they really on describe people at the most base level and even then, stereotype them on the basis of what most people believe that nation to be. (Sorry if that was incoherent, but it #8217;s an issue that I find very frustrating!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for your comment. You #8217;re exactly right, the racial categories based on colour that are particularly popular in the US are ill-defined and borderline offensive. They also serve to alienate cultures that don #8217;t perfectly fit in with the  #8220;white #8221; or  #8220;black #8221; label, and people who belong to these cultures or ethnic groups are more numerous than you think. There are European countries which are Muslim, there are Arabic people that pass as white and are Christian, there are white skinned latinos. Most of the world has a huge variation in skin colour and culture and trying to imply that a white race exists (along with a black race, a brown race etc) is regressive and colourist. I myself refuse to respond when people ask me  #8220;are you brown or white #8221; now, as a form of protest. I answer with my ethnicity or I say I #8217;m Mediterranean. It #8217;s not anyone #8217;s job to put me in a box defined by some weird and ill fitting rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes but in the weird system of colourism we exist in, being  #8220;black #8221; or  #8220;brown #8221; is actually more than just skin colour and also seems to cherrypick certain traits to determine your  #8220;brownness #8221; or  #8220;blackness #8221; I have been mistaken for Indian literally my entire life to the point where actual Indians would assume I was one of them. But I #8217;m not Indian, my family are from the balkans. We are just all deeply olive skinned and some of us are Muslim. All these racial warriors don #8217;t want me to identify as Brown because apparently being European completely negates the Islamic side as well as the literal brown skin, yet no one lets me identify as white for the exact same reasons. Opposingly, Freddie Mercury is lighter than me and would be mistaken as white more often than me but the fact he is from india automatically negates the fact he is relatively white skinned. The construction of Race in 21st century western society is toxic and misinformed, it really is a sickness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would hardly call it uncommon, 3-10% of the population are LGBT (possibly more given that each new generation people are more comfortable coming out). That #8217;s a similar prevalence to the number of people who have diabetes in the adult population, and you would never call diabetes uncommon. Either way, the issue with heteronormativity is its oppositional dichotomy; the notion that heterosexual identification or behaviour is normal while homosexual behaviour is abnormal. Homosexuality is a normal variant of human sexuality, not an abnormal variant of heterosexuality, which is a better distinction. Especially as no epidemiologist would consider a trait that is prevalent in 3-10% of the population as  #8220;abnormal #8221;- that #8217;s more common than having green eyes which, to illustrate my point, is considered a normal variant of human eye colour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I prefer the word variant because the definition of abnormal is literally  #8220;deviating from what is normal or usual; typically in a way that is undesirable or worrying #8221;. Using the word abnormal too frequently to describe homosexual populations is dangerous for us because it can easily tip the delicate scales to convince people that homosexuality too is  #8220;undesirable or worrying #8221; Also, the mean wouldn #8217;t be exclusively heterosexual, if you #8217;re assuming the Kinsey scale of sexuality which assumes sexuality represents a spectrum. Even so, we really don #8217;t know exactly how true that statement is anyway. Let #8217;s please never forget that not only was pederasty between men and boys common in Ancient Greek society but that it was also common and encouraged in many Muslim societies for a very long time (up till the late Middle Ages). This was a widespread practice and indicates how societal or cultural beliefs may play a role in the actual expression of sexuality. What we do know is that it certainly isn #8217;t uncommon and probably still not as uncommon as we think it is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I think they #8217;re very mixed these days. I #8217;ve heard that 20-30% of Turks may have Albanian ancestry and 10-20% bosniak. I also know there are lots of people with Bulgarian ancestry too. I know that one big reason is that under the Ottoman Empire, everyone who was Muslim was considered the same. When the Ottoman Empire fell a lot of Turks and Islamised local population went back to Turkey where they didn #8217;t have to worry about being hated by everyone in their home countries. It #8217;s interesting how countries like Bosnia were 75% Muslim at one point but by the turn of the 19th century had reached 38%. Ngl I think it #8217;s kinda cool how pretty much all the Muslim ethnicities were accepted in Turkey, it #8217;s a nice bit of solidarity :)</TEXT>

They wash over every ethnicity #8217;s experience with a generalised cover of race to explain that ethnicity #8217;s experience.

What Americans don #8217;t realise is that in classifying any country or ethnicity as  #8220;white #8221; Or  #8220;black #8221;, there is a good number of people who won #8217;t fit into that category.

    <TEXT>Hey, I just saw this and I #8217;m Bosnian. Thank you for this glowing review of Bosnia and especially our folk music Sevdalinka. It can be quite grating on the ears for people who have never heard it before I find so it makes me happy that you enjoyed it! Balkan traditional music does often tend to have a strong sorrowful element, talking about fighting against foreign powers (e.g the ottomans) and just the struggles of life in general. I #8217;m glad you #8217;re educating people on the problems of Bosnians as Bosnia is one of Europe #8217;s poorest nations and it is very hard for people to get ahead there because there are so few opportunities.

As soon as people stop doing their share their is a domino effect with socialism.

    <TEXT>That is true, but you have to acknowledge that a lot of ethnic kids are never capable of doing that, not because they aren #8217;t able to, but because they won #8217;t. There is a definitely a lot of psychological manipulation that goes on from an early age to make sure you feel indebted to them, and in their palm. It takes a LOT to break out from that. It #8217;s also because a lot of children of immigrants or immigrant children feel like they have to do everything perfectly, and are expected to do so by their parents. That can become a very dominant drive in life that is hard to break out of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe she #8217;s intended to replace Savannah/Elliana? Abby was definitely a bit weird around coloured people. I would like to see more diversity of ethnicities in the ALDC in general, not even just Latina and African Americans. Like, apart from Nia, Asia, Camryn and Jade, pretty much every other dancer was as white and stereotypical AS POSSIBLE. Like they were all western/central/Northern European descended, none of them were immigrants. It would be nice to see more Balkan people, middle easterners, south Asian #8217;s, Africans or really just anything that isn #8217;t just the absolute standard white American. I do get the impression though that dance is a particularly white dominated art form so I suppose that would contribute to it.</TEXT>

Jojo could possibly just be tone deaf, because some tone deaf people really don #8217;t have much hope of becoming good singers. Don #8217;t get me wrong, I love her, but even in a song like  #8220;Run, Run, Rudolph #8221;, while she stayed in the right key, she was not in tune for many parts of the song. Her voice also sounded very flat, probably because she doesn #8217;t open up her throat enough to provide resonance in her voice, which is why her singing sounds halfway between singing and shouting, and sounds almost atonal at times. I do wish she would get better at singing, because she does have an amazing base of resources to draw from but maybe she just doesn #8217;t have it in her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think Melissa is like everyone, good and bad. It #8217;s very clear from the beginning of the show that she really cared for all of the girls and their emotions. I remember when Paige forgot her solo one time and you could see Melissa crying in the audience. Honestly I think Melissa was only made to look bad because of Christi and Kelly, the things she did like  #8220;getting Maddie extra privates #8221; were perfectly within her rights to do and she absolutely did not need to apologise for wanting to get her daughter ahead in the dance world. C + K never seemed to understand that the dance world isn #8217;t the ALDC, Maddie isn #8217;t just going to be competing with Chloe in the future, she #8217;s going to be competing against professional dancers from across the country, so of course it makes sense to give her the best possible leg up you can.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Look, I 100% understand your point, but please don #8217;t talk as though I #8217;m too immature to understand these concepts. I was emotionally and sexually abused as a child. That takes a huge toll on someone #8217;s body image as well as their mental health in general. Especially in my case, where I was forced to be quiet about it due to the shame it would #8217;ve brought my family, and the victim blaming I would #8217;ve suffered as a result. When that has happened to you, you do tend to become both uncomfortable around others but also afraid of others. I was raised powerless and on many days I do still feel powerless. My whole life was built around protecting myself and trying to maintain an outer appearance of happiness and calmness. Similarly, I was also forced to hide I was gay, and the negative comments I received that linked the negative aspects of my appearance to something I didn #8217;t like about myself at the time (and was forced to hide) caused me to live in a constant fear of paranoia and being outed to my family. When you #8217;ve been forced to hide everything about yourself, including things such as sexual abuse because you know the outcome would be worse if you did say something, you do tend to feel like everyone is  #8220;out to get you #8221;. It becomes a protective mechanism because you live your life in a constant state of fear that someone may just come along and either push you to the edge or out you in some way to your family, and that would #8217;ve been death for me. I understand I may sound juvenile but please don #8217;t put me in that box. I have been through a lot in my life and have come a long way. I know I still have a long way to go, but just like everyone I have my good days and my bad days. Please don #8217;t judge me on my bad ones. I can #8217;t just  #8220;grow out #8221; of my sexual abuse, and my bad days stem from that, not from my personality or my immaturity. EDIT: and in response to the knowledge that  #8220;people don #8217;t care that much #8221;, yes, I do understand that, but you also have to understand that from the background I have come from, my brain finds that hard to believe. I would #8217;ve been shamed permanently and blamed for the rest of my life if I had revealed that I had been sexually abused. Same deal for if I had revealed that I was gay. It #8217;s hard for me to believe  #8220;people don #8217;t care that much about you #8221; when I have been forced into silence my whole life over the notion that if I ever reveal my truth to anybody, EVERYBODY would care, and everybody would hate me for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s right, men make up the majority of victims of (pure violence), while women make up the majority of sexual assault victims. Women are more likely to be victims of violence from a family member of partner while men are more likely to be victims of stranger attacks and muggings. I am a man and was sexually abused when I was younger but have also had two incidents of attempted sexual assault by men that could #8217;ve gone a lot worse. Thankfully I #8217;m fast and have a good instinct so nothing bad come out of those situations but still, scary stuff. I #8217;m very cautious around places like public bathrooms at night. If you are alone in a public bathroom at night and you see someone looking at you clearly, that #8217;s a pretty good sign to leave immediately.

    <TEXT>Not to discredit that violence and sexual assault is a big problem for women, but it #8217;s actually a big problem for men too. The issue is we bury the truth about what happens to men so men don #8217;t go around feeling they need to be careful with themselves. Men feel safe because they #8217;re told they should be, and given the statistics, that #8217;s actually not a good thing. Men make up the majority of victims of violence in Australia, while women make up the majority of sexual assault victims. Men are much more likely to be attacked by strangers while women are usually victimised by people known to them, unfortunately. As a man who has been sexually abused and has narrowly escaped two sexual assaults, I can definitely say that once it #8217;s happened to you, your eyes are opened wide as to the truth that being a man doesn #8217;t make you much safer, and the statistics say the same. I try to tell people this all the time, because if more people understood that men are the main victims of (non-sexual) violence and make up a sizeable portion of sexual violence too (around 25%), then hopefully mental health outcomes could be better for us. I know of course you don #8217;t mean any harm by saying women have to be constantly vigilant (because they do) but i just like to point out that violence against men is actually a very serious, hidden epidemic not many people know about. Lots of men DO know what it #8217;s like to have to look over their shoulder constantly, to never feel safe walking alone in a parking lot and I am one of them. Unfortunately most of us are conditioned to not say anything about our experiences because society just doesn #8217;t have a space for it. I don #8217;t listen to it because fuck that, I #8217;m going to be honest with people about my experience and also the real statistics out there. I hope that if we can raise awareness both about violence against women and men, we can actually put a dent in these crimes and hopefully lead to better societal awareness about the importance of safety first, regardless of gender or sex.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let #8217;s not also forget that fact that women also suffered severely in war through rape. Sexual violence is HUGE in wars especially in civil/ethnic based war. It #8217;s awful that men have been conscripted and forced to fight in wars since time immemorial, but it doesn #8217;t negate the fact that women #8217;s bodies are also completely devalued during times of war. War is horrible for everyone. I think the saddest part is that even though the men do suffer horribly from the fighting, at least they are venerated when (if) they come home. War rape is something that women have to deal with that there is very little recognition of (at best) or is considered specifically shameful to a family and deliberately hidden (at worst). Most women in non-western countries are never allowed to speak about those events, let alone heal from them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My biggest pet peeve about Abby was her attitude to mums working. She was always up Holly's ass in the earlier seasons about working while Nia is at dance, she even said "it's never about Nia, it's always about Holly". Yet at the same time she would say things like "kelly go get a job!" constantly and stuff like that. It just infuriated me so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a complicated relationship with my Mum. My dad is almost certainly a narcissist and is really not a great person. My mum is much more black and white. I know she cares about me and loves me, and she shows it in many ways. But on the other hand she has been complicit in my abuse for years and has also contributed in many ways to it over the years (including in her homophobia). At the same time, she has improved over the years as she has gotten wiser and learnt to listen to her children #8217;s emotions. On the other hand, she still won #8217;t stand up to my dad for me, but why would I expect her to? She can #8217;t stand up for herself. She was raised in a very conservative family of Yugoslavs and she has been squashed her entire life for being a woman. She has literally been raised to put up with peoples abuse. When my mum wanted to go and get a tertiary education for herself and got into uni, my baba was so angry with her that she started a bonfire and burned every single one of my mothers possessions she #8217;d ever had. Then my poor Mum ended up marrying into a new Yugoslav family that was even worse than her old one, and she suffered so much abuse that my dad didn #8217;t even bother trying to protect her from, half the time blaming it on her. In short, my Mum has been through a lot, and I don #8217;t want to hurt her. I want to cut dad completely out of my life, but I know that he will only be worse to her. I feel like it might be worth just keeping my distance from him, but not necessarily completely removing him from my life, just so my mum can get some peace as she retires. She has been treated awfully and been let down by every single person in her life. I want her to be able to live better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Luckily enough I #8217;m fortunate to live in Australia, my family #8217;s ethnic background still kind of pervades everything especially as we live in an area full of people of the same background as us, but I keep myself sane by the fact I get to meet normal people who aren #8217;t fucking crazy in the real world. I agree it is very sad to see the abuse cycle play out in front of you. Still, I haven #8217;t endured even a fraction of what my Mum has, and thankfully I have more agency to have upward social mobility, so it #8217;s not likely that I #8217;ll ever endure what she did. It #8217;s definitely made me a pretty big feminist in the process!</TEXT>

I think people know that too, because most of the time I was called either an Arab or a Jew with my nose. Then again, the fact I was always referred to as an Arab or a Jew highlights the fact that there were definitely racist undertones in what people were saying to me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t even bother explaining to him, seriously this is such a common attitude from people who stayed after Yugoslavia broke up. Leaving the country was not the easy option, because then our families had to come to a new country and start at the very bottom of the social ladder and work our way up. Yet for some reason, all our family in Croatia/Bosnia think that we  #8220;left them behind #8221; and that we  #8220;owe them #8221;. And I highly agree with you. Some people need to wake the fuck up about the war. It #8217;s been more than 20 years and half the people still haven #8217;t bridged that gap.

    <TEXT>Am I the only one that feels that dance has a big role in promoting traditional gender roles? It always seem like dance places such a big emphasis on little girls looking done up and having romantic interactions with boys. So many solos little girls do are literally about boys and the way they are, for example Paige #8217;s solo aptly entitled  #8220;boys boys boys #8221;. Like, girls don #8217;t need to be boy crazy! They don #8217;t need to be wearing makeup 24/7! I just feel dance is a breeding ground for perpetuating this super feminine gender role. On the other hand, it might just be the families that put their kids in dance happen to value traditional gender roles. I have noticed that in every little female dancers family with a brother, the brother NEVER dances, he is always on the football team or something. It seems sad to me that parents can #8217;t see the value of both of those activities for their kids. My cousin was a ballerina at a very prestigious institution and she now has three kids (two boys, one girl). She #8217;s put the boys into football and the girl into dance. Why not encourage them to be well rounded? Maybe the girl will grow up and love to play football! Maybe one of your boys would love to dance!

    <TEXT>I love Sarah! She seems really lovely. I #8217;m actually surprised about how sweet so many of the kids seem to be because I expected them (frankly) to be very bratty theatre kids. I even love GiaNina; I think she has been given a bad rap she didn #8217;t deserve. My heart broke for her when she said  #8220;you guys have been ripping my mum apart all morning #8221;. Like, that #8217;s when you realise how toxic of an environment dance moms is. Yes she is probably over confident but life will probably smooth her out naturally, especially in an industry like entertainment. Besides, she has a better attitude than most of the girls did in season 7, at least GN can back up her confidence with a number of great professional jobs. I see what people mean when they say the magic is gone, but I honestly think that with time the new team will start to gel and become great friends. I can already see the sparks of friendship forming and kids do make friends pretty quickly at that age, and they do spend practically 24/7 with eachother. I just hope the show survives long enough for us to see it.</TEXT>

I agree that the show has definitely had troubles with understanding and representing race issues adequately, but I don #8217;t agree that not favouring Nia highlights an issue with race. Personally, if I were one of the dancers in season 8, I probably wouldn #8217;t look up to Nia either (as a dancer). The dancers on season 8 all have amazing technique that is light years ahead of Nia #8217;s, so it would seem odd if they picked someone to look up to who doesn #8217;t have the greatest technique. Of course she did work very hard to improve throughout the show, but I also know that Maddie and Brynn worked their butts off to get to the point where they got, so I don #8217;t feel that Nia #8217;s work ethic alone would be enough to make her these kids favourite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They #8217;re hardly meh, all the dancers on the team are wonderful in their own right. As was said above, Savannah is also very well known in the competition world and came second at TDA to Elliana last year, which is very prestigious. GiaNina has a big list of professional credits that imo is more impressive than trophies from a dance competition, because she #8217;s already proven that she can beat out hundreds, if not thousands of other dancers in order to get paid work. Brady is obviously an amazing dancer but he #8217;s not the only amazing dancer in the world, in the country, or even on the ALDC team. Personally I did find Gianinas solo to be more entertaining and enjoyable than Brady #8217;s, that girl knows how to perform.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ooo that #8217;s an interesting piece of gossip! So were the select team aware that it would be disbanded at the end of the season then? I assume they would have had some idea given their contracts would #8217;ve been over but they might #8217;ve thought they would just have their contracts renewed for the new season. It must have been kind of frustrating for Kaleigh to have been brought in just for a single episode. I often think about dancers like Fallon who were only on for one episode and wonder if it has left a negative impact on them to this day. If Fallon has remembered her solo and won, she would probably be hundreds of thousands of dollars richer today than she is now. Money isn #8217;t everything, but it must be hard to be in a position where you were so close to achieving some level of fame and riches at a young age only for it to be taken away from you due to a mix of circumstances and your own personal mistakes. I #8217;m still very sad that none of the dancers from the select team made it onto the ALDC elite team, especially Kamryn, who Abby really liked, but the producers didn #8217;t like her Mum so it didn #8217;t happen. I wonder if Kamryn resented her Mum slightly for not being a more bitchy woman?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s such an offensive thing to say as well, people move to different countries all the time. Moving to a new country doesn #8217;t completely abort your actual ethnicity, and if it did we wouldn #8217;t have Chinatowns, Little Italys, Greektowns etc across the world. Many people maintain a connection to their culture, language and families back home especially balkan people. My family are immigrants from the balkans and I can still speak the language (albeit not perfectly), know and understand the culture and history really well, was raised as a Croat, am a citizen of the country, still keep in touch/visit family back home... that makes me a Croat. Living in Australia doesn #8217;t change anything about me and who I am.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair though, they don't suffer structural racism *currently.* However many older Italian-Americans will tell you a different story from when they first arrived in the US. Most immigrants are treated like shit when they move to a Western country until they have been in the country for a significant period of time and assimilated into the social order of things. Italians had an easier time of assimilation because of their religion but for a long time they were basically considered "semi-coloured". My family are from Yugoslavia (which is honestly much worse than Italy but still) and when they first came to the country the people around them thought of them as "worse than the Aboriginals" (yes that is a direct quote).  #8203; I don't blame Joanne for not wanting that solo to be shown on national TV. Just because GiaNina doesn't necessarily experience that structural racism *now* it is still making a mockery of her famiy who did have to experience that to get to where they are now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it's pretty offensive how people just say "you're white so what's the problem" to Italians. They were not perceived as "proper" white when they first arrived in the US, often being labelled "dirty whites", "semi-coloured", "browns" etc. It's just diminishing their experience by being like "omg but you're white!" when for a long time they certainly weren't part of the white club. Especially because lots of Italians have naturally dark skin.</TEXT>

Most people still don #8217;t know when they #8217;re actual adults! It #8217;s naive of people to assume that every dancer who joined dance moms (mostly in that 10-11 age group) would want to go on to professionally dance as adults. Not to mention the fact that outside of dance, we actually don #8217;t really know that much about the girls! For all we know, Kendall could be absolutely fabulous at science, Brynn might be amazing at math, Kalani might be a great soccer player. They should have the opportunity to cultivate themselves without every person wondering why they didn #8217;t become professional dancers. I personally feel all the dancers could be great in a number of non-entertainment roles. I can totally imagine Kalani working in PR.</TEXT>

Nia: she should #8217;ve stayed! Chloe: should #8217;ve left a bit earlier as she was being treated horribly by Abby most of season 4 Kalani: should #8217;ve left after season 6 or 5, it would have been good for her to just get some exposure then go back to dance training Brynn: should #8217;ve left after season 6 Asia: should #8217;ve stayed! IMO raising Asia sucked and even though she is now an AMAZING singer I do think it wouldn #8217;t have hurt her to stay a bit longer, maybe till season 5 or 6, seeing as she isn #8217;t really booking big jobs Jojo: she left at the right time considering she went straight into an opportunity Lilli: should have left by now Elli: I #8217;m glad she didn #8217;t do too many episodes in season 8 GiaNina: I hope she leaves at the end of this season tbh, that girl has too much going for her</TEXT>

Elli is amazing but I #8217;ve noticed Abby has a tendency to choreograph her solos which have lots of turns, which really aren #8217;t her forte relative to her other skills. She tends to give Lilli the stuff she is best at so I often feel it #8217;s hard to compare the two when they are on DM because one gets choreography that suits her and one doesn #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you Giant\_Anteaters! I am also a boy (although gay admittedly) and the amount of gendering we see in activities is ridiculous. People often say "oh but I wouldn't say ballet is feminine, look how macho male ballet dancers look!", without realising that they have just implied that the reason boys should want to do ballet is because it's **very much masculine and not feminine.** Why should something be lesser because it's feminine? Boys should be encouraged to join any pursuit or field of interest without having to find ways to "prove" its masculinity. You should be able to do whatever you want (provided it doesn't hurt anybody) and not have to explain yourself constantly if it provides you with fulfilment :)  #8203; Of course, ballet does take a lot of strength and ballet dancers really are athletes, so there theoretically should be that aspect that would be appealing to "traditional" boys, and you would hope that would make it more marketable to the traditional male audience. Still, it seems like no one is in a hurry to tell boys they can dance, even in 2019 in progressive countries. My cousins (all of whom have young children), some of whom were professional dancers (all female + in ballet) have already gone down the whole route of "our boys are doing football, our girls are doing ballet". Like? How limiting. What happens if your boy wants to do ballet or your girl wants to do football?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank god someone said it! Boys DO need feminism too. How can we ever convince men to respect women as equals when we still don't allow men to ever act feminine, or take part in feminine activities? The message is "women can act (similar to) men, and that's ok, because then you're acting "up"" but "boys can't act like women because that's acting "down" a class". It makes me angry when women are homophobic to me or have said "all gays are like women, like, act like a man" and i'm like: "do you even see your own internalised sexism right now!?"</TEXT>

Now all of a sudden you see heaps of people being like  #8220;actually she seems really nice and sweet #8221;. Why can #8217;t people just accept that there is nuance to each child #8217;s personality? No child is ever perfect 100% of the time, and they are growing up, and all of the girls seem to be lovely people.

    <TEXT>It also really bothers me how knee jerk most of the reactions are. Most of them are formulated from just one or two episodes where the girls have momentary (minor) lapses in judgement or behaviour, and then from that moment on they #8217;re given a negative label. It does actually make me feel upset because as far as I have seen Pressley and Sarah are both lovely girls who are relatively mature for their age. I do often worry that if people just get constant hate from a young age it #8217;ll end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy - like the person just becomes so jaded from being labelled something they aren #8217;t that they become cynical and bitter as a result.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It could just be noise, but in general, the further away a population is from what you are, the easier it is to recognise. Central/South Asians have vastly different genetics to balkan people so it #8217;s DNA that is easier to determine for that reason. There is a small chance it could be avars/Scythians though I doubt it as many were assimilated into Slavic tribes, so the reference population for the corresponding Slavic people already has the  #8220;Scythian #8221; parts counted for. Turk is probably the second most likely possibility, especially with the little bit of East Asian.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can make out like you were just framing your interest in someone else #8217;s opinions, but the way you did it was extremely passive aggressive. Also, if someone doesn #8217;t want to discuss their exact opinion on something personal to them with you, leave it. Don #8217;t give them the  #8220;I think I will actually #8221;. Nobody owes it to you to share their inner nuances. Also, @OP. I hear you. I am not Black/African American but I am part of the Balkan diaspora. My relationship with my ethnicity was also complicated growing up for a number of reasons. For starters, I was born here, but in many ways I was raised in my culture, with our values, and our beliefs. To make matters more complicated, I have always been treated as  #8220;different #8221; by the Anglo-Celtic majority here in Australia, and so being able to perceive myself as wholly Australian with my family from the balkans has been difficult. I imagine it must be even harder for you as my family have only been in this country ~50 years while yours have probably been there for hundreds! I #8217;m going to say right away there is no easy answer. However, you don #8217;t have to go with the grain of any culture. If you don #8217;t like certain aspects of African American culture, you dont have to embody them and you don #8217;t have to like them. You can be an African American with your own interpretation of your culture and history. There is something like 40 million African Americans; there are bound to be likeminded ones somewhere who feel the same way as you. Finding them won #8217;t be easy, but I can promise they #8217;re out there. Even so, individuality should trump your feelings of group identity. While I am ethnically 100% Balkan, I disagree with many aspects of culture, history etc that very much goes against the grain of typical Balkan people. And that #8217;s ok! You are free to explore your identity in any way you wish. Not everyone will like it, but that doesn #8217;t matter. If you are African American, but feel culturally close to Africa, that #8217;s your perogative. People may not like it, but they can never take away your heritage. I #8217;m not sure if I #8217;ve made my point clear because this is quite a complex issue for me and I #8217;m not the best at writing from a personal subjective but I hope you sort of understand what I #8217;m trying to say.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>People have been constantly redefining  #8220;white #8221; for centuries. Don #8217;t try and put it just on millennials just because they may or may not have a world view that disagrees with your own. As for the American idea of white, it really doesn #8217;t make sense. I am south Eastern European and am naturally quite dark, have very stereotypical  #8220;middle eastern #8221; features, yet I #8217;m pretty much entirely european. Say what you want, but I #8217;ve never in my life been treated as though I #8217;m white; I #8217;ve been treated as a foreigner in the country in which I have lived in my entire life. So why would I consider myself white when the white majority don #8217;t consider me white? Oh wait, they only don #8217;t consider white as far as my appearance and aspects of my culture. As soon as they find out I #8217;m european (god forbid!) I suddenly get grouped into white colonials, which is completely anachronistic with my deep olive skin and the fact that my ancestors were entirely victims of foreign domination and never actually colonised anyone. My point is,  #8220;white #8221; is stupid, dude. I prefer to identify myself by my ethnicity or the general region in which I #8217;m from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, the movie is pretty disgusting and laughably ironic in its premise. The movie uses a tall girl to be the focus on the wider theme that it's ok to be different and not everyone needs to fit in the same box. Then the movie proceeds to:  #8203; \- gt; Make sure that the tall girl can't date the short (seemingly Asian) man who is very attracted to her. Of course, she has to date a very tall (extremely White) man, because that's all she can have because \*woe is me\* "i'm tall". As a message, that just increases the pressure for taller young girls to feel like they can only date men taller than them (potentially reducing the likelihood they ever find their perfect partner!), tells tall girls they have to fit into what society thinks of them, and then also willingly perpetuates the stereotype that short men are lesser. This is further expanded on by the "nerdy" personality of the short dude, in comparison to the "hunky" and romantic personality of the tall man. This is a story masquerading to be about body acceptance that is really about body shaming. The overall message of the story? Be slightly different, but in a way that is perceived by society to be dominant, and then be born with the other advantages of having a supportive family, being white and being affluent, and then you will find your prince who also has to have every single one of those traits too. And you will be fine, no worries!  #8203; Give me a bucket, this whole movie is a joke. "Body positivity" my ass.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My take on the movie:  #8203; \- gt; Instead of teaching viewers that someone's personality and who they are is more important than their height and appearance, viewers are bombarded constantly with the physical aspects of each person and how Jodi is tall. We get it. \- gt; The weird/incel-ly type man who also appears to be of Asian heritage is of course short and given an even more one dimensional character than everyone else, because that's a great thing to reinforce in a movie about body positivity. Predictably, the boyfriend is of course not only tall (and smart and funny and romantic!) but also as white as humans can physically be. It's always great to tie in a healthy dose of racism into a movie about body positivity, eh? \- gt; Jodi is privileged as fuck and (acknowledging the movie is supposed to be about her) there is still a ridiculous lack of nuance in the issues that people face outside of being tall. Plus, they don't even approach her height in a way that encourages you to be sympathetic, mainly because they make her seem laughable and like a troll standing next to some gremlins for pretty much the entire movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I live in australia and things are a lot more flexible here with regards to race. I know that in America census data specifically records data based on races, so I suppose definitions of race there do have to be very specific. We don #8217;t have that kind of definition in Australia so your race is largely up to how you see yourself and just your outward appearance. I am usually grouped into brown along with most middle easterners and dark Europeans and south Asians, but it #8217;s just a general grouping, not like an actual category. Here, because I don #8217;t look  #8220;white #8221; (I.e light skin, western euro features) then I #8217;m not white. EDIT: to add, another common designation for me is  #8220;wog #8221;. I #8217;m not sure what the equivalent would be in the US but wogs are considered to be people from Southern Europe, Turkey, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Syria. Wog is again a sort of general ethnic identifier - it carries its own stereotypes of what you are, what you look like, how you speak etc but it #8217;s really an informal category</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I live in Australia and seeing the stark difference between our culture and values compared with the dominant Anglo-Celtic culture in Australia, I would say no. For us Croats we might have religion in common but that #8217;s just about the end of it. There #8217;s good and bad to it. For example, we are far more intolerant of people #8217;s differences (eg homophobic, sexist), but we are also more family oriented and less individualistic. All in all we #8217;re pretty different but I #8217;m proud to be part of that difference; I hate it when people want to call themselves western just because they want to be part of the West.

    <TEXT>I agree with everything you #8217;ve said, and for everyone who doesn #8217;t know, a great program to download is Anki. You basically make flash cards and then the program tests you at timed intervals (eg 3 days from now, 10 days from now) to consolidate everything in your memory. Works a charm for me :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes - that was probably one of her biggest factors in selecting Kendall. Abby has said time and time again that being able to comprehend movement quickly is extremely important for her team - which makes sense, given that they #8217;ll often really only have a few hours to learn and perfect multiple dances each week. I do agree that Kendall was underrated, especially because I think skills like picking up choreography quickly and having good timing are the type of skills that we aren #8217;t really going to notice from a TV viewing perspective, but any choreographer or dance instructor would notice immediately.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Honestly, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I #8217;m glad Kalani didn #8217;t try to pursue a professional ballet career/high level dancing career. My cousin was a ballet dancer at a prestigious company and she was treated horribly for her body - and she was skinny. Even BEING skinny was considered too fat. Both other girls and teachers would bully her for her weight. The girls would constantly smoke cigarettes to repress their appetite so they would stay super skinny (Which is even more unhealthy when you take into account the fact of how physically demanding ballet is!). So, I #8217;m glad Kalani didn #8217;t pursue ballet, because in all likelihood, a curvy girl like her would #8217;ve been treated awfully for her body, and she just doesn #8217;t deserve to have to feel horrible about herself literally because of the way she is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I think that was inevitable. Chloe has millions of followers on social media and can make thousands of dollars just for posting on instagram. I think Chloe is down to earth, but only relative to other celebrities/influencers. The reality is she lives and has lived a different (and very privileged) from what most people will ever be able to live, so it #8217;s not surprising she would be a little bit removed from reality. I #8217;m not going to lie that the postmates thing gave me a small heart attack though - I chronically meal prep and shop in bulk to save money, because it #8217;s so hard to get ahead in life and I #8217;d really like to save as much as possible as quickly as possible. I think she should be more careful because money can be VERY fleeting and if she plays her cards right, she could easily be set for life with the money she has already earnt and the money she will continue to earn from being an influencer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To some degree, yes, but that speaks more about her parents than it does her. Just having two college educated parents is indicative of privilege. The very fact Chloe was able to take intensive dance classes and that Christi was even able to go on the show with Chloe (keep in mind they made $600 over the course of season 1) is indicative of a level of privilege that many if not most would not be able to afford. Being on a single parent income for several months would be enough to cripple many families. I #8217;m not saying that Chloe hasn #8217;t worked hard, but it #8217;s just a reality that the life she lives is out of reach for the majority of people. Strictly speaking, it was the growth of a huge fan base that has made her most of her money (i.e through influencing on social media) rather than through Dance Moms. Being able to make money through being an influencer is not the sort of thing that the average person can achieve and no matter which you spin it, you can #8217;t disagree that being able to make money literally by clicking  #8220;post #8221; on an app is something that only very few, lucky people can have. You can say they earned their money through hard work, but they reason they were able to earn this money in the first place was through a combination of pure luck, socio-economic privilege, and yes, some talent. Denying otherwise is making a mockery of the hard working working/middle class people who will never be able to experience the life Chloe has had simply due to the circumstances they have grown up in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I also kind of get the impression she was being that way on purpose. We all know Abby has no kids or close relatives so it #8217;s not a big stretch to assume that when she dies she would leave Gianna the studio. I also think Gianna could be very rude to the girls, but it seems that even now the girls adore Gia so I suppose there is more to what we see. Given that they predominantly worked with Gia (rather than Abby), I can almost imagine that Gia was lovely to them most of the time and then turned on the snark like a light switch when Abby was around (which according to the girls wasn #8217;t that much). That may explain why most of the viewers have a neutral to negative impression of her yet the actual dancers have a positive impression of her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t think it #8217;s important that neurodiverse people should be prioritised to play neurodiverse roles. I think it #8217;s different if you #8217;re trans or if you are physically disabled (I.e in a wheelchair), because those are cases where what roles you can get are literally limited by your body #8217;s physiology. Obviously, someone in a wheelchair will be limited to what roles they can play if they can #8217;t walk, so I do think it #8217;s fair to expect that disabled roles should be  #8220;reserved #8221; for them. It #8217;s very important to have disabled people on screen - many disabled kids grow up believing that they can #8217;t achieve, or that nobody believes in them, so seeing a disabled actor or disabled character in the media is a big confidence boost.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It bothers me that Brynn said that so much. I mean, her nose to me is literally tiny. I come from an ethnic background with big noses and so naturally, I grew up with a very big nose and I would get so many nasty comments on it every day, even to the point of being heckled in public for it. It got to the point that I always had to angle myself away from people so that they wouldn #8217;t see my side profile. As soon as I turned 18 I spent all my time working to pay off a nose job (not in the US so it wasn #8217;t as astronomically expensive as it would be there). It really shows that she must have a very distorted view of herself if she thinks it #8217;s large, coming from someone with an actually large nose! I don #8217;t want her to fall into the trap of feeling like she needs plastic surgery, especially because if she #8217;s talking about her objectively pretty features and then still finding fault in them, then it #8217;s likely that she #8217;ll never be satisfied with the results. There #8217;s a reason you see so many people with plastic surgery who look botched or overdone - a lot of the people who get it just fall into this downward spiral of never quite being happy or satisfied with their appearance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m actually very lucky in that I got a position in clinical research in adelaide :) those jobs are fairly uncommon though and there were a lot of applicants for the position (450 I believe). Other health degrees are safer because they provide you with a pathway to a specific job - e.g if you do nursing you become a nurse, and there are thousands of jobs for nurses and heaps of opportunities available. It means that your qualification is *useful*. So if you don #8217;t make it into med, it means that you haven #8217;t spent the last three years doing a qualification that, for most people, doesn #8217;t lead to a job. Also take into account that med is rough - I know you probably know this, but med sci is like medicine lite and even med sci can be *soul crushing*. I started med sci wanting to do medicine and I no longer want to do it (though I have extenuating circumstances that are also playing into that). If you find at the end of your degree you don #8217;t want to do med, it #8217;s better to at least have a health qualification like nursing so you at least have something useful to fall back on. I should probably let you know also that biomed and med sci are usually basically the same thing, although maybe they #8217;re different in SA. Don #8217;t do forensic sciences, it absolutely won #8217;t get you a job as lots of people do it. If you can do it as a second major/minor go ahead and do it though.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed, and as unpopular this opinion is probably going to be, I #8217;m actually *glad* Kalani didn #8217;t pursue professional dance, especially ballet. The ballet industry is extremely ruthless and has extremely high, and unattainable, standards for what a woman #8217;s body should be. Kalani unfortunately would #8217;ve practically been considered obese by ballet standards. My cousin was a ballet dancer and was called fat consistently by her peers and her teachers, and she #8217;s had kids now and is in her 40s and is *still* slim, so you can imagine what she would #8217;ve been like at 21 doing 10+ hours of ballet every day. It #8217;s horrible. The other girls in her classes would imply she wasn #8217;t good enough because she didn #8217;t smoke to suppress her appetite. I think Kalani dodged a bullet really - I can #8217;t imagine anything worse than working your ass off your entire life then being told you #8217;re too  #8220;fat #8221; to work in the industry based off of something you have no control over.

    <TEXT>Ok, but statistics from western countries, certainly so in my country, show that men are actually more likely to be victims of stranger violence than women. Most violence against women is perpetrated by people known to them, which is of course awful, but the notion that men don #8217;t feel afraid and shouldn #8217;t *need* to is also a problem. A big part of me feels men don #8217;t feel afraid because men aren #8217;t told the truth about how common it is to be the victim of violence and sexual assault. If they knew, they might feel differently. I am a man and have felt scared walking by myself in all sorts of places, and I have also been sexually assaulted by a stranger, so these things do happen. It frustrates me when people say  #8220;I had to put myself into a woman #8217;s shoes to understand what it #8217;s like to be afraid in a public place! #8221; Yes, many if not most women feel that way, but keep in mind that men are both encouraged not to feel afraid and also socially stigmatised for ever admitting to feeling afraid, so please don #8217;t imagine this is something that isn #8217;t a problem for men by any stretch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally none of that statement at all needs to be addressed by feminism. I am a feminist. The fact remains that women and men tend to be recipients of violence from different sets of people. I have not denied violence against women, nor have I denied that there are still more cases (in number) of violence against women than there are men AFAIK. What I #8217;m saying is that the skew in proportion in violence against women (as opposed to men) is nowhere near as strong as most people would imagine it. So there are a large number of men who are living in a world where their experiences are constantly being invalidated before they even have a chance to say anything. We need to **stop** saying  #8220;oh men don #8217;t feel afraid to walk in public places #8221;, when many do. Many do and many have too much personal reason to understand what it #8217;s like. No one ever talks about how men can have panic attacks just being in public. No one talks about the man who was raped in a bush. No one talks about these things and people act like they don #8217;t happen. So don #8217;t act like I need feminists to  #8220;address #8221; this statement like I #8217;ve said something fucking horrible. Accept that we live in a world that can be horrible and not only women are capable of being victimised. Have some empathy and realise  #8220;huh, maybe this stuff actually *does* happen and I #8217;ve just been programmed by society to not think so #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m going to do that, because the whole point is that as soon as someone points out that feeling afraid is also something that is experienced by men, it gets shut down because women experience it  #8220;more often #8221;. If I ever heard people say  #8220;oh yeah there are plenty of men who don #8217;t feel afraid #8221; then I would be fine. And on another note, are not enough men feeling afraid? Do men not feel afraid because they genuinely aren #8217;t in danger, or is it because society tells them they don #8217;t have a reason to be afraid? I know lots of men who say stuff like  #8220;oh well I #8217;m a 6 foot, 95kg footballer, I wouldn #8217;t have any problems #8221;, yet that didn #8217;t stop my cousin #8217;s friend (literally a 6 #8217;5 #8221;, 110kg footballer) from getting mobbed and having his jaw broken and abdomen slashed at complete random and out of nowhere one night. My point is that people *in general* need to be more aware of the dangers that are out there. If anything, hearing that men  #8220;don #8217;t need to be afraid #8221; or  #8220;men don #8217;t have to be afraid #8221;, which I have heard a lot lately in my country, is incredibly invalidating for someone who is a literal victim of sexual assault by a stranger in a public place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think it might be a situation like Kalani where she trains at the ALDC for the show but competes under her actual studio in the off season. I have to admit though - I didn #8217;t particularly like this solo. She #8217;s an amazing dancer, but I hate the way modern competition dances always have to be to really downbeat, atonal type music, and just have all these weird leg extensions and odd moves all the time. The last 30 seconds of choreography I found particularly gross. I just don #8217;t know why competition dances can #8217;t be more  #8220;fun #8221;, or feature a more classical repertoire of moves outside of  #8220;aerial, leg contortion, leg extension, backbend, repeat #8221;. Now, granted, there are solos out there that feature this, but my god this solo is one of the worst offenders of what I dislike about modern competition dance. I do think she danced beautifully though! She seems to dance much older off the show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello fellow Australian! In a way similar to African Americans, most indigenous Australians have white heritage as well for not so good reasons. However, most indigenous people today will still identify as indigenous regardless of how much they have. Your Mum may be half in the sense that her dad was white and *her* Mum was aboriginal, but she would most likely be less than half aboriginal genetically because her aboriginal lineage was probably mixed with white ancestors when the British colonised Australia. Therefore she #8217;s probably around 15-25% aboriginal genetically, but that doesn #8217;t at all mean you can #8217;t or shouldn #8217;t identify as aboriginal :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This idea isn #8217;t *entirely* bad. Ok, the idea about having parents monitor and the questions board is a bit fucked. But a porn site for kids (I.e teenagers) that has adult actors doing porn wouldn #8217;t necessarily be a bad idea. Teens are watching porn anyway and they get a lot of bad messages from it, so I think it would be great for there to be a porn site that has *real* people having sex like normal people. It would be great for them to see what a normal and healthy relationship looks like. I also feel it would be great for teens to see diversity - not just in sexual orientation and race, but body type too. Teens shouldn #8217;t be receiving the message that having an 8 inch penis or triple E breasts is the average. They should be exposed to real bodies.</TEXT>

Like, Maddie has always been a *dancer*. I disagree that she should #8217;ve moved on from Sia - the jobs that she #8217;s had with Sia are arguably some of the most high profile and wide reaching media a dancer has ever had. She doesn #8217;t need to be acting in every big movie to somehow prove her worth. She has pretty much achieved as highly as possible for a dancer that is going down the non-ballet route.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Career question - should I do medical imaging or nursing? Just for some context, I currently work in medical research in Australia: here medical imaging is a 4 year bachelors degree training you in x ray and basic training in other modalities (excluding sonography). Nursing is a 3 years bachelor degree or a 2 years master degree. I #8217;ve been thinking about going into medical imaging for a long time - the physics and technological side really appeal to me, and I love anatomy because I personally find it much more challenging than physiology. However, heaps of people have told me that medical imaging is boring and repetitive, and that all radiographers/medical imaging technologists do is push buttons. While that may or may not be true for x ray, what are the other modalities like? The thing I find challenging though is that I #8217;m also interested in being involved in  #8220;hands on #8221;, procedural work. I #8217;ve looked into areas like Cath lab radiography and it seems like this is much more involved - I #8217;ve seen job descriptions that indicate that MITs would assist the cardiologist in using pressure injectors, intravascular ultrasound etc. Can anyone fill me in on what this type of role is like and how involved the imaging technologist would actually be in this process? And in a more general sense, could someone explain to me why modalities outside of x ray are generally considered more challenging and rewarding? Any help would be appreciated :) The reason I also consider nursing is because there is such a diverse set of career options you can have and there #8217;s plenty of hands on stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair, if Kira comes from an immigrant background she might not have been raised with the idea of being white. the US has very specific definitions of what it means to be white, lots of other countries don #8217;t use it in censuses so it #8217;s more of a cultural idea than a specific one. In Australia where I live it tends to be more  #8220;are you darker/ would you not pass for an Anglo Australian #8221; that tends to label you as non-white. I myself am from south Eastern Europe and I was never raised with the notion that I #8217;m  #8220;white #8221;, and many other people of my background haven #8217;t been raised with that either and have been treated accordingly. I understand Americans have a very specific definition of races, but it frustrates me sometimes how people from the US have no concept that these aren #8217;t scientific definitions; consequently different places have different interpretations of what it means to be white/black, and that #8217;s totally fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is so not okay. My parents have been together for 35 years in a very unhealthy relationship and this is exactly how my dad treats my mum. What woman wants to be spoken to like she has no clue about anything? It hardly makes for a very equitable relationship at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, that was my immediate impression too. OP, my dad is also a narcissist and he behaves very much the same way. Neither of your parents are all seeing or all knowing. They are human and flawed like everybody else. Please remember that you aren #8217;t always wrong, you #8217;re probably right a lot of the time. A big part of healing from a narcissistic relationship is learning to trust that your ideas and instincts are right, and have the confidence to not care if someone else thinks they are wrong. I really advise you to get into mindfulness and also look for tactics on dealing with narcissists - it #8217;s a challenging road ahead but you can come out all the better for it with hard work and determination :)</TEXT>

I don't think it matters that we become adults and it suddenly becomes "acceptable" for us to be gay - the vast majority of us either experienced or witnessed constant homophobia starting in primary school and going through to high school growing up. That sense of shame marks gay people and doesn't go anywhere quickly. I also think it's the isolation of being gay that can make things very hard as well.</TEXT>

However, please be aware that this can happen to anyone at the hands of anyone of any sexuality or gender. It is not gay exclusive. The majority of gay guys do not wish to harm you, and there are plenty of people (and heaps on this sub!) who want more than just sex. My advice is focus on yourself first. Spend your energy on being the best person you can be! You're only 15, you have lots of time to figure out what you want in a man and how best to express your sexuality. If you dont like men who just want you for sex that is fine (I am this way), but make sure to be firm in your boundaries in men who approach you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do I get privilege for being male though? Granted, I see myself as a non-binary gay male (if that makes sense), but I #8217;ve never felt that I #8217;ve ever been afforded male privilege. Rather, I #8217;ve felt that being a male who is gender non-conforming has just completely destroyed any respect or credibility I would be afforded normally. I have been discriminated against at my workplace (that is 90% women by the way), for essentially not being male  #8220;enough #8221;. I have been denied promotions for not  #8220;having enough authority #8221; or the  #8220;presence #8221; to delegate tasks, and been told I #8217;m too  #8220;friendly and passive #8221;. You can say that this isn #8217;t sheer proof I was discriminated against because of my gender behaviour, but in context it was obvious when I was getting the feedback that I wasn #8217;t  #8220;alpha male #8221; enough for the job. Then, we I did finally receive a promotion, I was given the job at a lower pay rate than the cis straight male who was promoted three weeks before me (about 6K less as a matter of fact), despite the fact I have more experience and am equally as proficient in the job. Socially, I have always felt the same. The greatest transgression for a male is to act feminine. The sheer fact I do so (and I #8217;m not even the most feminine gay person out there!) has made me a constant target of ridicule and disrespect. I have to work really hard just to get other women to respect me half the time, let alone other men. Regarding my own safety, this is something I also feel is lacking. The amount of times I #8217;ve been yelled at, heckled, been sexually assaulted, been threatened... I do truly wonder if it will ever end. People act like only women have to walk with their keys out between their fingers, and only women need to worry about their safety in a dark parking lot. But I #8217;ve been worrying about those things since I was a young boy! obviously I #8217;m not saying women aren #8217;t discriminated against because they absolutely are (and I #8217;m a huge feminist myself), but my point is that I think being gay and even remotely stereotypical greatly diminishes any privilege you receive for being male. There #8217;s a reason why straight boys will often use it as the worst insult (especially in schools + police etc). It #8217;s because you surrender a great deal of male privilege once you come out as gay. Life is a trial  #129396;.</TEXT>

Being male does not mean I can automatically fight other men off. We are not all created equally. Not one of my abusers was I able to fight off.

I am used to being seen as lesser and I #8217;m tired of fighting it. I #8217;m tired of having to explain to people how their actions and words are often casually homophobic. I #8217;m tired of experiencing internalised homophobia from other gay people. I #8217;m tired of trying to find a man to date that #8217;s not problematic and toxic. I #8217;m tired of being in my twenties and not ever being able to find a single man who has life together and is emotionally mature. I #8217;m tired of gay people seemingly never bothering to go on actual dates. I #8217;m tired of never being able to find other like-minded gay people. I feel like I #8217;m a black sheep. Being gay is exhausting. I #8217;d be lying if I didn #8217;t say I wish I wasn #8217;t gay. Because my entire life has been trial after trial after trial, and I #8217;m sick of having people shame me for any gay trait I express. I #8217;m sick of being body shamed by gay people for not being masculine enough, and then being body shamed by straight people for being too feminine.

    <TEXT>My family are from Eastern Europe as well and yep, you hit the nail on the head. Machismo is very deeply ingrained. It #8217;s quite literally dangerous to be gay in Eastern Europe. Even where there are legal protections, they are seldom unforced because pretty much the whole society including police are against you. I disagree with OPs idea that effeminate men are  #8220;liked #8221; in the West though. I #8217;m moderately effeminate (not really like  #8220;stereotype #8221; femme but just more feminine than a typical straight man) and I #8217;ve been heckled in the street, had things thrown at me, had multiple people make rude comments towards me... it #8217;s not great.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly think a move would be great. Are your options in your field so limited that NONE of your training would be transferable to another country? I know you say the younger generation are accepting but as fellow ex-Yugoslav gay person I think you would really benefit from being somewhere where the majority are accepting. However, I #8217;m not sure you should move for love specifically. I think you should start building a career and a happier life for yourself first in Macedonia, take some time to figure out what you want and then move elsewhere. I know the idea of moving seems scary, but there are millions of immigrants around the world in the exact same position! Think of how common it is for Balkan people especially to leave their home countries and to emigrate elsewhere. There #8217;s nothing special about them - you #8217;re just as capable as they are and I think a new perspective in a new place would be great for you :)</TEXT>

I have learnt from experience that expecting  #8220;moving to a new place #8221; to solve all my problems didnt do that. It definitely helped, but there are also lots of other things I dragged with me. Some of that is unavoidable, but some it isn #8217;t.

    <TEXT>Love that! I #8217;m not trying to doubt that your degree isn #8217;t transferable at all, but you must be eligible for credit in some country? I just had a look at pharmacist accreditation in the UK and it certainly seems possible that you could transfer there (not saying it would be logistically easy, just throwing things at the wall). That being said, I also think you should take some time to work on your self and try something new to focus on. I personally love singing and piano and these are things that help distract me when I #8217;m not feeling great. In addition to that, I think you should look into getting some assistance for your mental health. I saw some of your other posts and please, PLEASE, *please* do not kill yourself. You are worth so much more than you know and you deserve to understand that. I would be very sad if you killed yourself and I don #8217;t even know you! I know how much effort it takes to escape the grasps of depression, but please looking into getting help. I know the stigma is really strong against mental health in Macedonia, but if you can #8217;t get help, please at least look into developing strategies that help to make you feel better. I find writing down things that I #8217;m grateful for is a really helpful way for me to feel better when I #8217;m sad :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You #8217;re putting it on one person to communicate with everyone, where as we could educate the gay masses on stereotyping and save him the energy of constantly having to explain himself to people. I really disagree with the idea that  #8220;most bitches in this sub don #8217;t have real problems #8221;. You shouldn #8217;t diminish other people #8217;s experiences when you don #8217;t know them. For people who have mental disorders, a lot of things matter, and hearing/seeing people call them whiny cunts doesn #8217;t help at all. For instance, I can certainly say that I hate constantly being assumed to be submissive. As a child sexual assault + abuse survivor, constantly being told things like  #8220;you look like you #8217;d love dick in your ass #8221; or  #8220;you seem like the submissive type #8221; *are* harmful, because they #8217;re one step away from victim blaming me for being a rape + sexual abuse survivor. Furthermore, people automatically assuming I love dick in my ass and being submissive has also meant that some people assume I must have wanted it or enjoyed it in the moment, when in reality it was very traumatising and I still don #8217;t feel comfortable bottoming today. So please try to be measured in your conversations before calling everyone whiny cunts, because that isn #8217;t helpful to anyone.</TEXT>

It #8217;s very easy for people who haven #8217;t been treated like shit their entire lives by their families to talk about how being gay isn #8217;t a core part of their identity. When you haven #8217;t had your family make such a huge fanfare (a negative one) out of it, I can imagine that #8217;s something you can say. Unfortunately, I #8217;m not in that boat. I #8217;m not hating on people who haven #8217;t experienced that and don #8217;t feel their sexuality is core to their identity, BUT it is very frustrating when people like that give me derision for not feeling the same way as them. It #8217;s part of what makes dating in a western country difficult if you #8217;re from a minority - I find there #8217;s a big cultural gap between myself and the Western, liberal gays. Now I #8217;ll just sit here and wait for someone to attack me for perpetuating a cultural gap or some shit like that  #128580;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I haven #8217;t been on a date in months and haven #8217;t had sex in over a year. Yes, I #8217;m sure I could find something casual, but that #8217;s not what I #8217;m looking for. I #8217;m looking for a relationship. I #8217;m 22 and I feel like I #8217;m doing all the right things. I finished uni last year and got excellent marks, went straight into a full time job interstate and am completely financially independent. I #8217;m very capable of being independent in other facets (eg cooking for myself, fixing things) and very mindful of my physical and mental health. I have a few extracurricular activities that I enjoy and a small group of friends that I associate it with frequently, though I get along with most people fairly easily. So why can #8217;t I find anyone? I #8217;m a little bit picky, but the people I swipe right on on dating apps are hardly the bees knees. Yes I don #8217;t like super skinny guys, but it #8217;s not like I #8217;m only looking for muscular guys. I have consistently reassessed what I like in a man and I don #8217;t think what I ask for is too insane: - not extremely skinny or extremely muscly. I like an average guy or stocky guy - not into blonde at all - must have some sort of trajectory in life - must be an empathetic person and educated on suffering around the world ... and that #8217;s about it. Yet on dating apps, I feel invisible. I rarely get matches. In real life I feel invisible too, it #8217;s like men don #8217;t find me attractive or interesting or worthwhile. I used to be so confident that I was somebody special but I don #8217;t have that anymore. When I was in my previous city, I never felt like it was this hard, now I #8217;ve moved and I feel like no one would even date me. What am I doing wrong? I know people are superficial, so I immediately jump on the  #8220;there must be something wrong with the way I look #8221; train. I see myself as moderately attractive, but maybe I #8217;m wrong. Yes, I #8217;m on the skinny side, but I #8217;m fit and lean; yes I #8217;m on the short side, but surely 175cm isn #8217;t considered *that* short? Am I really that repugnant? I just have no concept of why I can #8217;t find anyone to date at all. Am I unloveable? I used to feel like anyone and everyone could love me, but since moving to this new city, I #8217;m starting to feel like the only person who #8217;ll appreciate me for who and what I am is myself. Has anyone else had this experience/these feelings?</TEXT>

I don #8217;t agree with your statement that this is how most people my age are - that may be so in America (I #8217;m assuming that #8217;s where you #8217;re posting from), but most 22 year old (and I only just turned 22) Australians are still living at home and having their parents do a lot of things for them. Which is fine, but I also feel that it #8217;s ok to be happy about my own achievements and be upfront that I feel like I at least meet the mark in life.</TEXT>
