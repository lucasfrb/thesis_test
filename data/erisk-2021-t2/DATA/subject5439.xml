    <TEXT>I just some on fridays, i use the cigarettes as an enjoyment product. Cigarettes are manufactured completely by high speed machine. First the tobacco mixture is thrown in, then sprayed with chemistry and perfume. Then the paper is wrapped with the filter, then the cigarette goes into the packaging machine. 45 million cigarettes are produced per day at our site, but will be a smaller factory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, now I understand the question, the expensive cigarettes really only get the exact tobacco mixture, the so-called american blend. Among them are the more noble tobacco plants and a qualitatively better perfume. As far as cheap cigarettes are concerned, the Committee of Premium cigarettes is being consulted to some extent. This means that the cheap cigarettes can taste different, but as a consumer you do not notice that. In addition, the premium blends of course come with significantly higher marketing costs on top.

    <TEXT>Tobacco companies don't lose money over time, I can assure you there is almost no industry in the world that makes such a high profit margin. It depends on the country, there are factories that are not allowed to supply the Middle East. However, there are countries that are allowed to supply through free trade agreements, these send about 30 percent.</TEXT>
