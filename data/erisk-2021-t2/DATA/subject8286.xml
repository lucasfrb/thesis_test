    <TEXT>From a purely financial point of view it is cheaper and easier to go to the local community college. Credits are cheaper and as long as you don't need to pay rent your living expenses will also be lower. After 2 years you can transfer out to another school. The community college is a great way to get basic classes out of the way for any major cheaper. You might also determine that mechanical engineering isn't something you want to do after taking some basic classes. I changed my major twice in undergrad. Don't let the no friends part be a factor. You'll make friends in college. At the same time going away for school can have a lot of benefits. It helps make you an adult and having to take care of yourself - which I'm sure is not a problem for you in anyway. The scholarship is a huge bonus and it isn't that far away (I'm guessing 1:30-2 hour drive). The costs will be higher though and I'm sure that you will need to take out more loans than expected. It is also possible that you might dislike the school or your major and once there is it more difficult to change your path. I think that it is possible your parents cannot help you in a few years and are really looking out to try to prevent you from going too much into debt. Their attempt to push you toward community college might be because they're worried that the $25k isn't going to be there. In the end though I think it comes down to two choices: 1) Stay local, do basic classes, keep things on the cheap end, and transfer out. 2) Go to your 1st choice, take whatever they can give you (the school), and loan the rest for the remainder of college without worrying about any support from your parents. If you want to take the hit in the wallet, there are programs such as income based repayment which could be a must for all loans you take. I'm still in debt from grad school and I do not see anyway I will ever pay it off. From my experiences I would say keep it cheap as possible especially if you want to continue your education post-undergrad. Just make sure to transfer out after 2 years because the school has a huge impact on job/post-grad prospects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From the shows perspective it feels lazy and rushed. I believe that she didn #8217;t need to go above and beyond by burning the city and almost everyone in it, but I believe she did it for a reason. I think she burned it down because of what it represented: a old male dominated system of subjugating the kingdoms and lords to a single lord - something she fought against believing people should be free. She didn #8217;t need to, but I would like to think that to her it makes sense. Destroy it all. Don #8217;t let it be there. Don #8217;t rule from it as it is. She has been abused, lied to, and fought for everything. If we have anyone to blame it #8217;s really the writers for forcing it over letting it just happen. Could she have stopped? Yes. Should she have stopped? Probably. But overall I would be pissed, too. The person she loves she can #8217;t love and has a better claim than she does even if he doesn #8217;t want it. She lost two dragons. A lot of her men fought in the north without many thanks. She wanted support and everyone around her was either killed, betrayed her, or was plotting/lying to her. While it was rushed and a bit lazy, I can #8217;t help but feel that she did what made sense to her and you think those people would support her out of love or just fear and she #8217;ll be just like everyone else so her going mad makes more sense if you believe that she did it thinking that it #8217;s symbolic destroying the city is breaking the chains/wheel/circle or she did it to get the fear aspect done first with the forgiveness loving leader later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Upgrading to first class on flights during bad weather seasons. We were flying to Florida from philly in February and a massive snow storm hit. We were stuck on the plane for three hours before we got off until they could de-ice the plane again and get it ready to fly during a break in the storm. We got right back on the plane and waited again before finally getting out. Last flight out as well. Ive never been so happy that our 3+ hour flight delay was when we had upgraded seats and were comfortable during the delay. Few other flying upgrades that are totally worth it: Boise cancelling headphones and getting tsa precheck/global entry. Global entry is fantastic if you do any traveling outside the us (granted not every country/us airport has it but it #8217;s worth it). Some of my friends also use travel credit cards to get access to lounges while traveling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the same way sometimes. I don #8217;t get to play often but that doesn #8217;t stop me from buying new sets or singles or older cards to decks. I hope it #8217;ll make me happy when I get them but I don #8217;t know if it does. You #8217;re not alone. While I am not encouraging you to buy cards you shouldn #8217;t have fomo over them, consider them to be more like stocks while if you buy high the retune isn #8217;t there so you want to make smart purchases. A lot of people Speculate on cards, you just need to make the purchases smart. If you can reduce your spending to speculation of cheaper cards you might be able to avoid buying expensive cards and eventually you #8217;ll either start to sell what you have to make a profit or you #8217;ll tap out. I also do suggest seeking help. Therapy has done a lot for me as has seeing a psychiatrist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are totally right. It seems like the jumpstart cards aren #8217;t very good quality wise. Some say they can see a quality difference between cards made in North America and overseas (mostly japan). The Japanese cards, apparently, have better card stock and quality/clarity. Maybe they #8217;re having printer issues in Canada (I think that #8217;s where they #8217;re printing them?). Maybe they #8217;re rushing it. Maybe they just don #8217;t care.</TEXT>

I liked opening a few boxes and getting one, but the cards are also worthless from the sets. With the number of new sets coming out and the chase cards in them I think wotc found out that but making more sets with powerful reprints every month makes more money than a few special cards every three months.</TEXT>
