    <TITLE>Youtube has way too many 'colon' type of comments</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-13 16:21:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Example](https://i.imgur.com/sbJMtaC.png) I feel like I'm the only one who feels this way about these kinds of comments... It's like a bad fashion trend where people don't realize how ridiculous it is until they get a bit older. It has overtaken Youtube's comment sections like a plague, you'll find one in almost every video. I just end up not reading them because they're unoriginal. Anyways, I'll let myself out before people start making colon comments in this post lol.</TEXT>
