    <TEXT>Hello Starbounders of reddit. With the recent update I decided to try Starbound once again. I did a few missions, beat Erchius Crystal boss and got that O2 suit. Now my question is how does one obtain more of those for radioactive, hot or frozen planets?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Broforce</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-04 16:19:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>After learning about this page from my previous post I decided to make a request! **Why should you give it to me?:** Well there's no heartbreaking story behind this request. I just grew up watching these movies with all those steroid pumped, testosterone overloaded guys and was stunned by their awesomeness. Tell me, who wouldn't enjoy Rambo mowing enemies with an M60 machine gun at the age of 8? Yeah that's right, everyone loved them! **Why should you not give it to me?:** It's really easy! You don't know me, I don't know you! I could be a junkie who wants a game to sell to buy a pipe and some crack! I could be a psychotic murderer wanting to fulfill my bloodlust by blowing millions of baddies to pieces! Or I could just be a student living from mouth-to-hand or not. **Why don't I just buy it myself?:** I am an optimistic 16 years old bloke without a job, studying without income (except a little cash from my parents). I fancy Great Britain and am looking forward to a school trip in June when we'll travel there! Loving Judge Dredd comics, guns and military stuff (my dream is to own a Walther PPK, Glock-17 Gen-4 or a SIG P226). My Steam library might seem pretty big and it might seem I put a lot of money into it, but the answer is that most of the games were bought by a previous owner of that library (my brother who moved out of our flat like 2 years ago, got married, got his wife pregnant and just stopped playing games). Feel free to comment anything you want, i don't mind rude comments as I am not a very sensitive person. My Steam profile link: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044820357/ PS I hope that my profile picture on Steam won't scare you :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[GoG] Thank you kind sir /u/rtza for Broforce</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-03-30 14:38:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>This is my thank you post for my thread made some time ago http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2xx3l9/requeststeam_broforce/ I never really believed that someone would really gift me this amazing gift. I forgot about it after quite some time and today in Maths when I was bored as f*ck I took my phone out and turned the wi-fi on. There was 1 notification from BaconReader and I thought: Oh great! Someone replied to my comment about guns! But when I opened it and saw the code I was like what the hell. I then checked in which thread it was posted and my heart started beating so hard that i thought people would be able to hear it even downstairs. I started internally freaking out that someone would ninja that code and I will be sad and cry in the corner all night. But nope, the first thing i did when i got home was to fire up my PC and STeam and ctrl+c, ctrl+v it. I didn't even took my shoes off so i got yelled at for making muddy footsteps all over living room. The joy when i hit enter and that little Steam window didn't show me that the key is duplicated or anything. So my third thanks to you Mr. rtza. You and other people who gift games to people who can't really afford them are the best the gaming community can offer. People can call us murderers for playing GTA, but yet they don't call me an operator if I play ArmA. Confusing and dumb these deductions are, but who cares what non-gamers feel and think.</TEXT>

One game I remember playing ages ago is missing and I can't find it anywhere on the web.

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Euro Truck Simulator 2 Scandinavia DLC</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-28 18:37:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>**Why should you give it to me?:** There's no should in this as it's quite an expensive one. It's all up to you if you want to or not. Maybe we have something in common and that might encourage you to help a bro out. As for music I listen to almost anything. I prefer metal, rock though. I dislike rap, R'n'B, pop and all this Minaj Bieber 1D shit. My favourite authors are Alestorm, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Five Finger Death Punch, Avenged Sevenfold, Lynyrd Skynyrd, ACDC, Johnny Cash, Savant and Dope. **What do I play?:** **Mostly FPS such as:** Half-Life, Serious Sam, DOOM, Wolfenstein, Max Payne **Some(?) RPGs:** TES III: Morrowind, Modded Skyrim (Vanilla's meh), The Witcher, Diablo, Torchlight, Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Path of Exile, Mount  amp; Blade **A few strategies:** Civilization, Age of Empires, Wargame, Company of Heroes **Shittons of roguelikes:** http://i.imgur.com/XRLctMG.png **Tidbit online games:** War Thunder, Guild Wars 2, Team Fortress 2 **Why should you not give it to me?:** We don't know eachother (I reckon) so you have all rights not to believe me and ignore anything I write here. **Why don't I just buy it myself?:** I'm just a poor 17yo student with no job (maybe a summer job if it turns out right) and hence no real income to buy me some games. It was a sad thing, looking at all those sales during Steam Summer Sale and knowing that the only thing I bought was a game for 2 euros for which I had to sell my Glock (the game was worth all the money though, Sir, You Are Being Hunted. Awesome stealth game, pick it up if it goes on sale again). But know, if I had them monies I'd buy it myself and not request here. I already requested here and got my game and I am so grateful for that (thanks again /u/rtza). I had some money like 2 months ago, but that had to go because of the school trip to England from which I returned last Sunday and enjoyed it so much and I feel like it was the best trip I've ever had in my life and my next dream is to visit the fjords of Norway (another reason why I want to play this DLC) By this post I thank everyone who is contributing games to strangers and to all of those who read those posts and post nice comments. I welcome every kind of comments! [Steam Store page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/304212/) [Steam Profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/uoxb62n6/) PS I might plan some offers as well.

    <TITLE>[OFFER][STEAM] Indie Bundle leftovers</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-06-28 18:48:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, after all these months lurking here on GoG I finally got some games for you to fight for. I got these from a friend of mine who's bought a bundle and there were two games he already had and asked me to give it away to someone and I wanted to give it to a crush of mine but she stopped playing PC games and switched to full console peasantry (needless to say she ain't my crush anymore). Okay the games are Magicka and Tropico 4. I suggest playing Magicka with friends as it's a bloody (literally) fun with 4 friends for example. Lots of friendly fire and jokes, innuendos and easter eggs. Fun fun fun. As for Tropico. It's one of the best city building games I've ever played. You play as a dictator and you can play how you want. You can play as a militaristic dictator with army on every corner of your city. Plus it has an awesome themed soundtrack. **What you gotta do to win:** Post a comment saying: I hereby enter this raffle. That's all, simple eh? **For how long is it gonna run:** For 48 hours, so hurry up when you can! EDIT: The raffle is now ended! Thank you for participating and I hope the winners are gonna enjoy their new games! Winners: Magicka - MinatoHikari Tropico 4 - HarryHayes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A big thank you for /u/Surtur1313 that made a giveaway of three totally awesome games. I hesitated whether to choose Freedom Planet or Screencheat and I gotta say I wanted Screencheat because of one simple reason. My friend already has it and I thought it might be fun to play with him. But then I looked up what Freedom Planet was. It looked incredibly similar to Sonic games from Mega Drive. I loved every Sonic game (2006 was not a game and neither the last one I don't even remember its name) since my childhood and that made my final decision. I look forward to playing it and again thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Stardew Valley</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-26 16:57:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi there pardner! In just about an hour this amazingly beautiful game is going to be released. It's an indie project from this awesome chill guy /u/concernedape. I've been following this game since I first heard about it and had to wait for months because of all the delays but I wasn't angry, I knew that the game will only get better and better if it takes more time to finish it. I love farming. Whether in real life or in games. haven't got many chances to farm in real life apart from growing some tomatos behind my house. I've played through numerous farming games like Farming Simulator, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory and Wild Seasons. Sure, Harvest Moon games are amazing and pretty similar to Stardew Valley, but playing them on emulators often feels clunky and doesn't feel that nice. Some PC exclusive farming games I tried were usually mediocre and didn't meet my hopes i had for them. That's where SV steps in and combines the exclusivity of PC gaming and depth, cuteness and playabilty of HM. Unfortunately I am not able to afford the game because I am taking driving lessons (which is also super cool and I look forward to driving my own car!) What it basically is: it's a PC version of Harvest Moon. That means this is an incredibly relaxing game where you restore and take care of your inherited farm. You can plant and harvest crops, breed farm animals, breed slimes, fish, barter and even mine some stuff. You can also find loads of people scattered all around the game world and befriend them and with some of them you can even make it past some bases ;) The game is currently single-player only but will feature a 4 player coop in the future, so you can farm with or against your friends! Anyway, make sure you check this game out and support the dev and I thank you for reading through my request and I hope you'll like this game as much as i do. EDIT: Forgot to link [myself](http://steamcommunity.com/id/uoxb62n6) EDIT2: Wooooooooooooooooo! The game is out!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yo yo guys it's your boy gabe here to hug the amazing Ali-Sama. **What's the game about** Well, as the game title suggests it's about factories. You start as a pleb with nothing on a completely plain planet and your job is to make a bloody automatized super machine that feeds itself with fuel and spits out goodies. It's actually quite complex and it takes some time to get things right. However if you stay patient and learn your ways around all machines, you can *Make Unknown World Great Again!* **Why do I want it?** Mostly because I like sandbox games where I can do my own thing and destroy alien cultures with fumes coming from huge chimneys and also partly because the game is made by Czech developers which coincidentally is my nationality as well! It's still an early access but one hell of a one. It's packed with content and offers a map editor so you can create crazy ass worlds and it has full modding support. **Post scriptum** Thank you everyone for being such awesome human beings and helping gamers in need. You all deserve a hug, glass of milk and 2 cookies (maybe more if you ask nicely). Also visit those crafty factory bastards on their [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/) to see what they can come up with. Peace.

    <TITLE>[REQUEST][STEAM] Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-05 19:35:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>**INTRO** Hiyo there boys and boyettes. Summer's almost here, girls are starting to wear those denim shorts we all love and adore and pale guys are realizing how pale they really are. So after breaking my door and cutting my hand I decided I needed something to relax. Something where I can quietly but efficiently kill bad guys and say "the fuck is this" over Kojima's tangled storyline. **WOT IS** I suppose most of you guys already heard about The Phantom Pain (not the actual pain when you're feeling something that's not there anymore) or MGS but I will try to summarize it without any major spoilers. Metal Gear Solid claims to be Tactical Espionage Action aka stealth action game and it's one, if not the best of its genre. The genius behind its phenomenal plot and characters is Hideo Kojima. Great writer who got fucked in the ass by Konami big time. Fortunately he was able to leave Konami to form his own studio, hooray! You play as Snake, stealthy bastard who wakes up from coma and decide to kick ass. **WHY GIB** I'll be honest with you guys. I expected to play this baby only a few days after its release by pirating it, 'cos i felt like Konami doesn't deserve players' money for being a massive cunt in recent times. Unfortunately the game uses Denuvo and I was unable to play it. Then my good friend shared me the game via Family Sharing and I immediately fell in love with it like I did with all the previous MGS games. Unfortunately again, Family Sharing decided to kick me in the face and it somehow stopped working, neither me nor my friend knows wtf is up. So yeah, this is basically my last resort.

    <TITLE>[Request][Steam] N++ (NPLUSPLUS)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-26 16:59:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yo wassup boys and girls, glad you clicked this, man. So yesterday this little awesome game released after a year of being an exclusive to PS4. It's a sequel to a game called N+ which was a sequel itself to a flash game N. It is a challenging platformer with nice minimalist aesthetics. It features around 10k community made levels and I am sure more will come, that means almost unlimited playtime. I see it as a great substitute for Super Mario Maker on PC. I've been a fan of N since I first discovered it 2005-ish. I wasn't an avid gamer back then and enjoyed the casual pace of the game and appreciated the rising difficulty with each level. I didn't follow the game for quite some time after I finished it numerous times but around 2012 a friend of mine told me about a cool platformer with ninja. I thought he was talking about Ninja Gaiden or something like that, but when I arrived to his house he launched this game called N+ and I had a massive nostalgia trip back to my youth. N+ had much more levels and much nicer graphics than the previous game and the same as before, I spent countless hours finishing and replaying and beating my own times. Then a few years later in 2014 the studio Metanet Software announced they are releasing a brand new N game, N++. They also unfortunately announced that it's going to be a PS4 exclusive which I couldn't understand why, so I wrote an [email](http://i.imgur.com/Ot2P8AG.png), asking the devs if the game will ever release on PC. And now, after a year of silence after the release of PS4 version the game was finally released on Steam on 25th August 2016. As a fan, I couldn't believe my eyes and my day just got a whole lot better. So yeah. This is why I'd love to play this game. To once feel the nostalgia kick in and the urge to beat myself. Be sure to grab the game for yourself and your mates to see who's got the fastest ninja. [This](http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/n.html) is the original OG version. [The game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/) is currently 20% off and the deal lasts until the 1st September Cheers lads.

    <TITLE>Diablo 2: Is this normal behaviour in Windows 10?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-06 15:59:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So after being quite disappointed with the Diablo part of Blizzcon I decided to revisit Diablo 2. I installed it and LoD from the discs without any problems. Updated to 1.13c and installed PlugY and Ultimative. I can run the game fine with the glide wrapper and -w command but when I try to maxismise the game window, this [cheekiness](http://i.imgur.com/cbhnb4l.png) happens. Any ideas how to fix this? I don't want to come back to D3 as I know it won't be fixed any time soon, so I hope atleast this can be somehow fixed. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TF2 freezes when a titan kills me with melee</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-04-17 18:01:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Playing on PC] So, I just got the game and I've been enjoying it so far, but one thing bugs me quite a lot. I was playing my second match and an enemy titan killed me with its melee attack and the game froze with audio running completely fine in the background. So I restarted the game. In another match I was killed by melee again and again it froze. I would like to know if it is the game's fault and if so if it's fixable. Any advice will be appreciated, thank you. EDIT: After verifying the integrity the game froze once during normal gameplay with no melee at all and then once at the end of the match. It seems to be randomly freezing now. Temperatures and CPU load during playing are okay.</TEXT>

But it is possible to play at 1080p at 60 fps with only a decent PC, it's only a matter of how you setup the game, you have to fiddle with the settimgs until it feels good for you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Request][Steam] Serious Sam's Bogus Detour</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-20 15:00:16</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello gifters of all kinds and sizes! I've come to request a game from a series that is very near and dear to me. It is Serious Sam! I've been in love with the SS games since my father first brought a copy of The First Encounter on the CD back in 2002. I immediately knew the game is gonna be a total blast since it had a kickass cover with a big muscly Schwarzenegger-built dude wielding a humongous minigun in one hand fending off alien invaders. Once it got installed and my dad booted it up we were both stunned by the graphics and never before seen (for us) Egyptian setting which was done brilliantly and still holds up today as one of the best level designs of the FPS genre. It was atmospheric, action packed with amazing soundtrack and millions of fucktons of enemies to mow down with such a diverse arsenal that any 7 year old kid could ever dream of. I knew that this game is gonna stick with me and it is true. To this day I own every Serious Sam game and finished them at least five times each. But this had changed recently with the release of this new dope collab project where the devs of Hammerwatch created a twin stick Serious Sam shooter. As a kid I also learned that the team that created Serious Sam (Croteam) were from Croatia which made me realize that we Slavs create one of a kind games that are sometimes considered cult classics. My country (Czech Republic) is known for the Mafia, ARMA (and original Operation Flashpoint), Samorost and Euro Truck Simulator series. This newfound knowledge boosted my inner Slav and I am proud that we are such a big part of the gaming industry. So I ask you, please help me continue my childhood saga that's been with me for as long as I can remember. I would have bought it for myself, but money is tight since I had to move to the city because of the university. Cheers and thank you for reading!

I understand that some units cannot be used on some maps, but I can't seem to choose the units on maps that I should be able to. When I join a server, choose an army and when it gets to choosing a unit different than the default one, the option to join is greyed out. Do i have to meet some requirements? Level restriction?

You'll probably have to fiddle with the settings and try different rendering options before getting it to run fine. RPCS3 is still far from being playable on most PCs, but it's been making mile long steps lately, so we might see MGS4 emulated earlier than previously thought!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi my dudes, tried LAN coop with my friend today and everything is working fine, but one thing that isn't exactly working is the sound. I can hear gunshots, impact sounds, player sounds without any problem, but my friend can't hear some of them. He says when shooting for example a shotgun, he can hear every third shot or so. We tried different engines (DarkPlaces, Quakspasm, WinQuake), still no bueno. It shouldn't be a ping problem either as it is LAN.

I #8217;ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I #8217;ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

    <TEXT>I look forward to trying it out. I think it's unfair to judge the game to be garbage now since only a few of us here got their hands on it. If it replicates the gameplay of MGSV in a zombie-apocalyptic environment, then it could be a new fresh take on the gameplay. Surely nobody will count it as a proper MG game. I myself don't like the usage of Metal Gear as its title, but understand that creating a whole new IP for a game that would be based on MGSV wouldn't make much sense. Given Konami's recent reputation they don't want to take risks.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Game is unplayable after last 2 updates</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-10 15:34:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello, I just need to let all this out. I bought the game about a month or so ago and the game was working fine, occasional freezes but nothing that would make the game unplayable in a long term. However, after the last two major updates, I can pretty much play only 2/10 games properly. Other times the game will either not load at all and get stuck on loading screen after finding a match, other times it will crash during the game randomly. Loading takes considerably longer than before the update and please spare me comments about how my PC is not powerful enough, most games running on UE4 load almost instantly and are much more stable. I have a feeling that the first and foremost thing in early access should be making the game work for all players. I appreciate the effort the devs have been putting in the game those last months, but please focus on optimization and stability before planning an ESL tournament, implementing crate and key system and stuff like that. I've tried everything from turning all the settings down to the lowest, tried launch parameters from all sorts of performance guides, tried high priority in task manager, new updates, but still no bueno.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it did. But it was in 2012 when the game was announced/debuted under the name The Phantom Pain without the Metal Gear Solid brand and said to be made by Moby Dick Studio led by Joakim. It was later revealed that Kojima=Joakim and his team were behind the game and the speculations that the game is the next MGS were proven right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This will always be my favourite episode and one of the few to make a man tear up. Shows different sides of many characters. Charles staying humble even after being called Ebenezer, confronting and understanding the housefather. BJ saving the lost cause to ease the pain of the loss for the family. Pierce not fighting for the man's life 'til the very end. Although a sad episode, I can't imagine Christmas without watching it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good morning 4077! After reading a bit more about MASH, I found out that you US guys have laugh tracks in the show. I am from the Czech Republic and we have completely dubbed over version with 0 laugh tracks which make the show a lot different and I think I actually prefer it that way as it makes MASH more believable and serious. The dubbing is still considered as one of the best out here (with The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and Friends). Sadly it's mostly not the case anymore and that makes me appreciate "our" MASH even more! Of course, there are many jokes and lines that lost their meaning in translation and sometimes they are either translated literally or being bypassed by a clever substitute. So are there any significant changes to the show in your country, if yes, how do you feel about them? EDIT: Goddamn asterisks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Entering for Brigador I love the aesthetics of the game and the soundtrack is just amazing to listen to while doing a genocide of a whole town in mechs bigger than houses. As for farming, you should check out the Kratky growing method if you don't know it already. Some say it's against the rules of nature, I think it's a fun new way to grow your veggies. Basically you don't use soil to grow the seeds but rather let them sit in a cup above water and let their roots grow for the water with nutrients. Check out [this guy's](https://youtu.be/4Mqg8Af5U8A) video for a funny but a bit creepy insight into this method. [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/OGbakon)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The movie's got a lot of interesting colour choices. Some scenes are very vibrant and saturated while other ones are very bland with little saturation and are nearly monochrome. It also deals with the problems of the child soldiers themselves. Drug usage, abuse and loss of friends and how the situation makes them distance from their humanity. It's pretty heavy when you realize shit like this happened/happens/will happen in under-developed countries.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Battalion 1944 - FPS inspired by COD2 and Promod runs quite nicely on older HW. But beware early access.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-05 10:27:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>[Battalion 1944 - Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/489940/BATTALION_1944/) First of all I would like to explain the mixed rating. The game had a rocky start due to overloaded servers due to large amount of players playing. This made the game unplayable for about a day or so. I'll leave this up to you to decide whether it is justified by the devs being indie and the game being in alpha stage or not. The game is as I said, heavily inspired by Call of Duty 2 which I think everyone holds dear memories of rifle only servers and such shenanigans. This game aims to reproduce that in a modern way. There are three types of matchmaking, Wartide - 5v5, basically defuse from CS. Then Arcade - also 5v5, but with more COD traditional gamemodes such as TDM, CTF, S amp;D. Those gain you exp after each match and when you level up, you earn a lootbox. Then there are of course dedicated servers that give you absolute freedom in settings. Their player limit can be raised from 10 players up to 64, weapons can be limited, time limit adjusted. This, personally, is the main reason for purchasing this game. But then again, take into account that this is an early access title and the game contains cosmetic lootboxes What I wanted to present primarily was the surprisingly good performance on my Lenovo Thinkpad T430 with a 2.6GHz i5, Intel HD 4000, 4GB RAM and an SSD. The game runs on UE4, which personally, has always been a nightmare for me. But here the performance is quite solid, the FPS counter jumps around 30-40 FPS which may not be ideal, but is playable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to disable touchpad delay in Windows 10 on a T430?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-02 10:56:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello everyone, Today I noticed a pretty annoying "feature" in Windows that hinders my ability to work at my pace that I am used to from other computers and OS. When I make any keystroke it temporarily, for a few milliseconds, disables both the touchpad tapping, left and right touchpad buttons and even Trackpoint buttons. I read that it might be in the Synaptics settings under [advanced mouse settings](https://i.imgur.com/ojR14oT.png), but all I found there was an option called PalmCheck and when I [turned it all down](https://i.imgur.com/yzZJzUg.png), it still didn't fix the issue. So I am fairly certain this is a Window issue as even uninstalling Synaptics drivers didn't fix it. Does anybody have any tips? Sadly I cannot completely replace Windows with say Linux as my school uses software exclusive to Windows and it either doesn't run under Wine or is a bitch to use thereafter. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don't own any of the games, but played TWoM briefly and liked the atmosphere. Eerily real. My favourite thing about Diablo I is that people are confused with Diablo II and think the cow level is in the original game as well and I know about like 6 people that spent ridiculous amount of time clicking the cows to get there. My fav studio will have to be Blizzard. Even with their recent fuckups, I still can't deny that I had thousands of hours worth of fun with their games. Their games are usually polished with brilliant gameplay and amazing storytelling. [Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OGbakon/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the thing is that we usually tend to "go all out" (read get shitfaced) during these younger teenage years and basically just test the waters and enjoy ourselves. When we get older we drink less and less until we reach a point in our lives when we just drink socially at events. Birthdays, weddings, zabija #269;ky, pivn #237; slavnosti, vinobran #237;/bur #269; #225;kovky and almost every other cultural event isn't complete without casual shots of slivovice.

    <TEXT>Asymmetry in architecture is unusual. Most buildings are designed in a traditional style and shape which puts functionality before looks and tend to blend with other samey looking buildings.

After that comment /u/oOoChromeoOo replied by saying they achieved something unnatural for their dog through hard work and determination, because /u/mockitt didn't specify they meant undomesticated animals. This should be enough for you to understand what I meant. If not, I'm sorry but I don't have that much time to dissect every part of this comment thread for you.</TEXT>

But why do others use it? Aside from convenience, only the advantage of getting higher refresh rates for dirt cheap/free comes to mind. As many people are still getting rid of their old CRT screens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've seen someone recommend JoeQuake  gt;I would give JoeQuake a shot, it #8217;s considered valid for speed runs and probably works better on modern systems  gt;http://quake.speeddemosarchive.com/quake/rules.html  gt;JoeQuake you can use the following console command: show_stats 1 Print actual statistics (time, secrets, kills) to the upper right corner of the screen, 1 by default. Values: 0 - off, 1 - only time, 2 - time + kills + secrets, 3 - only time, but only on if some reasonable event happens, 4 - same as 3, plus kills + secrets too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Extract the mod to its own folder in Quake's installation folder. Then just create a shortcut of your preferred Quake sourceport and add the "-game aopfm_v2" (without the quotation marks) parameter to the shortcut's target in its properties. PS If you extracted the mod in a differently named folder, make sure to use that folder's name in the target text field instead of aopfm_v2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Simple fix! Add a space after Winquake.exe, so it looks like this: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Quake\\Winquake.exe -game aopfm\_v2' My bad, I should've clarified. And for the convenience either just rename the folder to aopfm_v2 or replace that -game parameter with Abyss of Pandemonium, so it becomes this: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Quake\\Winquake.exe -game Abyss of Pandemonium' It's up to you which one of these will be more convenient for you and bottom line is, either one will work. And also just a little advice, if you plan on playing more custom maps/episodes try out a different sourceport, because some of the maps may require you to use a sourceport with raised limits for some stuff that vanilla Quake just won't deal with. I recommend Quakespasm (or Quakespasm spiked if you'd find some of the features/bugs in original Quakespasm annoying) for pretty much streamlined vanilla Quake experience for modern systems. And if you wanted to spice things up by adding some modern graphical flair to it, try out Darkplaces and fiddle around with its settings to make the game look exactly as you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point of a game soundtrack isn't to have something playing in the background for the sole purpose of eliminating silence and filling the gaps in-between sound effects. Game soundtracks are (usually) carefully picked to go with the gameplay flow. Yes, you can play any Spotify playlist over any game, but would you listen to Taylor Swift while playing THPS or Slipknot while playing Animal Crossing? Everyone appreciates a good soundtrack in a game and at the same time most people criticize a bad soundtrack or the lack of one. Anyway, why sacrifice one for the other? You can have both good gameplay, graphics and whatnot while maintaining a good and fitting soundtrack. You're thinking in a narrow way where either one or the other should matter.</TEXT>

Controls are stiff, combat is barebones and sound design is awful (obnoxiously loud assassination sound, constant beeping during alert phase) and some of the voices are very low quality and compressed. I'm currently replaying it and while enjoyable, 13 years of age definitely make a huge difference.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How to connect a PC/laptop with VGA output to an old CRT TV with SCART.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-03 17:30:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I built myself a a computer from scrap parts and it works nicely with a monitor. However, I needed to move it to my other place where I only have an old CRT TV that only has a SCART input and I got myself a male VGA to female RCA cable and a male CINCH to SCART cable, but when I hook all this monstrosity together the TV isn't displaying anything when switched into the AV mode. So my question is whether I need to get me one of these little VGA to AV convertor boxes to make the TV output the computer video signal or just try to find a TV that has normal RCA input? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's your perception of the AC identity. Games evolve and so do their "identities", you can't keep doing the same thing over and over to satisfy the "true, OG fans". Ubisoft made their games this way to appeal to a larger crowd, which wasn't a popular thing to do, but it's their choice. They make the games, they make the identities and whichever route they will take with the AC series will be the right one. I, too, am getting tired of all the same bullshit posts whining about true AC games. Every single one of the games is true AC game, be it Odyssey, Black Flag or AC1. Either move on and accept the fact or stay in denial, whatever, but just stop with this gatekeeping shit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you remember COD2? It certainly wasn't behind Medal of Honor and I remember it being one of the biggest multiplayer games, for years. Even in eSports. My point is that the jump from COD2 (3 if you wanna count it for the sake of numbering) to Modern Warfare was sudden and changed a whole lot. While AC has been changing gradually with every new release. It wasn't a sudden change of direction, you know. If we talked about the transition from Prince of Persia to AC then yes, that was a big change that ultimately killed PoP. But I don't think that's the route AC will go down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the situation here is complicated, as the older folk generally dislike it (my old man is a hardcore patriot and hates it). Younger people seem indifferent as to what is used, but as is natural there are some oddities who seem like they would defend our country from the evil of Czechia until their dying breath. I don't particularly love it, but I realize its significance. Many people call the country Czech and that's wrong and I get that they don't want to say the Czech Republic every time they want to mention our country. Czechia is therefore a nice compromise in this regard. It also follows our Slovak brothers because they also aren't usually called by the long Slovak Republic but rather Slovakia for short.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; it was likely, as in most cases, a time and budget thing. That's my point of view as well. But apart from this RPG voice actor syndrome Odyssey's sound design really surprised me with its quality. The ambient environmental sound when standing in an empty field, on a beach or on a town square are phenomenal and convey the immersion in the environment really well. Another example of pleasing sounds is the jingle and chiming of lootable items while using the Revelation skill. The world is just too huge to have a proportional number of unique voice actors for minor NPCs. And it was to be expected, ever since AC1 we've had to witness NPCs repeat the same lines every time we passed by them.</TEXT>

Many of those use the first version of the themes as a basis and work on top of that. In Odyssey it is overused and I get how someone could get tired of it but that doesn't mean it doesn't fit as the series' theme. Like it or not, that's how it has evolved.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure there is a difference but at this point the AC series is 13 years old and if you look at other game series that have gone on for that long you'll see similar changes that make the game into something completely different than what it started out as. Call of Duty went from a fairly realistic Saving Private Ryan style narrative over a blockbuster story to a futuristic almost sci-fi setting. Rainbow Six went from a tactical squad-based shooter to an angle watching "CS clone" with hero abilities. Need for Speed's change from supercars of the early entries to a tuner based night-time racing was a huge jump but universally acclaimed. I just wish the diehard fans of old AC understood that games just can't do the same thing over and over again. There comes a point in a series' lifetime when a change is required or it will just go down as a same game again and again only with a different polish but with the same old outdated mechanics.</TEXT>

Best case scenario for them is that people will, indeed, not notice and they can carry on. In the worse scenario they'll be forced to take action after being exposed which will ultimately lead to a better end-user experience. So while yes, it is a shame that the game is in the state that it is in, it is at least a little comforting to know that something is being done.</TEXT>

You're obviously knowledgeable on the topic of Aaron Kyro and Scientology, there's no denying that but the bottom line with the guy is that his videos will teach you something as they are okay tutorials. Anyone who won't spend that much time and research like you likely won't even know anything else but that he's quite an annoying person who knows how to kickflip and you can learn to kickflip by watching him and trying it yourself. It's cool that you want to warn people about Scientologists, but don't push your obsessions onto others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay buddy, now I see that reading comprehension is not your strong suit. I'll just briefly comment on what you got wrong and you can go on with your oh so entertaining Sunday rants, mkay? If you were only interested you would not spend half the time shoving your opinions down the throats of people of who only want to learn how to skate. We're a new skaters community and like I said, you want to show that he is a well-connected Scientologist? Go on, but you can piss off with flooding this whole comment section with your shit. There are other places where you can happily do that. He is not my favourite skater or YouTuber. I have better sources for skateboarding knowledge. I didn't compare you to their heinous crimes anywhere in my original comment, did I? Perhaps it is not me who is delusional. I just stated that the way you're desperately replying to every comment here is about the same level of obnoxiousness as Scientology being promoted. And just so you understand, I am disgusted by Scientology and cults like them and I have nothing but disdain for them. You decided to take my comment personally, started cursing and drawing untrue conclusions but that's your battle to fight. Bye</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the popularity of Tetris for the last 2 decades has been mostly consistent (albeit having moved away from its prominent mainstream position it gained when it released for the original GameBoy) with some recent spikes around the release of Effect and 99. But it's still one of the most popular puzzle videogames.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course it gets boring after a while. You're playing only one map out of the total of 19(?). A seasoned THPS player will speed through all of them in no time so it's no wonder that one level will keep you entertained for 15 minutes max - that's what it is for. The lighting is part of the graphics, just check how beautiful Venice looks in the trailers. The guys made real effort in giving those games a new coat of paint and damn did they deliver.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I decided to play this as a nostalgic throwback to the old PS1 version that I last played some 15 years ago but I can't even pass the first level! It seems like however I press the prompts (just before the button, right after it or even spot on it) it doesn't give me points and just lowers my score. I sometimes manage to score a few points and think that I'm getting the hang of it but then I try to so it just the same and I lose points. I'm generally pretty good at rhythm-based games so I wouldn't think that my rhythm is so off that I'm not even able to finish the first level which is basically a tutorial stage. So, my question is, is the game THAT hard or is there some trick to it to make it register better?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alright, tried hooking it up to my Hi-fi and the sound was much more clearer and it was easier to follow the beat and sound cues and pair them with my input. Then I guess I'll play with headphones on so I retain some of that portability from the PSP. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you just need to develop your own timing independent of the running bar up top. Which is an unexpected learning curve.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Food used to be flavorful 100 years ago, many types of seasonings existed, even hundreds of years before that. There's a great channel on YouTube demonstrating cooking of various foods and dishes from the 18th and 19th century called [ Townsends](https://www.youtube.com/user/jastownsendandson). It made me realize that tasty, aromatic or seasoned food is not that modern a concept.</TEXT>
