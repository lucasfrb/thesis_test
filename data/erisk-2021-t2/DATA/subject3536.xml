    <TEXT>So, haven #8217;t found anything related to the Swisslinx football matches. But since there is already 3 of us, we might just give it a try and possibly will find someone to play against. As it is still summer, I think outdoor would be better for now. What are your preferred locations in ZH? I am in Kreis 4, and there are few places around that would be ok (however no grass fields) to play on and possibly meeting other teams to play against. Let me know and we will make this work. EDIT: So, now there is 4 of us to start with, DM me your time preference please and let #8217;s do this! Thanks and really can #8217;t wait to play some finally.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Do you use cardinal directions when describing a direction/navigating?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-10 16:05:45</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, obvious not a native speaker to begin with. I realized how in US, cardinal directions seem to be more widespread than in Europe. Do you use cardinal directions in your everyday vocabulary? Does everyone understand these and can navigate itself with them? Sincerely yours, no idea where South is right now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hope this doesn #8217;t sound too dumb, but S-N direction would be a street and E-W would be an avenue? That would explain the situation when I was in the US and there would be streets and avenues with same name! TIL?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I sure do know that, it just might take some time to figure it out. My question was more related to Americans being able to say straight away where S, E, N, W is without a need to even think about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well, I am in Europe. And as such, I don #8217;t have to think about it since there have been very few instances in my life when this would be necessary. Simple as that.

    <TEXT>When on the road I use cities to navigate together with exit numbers. If giving directions it is left, right, straight, landmarks, public transport stops and such. Part of my curiosity was, if you can always determine where S,E,N,W even when in a place where you have never been?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That is actually a really cool and useful knowledge/sense. This thread has inspired me to look deeper into this and possibly learn to orientate myself with cardinal directions. Thanks for the insight.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Slovak living abroad here. I have left parents #8217; place and Slovakia at 19. Apart from 2 years, I have been abroad ever since. The problem is that everybody needs a Permanent residence address(I think this is still valid since the communism). The law is completely dumb as you either need to own your own apartment/house or find a landlord that is willing to give you the Permanent residence if he/she is renting it to you. So even I am gone from home for last 14 years, my permanent residence is still at my parents. And I am sure that I am not alone!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, it has several points to consider: 1. Based on the Residency, cities and towns are getting their taxes payed from the government used for infrastructure builds and repairs. This is a problem especially for my hometown of Bratislava. Since it is a capital, meaning universities, bigger employers and such, there is plenty of people that have moved there whilst still maintaining Residence in their hometowns. This leads to a situation where the city has population officially around 450k, but unofficially it can be up to 700-800k, but the city only gets taxes from 450k and as such suffers from lack of funding. 2. The landlords are not obliged to give you residency in their property. Many won #8217;t do it, afaik it creates a problem when eviction comes to a place. Also the process of obtaining residency from landlord hasn #8217;t changed in decades. Tenant and landlord will have to go personally to the bureau with a document saying that the landlord is the owner of the property and agrees to give you the permanent residency there. Afterwards the tenant needs to get a new ID as our IDs always have an address of permanent residency on them. As people pointed out, nothing really changes for you if you don #8217;t change your residency, there are no fines or anything, so no one cares to change it. But as you can see in 1. it is problematic for the cities to maintain infrastructure used by hundreds of thousands more than they are getting payed on. Hope this helped, I am sure I have forgot a few points but hopefully someone might add them.</TEXT>
