    <TEXT>Played 200 in old money (so 400 now) but you'd need a lot of space for 2000 or it'd be a complete bump-fest. Also your probably better running bar ships with few upgrades or I suspect you'd either miss loads of effects of just spend most of the game reading cards rather than actually playing. Perhaps run them in 400 point waves? With each wave flying in from your side after say 5 turns? Might give you both more space to fly and make the game more manageable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can now buy the first wave of 2.0 ships. I'd not recommend buying loads of 1.0 then converting it as such isn't getting replaced so you'll be paying for conversion stuff you can't use. Also 2.0 models are of better quality than 1.0 so slowly building up on just 2.0 would be better imo (that's what I'd do if starting now). In 2.0 you also get quick build cards with a lookout and set upgrades that use a notional threat level rather than point based squad building. Play using these first to get an idea about what upgrades suit your play style. Once you've got a real handle in the hand mechanics give full squad building a go but playing the lists will teach you far more than planning. Mixing factions isn't permissible even in casual play. The xwing wiki is really useful for info, rules clarifications, build ideas... The people on their are really helpful http://xwing-miniatures-second-edition.wikia.com/wiki/X-Wing_Miniatures:_Second_Edition_Wiki</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've considered it but don't think I will, currently still really enjoying making new stuff fit and going back to blank and knowing the hours and hours of sewing ahead. The Ward XVI patch is actually a larger circle patch (fucking circles, worst shape possible) so I tried cutting out just the band name and was quite happy with the result so can see me doing that for a few more before I'm resigned to this one being full. Maybe I'll never think it's full and just keep layering up.</TEXT>

I am eyeing up a different Ghost patch though so would need to find something to replace Opus Eponymous if I got it, don't have any bands on twice. Plenty not on the first patch I had though.

Take the time to keep pockets working as they're useful as fuck. Steal ideas from other kuttes you see, use this sub, Tshirt Slayer, ones you see in the wild for inspiration.

    <TEXT>There's the fairground, strongman competition and loads of stalls to mooch around. Do you like rock music? If so bands like The Wildhearts, The Lazys, Blind River, Scorpions, Jailbirds could be worth a watch for ya. Sophie Sparham on the Jager stage is spoken word. There's films each evening in the Hobgoblin New Blood stage (Thursday - Wayne's World 2  amp; Bill  amp; Ted's Bogus Journey, Friday - Conan, Saturday - From Dusk Til Dawn). If you've got access to the VIP bar there's other bands (including Slay Duggee who play children's TV themes in a metal style) on in there and stuff, check the Bloodstock VIP Facebook page for info. In the middle of the night there's the (unofficial) annual bin jousting contests near the Midgard campsite.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Constant Fortress Error, Any Advice?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-12 19:03:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>FIXED Recently I changed phones so have my old one (Huawei P10) to my daughter so she could play Wizards Unite. She's been using it a couple of weeks but she now can't enter any fortress chambers. She's done the fortress tutorial worst and completed Ruins 1 previously but now after selecting either Ruins 1 or 2 she gets an error stating there's no data or WiFi signal and is forced to restart the app. Weirdly when she goes into the fortress Harry still says the little flavor text explaining what fortresses are despite her already doing the tutorial. Phone worked fine for me since game launch (other than the few glitches that exist for everyone). Have tried both on Data and WiFi, multiple fortresses and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. All her settings in game match the same as on my phone. Any advice? Can't really play the game without fortresses. EDIT: Fixed - Contacting Support and going through on Chat fixed the problem (not filling a bug report). They said they needed to make a change to the account.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really can't see a change in learning currency coming because you'd still need green and red books of you started playing recently. Do new players just not get to progress the old lessons? Can't see higher level runestones becoming a thing but higher level fortresses are surely likely. Both though would mean earning CXP too quickly and that's already capped at level 150(ish? Something like that, I'm only ~80). Also wouldn't surprise me if the new lesson plans come out at the start of the new school year in September.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Disagree that being able to change would add extra strategy, all you'd do is pick Professor for a werewolf, switch to Auror for the death eater, back to Professor for the pixie etc... Plus if you can just pick to be whatever suits you get all the benefits without any drawbacks. Might as well scrap the professions altogether and just have one skill tree.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So do brilliant events stick to green books and get ignored by legacy players? Do they spilt events between both making new players take longer to catch up? Second lesson plans will obviously take a LOT more scrolls, because the balance is skewed. The only way I could see another book type working is if there's a scroll to book conversion mechanic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All the schools round here are dead zones so nothing spawns either in them or in the roads nearest them. The leisure centre is a Sports  amp; Games area. Parks the same as yours, either Magizoology or Care of Magicao Creatures (most seem to be CoMC). The town centre here is a big Dark Arts area and that's where I work which is my I maxed DA and completed gold prestige on the first DA page months ago. The weirdest flagged area I've seen is a road that runs next to the river is Legends of Hogwarts, and I mean literally the road itself not the area around it.</TEXT>

Had got to the bit where you go to the Northern Cave and I figured that'd probablybe the best place to try levelling up a bit before trying to fight Sephiroth but accidently went too far and fought and beat him. My level wasn't much higher than 50ish. Was many years later before I could beat Ruby and Emerald though and I've never played a specific save enough to master KOTR, would rather just play through again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got pages at all four levels and place every image as soon as I can. The fragments aren't lost they're converted in to Family XP (and now Ministry Manuals) and you can place them repeatedly, hell I placed McGonagall twice earlier today thanks to the Trace Charm). The only exception I make is community days that focus on one page. If I'm really close to being able to prestige the page then I'll hold off to try and bump up levels but for standard catches that feels futile.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got mine cheap on eBay, had always planned on covering it so much so can barely see the denim anyway so colour/style was irrelevant. There's certainly no rules but worth thinking about if your prefer the look of light blue, dark blue, black, something else... Imo it's not worth spending loads on a specific style as you're covering it up anyway. Also, Lovebites are fucking class.</TEXT>
