    <TITLE>Is this depersonalisation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-16 12:54:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey, I #8217;m new to this... I know you can #8217;t give me a diagnosis or anything, but I #8217;d really like some advice on whether you think that what I #8217;m experiencing is depersonalisation. I am seeing a counsellor at the moment, and she used the word disassociation to describe the little I #8217;ve told her about this, but I #8217;ve been a bit too scared to tell her more about this and to explore this further. So basically within the last couple of months, I had two periods of time (~ a week each) when I was feeling really detached from my body. Both times were related to being in very stressful, overwhelming environments. I didn #8217;t feel as if I was outside my body, more as if I was sitting somewhere deep inside my body and couldn #8217;t really feel any of the outsides. I was still like semi functional, but I felt like I was kind of sleep walking and was struggling to react to what was happening around me, or even felt like I was walking around but couldn #8217;t really feel my feet so was like stumbling over stuff. It felt like my brain just kind of shut down a bit and I couldn #8217;t really form any clear thoughts or concentrate on anything. As far as I understand you can experience episodes of DPDR at times without it being a disorder. But do you think that being in situations where you experience this repeatedly increases your risk of developing a disorder? Because after these two periods of time, I think I #8217;ve felt like this more often, but for shorter amounts of time. I can kind of drop out of it sometimes by scratching my legs really hard or clenching my fists. But I #8217;m not quite sure if that #8217;s a new thing, or if lately I #8217;ve just become more sensitive to that feeling...</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-03-23 09:57:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>It #8217;s weird because I feel like somewhere along the lines I must have developed other coping strategies or else I would have started cutting earlier on in my life - but somehow some of the stuff that happened a couple months ago must have completely overwhelmed those strategies. Anyway, I #8217;m three days clean right now. It #8217;s been fine up until this morning, but hopefully I can keep going. For the first time since I started, I actually feel determined to stop, so wish me luck. Socially distanced hugs to all you amazing people out there. You got this! Xx</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Who can give you a diagnosis?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-29 20:39:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve started seeing a counsellor lately, and she seems to think I have ptsd. Can a counsellor give you a diagnosis, or do you need to see a psychiatrist? I told my GP about my symptoms a while ago but she belittled the whole thing and tried to put me on anxiety pills which don #8217;t really work for me. I #8217;m in the UK in case that #8217;s important. I started reading about ptsd after my counsellor said that and suddenly everything I #8217;ve felt these past couple of months is starting to make sense. But I still have this feeling of not being valid, and guilt because other people are having it way worse than me. So I think getting a diagnosis would really help me take my own feelings seriously if you know what I mean...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Loss of agency/trust in self?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-02 10:13:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>I can feel that people don #8217;t trust me around sharp objects anymore... and I know they #8217;re right not to, and the fact that my friends are not letting me get in situations where I could, for example, take a razor from the bathroom or something, it does actually really help me because the thought is always there. I asked my friends to do exactly that, so they #8217;re just being amazingly supportive here, but it still doesn #8217;t feel good not to have agency over this part of my life. I guess I can #8217;t really trust myself at the moment when it comes to sharp objects. I #8217;ve been clean for two weeks but there #8217;s definitely been times when I would have self harmed if I #8217;d had my usual tools. I #8217;m telling myself that i have agency in all other parts of my life, and that i can trust myself when it comes to literally anything else but it still sucks. I don #8217;t want this to make me feel like I am less of an independent person, or like I can #8217;t make good decisions anymore. I don #8217;t know, just venting I think, and wondering if anyone feels the same. (And please don #8217;t get me wrong, I #8217;m immensely grateful to my friends!)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! To be honest, I know that even though I #8217;ve taken those steps, there #8217;s still ways I could hurt myself in this flat and there always will be. To be honest, my brain has it all mapped out. But it involves slightly more thinking about it and right now, fortunately, that #8217;s an extra barrier. Honestly I #8217;m just really scared of what it would mean to relapse now. I think the way the situation is right now, with my friends watching out for me and all, it #8217;s never going to get any easier to stop than now, so if I don #8217;t manage now, I wouldn #8217;t really know what to do...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Confusion</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-04 23:39:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey hey, posting here for the first time  #9786; #65039; I guess I #8217;m maybe a bit confused and was just wondering if any of you could relate to this. I think I #8217;m sexually attracted to people a lot less often than my friends, and at times I #8217;ve found myself pretending I was, and making myself sleep with people because I felt like that was the normal thing to do. But I have definitely experienced sexual attraction before. Most of the time however the people I have felt attracted to are not people I #8217;d want to be with, and the attraction is very short-lived and I don #8217;t really want to act on it. On the other hand, I #8217;ve met people that I #8217;ve been interested in romantically but not sexually. There #8217;s this guy for example who I #8217;ve known for a couple months now, and I like him a lot, and I could really imagine starting something with him, but I don #8217;t think I particularly want to sleep with him. I feel pretty neutral about it, and I don #8217;t think I would mind if it #8217;s important to him. But I don #8217;t really know how I #8217;d ever go about communicating this, or whether I #8217;d have to. On the other hand, my last relationship was with someone who is a very sexual person, and it got really weird because sleeping with them just didn #8217;t feel right, even though I was romantically attracted to them. I think it maybe was because it was my first time sleeping with someone of my own gender and I felt like I didn #8217;t really know what to do. And i guess I didn #8217;t really feel like doing it so it didn #8217;t come naturally, which just made things awkward. It sounds really bad, but when I #8217;ve slept with men, I kind of just know what to do, and my previous partners have been quite happy with me just letting them do their thing and me participating semi-enthusiastically (which, thinking about it, should have been a red flag). Every time someone has wanted me to take a more active role during sex, it has made me feel really uncomfortable. I don #8217;t know, and I #8217;m sorry to be spamming your page with my brain dump. I don #8217;t know if I #8217;m just not really into sex most of the time, or if I #8217;ve just not met a person that I #8217;m both romantically and sexually attracted to, or if I #8217;m just awkward in bed. I wonder if any of you can relate to the disparity between romantic and sexual attraction, or maybe I #8217;m completely in the wrong place here. Do you think it makes sense to start a relationship with someone who you #8217;re not sexually attracted to, even though you know that there are some people on this planet that you might be sexually attracted to? And how would you approach such a relationship? Basically, I #8217;m just really worried that if i start something with the person I #8217;ve been seeing (nothing can happen right now because of lockdown anyway) that it will end the same way as my last relationship.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey! Obviously I don #8217;t know very much about your situation, so what I #8217;m saying could just as well be counterproductive or something that you are not able to do - but if your anger is related to the current political situation, maybe getting involved in some form of activism might help to address that anger, and you might be able to use it to energise you. Obviously activism in itself can be really hard and at times traumatising, but there are so many different ways to get involved, some of which might be more suitable for you than others. I #8217;ve only realised recently that what happened to me in the past was not my fault, but that there were people who did stuff that was not okay. That realisation has come with a lot of anger about the situation and about these people and I am still figuring out how to deal with that. But I think for now, I #8217;m actually finding it really important to allow myself to feel that anger.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>To all the PE teachers out there</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-27 22:16:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>To all the PE teachers out there - I was never sporty in school, was the person people didn #8217;t want on their team, picked on by PE teachers etc. So obviously, I started hating exercise at some point. But I had this one PE teacher when I was about 16 who went on runs with us, and I loved it. I wasn #8217;t nearly as fast as some of the people who were on sports teams or stuff like that, but more importantly, I actually, genuinely enjoyed it and she must have realised. She really encouraged me to keep running, and I did all throughout my last year of high school. For the last nine months, I #8217;ve been struggling with my mental health, things were just getting worse and worse and I really didn #8217;t know what to do. But I somehow vaguely remembered feeling good about running in high school and tried that again. That #8217;s six weeks ago, I #8217;ve been running every other day since, and I #8217;ve been feeling so so much better for it. Honestly, if it wasn #8217;t for that teacher, I might still hate exercise and I might have never realised how much I loved running. So many other PE teachers have made me feel shit about myself and my body. I think it #8217;s such a shame that some kids are literally scared of PE lessons because they can #8217;t keep up with the competitive aspect of it and then are made fun of by both classmates and teachers. I certainly was. These experiences can be so intrinsic to people #8217;s relationships with themselves and with their bodies, and nobody should feel ashamed for what their bodies can or cannot do (yet). I understand that kids who are naturally good at sports should have the opportunity to compete. But I think the most important thing is to show people that exercise can be fun, and to empower people. So please, please be nice to the kids who aren #8217;t great at sports and encourage them to find some form of exercise that they enjoy, no matter if they #8217;re deemed good at it or not. It can make such a difference to people #8217;s lives, even years down the line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been doing C25K for the past couple weeks and it has really improved my mood. I think that is because it #8217;s starting quite easy so it feels achievable most times so when you come back it feels like an achievement, no matter your speed. And the fact that it tells you when to run and when to walk has been making it easier for me to stay motivated. Keep going, you got this! All the best :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Start medication?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-11 14:43:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>[TW selfharm, suicide] I #8217;m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I #8217;ve been depressed for about the last year. Obviously you can #8217;t give me medical advice but everyone around me seems to be really anti medication, so I #8217;d really like to hear some more opinions from people who wouldn #8217;t rule out medication categorically.. I #8217;ve been managing to be relatively functional for the first couple of months while I was still at uni, although I was kind of on autopilot for most of that and feeling really foggy and just not really there. I have some really bad days when I just feel in so much pain emotionally. I self harm every now and then, doing it less now, but whenever I do it, the couple days after are especially bad. But there are also some good days in between. It #8217;s really weird, whenever I #8217;m having a good day, I can #8217;t even imagine ever not being ok, and when I #8217;m having bad days, it feels like it #8217;s never going to stop. I #8217;ve had literally no pressures in life for the last few months which has been good, but I realised recently that whenever I have to do anything at all (like, something really trivial that would take me 5 minutes), I get really overwhelmed and it takes me way more effort than it should. I #8217;m not sure how I #8217;ll be able to deal with going back to uni in a month. I also struggle with sleeping, or with actually going to bed at night, but then can #8217;t get up in the morning even if I #8217;m awake I just stay in bed not really doing anything. I very decidedly do not want to die, but the thoughts kind of creep in, like just in random moments, and it scares me. Because mostly it #8217;s a distant thought, like, this would be an option but I #8217;m not gonna do it. But then most of the time I also don #8217;t understand how I could ever cut myself, and then I get overwhelmed and it happens. So I #8217;m kind of worried that at some point I #8217;m gonna get so overwhelmed that I #8217;m gonna do something stupid. When I saw my GP in March, she would have given me antidepressants but I said no. I #8217;ve recently thought about going back to ask for them, but I #8217;m not sure. I #8217;m in therapy but we #8217;re talking through some stuff that was traumatic and I usually feel worse afterwards. But then I #8217;m thinking maybe the fact that I still have some good days means I should stick it out without medication. Sorry, this ended up longer than I thought it #8217;d be, but it was quite cathartic writing it all. Thanks for reading, if you made it until here!</TEXT>
