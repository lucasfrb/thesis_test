There is still a lack of protective material. "It is the failure of politics that has not been taken care of. The pandemic plans of the authorities apparently only exist on paper", said the president of the Professional Association of Pediatric and Adolescent Physicians (BVKJ) in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In view of the spread of the coronavirus, leading economists warn of a dramatic expansion of the economic crisis. "It is now particularly important that the direct impact of the corona crisis is not compounded by a banking or sovereign debt crisis." Marcel Fratzscher, President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), also warned: "In Germany we must not think only within national borders. It was also a big mistake "that the EU has no coordinated strategy to combat the coronavirus and its economic effects," the DIW head told the NOZ. According to Fratzscher, Italy is the weakest link in the chain. He stressed: "A scenario like 2008 or 2012, when Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy, can no longer be ruled out today. Therefore, the entire EU and all national governments must now send a common signal that they will also help the weakest members. This would require solidarity, but also clever self-protection from a German perspective. "Because if Italy gets into trouble, then Germany too would pay a huge economic price. It is therefore also in Germany's interest that Italy does not slide into a financial crisis. Being able to count on full community solidarity Ifo boss Fuest also demanded that the governments of the euro zone should send a clear signal that all countries that get into financial difficulties due to the crisis can count on the full solidarity of the community of euro states. This did not only concern Italy. At the moment it was not yet clear which country would be hit the hardest. Increase capacity of rescue parachutes According to Fuest, "the full range of rescue instruments for banks and states is available for any stabilisation measures that may become necessary". At the same time, it should be agreed to increase the capacity of these rescue packages for the duration of the crisis so that the volume is sufficient for any eventuality. Italy is particularly affected Italy is particularly affected by the corona crisis. The country has already recorded more than 1800 deaths from the lung disease Covid-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus. The number of people infected is currently a good 25,000.

Marcel Fratzscher, President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), also warned: "In Germany we must not think only within national borders. It was also a big mistake "that the EU has no coordinated strategy to combat the coronavirus and its economic effects," the DIW head told the NOZ. According to Fratzscher, Italy is the weakest link in the chain. He stressed: "A scenario like 2008 or 2012, when Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy, can no longer be ruled out today. Therefore, the entire EU and all national governments must now send a common signal that they will also help the weakest members. This would require solidarity, but also clever self-protection from a German perspective. "Because if Italy gets into trouble, then Germany too would pay a huge economic price. It is therefore also in Germany's interest that Italy does not slide into a financial crisis.

    <TEXT>In the wake of the Corona crisis, the international financial markets are also coming under severe pressure. Drastic interest rate cuts, such as those by the US Federal Reserve, and similar aid measures by Asian central banks were unable to reassure investors. The stock markets continued to slump. In the current situation, many will remember the 2008 financial crisis. But today, unlike in the past, the situation is influenced by a one-off event that did not originate in the financial sector. Moreover, oil prices are eroding. So far, there has been no joint concerted action by the countries affected by the corona crisis. The central banks can do little to help in this situation by cutting interest rates, as interest rates were already at a low level before the crisis. Investments will certainly not be stimulated by such measures. The "advantage" now lies with countries that can look forward to consolidated finances. mei</TEXT>

    <TEXT>World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery spoke out against curfews for the population in the fight against the corona virus and cited Italy as a bad example. "I am no friend of lockdown. Anyone who imposes such a ban must also say when and how they will lift it," Montgomery told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post" newspaper. "Since we must assume that the virus will accompany us for a long time to come, I wonder when we will return to normality?"You can't keep schools and daycare centers closed until the end of the year. Because that's at least how long it would take to get a vaccine, Montgomery stressed. Italy has imposed a lockdown and has had the opposite effect. "They quickly reached the limits of their capacity, but did not slow down the spread of the virus within the lockdown at all." A lockdown is a political desperate measure because coercion is a means of getting further than reason will allow. Montgomery was critical of the border closures ordered by the federal government. "I don't believe the border closures will stop the virus. This is political actionism." He said that individual freeway crossings could be controlled and sealed off. But then people would just take the small country roads. "You don't often notice when you cross the border."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Helmholtz chief epidemiologist G #233;rard Krause has called for a change in strategy in the fight against the corona pandemic in view of the soaring case numbers. We must concentrate all the more urgently on keeping the number of serious diseases as low as possible," said the head of epidemiology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "It would be counterproductive if resources were tied up to put everything on containment, and then lacking the resources to optimise the treatment of the elderly and previously ill. This must not happen." The estimate of the Robert Koch Institute that ten million people could become infected within three months "is realistic", said the HZI chief epidemiologist. We must be prepared for a number of two million seriously ill Covid-19 patients. School and business closures did not change this. "We will no longer be able to prevent the virus from spreading in society. "It is to be expected that the braking effect will not last. Studies from London, for example, indicate this. "It is possible that we can only delay the peak of the first wave by a few weeks." Sufficient care workers cannot be trained in a few weeks. However, Krause said that it would not be possible to train enough intensive care workers in a few weeks. "The case may therefore arise that we can no longer treat everyone optimally. We will have to accept that." It is therefore crucial "that we focus on the care of the 20 percent of severely affected patients", said the researcher and demanded: "We need a 'VIP access' for those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly. They must be optimally protected from infections and must be given absolute priority in diagnostics, clarification, monitoring and medical care. We can do more here." Expert warns of curfew The expert warned urgently of the imposition of a curfew. "Massive interventions in the course of social events - such as a curfew - can also seriously impair health care," said Krause. "The production of medical goods and medicines must remain guaranteed, for example the production of insulin. The same applies to the supply of food." And the use of governmental force to implement a curfew "would create problems in other places that we don't need". No breakthrough in vaccines any time soon The epidemiologist does not expect a breakthrough in the search for a Covid-19 vaccine any time soon. "Experience teaches that the expectation that a vaccine or active substance will soon be available and the possibilities are usually dramatically overestimated at the beginning of epidemics. "We need to develop strategies that do not require a vaccine in the first place." pm, ots, m</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The coronavirus is keeping the world in suspense. Every minute the news about the lung disease Covid-19 rushes through the social media - be it Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp. The coronavirus keeps the world on tenterhooks. Every minute, news about Covid-19 lung disease rushes through social media - be it Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp. That's why there are quite a few who almost consider the new lung virus to be a "media infection" - so often, so much is reported about it. But in the many news and reports, more and more fake news, half-truths and myths about the global viral disease and the resulting consequences for people are appearing. For example, a false report from Austria also caused a stir in the media. Here, unknown persons had started the rumour that the corona deaths in Italy were also due to the intake of the painkiller ibuprofen. As "proof", the authors of the false report, which was distributed via the messenger service WhatsApp, referred to "research results" of the Medical University of Vienna. The clinic immediately pointed out that the report had no connection with the clinic. Corona "tips" for frightened contemporaries On the website of the Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR24) further fake news are listed, which circulated in the net. For example, a "corona test" was recommended. The tip: If you can hold your breath for ten seconds without sneezing, you would not have a corona. "This supposedly safe self-test is currently circulating on Whatsapp and Co", according to BR-online. Other "tips" advised scared contemporaries to drink a glass of water every 15 minutes to protect themselves from the virus. And vet conspiracy theorists claimed that the virus was grown in a laboratory. Two million fake news stories are said to be circulating on Twitter alone. A few days ago, representatives of the big tech companies were invited to the White House to take joint action against the flood of Corona fake news. Tech companies want to take countermeasures But the tech companies want to take countermeasures. Google, for example, has recognized that quite a few are trying to make a profit from the corona virus. For this reason, the counterparty has already blocked tens of thousands of such ads. Anyone searching Google for the keyword "coronavirus" will be presented with an information box and a link to the World Health Organization, for example. The company donates free ad spaces to governments and non-governmental institutions in regions affected by the virus and provides information about the virus to the population. The video platform Youtube, which, like Google, is also part of the Alphabet Group, refers to a banner of the Federal Centre for Health Education when Corona queries are made. The platform also provides free advertising space for governments and NGOs. "In addition, videos are removed which, for example, advise against seeking medical treatment," BR-online continues. Corona false reports are sorted out On Facebook, corona false positives are sorted out algorithmically so that they do not even appear in the user's timeline. In this context, Facebook works together with so-called fact-checkers and health authorities. In addition, the company provides the World Health Organization with free advertising space. The social media service Instagram is also taking action against the distributors of Corona false reports. The company will no longer allow users to search for Covid-19 related visual effects unless they have been developed in partnership with a recognized health information provider. In connection with the corona virus, the corporations Apple and Google will only allow searches from "trustworthy sources", as the online platform "t3n" reports. How false reports work "Successful" false reports make use of several components of the current situation: they benefit from people's increased need for information, address emotions and fears and are structured in such a way that they do not appear completely absurd, says Dr. Michael Littger of the association "Deutschland sicher im Netz". For example, false information about supermarket closures is spread even though concrete information is missing and the connections are not conclusive.

For example, false information about supermarket closures is spread even though concrete information is missing and the connections are not conclusive. Fake news ahead of its time Recently even the Federal Minister of Health defended himself against such fake news via Twitter. Under the headline "Achtung Fake News" it was said that it was claimed that the Ministry of Health and the Federal Government would soon announce further massive restrictions on public life. The ministry's response was: "That is not true. Please help to stop their dissemination". But this advice from the ministry had only a short half-life. Because, for once, a fake news had a truth content that should not be underestimated. For a few days after the Ministry's tweet, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced measures in the course of the corona crisis that the country had never experienced before. Websites generate fake news But there are also such sites on the Internet: They are called, for example, bluntly thefakenewsgenerator.com Completely service-oriented, this site offers everything a disseminator of false reports needs. There is a section for the headline and plenty of space for the actual "report". Also the selection of the flag under which the fake news should be sent on the net is made easy for the user. The choice is between CBS-News.US, Ailjazzera.com, BBC-News.US, CNN-Breaking-News.com and The-Young-Turks.com. Of course, these sites are not accessible in the real world of the Internet because they simply don't exist. But the fake address creates trust. And that's what really matters when the nightlife on the net goes on a journey and is taken at face value by someone on the WWW. They may then spread the word themselves and one more rumor is already set in the world. mei</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Carsten Brzeski, Chief Economist of ING Bank for Germany and Austria, has called for a joint appearance by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in view of the turbulence on the financial markets. "The financial markets can only be calmed with a clear signal from the Europeans," Brzeski told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). What is needed now is a clear signal "We will not let any country go bankrupt, we will protect the euro, whatever the cost". "Just as Merkel and the then French President Sarkozy always acted in concert in 2008, so it should be now," Brzeski said. The ING chief economist welcomed the announcement by ECB head Christine Lagarde to expand the ECB's bond purchase programme to 750 billion euros. "With the announcement to buy bonds for at least 750 billion euros, the ECB has finally sent a clear signal that Mario Draghi's phrase 'whatever it takes' still applies," said Brzeski. In doing so the ECB has put an end to speculation about a possible Italian bankruptcy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>According to various media reports, tomorrow, Saturday, it will be decided whether a curfew will be imposed on Germany, and on that day the government will take a close look at the behaviour of the population. On Sunday evening, Chancellor Merkel wants to discuss the further procedure with the heads of the state governments. Several heads of government had already threatened to impose curfews during the last few days because large parts of the population are not adhering to the necessary rules of conduct in the Corona crisis. For example, many continue to meet carelessly, visit shopping streets or even celebrate "corona parties". The necessary rules are not being observed The necessary clearance rules to prevent virus transmissions are of course not observed in these situations. Against this background, the Federal Government appeals to the population to adhere to the important rules during the corona crisis and to reduce social contacts to the absolute minimum. If curfews were to be imposed, this would mean even more restrictions for the population and would then be an enormous burden for everyone</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The former economist Peter Bofinger has spoken out in favour of a communitarisation of debts in order to absorb the corona crisis in the euro states. The economist told the newspaper "Saarbruecker Zeitung" "All countries are affected by the corona virus together, and no country bears causal responsibility for it. This is a common challenge, therefore it should be jointly financed". The debt instruments could be called corona bonds or unit bonds. This is also an act of European solidarity, said Bofinger. The economic expert appealed to the banks and savings banks in Germany to exempt micro-entrepreneurs from overdraft interest. Otherwise, self-employed people would be threatened with bankruptcy, said Bofinger</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great excitement around the Schalker midfielder Amine Harit. He was recently picked up at 1.30 am in a Shisha bar in Essen, which should have closed at 6 pm due to the Corona crisis. This was reported by the "Bild" newspaper. In addition to the 22-year-old Schalke star, another ten people are said to have been in the bar. Schalke's head of sports Jochen Schneider told the newspaper: "Amine was there with a friend because the ceiling fell on his head at home. It was a mistake, which he has now realized. I showed him once again the seriousness of the current situation. Because of his misconduct, Harit will donate to charity. With the Schalker fans Harit doesn't come off so well. So a user writes on the Facebook page "Schalke 04, Liebe im Revier": "Without words and this should be a role model for all the young Schalker fans? Irresponsible and unjustifiable".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whole article in English: Green party leader Katrin G #246;ring-Eckardt has accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and the other governments in Europe of a lack of agreement in the Corona crisis and lack of support from Italy. "The fact that the right information came from China late in the day certainly made the situation more difficult, but it must also be said that Europe and the national heads of government should have exchanged information and coordinated more closely much earlier," G #246;ring-Eckardt told the D #252;sseldorf-based newspaper "Rheinische Post". "I would have liked to have seen more European coordination and more active and earlier support for Italy from the Federal Government. Then a situation could possibly have been avoided in which each country "withdraws into its national shell". Now it was a matter of looking ahead, of strengthening cooperation and mutual trust again. "The Federal Government must now not only look inwards, but must also again give greater consideration to joint European approaches to solutions. It was good that EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) admitted that politicians had initially underestimated the corona virus. This shows that she can admit to mistakes</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The coronavirus will cause hundreds of billions of euros in production losses for Germany's economy, cause short-time work and unemployment to skyrocket and place a considerable burden on the national budget. These are the results of current calculations by the Ifo Institute. "The costs will probably exceed everything known from economic crises or natural disasters in Germany in recent decades," says Ifo President Clemens Fuest.  #8222;Depending on the scenario, the economy will shrink by 7.2 to 20.6 percentage points. This corresponds to costs of 255 to 729 billion euros." "It is therefore worthwhile using virtually every conceivable amount for health policy measures. The goal must be to shorten the partial closure of the economy without compromising the fight against the epidemic," says Fuest. Strategies are needed that allow the resumption of production to be combined with further containment of the epidemic "If the economy comes to a partial standstill for two months, the costs will be between 255 and 495 billion euros, depending on the scenario. Economic output then shrinks by 7.2 to 11.2 percentage points per year," says Fuest. The best scenario assumes that economic output falls to 59.6 percent for two months, recovers to 79.8 percent in the third month and finally reaches 100 percent in the fourth month. "With three months of partial closure, the costs already reach 354 to 729 billion euros, which is a loss of growth of 10.0 to 20.6 percentage points," says Fuest. Partial closures cost up to 57 million euros According to Ifo calculations, a single week's extension of the partial closure will cause additional costs of 25 to 57 billion euros and thus a decline in growth by 0.7 to 1.6 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases the costs up to 230 billion euros or 6.5 percentage points growth. Massive distortions on the labor market "The crisis is also causing massive distortions in the labour market. These put the conditions at the peak of the financial crisis in the shade," says Fuest. In the scenarios considered by the ifo, up to 1.8 million jobs subject to social insurance contributions (or 1.4 million full-time jobs) could be cut and more than six million workers could be affected by short-time working. Additional expenditure on transfers desirable and necessary Without taking into account the extensive planned guarantees and loans and possible European rescue packages, public budgets will be burdened by up to 200 billion euros. "However, for macroeconomic stabilization, the lower tax revenues and additional expenditure, especially for transfers, are both desirable and necessary," says Fuest</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The mood in German companies has deteriorated extraordinarily. The Ifo Business Climate Index slumped to 86.1 points in March, after 96.0 points in February. This is the sharpest decline ever recorded in reunified Germany and the lowest value since July 2009. In particular, corporate expectations darkened like never before. The assessments of the current situation have also fallen significantly. The German economy is in shock. The business climate index has fallen by a further 1.6 points compared with the preliminary publication of March 19, when it stood at 87.7 points. Since then, the assessments of the current situation have dropped by 0.8 points and the expectations by 2.3 points. Historically unique decline In manufacturing, the index has fallen to its lowest level since August 2009. There has never been a steeper decline in reunited Germany. The decline in expectations is historically unique in view of 70 years of surveys in industry. The indicator of the current situation fell less sharply. The index has fallen in all industrial sectors, in some cases quite significantly. Many companies have announced production cutbacks. Trade has collapsed In the services sector, the business climate indicator has fallen more sharply than at any time since records began in 2005, both in terms of the assessment of the business situation and expectations. In the retail sector, the business climate indicator has collapsed. Expectations plunged to their lowest level since reunification. Companies also assessed the current situation noticeably less positively. Both wholesale and retail have been hit equally hard. Positive exceptions are food and drugstores. Construction companies are still very satisfied In the construction industry, the index fell comparatively moderately. Construction companies are currently still very satisfied with their current situation. However, the outlook has deteriorated significantly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The mood among German exporters has deteriorated massively. The Ifo export expectations of the industry have fallen from minus 1.1 to minus 19.8 points in March. This is the sharpest decline since reunification and the lowest value since May 2009. The corona pandemic is slowing down global trade. Cross-border logistics are becoming more difficult. Germany as an export nation is particularly affected by this. Export expectations have fallen in almost all industrial sectors, in some cases significantly. The automotive industry has been particularly hard hit, which is expecting significant declines in exports. The outlook for the mechanical engineering sector is also bleak.

    <TEXT>English version The spread of the corona virus brings with it unprecedented risks and challenges for the German economy. Public life in Germany has largely come to a standstill within a very short period of time. The economic shockwaves are affecting both the supply and the demand side: due to a lack of intermediate goods and because everyday working life in many places cannot proceed as usual, many companies are having to cut back or even stop production, according to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in its analysis. This is associated with a considerable decline in demand for services and capital goods. Households are cutting back on consumption, which means major losses in sales, especially in the retail, catering and travel sectors. These effects would be intensified by the considerable uncertainty of companies and households. As the further course of the pandemic and the concrete political reactions to it are hardly predictable, the outlook for future economic development is far more uncertain than usual, according to DIW researchers. Rapid normalization scenario It seems certain, however, that the German economy will be severely affected at least in the next two quarters. What happens next will depend on how soon a return to normal economic activity is possible and successful. A scenario that assumes a similar course of the virus spread as in past epidemics, such as swine flu, SARS or bird flu, is similar to a "V": After a steep decline, production and consumption returned to normal relatively soon after successful containment of the virus, in the current case in the second half of the year. Even in this scenario, which is now rather optimistic, the German economy would shrink by 0.1 percent this year. In this case, the corona crisis would result in growth that would be around 1.3 percentage points lower The virus could travel in even larger circles The virus could, however, spread over a much wider area in terms of time and space. Other countries may be forced to take far-reaching measures, which in many cases would affect Germany's export-oriented and open economy - even if the peak of the epidemic in this country should at some point be passed. Households and companies are sustainably insecure and are continuing to postpone purchases. This would further accelerate the downward dynamic and delay economic recovery. The course of events in this scenario would correspond to an "L": the downward trend is steep, production and consumption do not normalize but remain at the lower level. The recession would then be much more severe. Global economy would have stabilized If it were not for the corona virus and its consequences, the industrial recession would have gradually come to an end. The global economy would also have actually stabilised, especially as there was a breathing space in the brexite sector and the USA and China were able to make progress in their trade negotiations. Under normal circumstances, the export-oriented German economy would have particularly benefited from the decline in these risks. But all this is now hypothetical. Decisive action needed for stabilisation The crisis should be countered quickly and massively. Central banks around the world, such as the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have in some cases taken far-reaching steps to calm the markets. This is important in order to prevent a resurgence of the crisis in the euro zone, but also to prevent a new banking crisis. Fiscal policy is now at least as important. Important first step to avoid insolvencies and job losses The Federal Government had presented a comprehensive package that would secure short-term liquidity for companies and facilitate access to short-time work compensation. This is an important first step towards avoiding insolvencies and job losses. Other solutions are needed, however, for small entrepreneurs and the self-employed, for whom the current crisis is often a threat to their very existence. All this ensures the continued existence of business structures in Germany. "Politicians should now continue to act decisively: build bridges with liquidity support and short-time work, declare readiness for a considerable stimulus in demand and organise coordination between governments". Claus Michelsen, DIW Economic Research Director Moreover, if the economic crisis were to deepen, despite an easing of the pandemic, it would be necessary to boost household consumption and investment. It would be possible to bring forward the partial abolition of the solidarity surcharge or to temporarily reduce VAT or social security contributions. A crisis of confidence must be prevented Decisive action is needed to prevent a crisis of confidence on the part of households and, above all, businesses. This would lead to a clear reluctance to invest on the part of companies. On the one hand, more generous depreciation rules could encourage companies not to postpone investment projects already planned but to tackle them at an early stage and thus stimulate demand. In order to strengthen confidence, the willingness to take such measures should be communicated clearly and early on. Coordination at European level These measures should also be coordinated at European level and complemented by joint European initiatives. The European Rescue System (ESM) could also be used for this purpose. The important thing is to ensure that all European governments, especially Italy's, have faith in and trust in the ability to act. The central goal must be to prevent a deep and persistent economic and financial crisis</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Statistics professor Walter Kr #228;mer from Dortmund warns against maintaining restrictive anti-corona measures for too long, as otherwise potentially fatal secondary diseases could increase: "People will put on weight, diabetes will increase, domestic violence will increase and suicides will increase. If the current measures continue for too long, serious problems for the health of German citizens are imminent," Kr #228;mer said in an interview with the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". "Two or three weeks without sport and with too much food and in social isolation are no problem. But if we had to endure this state of affairs much longer, the benefits would be less than the costs." Already now, "cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death in Germany, 300,000 people die of them every year", the statistician said. "It is known that overweight and too little exercise promote these diseases." Collateral damage is acceptable Kr #228;mer has made a name for himself as a specialist in social, economic and health statistics and teaches at the Technical University of Dortmund. If the measures currently being taken by the government were to quickly stem the spread of the virus, the remaining negative consequences for general health would be "acceptable as collateral damage", says Kr #228;mer. "As a statistician, however, we must look at how we can save most lives from premature death." Corona crisis may soon be over Kr #228;mer therefore considers it "completely unlikely" that the current conditions would be maintained for months or even a year. He said: "I assume that in two or three weeks we will stop with the current measures and that in two months we will laugh ourselves to death about how we let ourselves be panicked." If all German citizens now adhered to the two-person rule, the Corona crisis would soon be "just a bad dream", said the statistics professor. A very low death rate Overall, he believes that the danger posed by the coronavirus is overestimated: "Only very few die, about half a percent or even less. This is one of the lowest mortality rates of any infectious disease. Nevertheless, Kr #228;mer does not find the current drastic measures excessive. Soon, he says, test procedures will also be available that can be used to determine "relatively quickly" whether someone has the virus or not. "If those who have it are quarantined, the drama is over."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Information all, a long article, but very good English version In an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung", the medieval professor referred to epidemics of the past and explained that pandemics "were and are always the starting point for something fundamentally new". They "relentlessly revealed the weaknesses of the status quo". Corona will therefore also noticeably shift the social paradigms. Schlotheuber assumes that questions about death and the meaning of life will gain in importance again, and in this process faith. The classical churches, however, would not profit from it - the Corona crisis would not change their problems. "Perhaps we will see completely new religious currents," said Schlotheuber. Historian calls for prudence The chairwoman of the historian called for calm in the face of the crisis. "If you look at epidemics and their accompanying processes in a historical dimension, you see that they are always instrumentalized to serve other political or social goals," she warned. There does not always have to be a bad intention behind it, she said. "People want to classify things, especially when they are not really comprehensible." The important thing is to "stay sober and avoid overreacting". History also shows that pandemics are always accompanied by charlatanism, agitation and unrest. "Any other assumption would be naive. We are all called upon to counter." No premature recriminations Schlotheuber turned against hasty accusations of guilt, such as reflexively attributing a share to capitalism. "It is to be expected when it is argued that Mammon is ultimately to blame for everything," she said, admonishing: "Think of the persecution of the Jews and the emergence of the legends that they poisoned the wells in the times of the great plague. This stigmatization also happened against the background of their great role in money lending." It is important to look at the real causes of misdevelopment. "I think it is conceivable that the global mobility of people and goods is more strongly reflected", she said. Great era of Christian orders and monasteries The medieval professor and church specialist Eva Schlotheuber also sees opportunities in the current situation of social seclusion of many people. It reminds her of the great age of Christian orders and monasteries, said the historian. "In the Middle Ages, the self-imposed 'curfew', the enclosure of monks and nuns, led to great intellectual and cultural innovations," Schlotheuber recalled. "An inner world opened up for them when the outer world remained closed." Creative thoughts from the cloister Creative thoughts from a "retreat" could be useful for the individual as well as for society today. "Perhaps now is a good time to reflect on what is really at stake, what is important to us in a deeper sense," said Schlotheuber. "The fact that the pandemic is destroying the illusion in the industrialized nations that man and nature can be controlled without limits can also clear a path".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version TV commentator Claudia Neumann hopes for positive changes in football as a result of the Corona crisis. For years, professional soccer has developed into an increasingly large billion-euro business. "This stagnation is forcing one or the other major player in this business to rethink their position. Whether this latent striving for more and more money was the right way to go", Neumann told the newspaper "nd - Die Woche", the weekend edition of "new germany". Neumann spoke of an unhealthy gigantism, "which now possibly encourages people to rethink, and that is something one can only wish for." The football expert, whose first book was published this week, also hopes for better social interaction. "A more respectful coexistence is urgently needed." As far as manners in society are concerned, she says, we have reached a low point "where things can hardly get any meaner". As the first woman to comment live on a men's soccer world and European championship, the journalist is constantly being attacked on the net. "Since the European Championship in '16, shitstorms have been my persistent pursuers," she reported. Actually, Neumann would have hosted the European Championships this summer and the Olympics in the football sector. "That will be in 2021. It will be a busy year, but at the moment everything is at a standstill</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung", the medieval professor referred to epidemics of the past and explained that pandemics "were and are always the starting point for something fundamentally new". They "relentlessly revealed the weaknesses of the status quo". Corona will therefore also noticeably shift the social paradigms. Schlotheuber assumes that questions about death and the meaning of life will gain in importance again, and in this process faith. The classical churches, however, would not profit from it - the Corona crisis would not change their problems. "Perhaps we will see completely new religious currents," said Schlotheuber. Historian calls for prudence The chairwoman of the historian called for calm in the face of the crisis. "If you look at epidemics and their accompanying processes in a historical dimension, you see that they are always instrumentalized to serve other political or social goals," she warned.

    <TEXT>Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff fears a new global economic crisis like the one in 1929 in view of the global "lockdowns" in the fight against the corona virus - and calls on governments to come up with larger aid packages: "This shock is unique and cannot be compared to any since the Spanish flu of 1918/19. We are experiencing the first truly global crisis since the Great Depression," Rogoff told the business magazine "Capital".

    <TEXT>According to Pfeiffer, the quota of intensive players is likely to "grow considerably". This would be accompanied by a considerable danger of addiction, the former Lower Saxony SPD Minister of Justice (2000 to 2003) emphasized. He said there was every reason to worry that after a phase of intensive gambling in times of corona, a considerable number of young people in particular would get stuck in this situation. Women's shelters get more to do Pfeiffer also predicts that women's shelters will become more busy in the near future. "We know from China, for example, that intra-family violence has become a serious problem there due to the Corona crisis.

    <TEXT>English version In view of the discussion about a general obligation to wear protective masks, Susanne Johna, chairwoman of the doctors' union Marburger Bund, has expressed criticism, saying in the "Rheinische Post" newspaper: "Respiratory masks are currently in short supply in hospitals and nursing homes. We hope that the situation will improve with additional deliveries, which have been arranged by the federal government and the state governments". It would be fatal if more and more private individuals bought protective masks that were intended for use in hospitals or nursing homes, Johna said. "There is nothing wrong with buying a simple mouth and nose protector or making one yourself. This can be useful because it also protects others from possible infection through coughing or sneezing, for example". A homemade mask does not offer sufficient protection However, one should not be under the illusion that a simple, possibly homemade mask offers sufficient protection against infection. "This is not the case. Wearing a simple mask could even have a negative effect if the distance rules were no longer observed", warned the chairwoman of the Marburger Bund. Sufficient distance to others is still important and should definitely continue to be practiced in public areas. "Incidentally, care should be taken to ensure that cotton masks, for example, are washed daily at at least 60 degrees. They should not be worn unwashed," said Johna</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The economic barometer of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) slumps to 86 points in March, pointing to a significant decline in economic output in the first quarter of 2020. This reflects the massive impact of the corona pandemic, which is visible in the indicators now available on developments on the financial markets and in company surveys. Other data, such as on the order situation or production output, do not yet reflect the current situation. The fact that production has virtually come to a complete standstill in some economic sectors is not yet fully reflected in the current barometer value. Additional estimates of the loss of production and demand suggest a significant decline in economic output, especially in the second half of March: On a quarterly average, it is likely to fall by around 2.0 percent, and thus even somewhat more than at the beginning of the financial crisis. At the end of 2008, gross domestic product slumped by a good one and a half percent compared with the previous quarter. Restrictions will weigh on value added Restrictions on public life - including school closures, bans on pub and restaurant visits, or the discontinuation of sports, entertainment and cultural offerings - will continue to weigh on value creation in April. Initial estimates suggest that the decline in economic output will be even more drastic as a result in the second quarter - the decline could be almost double-digit. Economic development for 2020 difficult to predict It is currently very difficult to estimate the economic development for the year as a whole, as it depends largely on the further spread of the virus and the political reactions to it. The data available at this time provide an extremely incomplete picture of the situation. Even if more and more economic activity becomes possible again in the coming weeks and a normalisation follows in the coming months, the economic performance is likely to decline by around six percent at the end of the year. This is comparable in magnitude to the collapse of the financial crisis. If there is no normalisation, an even greater decline is possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The US online trading company Amazon will be able to expand its dominant position on the German market in the wake of the Corona crisis, according to a still unpublished study by the Institute of the German Economy (IW), which is available to the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". The current restrictions on stationary trade due to the corona crisis would generally give a strong boost to online trade, the study states. "The major retailers and trading platforms, above all Amazon, which should emerge from the crisis significantly stronger," the IW says. In 2018, Amazon has already turned over goods worth more than nine billion euros in Germany. According to the Institute, this was already more than three times as much as otto.de, the second largest online retailer, was able to turn over. In a survey in 2019, 82 percent of 18- and 64-year-olds in Germany said they had bought something from Amazon in the last twelve months. High level of awareness and wide product range "It can therefore be assumed that Amazon will continue to be chosen for purchases during the crisis and that, in addition, people who have not previously ordered online, or hardly ever ordered online, will also choose the online retailer," writes study author Vera Demary. The advantages of Amazon are its high level of brand awareness, the breadth of its product range and its delivery reliability. Because of Amazon's increasing market power, German and European competition law must be consistently applied, the IW demands. The Cartel Office and the EU Commission could, for example, force Amazon to sell its business divisions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The control of coronavirus will lead to production losses. It will cost the countries of Europe hundreds of billions of euros. This is the result of new calculations by the ifo Institute: "In addition to medical reasons, there are also economic reasons for investing massively in health protection. In this way, the epidemic can be contained - and at the same time we could then gradually lift the closures of schools and businesses," says Ifo President Clemens Fuest. Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom were examined. "There is also an urgent need for precautions in the companies that would make it possible to combine a resumption of production with further containment of the epidemic," Fuest adds. "If firms remain closed for more than a month, production losses quickly reach dimensions well beyond the slump in growth known from previous recessions or natural disasters in the history of the European Union. How much added value is lost in the crisis period The Ifo Institute calculated how much added value is lost if production is interrupted. In addition, it estimated the consequential costs arising from a delayed return to normal economic activity or from permanent disruptions, such as bankruptcies or the loss of business relations during the crisis. Austria may lose up to 14 percent of growth For Austria, the Ifo Institute estimates costs of 34 to 57 billion euros for a partial closure of two months. This reduces the annual growth rate between 8.5 and 14.2 percentage points. For three months, the costs already reach 47 to 83 billion euros or a growth loss of 11.9 to 20.9 percentage points. A single week's extension causes additional costs of EUR 3 to 7 billion in Austria and thus a decline in growth of 0.8 to 1.7 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 26 billion euros or 6.6 percentage points growth. Switzerland may lose up to 19 percent in growth For Switzerland, the Ifo calculations show that a partial closure of two months would result in costs of between 49 and 81 billion euros, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 7.8 to 12.9 percentage points; for three months, they already reach 69 to 119 billion euros, which means a loss in growth of 11.0 to 19.0 percentage points. It can be seen that a single week's extension in Switzerland causes additional costs of 5 to 10 billion euros and thus a decline in growth of 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases the costs by up to 38 billion euros or 6.1 percentage points of growth. Italy may lose up to 19 percent growth According to Ifo, the costs in Italy, which is severely battered, reach between 143 and 234 billion euros for a partial closure of two months, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 8.0 to 13.1 percentage points; for three months, the costs already reach 200 to 342 billion euros or 11.2 to 19.1 percentage points growth loss. A single week extension causes additional costs of 14 to 27 billion euros in Italy, reducing growth by 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 108 billion euros or 6.3 percentage points of growth. Spain may lose up to 20 percent growth In Spain, which has also been severely affected, the ifo Institute expects costs of between 101 and 171 billion euros for two months of partial closure, which will reduce the annual growth rate by 8.1 and 13.8 percentage points. In the case of three months, costs will already reach 141 to 250 billion euros or reduce growth by 11.3 to 20.0 percentage points. A single week extension causes additional costs of 10 to 20 billion euros in Spain, reducing growth by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 78 billion euros or 6.1 percentage points of growth. France may lose up to 19 percent growth For France, according to the ifo Institute, the costs of two months of partial closure of companies reach between 176 and 298 billion euros, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 7.3 to 12.3 percentage points; for three months, they already reach 247 to 436 billion euros or 10.2 to 18.0 percentage points growth loss. In France, a single week extension causes additional costs of between 18 and 35 billion euros and thus a loss of growth of 0.7 to 1.4 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 138 billion euros or 5.7 percentage points of growth. The United Kingdom may lose up to 19 percent in growth In the United Kingdom, two months of partial closure cause losses of between 193 and 328 billion euros, according to the ifo Institute. This reduces the annual growth rate by 7.7 to 13.0 percentage points; in three months, the costs already reach 271 to 480 billion euros or 10.7 to 19.0 percentage points growth loss. A single week extension causes additional costs of 19 to 38 billion euros and thus a loss of growth of 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 152 billion euros or 6.0 percentage points growth</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The control of coronavirus will lead to production losses. It will cost the countries of Europe hundreds of billions of euros. This is the result of new calculations by the ifo Institute: "In addition to medical reasons, there are also economic reasons for investing massively in health protection. In this way, the epidemic can be contained - and at the same time we could then gradually lift the closures of schools and businesses," says Ifo President Clemens Fuest. Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom were examined. "There is also an urgent need for precautions in the companies that would make it possible to combine a resumption of production with further containment of the epidemic," Fuest adds. "If firms remain closed for more than a month, production losses quickly reach dimensions well beyond the slump in growth known from previous recessions or natural disasters in the history of the European Union. How much added value is lost in the crisis period The Ifo Institute calculated how much added value is lost if production is interrupted. In addition, it estimated the consequential costs arising from a delayed return to normal economic activity or from permanent disruptions, such as bankruptcies or the loss of business relations during the crisis. Austria may lose up to 14 percent of growth For Austria, the Ifo Institute estimates costs of 34 to 57 billion euros for a partial closure of two months. This reduces the annual growth rate between 8.5 and 14.2 percentage points. For three months, the costs already reach 47 to 83 billion euros or a growth loss of 11.9 to 20.9 percentage points. A single week's extension causes additional costs of EUR 3 to 7 billion in Austria and thus a decline in growth of 0.8 to 1.7 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 26 billion euros or 6.6 percentage points growth. Switzerland may lose up to 19 percent in growth For Switzerland, the Ifo calculations show that a partial closure of two months would result in costs of between 49 and 81 billion euros, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 7.8 to 12.9 percentage points; for three months, they already reach 69 to 119 billion euros, which means a loss in growth of 11.0 to 19.0 percentage points. It can be seen that a single week's extension in Switzerland causes additional costs of 5 to 10 billion euros and thus a decline in growth of 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases the costs by up to 38 billion euros or 6.1 percentage points of growth. Italy may lose up to 19 percent growth According to Ifo, the costs in Italy, which is severely battered, reach between 143 and 234 billion euros for a partial closure of two months, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 8.0 to 13.1 percentage points; for three months, the costs already reach 200 to 342 billion euros or 11.2 to 19.1 percentage points growth loss. A single week extension causes additional costs of 14 to 27 billion euros in Italy, reducing growth by 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 108 billion euros or 6.3 percentage points of growth. Spain may lose up to 20 percent growth In Spain, which has also been severely affected, the ifo Institute expects costs of between 101 and 171 billion euros for two months of partial closure, which will reduce the annual growth rate by 8.1 and 13.8 percentage points. In the case of three months, costs will already reach 141 to 250 billion euros or reduce growth by 11.3 to 20.0 percentage points. A single week extension causes additional costs of 10 to 20 billion euros in Spain, reducing growth by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 78 billion euros or 6.1 percentage points of growth. France may lose up to 19 percent growth For France, according to the ifo Institute, the costs of two months of partial closure of companies reach between 176 and 298 billion euros, depending on the scenario, and reduce the annual growth rate by 7.3 to 12.3 percentage points; for three months, they already reach 247 to 436 billion euros or 10.2 to 18.0 percentage points growth loss. In France, a single week extension causes additional costs of between 18 and 35 billion euros and thus a loss of growth of 0.7 to 1.4 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 138 billion euros or 5.7 percentage points of growth. The United Kingdom may lose up to 19 percent in growth In the United Kingdom, two months of partial closure cause losses of between 193 and 328 billion euros, according to the ifo Institute. This reduces the annual growth rate by 7.7 to 13.0 percentage points; in three months, the costs already reach 271 to 480 billion euros or 10.7 to 19.0 percentage points growth loss. A single week extension causes additional costs of 19 to 38 billion euros and thus a loss of growth of 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points. An extension from one to two months increases costs by up to 152 billion euros or 6.0 percentage points growth</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In view of the discussion about a general obligation to wear protective masks, Susanne Johna, chairwoman of the doctors' union Marburger Bund, has expressed criticism, saying in the "Rheinische Post" newspaper: "Respiratory masks are currently in short supply in hospitals and nursing homes. We hope that the situation will improve with additional deliveries, which have been arranged by the federal government and the state governments". It would be fatal if more and more private individuals bought protective masks that were intended for use in hospitals or nursing homes, Johna said. "There is nothing wrong with buying a simple mouth and nose protector or making one yourself. This can be useful because it also protects others from possible infection through coughing or sneezing, for example".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version! In contrast to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's leading hygienists recommend wearing a simple mouth and nose protector (MNS) because it provides effective protection against corona infection: "Anyone who coughs and wears an MNS protects themselves from most of the droplets that get caught in the cloth or fabric," Peter Walger, spokesman of the board of the German Society for Hospital Hygiene (DGKH), told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "Anyone who is coughed on by an infected person from about one metre away is protected to a high degree from breathing in the droplets by a cloth or even a scarf, because they get caught in the scarf". Only a small percentage would find their way through the pores, even if they were very close to the person coughing. Opposition to the Robert Koch Institute The DGKH thus contradicts the Robert Koch Institute. The RKI website also states that there is "insufficient evidence that wearing a mouth and nose protector significantly reduces the risk of infection for a healthy person wearing it". However, the DGKH currently rejects a "mask obligation" such as in Jena and in Austria: "It would lead to us withdrawing masks from those who need them more urgently, such as nurses and hospital staff", said board spokesman Walger. There are not enough masks to buy "Duty to wear masks is also problematic because there are not enough masks to buy." This is evident in Austria. "There a duty was introduced with the requirement for supermarkets to distribute masks to their customers. But the supermarkets don't have enough MNS and don't know where to get them. This is half-hearted and creates confusion because the duty simply cannot be met." Do not get medical respirators Walger urgently warned the population to get medical breathing masks (FFP2/3). "Professional masks belong in professional care, are much more urgently needed by medical practices, clinics and in intensive care." It is also "absolutely sufficient" to wear a simple mouth-nose mask for contacts among non-risk groups and in normal social life. "Therefore, every company and institution that can manufacture fabric masks should do so," Walger appealed. "Private households should definitely sew masks made of fabric, too," he said and advised: "Sewn-in sanitary napkins can also be useful, they increase protection and also catch moisture. And moist masks can be dried quickly. At 70 degrees in the microwave or oven, all viruses die off." No mask while walking The DGKH spokesman explained that it is not absolutely necessary to wear MNS on the street. In fresh air or in well-ventilated rooms, the droplet cloud immediately spreads into a dilution, which significantly reduces the risk. "When walking, therefore, nobody needs a mask if a distance of about 1.5 meters is maintained and coughing is avoided," Walger said. The risk of infection is higher in rooms that are not ventilated, but even there it is "considerably" reduced by a simple MNS. "Therefore: Every mask protects! And the more often it is ventilated, the more effectively it can protect," said the NOZ hygienist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The humanitarian crisis in the central Sahel states of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali is getting out of control - more than five million people throughout the region are suffering from severe hunger. This is the conclusion of a new study on food security on the ground published by various aid agencies, including the UN World Food Programme (WFP). The dramatic increase in the number of people suffering from hunger comes at a time when the COVID 19 pandemic is reaching the fragile countries in the region, which have the weakest health systems in the world. Burkina Faso is the country with the most officially reported COVID-19 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Beginning in June, the so-called "lean season" - the period between consumption of the last crop and the new one - will see 2.1 million people go hungry, three times as many as the year before when 680,000 were affected during the same period. "Here one crisis intensified another" "Here, one crisis reinforces another crisis and the situation threatens to get out of hand," said Chris Nikoi, WFP Regional Director for West Africa. "People are at the edge of the abyss - we must act now to save lives - we are the only hope for millions of people." "Our message to the world is clear - look away now and the consequences will be nothing but catastrophic," Nikoi added. The situation is worrying The situation is worrying throughout the central Sahel, a region that includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The number of hungry people is rising steadily as the crisis worsens. This is also plunging 1.3 million people in Mali and 2 million people in Niger into severe hunger. The number of displaced persons in the central Sahel has also quadrupled, with the number of displaced persons in Burkina Faso alone rising from half a million at the beginning of the year to 780,000 in the last three months. The families are being driven from their homes by extremist violence and are now almost entirely dependent on external aid to survive. WFP food aid is the lifeline For millions of people in the region, WFP's food aid is the lifeline, providing stability and increased resilience to the communities in which they live. In February, WFP supported 1.5 million people in Burkina Faso and Mali, but further support is needed to tackle the crisis. Precisely because COVID-19 is putting life-saving humanitarian work to the test. WFP urgently needs US$208 million by August 2020 to continue providing vital assistance. Extensive experience in fighting epidemics WFP has extensive experience in fighting epidemics and pandemics, which the organization has also gained during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa 2014-2016. This experience has shown that food aid can play a crucial role in halting the spread of disease. On the other hand, nutritional programmes have reduced susceptibility to infection for vulnerable groups with weakened immune systems, such as the chronically ill and the elderly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the course of the corona pandemic, it is time that people in Germany start to think more about the end of life, about their own mortality, said Professor Uwe Janssens, President of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). Especially family doctors, who care for elderly, perhaps already bedridden and sick people at home or in nursing homes, have a special responsibility here. "Does it really make sense to intubate and ventilate people at a very old age who have been unable to live on their own for a long time and who have severe chronic concomitant diseases, when they are seriously ill with Covid-19 and have little chance of recovery?" he asks urgently, without wanting to give an answer himself. Sufficient medication to relieve symptoms Janssen works as head physician at the Clinic for Internal Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine at the St. Antonius Hospital in Eschweiler near Aachen. He and Professor Lukas Radbruch, president of the German Society for Palliative Medicine and head physician of the Bonn Clinic for Palliative Medicine, can be reassuring: There are enough effective drugs to alleviate the symptoms of Covid-19, including pain as well as shortness of breath and anxiety. Even when the most seriously ill can no longer be saved. According to Radbruch, supply bottlenecks in hospitals could only arise if all wards now stockpiled an excessive amount of drugs, as many people currently do with toilet paper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version An interdisciplinary group of renowned scientists is now calling for a gradual easing of the existing social and economic restrictions while ensuring medical care for the entire population. In their position paper, the researchers around Ifo President Clemens Fuest and Martin Lohse, President of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians, point out ways to achieve this goal. The strategy envisages the gradual easing of current restrictions in a differentiated way and under continuous consideration of the risks. Priority will be given to restrictions that cause high economic costs or lead to severe social and health burdens. Regions with low infection rates and free capacities in the health system could, according to the proposal of the 14 experts from German universities and research institutes, lead the way in the gradual new start. In addition, sectors with a low risk of infection, such as highly automated factories, and areas with less vulnerable people, such as schools and universities, should also be started. Restrictions start to take effect "The current restrictions make sense and are beginning to show their first effects," says Martin Lohse, physician and president of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (GDN #196;). However, in addition to high economic and social costs, the measures would also have serious medical consequences, for example for patients with other serious diseases. "Because we have to expect that the pandemic will keep us busy for many months to come and ultimately only our immune system will be able to protect us, we need a flexible strategy that is graduated according to risks - a general shutdown is not a long-term solution," says Martin Lohse. Health and a stable economy are not mutually exclusive  #8222;Health and a stable economy are by no means mutually exclusive," says Clemens Fuest, economist and president of the Munich-based Ifo Institute.

    <TEXT>English version The German government wants to make another huge sum available to provide companies with money. Since the credit supply with the help of the house banks does not work well despite the 90 percent coverage by the federally owned KfW, there will now be loans without prior examination.

    <TEXT>English version In the course of the corona pandemic, it is time that people in Germany start to think more about the end of life, about their own mortality, said Professor Uwe Janssens, President of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). Especially family doctors, who care for elderly, perhaps already bedridden and sick people at home or in nursing homes, have a special responsibility here. "Does it really make sense to intubate and ventilate people at a very old age who have been unable to live on their own for a long time and who have severe chronic concomitant diseases, when they are seriously ill with Covid-19 and have little chance of recovery?" he asks urgently, without wanting to give an answer himself. Sufficient medication to relieve symptoms Janssen works as head physician at the Clinic for Internal Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine at the St. Antonius Hospital in Eschweiler near Aachen. He and Professor Lukas Radbruch, president of the German Society for Palliative Medicine and head physician of the Bonn Clinic for Palliative Medicine, can be reassuring: There are enough effective drugs to alleviate the symptoms of Covid-19, including pain as well as shortness of breath and anxiety. Even when the most seriously ill can no longer be saved. According to Radbruch, supply bottlenecks in hospitals could only arise if all wards now stockpiled an excessive amount of drugs, as many people currently do with toilet paper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The school closures imposed during the Corona crisis threaten the future of millions of children in West and Central Africa. Daily school attendance is the only access to education, especially for the children who are growing up in humanitarian crises and armed conflicts there. Therefore, Save the Children calls for education to be urgently included in the measures against the COVID 19 pandemic. Particularly in rural regions or in the suburbs of large cities, many children in West and Central Africa have no access to distance learning at home. The education systems in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and northern Nigeria are already weakened by the conflicts there. The current school closures increase the risk for many children of losing their connection or dropping out of school altogether. Children who stay at home are also exposed to an increased risk of neglect, abuse and exploitation. This particularly affects girls. "Of course, the priority is to fight the spread of COVID-19, but at the same time we need to ensure that children can continue their education at home," says Philippe Adapoe, Regional Office Head of Save the Children for West and Central Africa. "Education must be an integral part of action against COVID-19, because the future of millions of children is at stake. The disease will eventually subside, but the children could feel the consequences for the rest of their lives. So far, too little has been done to ensure that children can continue learning at home," Philippe Adapoe stresses. "The governments of the affected countries must meet this challenge with the help of the international community. If we do not ensure continuity in education, we will see many children, especially girls, drop out of school. We should learn our lessons from the Ebola crisis." Save the Children calls on governments and the international community that measures be taken to mitigate the effects of school closures. In Africa, where millions of people have no access to the Internet, radio and television programmes can help children access education. Governments must also enable teachers to provide quality distance education. that there is adequate care for children in addition to distance learning, as well as specific support for the most needy children. that other effects of school closures, such as the loss of school meals, are cushioned. In addition, risks such as child labour, abuse and exploitation, which are increased as a result of school closures, must be minimised. that girls are particularly protected from exploitation and child marriage. Girls are likely to be disproportionately involved in the care of sick family members or younger siblings, thus limiting their right to education</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The risks to human health will continue to increase due to massive environmental destruction, warns the nature conservation organisation WWF Germany in view of the current COVID19 pandemic. The probability of the occurrence of further zoonoses and other infectious diseases is also growing. In the worst case, new pandemics could develop from this. The WWF therefore calls for an internationally consistent approach to illegal wildlife trade and better regulation of legal trade, an end to the destruction of ecosystems and habitats, and more basic research into the processes that make it possible for pathogens to pass from animals to humans. "COVID-19 makes it painfully and dramatically clear to all of us that we must rethink and correct the destructive relationship we have with nature," demands Eberhard Brandes, Chairman of WWF Germany. Nature is the source of most medicines "The destruction of biodiversity has indirect and direct consequences on human health. Habitat destruction such as deforestation and illegal or poorly regulated wildlife trade make more frequent and more serious outbreaks of infectious diseases more likely. The SARS pandemic of 2002/2003 and the current COVID 19 crisis are a dramatic reminder of this". At the same time, the biodiversity of the earth is also the key to our health: "Analyses from the USA show Nature is the source of most of the drugs used to treat our diseases." There can't be a "keep it up" According to Brandes, there should not be a simple "keep it up" after the COVID 19 crisis. The WWF Germany has therefore identified three set screws to reduce the risks of further zoonoses and infectious diseases in the future: Decisive action against the illegal trade in wild animals and better controls on the legal trade in species such as game meat: According to the WWF, the core element is a consistent approach against illegal trade in species, including the closure of unregulated markets and the revision of laws to close loopholes. In addition, better regulation of the legal trade in species in order to prevent the occurrence of zoonoses, for example through higher hygiene standards. More support would be needed here - especially for developing and emerging countries. According to the WWF, international agreements and negotiations must also focus even more strongly on this issue than before. Protect biodiversity and recognise that it is indispensable for ecosystems and human health: According to the WWF, the protection of biological diversity and an end to habitat destruction is a key factor in preventing the spread of new infectious diseases. Environmental changes lead to new patterns of pathogen spread. When habitats and ecosystems are destroyed and natural barriers disappear, it brings species into contact with each other that were not previously in contact. It also creates a new spatial proximity to humans. Both factors increase the probability of the development and spread of infectious diseases and zoonoses. In its own interest, Germany must assume its responsibility here and play a pioneering role. In concrete terms, the WWF is calling for legislation at national and European level for deforestation-free and sustainable supply chains. The financial sector and government aid and economic stimulus programmes must immediately establish ecological and social criteria in addition to solvency, and monitor their gradual fulfilment. This includes the Paris climate target as well as the sustainable development targets of the United Nations. The health of people, wildlife and the environment must be consistently considered together in future: The links between habitat destruction and the worldwide loss of biodiversity on the one hand and human health on the other must be given greater weight in global health care and research. It is necessary to break down any silo thinking and tackle these challenges in an even more interdisciplinary way. It must be assumed that epidemics such as SARS, avian flu or COVID-19 are likely to increase in the future. The ecological processes that lead to such outbreaks must be better understood and taken into account.

In addition, better regulation of the legal trade in species in order to prevent the occurrence of zoonoses, for example through higher hygiene standards. More support would be needed here - especially for developing and emerging countries. According to the WWF, international agreements and negotiations must also focus even more strongly on this issue than before. Protect biodiversity and recognise that it is indispensable for ecosystems and human health: According to the WWF, the protection of biological diversity and an end to habitat destruction is a key factor in preventing the spread of new infectious diseases. Environmental changes lead to new patterns of pathogen spread. When habitats and ecosystems are destroyed and natural barriers disappear, it brings species into contact with each other that were not previously in contact. It also creates a new spatial proximity to humans. Both factors increase the probability of the development and spread of infectious diseases and zoonoses. In its own interest, Germany must assume its responsibility here and play a pioneering role. In concrete terms, the WWF is calling for legislation at national and European level for deforestation-free and sustainable supply chains. The financial sector and government aid and economic stimulus programmes must immediately establish ecological and social criteria in addition to solvency, and monitor their gradual fulfilment. This includes the Paris climate target as well as the sustainable development targets of the United Nations. The health of people, wildlife and the environment must be consistently considered together in future: The links between habitat destruction and the worldwide loss of biodiversity on the one hand and human health on the other must be given greater weight in global health care and research. It is necessary to break down any silo thinking and tackle these challenges in an even more interdisciplinary way. It must be assumed that epidemics such as SARS, avian flu or COVID-19 are likely to increase in the future. The ecological processes that lead to such outbreaks must be better understood and taken into account. This insight must be given greater prominence in future research and funding programmes, says the WWF</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to Dietmar Bartsch, head of the Left Party parliamentary group, the federal government must "begin to take care of the financing of the Corona crisis", while the Taxpayers' Association warns against tax increases. Bartsch told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ): "Precautions must be taken, especially if spending has to increase further. A financing plan for the crisis also includes a corona levy, a one-time solidarity contribution from the super-rich, as expressly provided for in the constitution". When asked who exactly he had in mind, Bartsch explained: "Multimillionaires and billionaires." According to a survey by the Federal Ministry of Finance, which is available to the "NOZ", the aid packages, guarantees and compensation payments so far estimated by the federal government, the states, municipalities and social insurance companies add up to 1173 billion euros. The Federal Government estimates that 353 billion euros will be spent on measures affecting the budget alone. These include, for example, "Corona emergency aid for small businesses and the self-employed". The largest item in the rescue package are guarantees - for example for sureties - totalling 819 billion euros. Corona crisis will place heavy burden on public coffers "The consequences of the corona crisis will place a heavy burden on public coffers in Germany for decades to come," Reiner Holznagel, President of the Taxpayers' Association, told the "NOZ". But he also emphasized that Germany has been able to build up a solid financial foundation that will pay off in the fight against the consequences of the corona crisis. Taxpayers and contributors had contributed to this over the past ten years through their high taxes. "That's why it's forbidden to think about tax increases that would also slow down an economic recovery." New debt as low as possible Holznagel demanded that the federal and state ministries should tap their reserves and use remnants of expenditures from previous years to exhaust the current billion-euro credit authorizations only as far as absolutely necessary. Politicians must keep new debt as low as possible, the taxpayer president warned, and demanded: "When the economic situation stabilizes again, not only must the crisis-related debt be reduced, but the black zero must be tackled once again. Black zero means balanced budgets, as the federal government has had in recent years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Englisch version A new WWF analysis entitled "The loss of nature and rise of pandemics" warns of growing global health risks due to environmental degradation, with an increasing risk of further zoonoses - pathogens that spread from wild and domestic animals to humans - according to the paper. Outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such as malaria, are also directly related to deforestation. In the worst case, COVID-19 is just a foretaste of what we could be facing, the WWF warned. "An intact nature is a bulwark against new pathogens and pandemics and must finally be perceived as a decisive key factor for our health", demands Eberhard Brandes, board member at WWF Germany. Covid-19 is a global health crisis "COVID-19 is a global health crisis, combined with dramatic cuts in our daily lives. But the bitter truth is that this is a crisis with an announcement. For years, doctors and environmentalists alike have been warning that massive destruction of nature and illegal wildlife trade not only endangers the health of our planet, but also our own health." Link between deforestation and malaria diseases According to the WWF, studies from Brazil, for example, show a connection between deforestation and the increase in malaria diseases. A Brazilian study from 2010 concludes that deforestation of four percent of a forest was accompanied by an almost 50 percent increase in human cases of malaria. A similar observation was made in Africa: The construction of dams has drastically reduced the population of migrating freshwater shrimps. This led to an increase in the prey of the shrimps, certain species of snails. The snails, in turn, are intermediate hosts of the bilharzia pathogen. As a result, the disease increased in humans. "The health of humans, wildlife and the environment must be consistently considered together. We must rethink and correct our relationship with nature. The connections between healthy, diverse habitats on the one hand and human health on the other must be brought into focus in global health care," says Brandes. Stopping global deforestation The WWF Board therefore calls on the German government to act in the interests of national health care. Germany must work for an immediate halt to global deforestation and for the preservation of vital, diverse habitats.

    <TEXT>Englisch version A new WWF analysis entitled "The loss of nature and rise of pandemics" warns of growing global health risks due to environmental degradation, with an increasing risk of further zoonoses - pathogens that spread from wild and domestic animals to humans - according to the paper. Outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such as malaria, are also directly related to deforestation. In the worst case, COVID-19 is just a foretaste of what we could be facing, the WWF warned. "An intact nature is a bulwark against new pathogens and pandemics and must finally be perceived as a decisive key factor for our health", demands Eberhard Brandes, board member at WWF Germany. Covid-19 is a global health crisis "COVID-19 is a global health crisis, combined with dramatic cuts in our daily lives. But the bitter truth is that this is a crisis with an announcement. For years, doctors and environmentalists alike have been warning that massive destruction of nature and illegal wildlife trade not only endangers the health of our planet, but also our own health." Link between deforestation and malaria diseases According to the WWF, studies from Brazil, for example, show a connection between deforestation and the increase in malaria diseases. A Brazilian study from 2010 concludes that deforestation of four percent of a forest was accompanied by an almost 50 percent increase in human cases of malaria. A similar observation was made in Africa: The construction of dams has drastically reduced the population of migrating freshwater shrimps. This led to an increase in the prey of the shrimps, certain species of snails. The snails, in turn, are intermediate hosts of the bilharzia pathogen. As a result, the disease increased in humans. "The health of humans, wildlife and the environment must be consistently considered together. We must rethink and correct our relationship with nature. The connections between healthy, diverse habitats on the one hand and human health on the other must be brought into focus in global health care," says Brandes. Stopping global deforestation The WWF Board therefore calls on the German government to act in the interests of national health care. Germany must work for an immediate halt to global deforestation and for the preservation of vital, diverse habitats. Corresponding national and European laws, above all a law on deforestation-free supply chains, must now be put into effect quickly.

    <TEXT>English version Economist Sebastian Dullien warns that the EU could break up as a result of the Corona crisis. "That is not out of the question," says the academic director of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research (IMK) of the Hans B #246;ckler Foundation, which is close to the trade unions, in an interview with the daily paper "neues deutschland". Dullien therefore advocates the introduction of coronabonds. "Coronabonds would also be very important for Italy and Spain as a signal of solidarity," said Dullien. There, he said, the impression was created that they were being left alone with the corona crisis by the other EU countries. According to Dullien, these joint bonds could have a volume of one trillion euros. "That would be enough to meet the current challenges and not have a negative impact on the debt levels of individual countries," explains the economic expert. For countries like Italy, he sees the danger of a renewed national debt crisis due to the economic consequences of the Corona pandemic. Increase in short-time working allowance For Germany, Dullien recommends increasing the short-time working allowance, especially for employees in the low-wage sector. "For low incomes it should be raised to 90 percent of actual earnings. One could also stagger the increase according to the level of income, as is done in Austria," suggests Dullien.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona pandemic triggers a severe recession in Germany. Economic output will shrink by 4.2 percent this year. This is what the leading economic research institutes expect in their spring report. For the coming year, they predict a recovery and growth of 5.8 percent. In the first quarter of 2020, gross domestic product is already expected to have shrunk by 1.9 percent. In the second quarter, it then collapses by 9.8 percent as a result of the shutdown. This is the sharpest decline ever recorded in Germany since the beginning of the quarterly accounts in 1970 and more than twice as large as that recorded during the global financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009. "The recession is leaving clear traces on the labour market and the national budget," says Ifo economic boss Timo Wollmersh #228;user. "At its peak this year, the unemployment rate will skyrocket to 5.9 percent and the number of short-time workers to 2.4 million. On average, the number of unemployed will rise by almost a quarter of a million to 2.5 million compared to the previous year. Gross debt rises to 70 percent "Germany is in a good position to cope with the economic slump and in the medium term to return to the economic level that would have prevailed without the crisis," says Wollmersh #228;user. The favourable financial situation enables the state to take far-reaching measures to cushion the short-term negative consequences for companies and private households. This year, these will lead to a record deficit for the state as a whole (federal government, states, municipalities, social security) of 159 billion euros. The gross debt of the state will rise this year to 70 percent in relation to nominal gross domestic product. The downside risks are considerable The downside risks associated with this forecast are considerable. For example, the pandemic could weaken much more slowly than anticipated. It could also be less successful in restarting economic activity and trigger a new wave of infection. In addition, further infection control measures could come into effect, which could lead to a longer or more extensive shutdown of production. Distortions in the financial system as a result of increasing corporate insolvencies would become more probable, which could not be prevented by state protective shields.</TEXT>

The Solidarity study aims to improve and pool knowledge worldwide on the treatment of COVID-19. The focus is on whether and how already known drugs can help against COVID-19.

    <TEXT>The Corona crisis also has a massive financial impact on German professional football. More and more Bundesliga clubs threaten to become insolvent as a result of the suspension of play, explains DFB President Fritz Keller in the phoenix-tv daily speech. Clubs in the second and third Bundesliga are particularly affected, but also first division clubs such as SC Paderborn are threatened in their existence. "I don't believe that after the corona crisis the landscape of football will be the same as it is today. We will miss some of them and I believe that the longer this goes on, the more insolvencies we will have in professional football as well," said Keller</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The former Chairman of the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), Wolfgang Huber, paid tribute to the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was murdered on 9 April 1945, as an important adviser of the resistance against the Nazi regime and a thought leader of astonishing topicality. "The exciting thing is that Bonhoeffer was already convinced in April 1933, after the first actions of the Nazi regime against Jews, that resistance against Hitler was necessary," Huber told the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger". Initially, Bonhoeffer had opted for non-violent resistance. "He even wanted to visit Mahatma Gandhi in India to learn more about his spirituality and inspiration. As the dictatorship in Germany progressed, however, Bonhoeffer came to the conclusion that non-violence would no longer achieve anything," said Huber, who is also co-editor of Bonhoeffer's complete works. As the most important legacy of Bonhoeffer, who was condemned to death on the personal order of Adolf Hitler and hung in the Flossenb #252;rg concentration camp 75 years ago, Huber cited the ethics drafted during the conspiracy, in addition to the idea of a worldly Christianity committed to this world. Bonhoeffer's guiding principle of responsible freedom With its guiding principle of responsible freedom, it is "of astonishing topicality up to the current corona crisis", Huber continued. "We can best deal with it when we make responsible use of our freedom. Keeping our distance, avoiding contact with others - we will be able to do all this much better if we don't simply stick to prohibitions, but do what is necessary out of inner conviction. And we will be much more vigilant in monitoring whether some of these conditions may remain in place, even if they are no longer appropriate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to the SOS Children's Villages, girls and women could become the big losers of the Corona pandemic. "If we are not careful now, everything we have achieved for girls over the past decades will be destroyed and existing injustices will be further aggravated," says Katharina Ebel, emergency aid coordinator of the aid organisation. The effects extended into all areas: education, health care and a feared increase in child marriages. Education Over 90 percent of all schools worldwide are now closed. Almost 1.6 billion students are affected. "Girls are already getting much more involved in the household or looking after smaller siblings while their brothers take advantage of the opportunity to learn from home," says Katharina Ebel. It is to be feared that girls are increasingly being tied up in the household or have to look after smaller siblings instead of being able to learn, and that they will be the first to be hit when families can no longer afford to go to school due to economic problems. "This is exactly what happened in many cases after the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Biographies are being destroyed here", says Ebel Domestic violence When families are forced to live together in a confined space for an indefinite period of time, and this is accompanied by worry and stress, domestic violence is massively increased. In Hubei province in China, for example, three times as many cases of domestic violence were reported in February as in the previous year. Girls and women are the main victims. Ebel says: "It is essential that the social care networks are maintained and that women receive support in case of emergency". Child marriage The worldwide pandemic makes an increase in child marriages highly probable. "When societies get into difficulties, families get economic problems and basic care is not ensured, as we are currently experiencing worldwide, this is a breeding ground for child marriages. The probability is high that more girls will marry as a result of the crisis, for example to ensure their survival or to relieve the burden on the family," says Ebel. Care of pregnant women and babies The aid organisation also sees the care of expectant mothers and newborns at risk if clinics put all their resources into the fight against Covid-19. For example, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, maternal mortality rose by 75 percent. Ebel demands: "It is now important to take the situation of girls and women into account in all our decisions and, especially in times of crisis, to constantly review how we can better protect them. If we wait until the crisis is over, it could be too late!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the GECS survey conducted by the IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) and the ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), almost 1,000 financial experts were interviewed. The key finding of the survey is that confidence in the economy in Western Europe fell by 32 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Other indices in the survey, such as orders, employment and investment, remained stable in Western Europe. This contrasts with other parts of the world. "This is the biggest loss of confidence we have ever seen in our surveys. Yet these figures do not even reflect the full extent of the global economic contraction that is currently underway. For many respondents, de-globalization is a real scenario for the near future," says Bernardin Generalao, Director, Regional Partner Relations at IMA and responsible for the association's activities in Central Europe. Significantly lower economic output expected Respondents indicate that there will undoubtedly be a decline of 4 to 5% in global GDP and a 10% drop in production. During the 2008/09 recession, these figures were 2.5% and 6% respectively at their lowest point. Michael Taylor, ACCA's chief economist, warns that economic output will decline significantly in the near future and adds: "Data such as unemployment rates and activity surveys in the eurozone, the UK and the US suggest that economic output is declining. Emerging markets face additional difficulties as the 'flight' of investors to quality triggers capital outflows. Eurozone: States pay workers' salaries The approach taken by countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom, where the state pays a large part of the wages of employees in the companies concerned, provides the right conditions for a return to normal economic activity after the coronavirus crisis. However, due to the aftermath of this economic shock, many eurozone countries will have high public sector deficits and debt. These will far exceed the limits set for euro membership, which will lead to an inevitable increase in the risk of a new sovereign debt crisis. Even before the current economic shock, Italy, with a very high level of public debt (130% of GDP) was considered by many to be the most likely candidate for such a crisis. Now that this country has been hit so hard by the crisis, this will only intensify. De-globalisation: international economic relations are declining As the vulnerability of the various supply chains has been exposed, financial experts expect that the long-term effects of the crisis will cause international economic relations to diminish and become more regional. World trade will fall sharply this year, possibly by as much as 20%. So the big question is whether world trade will recover with the global economy or whether de-globalization will take place. pm</TEXT>

De-globalisation: international economic relations are declining As the vulnerability of the various supply chains has been exposed, financial experts expect that the long-term effects of the crisis will cause international economic relations to diminish and become more regional. World trade will fall sharply this year, possibly by as much as 20%. So the big question is whether world trade will recover with the global economy or whether de-globalization will take place. pm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In Austria, hundreds of people are still becoming newly infected every day, despite the health policy measures in force, such as self-isolation and mobility restrictions, and researchers and doctors from Danube Private University in Krems (DPU), Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU) and the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) want to help reduce the infection rate with a new project supported by the Science Department of the Province of Lower Austria. DPU professors Dr. Christoph Kleber and Dr. Ralf Braun, professors of chemistry and cell biology, together with Prof. Dr. Achim Walter Hassel from JKU Linz and Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Knoll from AIT, want to exploit a hitherto underestimated symptom of Covid-19 disease, the loss of the sense of smell and taste. "These days represent an important time window" A large majority of those infected with SARS-Cov-2 are affected several days before the classic Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and cough occur. "We are convinced that these days represent an important window of opportunity to detect the disease earlier than before and selectively isolate potential symptom-free patients and test them for the virus," said Professor Hassel. The researchers want to develop olfactory tests that are cheap and easy to use. "The rapid tests will help doctors in private practice as well as the health authorities to be able to take appropriate measures quickly if there is a suspicion of positively infected patients. The early filtering out of pre-symptomatic patients certainly has great potential to save lives," says Professor Kleber. Reducing the infection potential of the virus The planned studies in Krems and Linz, for which more than 150 students as well as teaching and administrative staff of the participating institutes were recruited as test persons, are trend-setting worldwide. "Thanks to the support of the Province of Lower Austria, Department of Science and Research, it is now possible to start work without delay, to develop applicable tests using the primary results, and thus to reduce the infection potential of the virus in the near future and save lives", says Robert Wagner MA, Director of Science and Management at DPU</TEXT>

Economic output is likely to have already shrunk by 2.3 percent in the first quarter and will then shrink by as much as 10.5 percent in the second. For the third quarter of 2020, the researchers then forecast growth of 8.7 percent, always against the previous quarter. "The corona pandemic is an unprecedented shock for the global economy," the researchers write. One consequence is drastic fluctuations in industrial production. This is likely to have already fallen by 4.4 percent in the first quarter and will then shrink by 18 percent in the second. For the third quarter, the researchers expect growth of 19 percent again.

    <TEXT>English version To cushion the effects of the corona crisis, the central banks have taken far-reaching monetary policy measures. The US Federal Reserve has lowered its interest rates and, like the European Central Bank, has expanded its bond purchase programs. In an analysis, the DIW questioned whether these measures are having the desired effect, i.e. calming the markets and supporting the real economy, although the overall economic effects cannot yet be quantified. However, initial indications of their effectiveness can be seen in the short-term reactions of share prices and bond yields. The analysis shows how interest rates and prices have reacted directly to the announcements of the central banks and what conclusions can be drawn from this for future measures. As the corona crisis worsened in March, both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) took far-reaching monetary policy measures. In several resolutions in March, including unscheduled ones, the central banks implemented key interest rate cuts, announced programmes to provide liquidity for banks and expanded the existing bond purchase programmes or set up new corona-specific ones. The scope of these measures was enormous and comparable to the first rounds of bond purchases by the USA after the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008/2009 and by the ECB in the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Differences in the monetary policy starting position Although the current monetary policy reactions of the European and the US Federal Reserve are quite similar in principle, there are noticeable differences in the respective monetary policy starting positions. Thus, the question arises to what extent these monetary policy impulses can counteract the economic consequences of the corona pandemic in the respective economies. Information on the effectiveness of monetary policy It is true that, on the basis of the current data situation, it is not yet possible to quantify the effect of these expansionary measures on macroeconomic developments. However, it was possible to determine whether and how the recent monetary policy measures had affected government bond yields and stock prices in various countries and economic sectors. This should provide initial information on the effectiveness of monetary policy.For example, government bonds are generally considered to be virtually risk-free and liquid securities and serve the market as reference values for lending rates. Expansive conventional and unconventional measures were aimed at reducing market interest rates on loans and thus supporting lending and thus macroeconomic demand. The yield response of government bonds can therefore be used to make an initial assessment of the effect of monetary policy measures. In addition, the development of share prices following monetary policy impulses should also provide an indication of whether the economic prospects of companies have changed significantly. Three important resolutions in March The Fed took three important monetary policy decisions in March of this year in view of the Corona pandemic. After the sudden rise in the number of people infected with corona virus at the end of February, especially in South Korea and Italy, made a pandemic with far-reaching economic restrictions increasingly likely, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided at an unscheduled meeting on 3 March to cut the key interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent in order to counteract possible economic risks arising from further spread of the virus. Bond purchases in the amount of 700 billion US dollars The second and probably more comprehensive decision was taken on 15 March, when the resumption of bond purchases totalling USD 700 billion was announced and the key interest rate was lowered by a further 100 basis points. The background to the second unscheduled step is likely to have been the rapid spread of the corona virus. This has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and the United States has now also seen an exponential increase in the number of people infected. In the course of the month the situation worsened further, with the US government announcing extensive fiscal policy measures and the Fed also adding to this in a statement on 23 March. In this last decision the Fed announced that it would continue to buy assets indefinitely. Fed measures do not bring about a turnaround on the stock market In general, a successful expansionary measure should cause share prices to rise, as the positive economic impulse will increase profit and thus dividend expectations. Moreover, the lower yields on safe government bonds should make equities more attractive. On the other hand, if one considers the reaction of the US equity market to the monetary policy impulses of the Federal Reserve, no positive price effects can be seen. The US equity market generally displays high volatility during the corona crisis, as can be seen from the size of the confidence bands. Effects are not significant In view of this general turbulence, the impact of the Federal Reserve's political announcements on the S amp;P 500 stock index cannot be considered significant. One exception is the announcement on March 16 that the target range for US key interest rates will be set at zero. Share prices in all economic sectors are falling significantly by eight to 15 percentage points. Particularly large price losses have been recorded in the automotive sector, the hotel and leisure industry and the banks. Food and health care sectors with the smallest losses The corona-related decline in demand is likely to be particularly pronounced in these sectors. The food retail and healthcare sectors, on the other hand, will show the smallest losses. The negative reactions of US share prices to the resolutions of 16 March could be explained by the so-called signal channel. Thus, expansionary monetary policy measures can also have a counterproductive effect because they signal that the economic situation is worse than originally assumed. No effect on government bond yields in the euro zone The ECB also reacted in March with three important monetary policy decisions to stabilise the real economy, which was suffering from the Corona crisis. On 12 March, as the situation in Italy worsened and the corona virus spread rapidly to other member states, the ECB announced within its regular meeting that it would expand the existing bond purchase programme on a moderate scale. In addition, the targeted provision of liquidity via existing programmes was extended or further reduced. Bond purchases have failed to have the desired effect The second major decision followed on 18 March with the announcement of a Corona-specific Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), which is intended to increase the volume of bonds held by the ECB by around 30 percent. The last important monetary policy decision concerned the change in the maximum share limit for the bonds held by the central bank. In the past, for example, the ECB had undertaken not to hold more than one-third of a country's government bonds, partly in order to avoid suspicion of public finance. This limit was discarded on 25 March. Overall, the expansion of bond purchases by the ECB has failed to have any effect on bond yields in the euro zone, at least on the weighted average of the monetary union. High volatility on the bond markets Thus, the first announcement on 12 March and the second announcement of the PEPP on 18 March did not have the desired effect of reducing interest rates. On the contrary, the yield curve of euro zone bonds shifted upwards around these event days. However, this rise in yields is only significant for government bonds with long maturities. The situation is different, however, following the announcement on 25 March that the limit on asset purchases would be lifted. This has shifted the yield curve downwards as desired. In view of the already high volatility on the bond markets during the Corona crisis, however, even this decline cannot be regarded as significant. Italy benefits from third ECB intervention A look at selected European countries shows that long-term government bond yields react very differently to ECB decisions. Accordingly, the ECB's first monetary policy announcement on 12th March has had only a minor impact on German, Dutch and Spanish bonds. By contrast, yields on Italian and French government bonds rose significantly by 0.2 and 0.15 percentage points respectively. Stock markets continue to fall despite ECB measures Contrary to expectations, the first two monetary policy announcements on 12 March and 18 March had a largely negative impact on the stock markets of all countries under review (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The stock indices fell by a remarkable 10 to 15 percent on 12 March and by a further five percentage points on 18 March (except in Italy). The automotive, utilities, finance and banking sectors were hardest hit by the price fall on 12 March, while healthcare, food and drug retailing and the technology sector were more moderately affected. The oil and gas, industrial production and automobile and technology sectors were particularly affected on 18th March. Equity prices fell by between five and ten percentage points. However, a recovery in equity prices of between two and five percentage points was seen on 25 March. In view of the generally high volatility of the stock indices in the weeks since the outbreak of the corona pandemic, however, it is not possible to speak of a significant price movement on this event day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The decision of US President Donald Trump to cut funding during the WHO Corona pandemic shows "the dangers of a policy that relies on individual interests rather than global action", according to the aid organisation Medico International, "The combination of nationalist action and the systematic weakening of multilateral approaches has health-threatening, even fatal, consequences", says Dr Andreas Wulf, health officer at medico international. "The only reasonable consequence of current events can only be a massive strengthening of the WHO and its independence. The corona pandemic, he said, had made visible the need for independent control of global health policy. "We are witnessing it now: a pandemic can only be contained through joint action. The virus does not stop at borders. The community of states must now massively strengthen the WHO financially so that it can assume a strong leadership role in global health care and implement a human rights-oriented approach to care. WHO had to beg for information According to Wulf, the problem began even before Trump's attack: "The WHO had to beg to get the necessary information during the crisis. This blocked rapid action, which has serious consequences especially in acute decision-making processes." The WHO must be strengthened in its independence. It needed the scope for action to produce its analyses and recommendations independently of the interest-driven influence of its increasingly private donors. "We need a global health organization that is capable of acting independently of economic interests and political particular interests. This will also apply to the issue of corona vaccines and drugs, the distribution of which should be organised by the WHO," said Wulf</TEXT>

In addition, in the Netherlands, hospital staff had hardly been tested at all. In many places the hospitals had become "turbines of the epidemic".

People from the southern, mostly Catholic provinces of Limburg and Brabant were on skiing holidays at a time when the virus was still raging largely unrecognised in Austria and northern Italy. In addition, in the Netherlands, hospital staff had hardly been tested at all. In many places the hospitals had become "turbines of the epidemic". As a result, the number of corona deaths in the Netherlands is four times higher than in North Rhine-Westphalia for a population of about the same size. Patients requiring artificial respiration must be distributed throughout the country, and clinics in Germany have also taken in Dutch patients.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The spread of the corona virus is hitting the economy hard worldwide. Exactly how hard, however, is difficult to predict. Forecasts about the course and economic consequences of epidemics are also very uncertain because there is a lack of appropriate models for the dynamics of epidemics. A message-based epidemic index, which includes media reports for the period from January 1990 to February 2020, can help to estimate the economic impact of epidemic shocks on the German and global economy, according to the DIW experts. The analysis shows that there are significant declines in production worldwide that are not being made up for, but are of a permanent nature. Resilient health care systems and expansive economic policies can help to reduce the costs of pandemics. Diseases have always accompanied people Diseases have accompanied mankind since time immemorial. Some of them are rare but devastating, costing millions of lives and bringing economic activity to a standstill. Others are common but relatively mild, such as seasonal flu. Outbreaks of corona viruses have occurred on average about once a decade since the first global outbreak in 2002. Pandemic influenza is even less frequent, about two to three times every 100 years.

It is still unclear, however, to what extent the official number of cases reflects the actual development of the epidemic, according to experts from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), but the benefits and costs of a possible relaxation of the restrictive measures can only be meaningfully considered if the number of people affected and the current rate of infection are known. Similarly, the health care systems in Germany and Europe need information on the spread of the epidemic in order to adjust capacities and ensure patient care.

Regrettable statement of the Robert Koch Institute It is unfortunate that the management of the Robert Koch Institute says that representative studies with randomised testing are "not very effective", as testing is carried out on a large scale in Germany.

    <TEXT>The complete Interview in English "Fast and unbureaucratic" was to be the state Corona emergency aid, but in many places the aid turns out to be a long and tough undertaking. Mr. Koetter, what was your professional situation when the corona crisis began? ANDREAS KOETTER: I have been working as a freelance journalist for 26 years, in the past few years for various clients, mainly in the German Bundesliga. I also write about cars, motorcycles and pop culture for some smaller publishing houses. What income did you lose during the crisis? KOETTER: Most of my income is generated from interviews with the protagonists of the German Soccer League. Without the match and because players and responsible persons had muzzled each other in the first weeks of the crisis, this income completely broke away from me. In addition, the smaller publishers mentioned above stopped agreed projects at least temporarily, since they also lost regular income, for example from advertising. When did you apply for emergency aid? KOETTER: On 27 March I submitted the application, and on 28 March I received an e-mail about the approval of 9,000 euros for the next three months. The immediate aid was to be fast and unbureaucratic. What is the reality in your case? K #214;TTER: Like about 4,000 other affected people, I have not received any money to date. And I am not the only one who feels that the responsible persons in NRW, according to the Ministry of Economics and the district governments responsible for disbursement, are even boasting about their "immediate help". In your opinion, what are the reasons why you have not received any money so far? KOETTER: The application was possible from March 27th, about 4 p.m. That there would be an enormous rush was foreseeable, but was obviously not considered by those responsible. The consequence was that the server was completely overloaded, so that one had to start again and again to upload the form. The consequences were a complete mess. I know from my colleagues and acquaintances that many have received several authorisations for one and the same application, in one case there were even nine authorisations. I too received two authorisations. The reason for this is that the server sometimes created so-called duplicates on its own. However, since the authorities pointed out that double or multiple payments were not technically possible, I initially decided to no bigger thoughts. What happened next? KOETTER: In the days that followed, I read and heard from an increasing number of applicants, including some I knew, who had applied for a loan at the beginning of April and had the money in their accounts within 48 hours. And I was not alone in this scepticism. On the Facebook page of the NRW Ministry of Economic Affairs there were hundreds of contributions from people who were also affected and who were getting more and more desperate from day to day. No one page provided any valid information. Neither the Ministry of Economic Affairs nor the district governments responded to the numerous inquiries with meaningful answers. Instead, from the Easter week at the latest, they were only put off with standardised sentences such as "Have a little more patience and stay healthy". A few days later, even these answers were still not forthcoming, and the connections to the respective hotlines were no longer available. What did you do? KOETTER: I tried in various ways to gather information, or at least to get a sense of desperation from those responsible. For many, the initial anger about the failure of the authorities had meanwhile given way to fatalism. But despite the failures I tried it further and wrote to the office of the NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet three times in the days shortly before Easter. I also contacted the press office of the district government of Cologne, in the hope that a colleague could be approached collegially and at least with a clear information would help. Instead, however, here too I was merely put off and, with today's knowledge it must be said so clearly, I was downright lied to. The reason for this shabby behaviour was finally revealed on 9 April. Because of presumably fraudulent Internet sites, the payments of the Corona aid were stopped on that day. No one can tell me that this stop was a jerking off action that only occurred to those responsible this morning. In fact, this intention and the associated procedure must have been known to all the authorities involved for days - which is once again proof that 4,000 people (this is the number the authorities themselves state) had been lied to over days. What do you think about the actions of politics and administration in North Rhine-Westphalia and do you understand why the immediate aid was stopped? KOETTER: Of course I understand that in view of the obviously partly very well organized criminal machinations one could not simply look away, but had to do something. I have no understanding for the foreseeable, but not prevented technical disaster in the days from March 27th to 30th - keyword server- Capacity - and even less for the stalling tactics and lies used to try to silence desperate people who feared and still fear for their existence. The way in which these people were treated in those days just before Easter simply speaks of shabby behaviour. What is your current situation? KOETTER: I've had virtually no business since early March, and I've had no income. Since March 27th I have been waiting for the immediate help, which is oh so praised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs NRW. I don't have to say any more about it. What happens if the help does not come or comes too late? KOETTER: Good question, all the more so since an end to the situation is not foreseeable. In a few days I will have to live on my overdraft, which fortunately is quite comfortable but also expensive. Somewhere deep inside, I still hope that the NRW government will keep its promise "If you have a permit, you get money". Most of the time, however, I fear that many of the 4,000 people affected will be left standing in the rain and shrugging their shoulders as they lose their livelihood. Those responsible for this disaster should hope that not too many of these people have read Kleist's "Michael Kohlhaas</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The high mortality rate in Covid-19 patients could be caused by pulmonary embolism, according to medical experts. Up to now, the "shock lung" has been considered the main cause of death in Covid-19 patients, i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome triggered by an overreaction of the immune system. However, there are now indications that blocked pulmonary vessels could be a cause of sudden death. If seriously ill patients were given blood thinners at an early stage, it might be possible to "prevent the severe coagulation disorder caused by this virus and reduce mortality," the cardiologist, angiologist and pulmonary embolism specialist Nils Kucher of the University Hospital of Zurich told the Berlin-based "Tagesspiegel" newspaper. Pulmonary embolisms are rarely detected So far, pulmonary embolisms have hardly been detected in Covid-19 patients because the necessary imaging examinations such as computer tomographies are rarely carried out on infected patients. However, in patients who have been diagnosed using this method, more than one third of the blocked vessels in the lungs have been discovered, Kucher told the newspaper "Tagesspiegel". Kucher believes that sudden pulmonary embolisms are responsible for the death of the 1200 Covid 19 victims in Switzerland, of whom an estimated 75 percent died at home.

    <TEXT>English version The high mortality rate in Covid-19 patients could be caused by pulmonary embolism, according to medical experts. Up to now, the "shock lung" has been considered the main cause of death in Covid-19 patients, i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome triggered by an overreaction of the immune system. However, there are now indications that blocked pulmonary vessels could be a cause of sudden death. If seriously ill patients were given blood thinners at an early stage, it might be possible to "prevent the severe coagulation disorder caused by this virus and reduce mortality," the cardiologist, angiologist and pulmonary embolism specialist Nils Kucher of the University Hospital of Zurich told the Berlin-based "Tagesspiegel" newspaper.

    <TEXT>English version Migration researcher Jochen Oltmer of the University of Osnabr #252;ck has contradicted the thesis that growing poverty as a result of the Corona pandemic will increase migration, Oltmer told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung": "There is much to be said for the exact opposite effect. For one must always remember that migration across the borders of countries or even continents is expensive. And as economic conditions deteriorate due to the pandemic, migration tends to be more difficult". Oltmer stressed: "At the moment we are talking more about immobilization and less about mobilization. A central statement of migration research from many studies says: Poverty hinders migration, poverty prevents migration, poverty tends to make people stuck. The researcher also anticipates that borders will become more and more rigid and that states will become more willing to close themselves off - in Europe, but also worldwide. He also sees this in the increased use of state-of-the-art surveillance technologies such as satellites and drones. As a result, the possibility of controlling and monitoring movements has grown considerably in recent years and especially since 2015. "There is no reason to believe that the Americans or the Europeans will abandon it at this time." Stigmatization and prejudice have a long history Oltmer also complained of increasing stigmatisation and discrimination of foreigners and migrants "because they are considered potential carriers of the virus". This is a considerable problem for those affected, but also for Western countries, as they are dependent on foreign workers, for example in the care sector. According to the researcher, it is also problematic "that such stigmatisation and prejudices last for a long time". The assumption that "migration equals health hazard" is misleading, at least in the Corona crisis.

    <TEXT>English version The German Word Hunger Aid regrets that public funds for development cooperation have remained stable over the past year. The OECD has published the provisional ODA (Official Development Assistance) quotas for 2019, which calculate the financial resources for development cooperation in relation to economic performance. At 0.6 percent, Germany is almost at the same level as in 2018. Stabilizing ODA spending is not enough in view of the global corona crisis, as the need for aid is increasing dramatically. "The corona crisis will be followed by a recession that is expected to plunge 14-23 million people into poverty and hunger. The majority of people in developing countries are informally employed and have hardly any social security. For them the economic crisis is life-threatening, especially for women and children. Developing countries now need additional ODA funds to be able to put together a rescue package as well. Otherwise the poorest will pay the highest price. Now is the time to close the gap on the international commitment of 0.7 percent," says Mathias Mogge, Secretary General of German Agro Action.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The family office of Mark Zuckerberg, Iconiq Capital, is increasingly looking for investments in German start-ups, according to the business magazine 'Capital'. According to industry insiders, Iconiq Capital has already looked at several young start-ups in Germany in recent months. So far, the Facebook boss' investment vehicle has held back in Europe. One of the few European start-up bets is the Dutch payment provider Adyen, in which Iconiq took a stake five years ago. With great success: the 40 million dollars invested are now worth about ten times that amount, as confidential Iconiq documents show. Corona crisis could slow down investors When asked by Capital, the company did not comment on the information. However, the acute corona crisis could slow down US investors somewhat in the coming weeks. Investment companies such as Iconiq Capital, however, are unlikely to pull out in general due to the pandemic, as they are sitting on too much money for that. Iconiq Capital, for example, manages a total of 6.7 billion dollars and has documents available to 'Capital'. These documents only concern the growth fund for start-ups, with further money being invested in real estate. Company is one of the venture capitalists Iconiq is one of the world's largest venture capitalists and has financed the video platform Zoom and the leasing start-up Airbnb. The current fund has a total of 1.8 billion dollars. In comparison: Europe's largest start-up fund is just over a billion dollars and belongs to the Berlin-based company Rocket Internet. Iconiq Capital is not only Zuckerberg's own money, other tech celebrities have also invested, such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Iconiq uses this prominent network to promote itself: apart from Zuckerberg, the advisory board includes KKR boss Henry Kravis and Yahoo founder Jerry Yang</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In view of the current death penalty report of the human rights organisation Amnesty International, the chairwoman of the Bundestag's Committee on Human Rights, Gyde Jensen (FDP), has called on the federal government to work for the immediate abolition of the death penalty in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jensen told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". According to the report, 184 people were executed in the country last year, more than at any time since records began. "Saudi Arabia sets a sad record, but at the moment the country can still adorn itself with the G-20 presidency. The German government must not take part in this staging, but must point out the catastrophic human rights situation at every meeting and demand the immediate abolition of the death penalty," Jensen told the NOZ. Amnesty documents 657 executions in 20 countries worldwide in 2019, the lowest number in ten years. "That makes us optimistic. But we must not allow ourselves to be distracted by this worldwide trend," Jensen said. For China, Amnesty estimates thousands of executions, but these are treated as state secrets in China. "We must always keep reports like this latest Amnesty Report in mind when Chinese President Xi Jinping is once again proving to be an international human rights advocate. A country in which thousands of people are murdered by the state every year has completely lost its moral authority and must never, in any form whatsoever, become a model for others," said Jensen. Death penalty in Belarus Belarus is the only European country that continues to impose and execute the death penalty "in secret", Jensen said. "There too, this cruel practice must end immediately! Germany must also make a strong commitment to this within the framework of its EU Council Presidency," demanded the human rights politician.</TEXT>

According to the International Labour Organization, more than half of the working population in Latin America and the Caribbean works informally, i.e. without employment contracts and insurance protection. Retailers and street vendors, shoeshine boys and day labourers - they are threatened by bitter poverty and hunger. Those who do not come to work are not paid and therefore have nothing to eat. Added to this are food shortages and rising prices. People are at least as afraid of hunger as they are of the virus. Quarantine measures can hardly be implemented Quarantine measures are often hardly implementable. Many people in a confined space are the norm in the poor sections of the population. Often there is neither running water nor soap or even disinfectants. The risk of people breaching quarantine due to hunger is real. The health systems are completely overburdened Not to mention the possibility of getting medical help in case of illness. Public hospitals are not accessible for many. The resources and equipment with hospitals, intensive care beds and medical staff are miles away from western standards in most Latin American countries. Even without Corona, there is no adequate supply of the population.

    <TEXT>The German Federal Government plans a significant expansion of rapid tests for the detection of corona infection, as reported by the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger". "We will introduce a law that will also give veterinarians the opportunity to test", SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach told the newspaper. "This will significantly increase capacity", the member of parliament explained. According to current considerations, the corresponding law should be introduced into the Bundestag on May 21 in a first reading. Due to limited laboratory capacities, it has not been possible to carry out more rapid corona tests so far. If laboratories of veterinarians could also be used, this would lead to a "considerable expansion" of the examination possibilities: "Up to now, the laboratories have been the bottleneck", Lauterbach explained. "It would make sense to use the additional capacities in order to reduce the risk of infection in clinics, nursing homes and schools". However, comprehensive tests are probably unrealistic in Germany. Detecting corona diseases without symptoms With the so-called PCR tests, one can detect acute corona disease even when no symptoms are present. Lauterbach said that it is particularly important to identify these patients in order to prevent the spread of the pathogen in sensitive areas. Such a test currently costs 59 euros; results are usually available within two days. "With an expansion of the test capacities, we can probably speed up the speed considerably," said the SPD politician</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery has criticised the planned almost nationwide compulsory wearing of masks: "I wear a mask myself, out of politeness and solidarity, but I think a legal obligation is wrong," Montgomery told the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". "Anyone who wears a mask is sure to think that they are forgetting the only decisive minimum distance," the physician emphasized. Masks could become dangerous if used improperly. The virus is concentrated in the material, when you take it off you touch the skin of your face, there is hardly a faster way to get infected. Montgomery went on to explain that there can only be a legal obligation to wear a mask for real protective masks - an obligation for scarves or shawls is "ridiculous". At the same time, he pointed out that all "genuinely effective masks" for medical personnel, nursing staff and those at risk were still needed.

    <TEXT>English version More than two thirds of Germans (69 percent) believe that climate change is as serious a crisis in the long term as the current COVID 19 pandemic. Worldwide, 71 percent of people see it that way, in China, the figure is as high as 81 percent of those surveyed in a study. Only one in four German citizens (24 percent) is more concerned about the spread of the corona virus in the long term than the climate crisis. This is the result of a recent survey of 28,000 people in 14 countries conducted by the market and opinion research company Ipsos between 16 and 19 Countries heavily affected by the coronavirus in particular see an equal risk from climate change Worldwide, as many as seven out of ten respondents (71%) state that they consider the respective danger posed by COVID-19 and climate change to be of equal importance. It is interesting to note that China (87%) and some other countries heavily affected by the virus, such as France (76%), Spain (73%) and Italy (72%), agree with this statement. In Australia, where devastating bushfires raged earlier this year, comparatively few people (59%) believe that climate change is as serious a crisis as the COVID 19 pandemic. Economic recovery should not come at the expense of the climate A majority of citizens also believe that the recovery of the economy after the Corona crisis must not be at the expense of the environment. In Germany, as many as 57 percent of those surveyed consider it important that future government measures to strengthen the economy should always also focus on climate change. Worldwide, as many as two-thirds of all respondents (65%) are calling for this, but particularly frequently in India (81%), China and Mexico (80% each). Only one in three would approve of environmentally damaging measures Consequently, only one in three Germans (36%) believes that the government should now focus primarily on economic recovery, even if this means taking measures that are bad for the environment. Just over half of the German population (55%) opposes this. Only in China (59%) and France (58%) would environmentally damaging measures for the benefit of the economy be even more unpopular than in Germany</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the Corona crisis, 50 percent of German companies are using short-time work, 18 percent want to cut jobs. That is the preliminary result of the latest survey conducted by the Ifo Institute in April. In the retail sector, 55 percent of companies are currently on short-time work, in industry 53 percent, in service providers 48 percent and in construction only 37 percent. "For many companies, short-time work is a means of choice to cushion short-term sales losses and retain their staff," says Klaus Wohlrabe, who heads the ifo surveys.To apply for short-time work, overtime and time credits must first be reduced. These measures were initiated by 69 percent of the companies. In industry the figure is 78 percent, in trade 68 percent, in service providers 65 percent and in construction 54 percent. Layoffs and no extension of temporary jobs 18 percent of companies want to lay off employees or not extend temporary jobs. In industry and service providers the figures are 20 percent each, 15 percent in trade and only 2 percent in construction. 46 percent of the companies want to postpone investments, including 56 percent in industry, 44 percent in service providers, 38 percent in trade and 31 percent in construction. On average, the companies expect the restrictions on public life to last around 3.9 months.

    <TEXT>English version In German research institutions millions of animals are bred, but then killed without further scientific use. This was reported by the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ) referring to an answer of the federal government to a question of the Greens. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture expects about 3.9 million animals to be killed in 2017. "These were primarily mice (85 percent) and zebra fish (14 percent)," the ministry added in response to an inquiry from the "NOZ". This was the first time that this figure was collected in this form and reported to the EU Until now, the Federal Government had only reported how many animals were used for experiments or, for example, killed for the purpose of organ removal. In 2017, this was approximately 2.8 million animals. Renate K #252;nast, spokeswoman for animal protection policy for the Greens in the Bundestag, criticized in the "NOZ" that the government's previous statistics were "obviously embellished". "For every animal that appears in the annual statistics, one or two more animals are killed", K #252;nast said. She called on the federal government to work out a plan to phase out animal experiments. The reason for killing may be that the animals in the course of breeding do not have the characteristics required for the specific experiment. According to the federal government, 12.6 million experimental animals were killed across Europe in 2017 without having been used for further research.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Since the Colombian government also ordered the country to shut down for fear of the coronavirus, thousands of Venezuelan refugees have been returning to their economically shaken homes for fear of survival. "But there is nothing for them there either, no food, no work, let alone medical care in case of corona infection," says Angela Rosales, director of SOS Children's Villages in Colombia. The aid organisation warns of a triple danger for children and young people: In Colombia 1.5 million Venezuelan refugees currently live in Colombia, almost all of them working in the so-called informal sector without social security. As a result of the Corona measures, the refugees lose their already meagre income. "Families who already live from hand to mouth on normal days can no longer pay their rents, buy medicine, or know how to save their children from starving," says Rosales. As drastic as that sounds, in the worst case, people would have to decide whether they would rather die in a foreign country or at home.

Worst economic crisis in the history of the continent Once back in Venezuela, according to SOS Children's Villages, the worst that can happen to people worldwide is death: the economy is suffering from the worst crisis in the continent's history, and acute fuel shortages would exacerbate the bottlenecks in the supply of food to the population.

    <TEXT>English version Since the Colombian government also ordered the country to shut down for fear of the coronavirus, thousands of Venezuelan refugees have been returning to their economically shaken homes for fear of survival. "But there is nothing for them there either, no food, no work, let alone medical care in case of corona infection," says Angela Rosales, director of SOS Children's Villages in Colombia. The aid organisation warns of a triple danger for children and young people: In Colombia 1.5 million Venezuelan refugees currently live in Colombia, almost all of them working in the so-called informal sector without social security. As a result of the Corona measures, the refugees lose their already meagre income. "Families who already live from hand to mouth on normal days can no longer pay their rents, buy medicine, or know how to save their children from starving," says Rosales. As drastic as that sounds, in the worst case, people would have to decide whether they would rather die in a foreign country or at home.

    <TEXT>English version In the Corona crisis, the Aral parent company BP Europa SE deliberately refrains from short-time work despite significantly reduced production. "As BP, we have clearly decided that we do not want to burden the state treasury when we pay dividends as a BP Group," BP European boss Wolfgang Langhoff told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. "From today's perspective, we are also not planning any job cuts because of Corona," he added. In Germany BP employs around 4600 people, of whom about 800 work at the administrative location in Bochum and 2000 at the refinery in Gelsenkirchen. BP European boss Langhoff considers accusations that fuel prices in Germany are too high in view of the rapidly falling crude oil prices to be unfounded. "Even if a litre of E10 would cost nothing at the filling station, 65.5 cents energy tax plus 19 percent VAT, i.e. a total of around 78 cents in taxes, would have to be paid to the state". Currently, fuel prices in Germany are "very low".</TEXT>

This is the lowest value ever measured. There has not yet been a stronger decline. This is mainly due to the massive deterioration of the current situation. In addition, companies have never been so pessimistic about the coming months. The Corona crisis is hitting the German economy with full force. In manufacturing, the business climate index has fallen to its lowest level since March 2009. The current business situation of industrial companies deteriorated dramatically. Expectations are marked by massive pessimism. The expectation indicator fell to a historic low. Demand for industrial products has collapsed. In the service sector, the business climate indicator fell to a low. Service providers have never assessed their situation so badly before.

    <TEXT>English version The child rights organisation Save the Children regrets the violations of the two-week ceasefire in Yemen and demands an immediate stop to the fighting in view of the Corona pandemic. The ceasefire declared by the military alliance led by Saudi Arabia was announced on 9 April and ended on 23 April. At least 38 civilians were killed or injured during this period. Among them were five children who lost their lives in attacks and at least six others who were injured in various attacks. In 29 cases, civilian homes were hit. This is the second ceasefire announcement since the beginning of the global COVID 19 pandemic, which reached Yemen on 10 April with a first case of infection. The fighting had prevented effective prevention against the further spread of the novel coronavirus. Complete lack of political will Xavier Joubert, Country Director of Save the Children in Yemen, said: "It is extremely disappointing that the warring parties were unable to lay down their weapons even for two weeks to avert the most immediate threat facing Yemen at the moment: the possible spread of COVID-19. This shows a complete lack of political will on the part of all those involved in this conflict to work in a peaceful direction. The civilian population is paying the highest possible price for this inability every day".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In view of the restrictions on many basic Wolfgang Sch #228;uble, President of the German parliament, has warned against subordinating everything else to the protection of life in the Corona crisis: "When I hear that everything else has to step back from the protection of life, then I have to say that this is not right in this absoluteness", said Sch #228;uble in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel". "If there is an absolute value in our constitution, then it is the dignity of man. It is inviolable. But it does not exclude the possibility that we have to die," Sch #228;uble stressed. "The state must guarantee the best possible health care for everyone. But people will continue to die of Corona," said the CDU politician. "With all the previous burdens and at my age I am a high-risk group. But my fear is limited. We all die. And I think younger people are actually at a much higher risk than me. My natural end is a little bit closer. The mood of the population can get out of hand Sch #228;uble warned that a tipping point in the mood of the population could soon be reached. "It will become more difficult the longer it takes." Health minister Jens Spahn was right when he said that everyone still had a lot to learn from each other and maybe in a few weeks we will find out that we did some things better differently. "We all do not know what effects our actions will have, but politicians must act nevertheless", said Sch #228;uble. Taking back will be much more difficult The way back from standstill is the much more difficult one. "One must proceed carefully, step by step, and be prepared to learn. Some say, if it was too much, you have to take it back." But it's much harder to take it back.

    <TEXT>English version Infectiologist and intensive care physician Peter Walger from Bonn has warned against exaggerated hopes for an anti-corona app. "I do not expect the app to provide any real help in trying to return to normality," the spokesman of the board of the German Society for Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "If everyone wore mouthguards and kept their distance, it would be superfluous, because then it would only recognize the uncritical proximity of protected people." The planned smartphone application "says nothing about whether there is an actual risk of infection, but only defines the proximity of a person to a potentially infectious person," the infectiologist explained his scepticism. Safety brings testing of high-risk groups "A lot of security would be provided by testing high-risk groups and additionally all employees who have access to them, for example tests once or twice a week," said the expert, adding: "As long as we don't test extensively, there will be infected people where the infection is not known, and positively tested people who do not use the app. The system will be so full of holes that we won't be able to see how the app is supposed to provide new security". In the initial phase of an epidemic with few so-called super spreader events such as a champagne meeting in South Korea, a tracing app for contact tracing might be useful. But even if events with up to 100 participants were again made possible in Germany, the app would not help, said Walger. "If everyone there wears a face mask, if distance is maintained, then the app is of no use," said the DGKH board spokesman. In Germany, Covid-19 is increasingly spreading in nursing homes and possibly also in hospitals, he said. Walger explained that the app does not help these institutions either. "There, tests must be carried out across the board, and only negative or future-proofed Immune are allowed into the facilities. If this is not possible, the protective barrier must be raised so high that only people wearing masks are allowed to enter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version An interview with Niko H #228;rting, Professor at the Berlin School of Economics and Law, about the introduction of compulsory masks and the restriction of other basic rights during the Corona pandemic. Professor H #228;rting, can people feel restricted in their basic rights by wearing a mask? NIKO H #196;RTING: Yes, the Basic Law protects the general freedom of action. If I am not allowed to enter a supermarket or bookstore without "mouth and nose cover", this restricts my freedom of action. This applies especially to people with physical disabilities, for whom there are no exceptions. For deaf and dumb people, the obligation to wear a mask means a ban on communication. Are there legal possibilities to defend oneself against wearing a mask? H #196;RTING: Yes, you can defend yourself against the obligation to wear a mask by filing an urgent application with the administrative court. The outcome of such proceedings is uncertain. Do people who are cured of Covid-19 also have to wear masks? Can they take legal action against wearing a mask? H #196;RTING: Yes, the obligation to wear a mask also applies to people who are cured. Those who wish to oppose this should file an urgent application with the Administrative Court. To what extent can not wearing a mask be "criminalised"? Are the police resources sufficient to punish violations? H #196;RTING: On the website of the Hessian state government it says that they want to punish "repeated offences" with a fine of 50 euros. There is no legal basis for this amount. Furthermore, it is said that it will be decided "on a case-by-case basis" which penalties will be imposed on shop owners who do not enforce the obligation to wear masks. No punishment without law. This is a constitutional principle which is obviously not taken very seriously in Hesse when it comes to the obligation to wear masks. Anyone who gets a fine should go to a lawyer he trusts. What fundamental rights were restricted in the pandemic? H #196;RTING: There is hardly a fundamental right that is not currently drastically restricted: freedom of movement, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly, freedom of occupation for entire occupational groups that are unable to exercise their profession, freedom of ownership for entire industries. The fundamental right to marriage and family and the inviolability of the home are also affected when visitation bans are imposed in Corona ordinances. Where do you see the strongest restriction(s)? H #196;RTING: Compared to the other restrictions on fundamental rights, the obligation to wear a mask is a mild intervention. Particularly problematic are the serious restrictions on freedom of assembly, the ban on worship and - in many federal states - bans on receiving visits from friends and relatives in one's own home. Is the government moving into legally secure territory here? H #196;RTING: No. One day the Federal Constitutional Court will decide whether it was at all permissible to issue decrees restricting fundamental rights - bypassing the parliaments. I mean no. These are the most serious restrictions that the Basic Law has ever seen. Some of the restrictions are excessive and will sooner or later be examined extremely critically by the Federal Constitutional Court. What do you think about a Corona App? H #196;RTING: There have been discussions about a corona app for weeks. But it does not exist yet. Only when there is a functioning app will it be possible to say whether it does what many people expect it to do. I don't understand a policy that focuses on an app yet to be developed and a future vaccine. People are expecting miracles from science and technology and have no plan B. mei About the person: Niko H #228;rting (born 1964) studied at the Free University of Berlin (FU) and founded H #228;rting Rechtsanw #228;lte in 1996. He teaches at the Berlin School of Economics and Law and the FU Berlin.</TEXT>

This is the result of an evaluation of the Ifo surveys in April among about 8800 companies from almost all industries. The estimate was based on the companies' data on capacity utilisation in January and April and the actual and expected change in sales in the first and second quarters. "This means that gross domestic product is likely to have fallen by 1.9 percent in the first quarter and then slump by 12.2 percent in the second," says Timo Wollmersh #228;user, head of the ifo economic forecasts.

    <TEXT>English version Many German companies see their existence threatened by the Corona crisis, according to an Ifo survey. 29.2 percent of the companies surveyed said they could survive for three months or less if the pandemic-related restrictions were to remain in place for a longer period. Six months or less would allow 52.7 percent to survive. "These are worrying figures that point to a coming wave of bankruptcies," says Klaus Wohlrabe, head of the Ifo surveys. The situation in April was particularly critical in the retail sector: 44.9 percent of companies replied that they could hold out for a maximum of three months. And a total of 63.2 percent of retailers said that they could hold out for a maximum of six months. 31.3 percent of service providers said that they could hold out for a quarter or less. And a total of 56 percent of service providers have to announce bankruptcy after six months at the latest.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version South Africa's black population is particularly vulnerable in the Corona crisis. The SOS Children's Villages warn of a catastrophe that is currently looming in the slums: "It is no coincidence that infection rates are soaring, especially in the black communities - that is the legacy of apartheid," says Patrick Kulati, head of the aid organisation in South Africa. Especially in the townships, the slums inhabited by black people, it is simply impossible to protect oneself due to the narrowness and lack of sanitary facilities, which is why the virus spreads much faster here. The people there also have neither the money nor the space to store sufficient food. Hunger is increasing drastically and threatens above all the lives of children. "The townships were created during the apartheid era to separate the black population - in far too small a space and far from all job opportunities. This was a systematic manifestation of poverty," says Kulati. Social differences are greater today than ever The social differences are greater today than ever. "In no other country is prosperity so unequally distributed as in South Africa," says Kulati. The youth unemployment rate is 60 percent, and almost without exception black and coloured people are affected. It is to be feared that the gap between rich and poor will widen further as a result of the Corona pandemic, as the economic consequences will also hit the poorest much harder. The informal sector is virtually idle and the poor population has practically no opportunity to work from home. The World Bank is already expecting poverty in South Africa to increase by nine percent this year as a result of Corona. "We must now do everything we can to protect and include these people! This is the only way we can stop the corona virus - and prevent injustice in South Africa from taking on even more dramatic forms," says Kulati</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The federal government is procuring 4.5 million doses of influenza vaccine to prevent corona and influenza infections in autumn and winter. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ): "Caring for many flu and corona patients at the same time could overtax our health system. With a view to the next flu season, we are making it possible for doctors to stockpile more vaccine doses, and for the first time we are procuring an additional 4.5 million vaccine doses against flu directly as the federal government". The Corona pandemic will most likely not be over next winter, Spahn explained. "So we are preparing for it in time." In a resolution passed by the Corona cabinet on Monday, which is available to the "NOZ", it says the doses must be ordered "quickly in the next few days", as the manufacturers are currently planning and deciding on their capacities and distribution to the states. According to the report, Spahn's ministry has already obtained offers for a total of 4.65 million cans from three manufacturers. The federal cabinet is expected to give the green light this Wednesday for higher vaccine stocks by doctors and an expansion of vaccination reimbursement by the health insurance companies. Risk groups to be protected According to the decision of the Corona Cabinet, risk groups such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, who are "equally at risk" from Covid-19 and influenza, are to be protected. In order to avoid overburdening the health care system, it is therefore necessary to achieve "a much more comprehensive vaccination of the population against influenza than in previous years". To achieve this goal, the Ministry of Health was commissioned to draw up a "supplementary vaccination concept". However, the introduction of compulsory flu vaccination at least for risk groups is "not an issue", a ministry spokesperson said. According to the Techniker Krankenkasse [health insurance company for technicians] last fall, only one in ten citizens has been vaccinated against influenza in the 2017/2018 season. Among those over 60 years of age, for whom vaccination is expressly recommended, the figure was only 33.4 percent. This was well below the EU target of 75 percent for this group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The coronavirus is plunging almost the entire world into recession. This is the result of the latest survey by the Ifo Institute, in which 1000 experts in 110 countries took part. According to the survey, global economic output will shrink by 1.9 percent this year. "This is an unprecedentedly low figure since the survey began in 1989," say researchers Dorine Boumans, Sebastian Link and Stefan Sauer of the Ifo Institute. According to the survey, the eurozone has been hit particularly hard, with a decline of 5.3 percent, and Italy in particular, with a decline of 7.0 percent. For Germany and France, the experts forecast minus 5.0 percent each, for Great Britain minus 3.6 percent and for Spain minus 3.4 percent. USA with a minus of 4.6 per cent The USA is estimated at minus 4.6 percent, Brazil at minus 4.2 percent, Russia and South Africa at minus 3.4 percent each, and Japan at minus 3.3 percent. Even the growth world champions China and India will only increase slightly, by 2.3 and 2.5 percent respectively. Reducing investment is a major problem According to the experts, the most problematic is a reduction in investment, followed by an increase in government deficits, a contraction in consumer spending, plant closures and production stops, quarantine measures, disruptions in supply chains and company bankruptcies. They consider the consequences of waves of staff illness and bank failures to be minor. Liquidity support for companies The experts regard these as particularly helpful countermeasures: liquidity support for smaller companies, tax deferrals for firms, liquidity support for large companies, the purchase of securities by central banks and temporary reductions in VAT. They are more sceptical about interest rate cuts, permanent tax cuts, helicopter money and relaxed bank supervision. Return to pre-crisis performance levels The experts surveyed by the Ifo expect a return to pre-crisis performance levels only after a time lag. They are most optimistic in the emerging and developing countries, where 34 percent expect this to happen this year.

For sub-Saharan Africa, 20.7 percent think so, and 18.7 percent for the Middle East and North Africa. The bottom of the league is the EU, where only 6.7% of the experts surveyed expect this to happen as early as 2</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version An interview with British songwriter Billy Bragg about Covid-19, the intrigues against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the art of freedom. Mr Bragg, has Covid-19 heralded the end of globalisation and is it also promoting the rise of a new nationalism? BRAGG: Globalisation has led to an epidemic of outsourcing, which, as the pandemic has shown, leaves huge gaps in domestic production of vital goods and equipment. And just as we have locked ourselves in our homes, so each nation has closed its borders for the duration of the epidemic. The global economy will eventually reopen, but governments will certainly strive to strengthen the resilience of their economies to future shocks. So I think there will be a regression from globalization, and economic nationalism may well come to the fore. During the Corona crisis, the much-acclaimed Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also resigned. Has he ultimately become a victim of brexite or his own party? BRAGG: I don't think any Labour leader could have overcome the Tories' three-word electoral program on Get Brexit Done. 17 million people voted to leave the EU, and they all supported the party that promised to stop dithering and make it happen. So Labour was the victim of brexit, the Tories' original plan - to give itself a distinctive platform in a post-ideological political landscape. At the same time, it is increasingly likely that there were forces within the Labour bureaucracy that were actively working to prevent Corbyn from winning the 2017 and 2019 elections. If this is true, heads must roll. You have now also spoken out with a very political book. What made you decide to write instead of protest songs against the injustices in the world? BRAGG: The last few years have been a challenge for those of us who believe that the first step on the road to a better society is to curb our own cynicism. It's hard to resist the urge to put your head back under the covers until things get better. But I have always believed that the best antidote to cynicism is activism. So I have tried to respond to this challenge by writing a book instead of sticking to my usual format, the polemic song.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The press conferences and speeches by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Corona crisis are changing expectations in Germany. This is the result of a research paper in which scientists from the ifo Institute are involved together with scientists from DIW, LMU Munich, HU Berlin and FU Berlin. "According to the Chancellor's press conference on 15 April, the propensity to consume among German citizens has fallen by about one fifth," says Andreas Peichl, head of the Ifo Centre for Macroeconomics and Surveys. "We measured this against the extraordinary expenditures planned by the budgets. They fell on average from 2990 euros in the week before the press conference to 2327 euros on average in the week after," says Peichl. On Thursday next week Merkel will again consult with the state premiers* of the federal states and is expected to comment on the Corona crisis again afterwards. Many measures were extended The Chancellor's speeches also have a noticeable impact on other expectations. After the press conference on 15 April, the point in time at which everyone expected the society to be fully opened up was moved considerably later, to the beginning of November, despite the announcement of initial easing of tensions. The expectation of when normal school lessons could take place again was also shifted back by three weeks. Likewise, the expectation of when the Bundesliga can play with spectators* again (not before 2021) was postponed. Politics can change behaviour "Politics, here in particular in the person of Angela Merkel, can change expectations and thus also economic behaviour through public statements. Irrespective of whether the measures announced are targeted or not, this is enormously helpful for the government's ability to act, but it can also lead to undesirable side-effects," says Peichl. Expectation management is effective so far "The expectations management of politics in the Corona crisis has been effective so far. Our empirical analyses provide clear evidence that political statements, especially those made by Angela Merkel, have had a substantial influence on expectations and consumer intentions," says Peter Haan, Head of the State Department at DIW Berlin. "Expectation management also has something to do with credibility, and it is important that politicians do not gamble it away". Data from an online survey were evaluated Daily data from an online survey conducted by the Civey Institute between April 2nd and 20th, commissioned by the institutes and funded by the Collaborative Research Center TRR 190 of the German Research Foundation were used. A total of around 50,000 people were asked during this period about their expectations as to how long the current restrictions on public life will continue and whether the respondents plan to spend more on consumption in the coming months.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Professional associations for intensive care medicine in Germany have drawn up a joint declaration on the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The five associations are thus reacting to the criticism of individual doctors with little experience in intensive care medicine, according to which intubation and ventilation of Covid-19 patients is allegedly a dubious therapy. The professional associations respond to this, among other things: The attempts of individual doctors to stir up fear of ventilation in the media led to unnecessary uncertainty among patients. The allegations could not be supported by the scientific data available to date. The wording of the statement The German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI), the "Professional Association of German Anaesthetists" (BDA), the "German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine" (DGP), the "German Society for Internal Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine" (DGIIN) and the "German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) jointly represent the majority of German intensive care medicine and state Non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation are not either-or concepts of intensive care treatment, but complement each other. They are applied in accordance with the respective, individual patient and his or her situation. This step-by-step concept is part of the ICU treatment strategy in accordance with guidelines. Attempts by individual doctors to stir up fear of ventilation in the media lead to unnecessary uncertainty among patients. These claims cannot be supported by the scientific data available to date. The implicit and explicit accusation that in Germany Covid-19 patients are intubated too early and/or too often and thus die more frequently is simply false. Rather, the data derived from the intensive care register of the DIVI as well as from a survey of the DGAI show that about 70 percent of intensive care patients with Covid-19 survive treatment in an intensive care unit in Germany. Why other countries report significantly lower survival rates cannot be conclusively answered from the existing data on the marriage of the pandemic. Possible reasons for the better results in Germany are - in addition to intensive care treatment in line with guidelines - a well-prepared and high-quality health care system as well as good access of the entire population to health care services during the pandemic, with manageable case numbers. At the same time, in other countries such as Italy and the United States, a large number of patients are affected within a short period of time by a health care system that - overall - is significantly worse off. In addition, the figures on mortality of Covid-19 patients undergoing intensive care treatment published in the largest U.S. study to date and frequently quoted were incorrect and have since been corrected by the journal.</TEXT>

The five associations are thus reacting to the criticism of individual doctors with little experience in intensive care medicine, according to which intubation and ventilation of Covid-19 patients is allegedly a dubious therapy. The professional associations respond to this, among other things: The attempts of individual doctors to stir up fear of ventilation in the media led to unnecessary uncertainty among patients. The allegations could not be supported by the scientific data available to date. The wording of the statement The German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI), the "Professional Association of German Anaesthetists" (BDA), the "German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine" (DGP), the "German Society for Internal Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine" (DGIIN) and the "German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) jointly represent the majority of German intensive care medicine and state Non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation are not either-or concepts of intensive care treatment, but complement each other. They are applied in accordance with the respective, individual patient and his or her situation. This step-by-step concept is part of the ICU treatment strategy in accordance with guidelines. Attempts by individual doctors to stir up fear of ventilation in the media lead to unnecessary uncertainty among patients. These claims cannot be supported by the scientific data available to date. The implicit and explicit accusation that in Germany Covid-19 patients are intubated too early and/or too often and thus die more frequently is simply false. Rather, the data derived from the intensive care register of the DIVI as well as from a survey of the DGAI show that about 70 percent of intensive care patients with Covid-19 survive treatment in an intensive care unit in Germany. Why other countries report significantly lower survival rates cannot be conclusively answered from the existing data on the marriage of the pandemic. Possible reasons for the better results in Germany are - in addition to intensive care treatment in line with guidelines - a well-prepared and high-quality health care system as well as good access of the entire population to health care services during the pandemic, with manageable case numbers. At the same time, in other countries such as Italy and the United States, a large number of patients are affected within a short period of time by a health care system that - overall - is significantly worse off. In addition, the figures on mortality of Covid-19 patients undergoing intensive care treatment published in the largest U.S. study to date and frequently quoted were incorrect and have since been corrected by the journal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version 75 years after the end of the Second World War, the President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, has expressed doubt that the Germans have learned sufficient lessons from the past. In an interview with the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ), Schuster said that those who had governmental responsibility in Germany were aware of the ongoing responsibility from the Nazi era. "However, if we interpret Germany as a state with all its inhabitants and ask ourselves whether they have also understood this and learned from history, I must say that I was never convinced of this and certainly am not in this day and age," said the Central Council President. Schuster expressed his concern that a certain degree of anti-Semitism seems to be a lasting fact. On top of that, there is a dangerous oblivion of history. "It cannot be denied, especially among younger people. For them, the Second World War is as far away in their minds as the Empire; there is no longer a current reference to it. If about half of the young people do not know the term 'Auschwitz', something goes wrong", he lamented. Nevertheless, Schuster told the "NOZ" that it is possible to live well in Germany today - "even as a Jew". Many Jews were also standing to their roots outside of community life and enriching the country. "I am delighted when people like Marina Weisband or Oliver Polak play an important and self-evident role in politics and culture," said Schuster, referring to Jewish life in Germany today. After the capitulation of the German Reich on May 8, 1945, hundreds of thousands of Jews were still living in Germany, many as liberated inmates from the concentration camps. The number of Jewish community members then quickly dropped to a low of about 30,000 in the 1980s, before many Jews came to Germany as refugees from the Soviet Union. Schuster put the number of current parishioners at around 100,000. "At the moment we see an annual decline of 700 to 800. The demographic structure is not ideal." Schuster advocated strengthening anti-Semitism research in Germany. Among other things, he said, teachers should be given better tools. "Ask a teacher what he would do if a student called someone else a Jew in the schoolyard. If teachers are honest, many won't know what to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Moritz Mebel, professor emeritus of urology at Berlin's Charit #233; hospital, criticises the West's persistent ignorance of the Red Army's achievements in the fight against the Hitler regime: "For many years now it has been portrayed as if the Western Allies had brought about a turning point in the war by landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944," the 97-year-old said in an interview with the daily "neues deutschland". "But the victory against the Nazis was won above all by the Red Army, and the Soviet Union paid the highest blood duty," said Mebel, who was born in Erfurt in 1923 but grew up in Moscow. His parents were of Jewish origin. His mother, who was a member of the KPD, emigrated with him and his sister to the Soviet Union as early as 1932. Mebel volunteered for military service in 1941 at the age of 18 and fought in the ranks of the Red Army against the German Wehrmacht until the end of the war. No equation between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union Mebel, who became a renowned specialist for kidney transplants in the GDR, also opposes the de facto equation of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union under Stalin with regard to responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War. This equation was postulated in a resolution of the European Parliament in September 2019. Mebel stressed that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 after Poland and systematically murdered civilians in its campaign of annihilation in the East.

    <TEXT>English version The results of the study provide physicians with new insights into how COVID-19 patients could be better treated after they are admitted to hospital. The study was published in the latest issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology on May 6. Data scientists and physicians from the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai used state-of-the-art IT and biomedical informatics techniques to evaluate data sets of 2,773 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to the American Mount Sinai Health System in New York City between March 14 and April 11, 2020. In particular, they analyzed the survival rates of patients who were administered anticoagulants - also known colloquially as blood thinners or anticoagulants - compared to patients who were not administered anticoagulants. Life threatening blood clots developed Recent observations by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai had shown that a large number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 often develop life-threatening blood clots that can lead to fatal thromboses and heart attacks. Of the COVID-19 patients analyzed, 786 (28 percent) received a higher dose of blood thinner than that usually administered for the prevention of blood clots, and a dose usually given to those who already have clots or are suspected of having clots. COVID-19 patients treated with these high doses of blood thinners showed better recovery both in the ICU and outside. Analyze patient data in real time "The study shows how important it is that we analyze patient data in real time. This is the only way we can now act quickly, save lives and improve the course of disease of patients suffering from this devastating pandemic. The promising results from New York City can now quickly be applied worldwide in the inpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients," says Professor Erwin B #246;ttinger, Co-Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai in New York City and Director of the Potsdam-based HPI Digital Health Center. Effect of blood thinners more pronounced In addition, the scientists found that the effect of blood thinners was more pronounced in ventilated patients - 62.7 percent of intubated patients* who were not treated with blood thinners died, compared to 29.1 percent of intubated patients* treated with blood thinners. "Based on the important findings of this study and clear observations from our treating physicians, we are treating COVID-19 patients with blood thinners without any risk of bleeding," said Dennis Charney, Dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The study is just the beginning "This study is just the beginning of more comprehensive analyses with up to 5,000 COVID-19-positive patients, where we will evaluate the efficacy of three different anticoagulants and then perhaps use this data for future clinical trials," said Girish Nadkarni, lead author of the study and Medical Director at the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health. "We are pleased with these preliminary results, which are positive for COVID-19 patients and may give them a greater chance of survival, although further analysis and studies are needed to understand the exact effect of blood thinners in COVID-19 patients".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Warren Buffett recently pulled the ripcord and sold his shares in all four major US airlines to his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway. The legendary investor admits that the investment was a "mistake". But of course, even an experienced veteran like Buffett was not prepared for the virus and pandemic. And Corona changes a lot, if not almost everything, on the stock markets. The cards are now being reshuffled completely. For example, Buffett asks whether many more airplanes will be needed in the future. With the answer to this question, the value of aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing or Airbus will naturally fall. As a result of Corona, a number of public limited companies such as Lufthansa, Boeing, Airbus and, among others, a number of car manufacturers and suppliers have lost a great deal in value. Many companies are now simply struggling to survive, which is often not likely to happen without state aid. As a result, before buying an individual stock, investors must look very carefully at the extent to which the business model is affected by Corona and how much fat the company in question has on its ribs. In particular, companies that already had problems before Corona, like Vapiano most recently, are threatened with insolvency. Companies that profit from the virus But there are also several companies on the stock market that benefit from Corona. On the German stock market, the share price of the cooking box manufacturer Hellofresh has doubled this year, while Dr #228;gerwerk (which produces ventilators) and Teamviewer (the software company specialises in home office, remote access and remote maintenance) have also made massive gains. The Shop Apotheke, where customers can buy medicines online, also posted an increase of around 80%. Large tech groups are gaining ground On the international markets, it is primarily the large technology groups that have been able to grow. Above all Amazon, which recently reached a new high. In addition, health care stocks, so-called healthcare stocks, have been in demand in recent months, with the result that the sector has performed significantly better than the market as a whole. However, the price development of the past weeks is only a glance in the rear-view mirror. Quality counts for investors The question for investors is now: Which companies are likely to benefit from the effects of the pandemic in the longer term and which stocks are at risk? Three points emerge. First, quality counts. Investing in the biggest losers should be dangerous. "For some companies, for example in the tourism and aviation sectors, the cash injections may come too late," says Frank Fischer, CIO of Shareholder Value. In his opinion, investors should therefore focus primarily on the quality of the respective business model. Goldman Sachs analysts point out that companies with strong balance sheets will benefit most. Stable business model and solid balance sheet For fund manager Bert Flossbach, too, a stable business model and a solid balance sheet are decisive factors in selecting a company. Secondly, the lockdown caused by Corona has given a real boost to digitalisation, home office and online trading around the world. Tech companies will still benefit from this once the virus has been defeated. The analysts at Goldman Sachs and others therefore consider the technology sector to be the long-term winner of the crisis. Online trading belongs in every portfolio Frank Engels, Head of Portfolio Management at Union Investment, explains: "Online trading, digital technology, software and health belong in every portfolio in the medium term".

    <TEXT>English version Warren Buffett recently pulled the ripcord and sold his shares in all four major US airlines to his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway. The legendary investor admits that the investment was a "mistake". But of course, even an experienced veteran like Buffett was not prepared for the virus and pandemic. And Corona changes a lot, if not almost everything, on the stock markets. The cards are now being reshuffled completely. For example, Buffett asks whether many more airplanes will be needed in the future. With the answer to this question, the value of aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing or Airbus will naturally fall. As a result of Corona, a number of public limited companies such as Lufthansa, Boeing, Airbus and, among others, a number of car manufacturers and suppliers have lost a great deal in value. Many companies are now simply struggling to survive, which is often not likely to happen without state aid. As a result, before buying an individual stock, investors must look very carefully at the extent to which the business model is affected by Corona and how much fat the company in question has on its ribs. In particular, companies that already had problems before Corona, like Vapiano most recently, are threatened with insolvency. Companies that profit from the virus But there are also several companies on the stock market that benefit from Corona. On the German stock market, the share price of the cooking box manufacturer Hellofresh has doubled this year, while Dr #228;gerwerk (which produces ventilators) and Teamviewer (the software company specialises in home office, remote access and remote maintenance) have also made massive gains. The Shop Apotheke, where customers can buy medicines online, also posted an increase of around 80%. Large tech groups are gaining ground On the international markets, it is primarily the large technology groups that have been able to grow. Above all Amazon, which recently reached a new high. In addition, health care stocks, so-called healthcare stocks, have been in demand in recent months, with the result that the sector has performed significantly better than the market as a whole. However, the price development of the past weeks is only a glance in the rear-view mirror. Quality counts for investors The question for investors is now: Which companies are likely to benefit from the effects of the pandemic in the longer term and which stocks are at risk? Three points emerge. First, quality counts. Investing in the biggest losers should be dangerous. "For some companies, for example in the tourism and aviation sectors, the cash injections may come too late," says Frank Fischer, CIO of Shareholder Value. In his opinion, investors should therefore focus primarily on the quality of the respective business model. Goldman Sachs analysts point out that companies with strong balance sheets will benefit most. Stable business model and solid balance sheet For fund manager Bert Flossbach, too, a stable business model and a solid balance sheet are decisive factors in selecting a company. Secondly, the lockdown caused by Corona has given a real boost to digitalisation, home office and online trading around the world. Tech companies will still benefit from this once the virus has been defeated. The analysts at Goldman Sachs and others therefore consider the technology sector to be the long-term winner of the crisis. Online trading belongs in every portfolio Frank Engels, Head of Portfolio Management at Union Investment, explains: "Online trading, digital technology, software and health belong in every portfolio in the medium term".

    <TEXT>English version Athletes' spokesman Max Hartung supports Union Berlin defender Neven Subotic in his demand for a greater say for football professionals, "I think it is important that it becomes so visible that football professionals also want to discuss and influence what is being decided about them," Hartung told the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". In an interview with "Deutschlandfunk", Subotic had criticised the, in his view, limited influence of the professional footballers, especially during the current Corona crisis. However, Hartung sees a second important effect in such public statements by Bundesliga players: "I think it's good that articles like those by Birger Verstraete or Neven Subotic make it clear that in the end there are people on the football field," said the sabre fencer from Dormagen. FC professional Verstraete had said a week ago that he was worried about the health of his pre-crisis girlfriend if the league starts up again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona pandemic is leaving deep scars on the global economy. According to the credit insurer Euler Hermes, this is likely to lead to a deep recession in world trade and the global economy - and consequently to a worldwide wave of bankruptcies.2020 is likely to see a fourth consecutive rise in insolvencies worldwide - albeit on an unprecedented scale of +20%. By comparison: in 2019 the increase was still 8%. Global trade is threatened with losses of USD 3.5 trillion. This means a 15% drop in the volume of goods and services traded, and an even more severe setback in the value of goods at -20%. Due to the corona pandemic, the global gross domestic product (GDP) is in the deepest recession since World War II with an estimated -3.3%. 2020 originally promised to be a rather quiet year - but then came Corona. "2020 originally promised to be a rather quiet year," says Ludovic Subran, Chief Economist of Allianz and Euler Hermes. "With some geopolitical uncertainties, a still smouldering trade conflict - but also with a delicate growth in world trade and the global economy. A year of 'cheating'. A textbook black swan Actually. But then came Corona. A textbook black swan - and suddenly everything was different: one piece of bad news chases the next, from one export crisis to a quake on the financial markets, from oil price shock to a virtually worldwide consumption shock. According to our current forecasts, the global economy is expected to collapse twice as hard in 2020 as it did during the financial crisis. The losses are as high as the economic power (GDP) of Germany and Japan combined. This leaves traces like a meteorite impact that will not disappear overnight." This development is not without consequences for companies either. Never before has there been such a severe slump in so many countries and in so many industries at the same time. As a result, it is currently not possible in most cases to find alternative buyers or alternative sales markets to cushion the impact. Global insolvencies: +20% more bankruptcies expected in 2020 - in Europe +19  #8222;A veritable wave of bankruptcies is rolling in on companies worldwide," says Ron van het Hof, CEO of Euler Hermes in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. "We currently expect a 20% increase in the number of insolvencies worldwide in 2020 - more than three times as high as expected before the corona pandemic (+6%). Besides the USA (+25%), Europe in particular is in the eye of the storm (+19%). In this situation, it is extremely important to create confidence for companies and the economy. This is why the joint protective umbrella that has now been agreed is elementary for the German economy, companies and their employees - especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Trade will be stabilised as a result. This is an important basis for ensuring that German companies are in a relatively good starting position for an upswing after the crisis. The difficulties are far from over At present, the German economy, among others, is being revived by the containment measures after the standstill, but the difficulties are far from over. With German GDP contracting by -8.9%, the German economy is also sliding into recession. Euler Hermes economists therefore forecast at least 10% more insolvencies in Germany than in the previous year. Without the government measures in many countries, the Euler Hermes economists expect an even much higher increase in insolvencies. In Germany, companies benefit not only from the protective shield but also from numerous liquidity measures - much of it in the form of loans. The debt burden is overwhelming for many Postponed is not lifted: debt burden for many is overwhelming, solutions must be found "The liquidity and stabilisation measures are an enormously important first step towards stabilising the economy quickly," says Van het Hof. "The flip side of this coin, however, is that the debt burden for many companies will be much greater than before. In order to prevent companies from being crushed by these mountains of debt, the second step is therefore to find solutions as to how and in what time frame companies can subsequently reduce or restructure these debts. The problem is currently postponed for the time being, but not cancelled. Beware of zombies: there are an estimated 13,000 sham dead companies in the eurozone For companies that were already in financial difficulties before Corona, however, the corona pandemic makes it increasingly difficult to escape the downward spiral. In the eurozone alone, there are an estimated 13,000 so-called "zombie companies" with total sales of around 500 billion euros. They have managed to keep their heads above water thanks to the ongoing phase of low interest rates. But Corona could make things tight for many. Many companies in the textile retail trade, for example, have been hanging by a thread for years and the electronics industry has also been struggling with numerous problems for a long time. In the metal and automotive industries, too, structural challenges meant that the situation was already bad in many places before Corona. There, the effects of the virus are the straw that breaks the camel's back. pm, ots, mei</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Edson Fachin, Minister of the Supreme Court (STF) in Brazil, has suspended a controversial executive order from 2017. Executive Order 001/2017 has made it difficult for indigenous peoples to legally claim their traditional lands and protect them from overexploitation. "The minister's order will be very much displeased with the powerful agribusiness and the Bolsonaro government," says Juliana Miyzaki, Indigenous Peoples Advisor at the Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV). "They had repeatedly used the order to prevent or reverse the demarcation of indigenous territories." The same order also prevented forced evictions and expulsions of indigenous people from their land until the end of the pandemic. At first glance, the ruling seems to be a positive step. "Of course, such an order is only helpful to the extent that it is respected and followed," Miyazaki added. Deforestation and mining activities on indigenous territories are also prohibited by law. Finding gold and settling cattle herds "But in the shadow of the pandemic, invasions of indigenous areas continue to increase," Miyazaki said. "Invaders come to cut timber, mine gold and raise cattle herds." Deforestation rates on indigenous territory have risen by 59 percent during the pandemic, and mining activities by 45 percent, Miyazaki said. 64 Covid-19 deaths in various tribes The struggle of the indigenous people in Brazil for their rights and resistance against assaults continued unabated under difficult conditions. Over the weekend, envoys from national and international organizations met for a two-day online session. Among other things, they discussed the situation of indigenous peoples in Brazil and strategies against the spread of the corona virus. Indigenous people have hardly any access to the health system. There is a lack of equipment and medicines. "The authorities are also trying to minimize the serious impact of the pandemic on indigenous peoples, 'Miyazaki said." The indigenous organization APIB reports 64 deaths in 30 different tribes. However, the state authorities count only 15 deaths among the indigenous people. Indians in cities are not counted as such.This affects about half of all indigenous people in the country</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English Version The price of gold has risen significantly. Calculated in the common currency, the yellow metal is even at an all-time high. The vast majority of analysts assume that the positive trend in the price of gold will continue. The profit-taking that has recently pushed the price of gold below $1,700 an ounce is undoubtedly only an interlude. The demand for gold is driven in part by the fact that gold is considered the most appropriate store of value in times of crisis. This is probably particularly true at present in the USA, where the pandemic is not yet under any kind of control and where there is a risk that the country could plunge into a deep and long-lasting crisis. This is at any rate indicated by the fact that the measures taken by the US federal government and the individual states to deal with the crisis appear to be anything but coordinated and that US President Donald Trump is now thinking about lifting the lockdown measures far too early in all probability. Similarities during the Spanish flu It is therefore quite likely that the pandemic in the USA, after a possible calming of the situation in summer, will culminate in a new, possibly even worse wave of disease in the autumn. A similar situation was observed, for example, with the Spanish flu of 1918/19, which, like many other epidemics, had a so-called "fat tail" distribution over time. The fact that the Americans do not trust the situation and their government is shown, among other things, by the fact that the demand for gold coins in the USA has risen sharply. As a result, there are already premiums of up to 10% on gold coins in the USA compared to the spot price of gold. Private household demand for gold is low Here it should be taken into account that at the moment the demand for gold from private households worldwide is still rather low, as especially in Asia little gold can be bought due to the lockdown measures and of course the effects of the severe economic crisis on household incomes. If the situation returns to normal, this demand will pick up again and support the gold price. From the point of view of institutional investors, it is above all the protective function of gold against the devaluation of money that is of particular interest. Many investors currently fear that the enormous scale of governments' global economic stimulus programmes and central banks' monetary policy measures will lead to considerable inflationary pressure once the crisis has subsided - especially if those voices are right who still believe in a rapid exit from the crisis and a then powerful economic recovery around the globe. The lion's share of the aid will go to the financial sector and capital markets But there is another aspect that drives investor demand for gold. The lion's share of the aid provided by governments and central banks is once again going to the financial sector and capital markets, which were already pumped full of liquidity to an unprecedented extent after the financial crisis of 2007/08 - so that many critics spoke of an "everything bubble" that encompassed almost all asset classes. In this environment, the price of gold no longer necessarily moved in the opposite direction to the prices of classic risky investment forms such as shares. At times there were almost only positive correlation coefficients between the asset classes. Support measures must remain in place for a longer period of time A similar situation can be observed in the current crisis: The deep market slump in March was not only experienced by equities, the gold price also followed suit. One of the reasons for this was that gold investments had to be sold in order to meet margin calls for other asset classes. Accordingly, when the support measures of the central banks were announced and began to take effect, the gold price moved upwards in line with the stock markets. Just as it was difficult to turn away from the central banks' liquidity support several years after the end of the crisis in 2007/08, it can be assumed that the current support measures will have to continue for a long time, because otherwise the markets would promptly crash again. The gold price will also benefit from this "Everything Bubble2.0" in the long term</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version A drug will soon be available to combat the lung disease Covid-19, which is caused by the coronavirus. The drug Remdesivir "will be available within weeks or a few months," said the head of Infectiology at the University Hospital of Cologne, Gerd F #228;tkenheuer, to the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger" newspaper.

    <TEXT>English version Almost three-fifths of all German citizens are certain that the long-term effects of the climate crisis are more serious than those of the corona crisis. They would like to see scientific findings used more strongly for political decisions. They value a state that can cope with crises and, in the light of COVID-19, have learned not only how they have missed friends, family and mobility, but also what nature and regional products mean to them. These are some of the results of a representative survey conducted by forsa Politik- und Sozialforschung (Berlin) among 1,029 German citizens aged 14 and over. The Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) had commissioned the DBU environmental monitor Corona-Folgen (Corona Consequences) in order to find out more about the views and assessments of German citizens on the consequences of the corona crisis for the environment with regard to its funding work. 93 percent for greater influence of science on politics 59 percent of citizens believe that the climate crisis will have a greater long-term impact on the economy and society than the corona crisis. 23 percent estimate that the long-term consequences of both crises will be equally high. 17 percent believe that the effects of the corona crisis will be greater in the long term. DBU Secretary General Alexander Bonde: "People have a good sense of the fact that consistent commitment to climate protection cannot be put off. They also see the dimension of the problem as enormous in view of current crises. At the same time, this is also an urgent appeal to think climate protection and sustainable economic activity together". If in future, for example, the opinions and analyses of the scientific community were to be more strongly integrated into the political decision-making process on issues of climate protection - as was the case with the Corona crisis - 93% would find this good or even very good. Investment programmes to strengthen regional SMEs and the health system What do German citizens expect from the state investment programmes in connection with the Corona crisis? 94 per cent consider it important and very important to strengthen the regional economy and medium-sized businesses (92 per cent). However, they consider it at least as important to see the health system strengthened (94 percent), but also - with gradations - not to lose sight of social justice (89 percent), environmental and climate protection (86 percent) and the extinction of species (82 percent). For 83 percent, the fact that the planned major government investment programmes will promote innovation is very important and significant. The under-30s are less likely than older people to consider it very important that the investment programmes strengthen the regional economy and promote social justice. Products of regional companies and staying in the countryside very popular And what lessons has Germany learned from the Corona pandemic? Seven out of ten citizens missed above all personal meetings with friends and family, 59 percent missed their unrestricted mobility. But 49 percent also learned to appreciate information from independent scientists on important social issues. For 46 percent more than "before Corona", exercise and outdoor sports are now more popular than before, and for 44 percent each to buy products from regional companies or to be able to use green spaces, parks and allotments. Home office established - business travel soon to be phased out? But not only the living conditions, but also the working conditions will change according to the DBU environmental monitor Corona-Folgen. Almost three quarters of the population (73 percent) believe that the home office, working from home, which was used more frequently during the crisis, should have a permanent place in the working world in the future. Those under 30 years of age, who see digitization more as an opportunity, are even more likely to think so than older people who are more critical of digitization. According to the forsa DBU figures, business trips will soon be a completely phased-out model. In the opinion of 86 percent, meetings and conferences should continue to be firmly integrated into the working world via video or telephone even after the Corona crisis. Increasing the expansion of renewable energies The energy we need for our private and professional lives should increasingly come from renewable sources, also in order to import less oil and gas from other countries and thus remain independent in every situation. In any case, a large majority of 78 percent would find it important if the expansion of renewable energies in Germany were to be pushed forward more strongly now.

    <TEXT>English version Since the beginning of March, the corona pandemic has hit Europe with full force, radically worsening the economic outlook. Like all countries in the euro zone, Germany reacted with tough containment measures, which partially paralysed public life and economic activity. As a result, economic output in Germany is likely to have been around 20-25% lower than pre-crisis levels for several weeks, and around 30% lower in the Euro-Zone. Provided that a second wave of infection can be avoided, economic activity should have bottomed out in April. With the withdrawal of many restrictions, it should at least partially normalise by the summer, leading almost mechanically to very high growth in the third quarter. For 2020 as a whole KfW Research expects German GDP to slump by -6%. In the other large eurozone countries (France, Italy and Spain) the recession is likely to be much deeper than in Germany because of greater exposure to the corona virus, so that eurozone economic output will shrink by -7% this year. Waiting for a vaccination or medication For 2021 KfW Research expects growth of +5% in Germany and +6% in the eurozone. The return to public life and economic activity will be slow in Germany and Europe despite the loosening measures that have begun - presumably until a vaccination or a very effective drug is available. Above all, there will also be a marked reluctance to consume until rapid tests are available, infection chains can be traced and nationwide behavioural protocols for various sectors of the economy are in place due to fear of infection and the high level of economic uncertainty. In addition, necessary security measures continue to restrict capacity in some sectors and industrial production is likely to be disrupted for a long time due to interruptions in value chains and loss of demand. As long as the crisis has not been sustainably overcome in all major trading partners, many investments will probably not be made due to the enormous uncertainty. Corona crisis: struck like lightning "The Corona crisis hit Germany like lightning," says Dr. Fritzi K #246;hler-Geib, Chief Economist at KfW. "Although a recovery is likely to start in the second half of the year, the pre-crisis level will probably not be reached again until autumn 2021. The cost of the crisis in terms of lost economic output will then be around EUR 300 billion. This is roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Denmark. The regulatory measures help the economy "Without the rapid response of fiscal and monetary policy, the recession would be even more devastating," said K #246;hler-Geib. "Subsidies and bridging loans as well as various adjustments in bank regulation or rental and insolvency law are helping the economy. The short-time working allowance reduces running costs, jobs are preserved and domestic demand is supported. The majority of companies are likely to come through the crisis with wounds, but with the capacity to survive. However, all measures can only serve to bridge the gap. We must now quickly find ways to protect lives and livelihoods at the same time with the help of rapid tests, tracing chains of infection and behavioural protocols". The downside risks outweigh For the current economic forecasts of KfW Research, however, the downward risks predominate. Most obvious is the danger of a second wave of infection. However, economic second-round effects are also possible if the rising debt level should lead to sovereign debt or banking crises in Europe. The stabilising function of monetary policy is therefore important, although it is endangered by the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court. Positive surprises for the economy are conceivable, such as rapid medical advances</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Video evidence is often discussed in the European leagues, especially because of the interruption of the game that this entails. The information platform Wettbasis (www.wettbasis.com) has now examined and compared all video evidence from this season in the German Bundesliga as well as the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A and La Liga. 90 percent of the preliminary decisions are revoked In the 224 matches played so far this Bundesliga season, the verdict of a video referee has been used 84 times. In 90 percent of the cases, the original decision of the referee was overturned on the pitch as a result. The video assistant corrects wrongly given goals particularly frequently: 33 percent of all VAR assignments relate to goals that were actually invalid, for example, because of an offside position or a previous foul. Video assistant intervenes when penalty kicks are not given Similarly, 29 percent of the video assistants intervene because of a missed penalty kick, which the referee overlooked on the pitch. 16 per cent of the video evidence this season led to a re-evaluation of the given penalty kicks, the majority of which were revoked. In 11 per cent of the decisions, goals not given in error were retrospectively assessed, e.g. by an offside flag. Ten per cent of the video evidence is the result of players being given too low a penalty, instead of a yellow card they were given a red card after the video assistant had checked the scene. Major differences in decisions by the video assistant In an international comparison of the video assistant's decisions, there are big differences between the five European football leagues: In the French Ligue 1, 85 percent of all reviewed decisions are revoked with the help of the VAR, in the Italian Serie A 89 percent, in the Bundesliga 90 percent and in the Spanish La Liga 91 percent of all reviewed decisions. By contrast, in the English Premier League the figure is only 32 percent. According to these figures, in almost 70 percent of the video evidence there, the first decisions of the referees on the pitch were merely confirmed. The Premier League also stands out clearly from the others in terms of the number of video evidence: This season the matches have already been interrupted 275 times for video evidence. In France and Germany, the tool is used about three times less frequently. Here, the video assistant's verdict was only used 82 and 84 times respectively. Video evidence was used slightly more frequently in Spain (101 times) and Italy (111 times).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version It is now clear that the economic consequences of the corona pandemic are serious. But how long these effects will be felt is an open question. Financial market participants expect the effects to continue to impact the economy for at least another five years. This is the result of a recent study by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). DIW macroeconomists Stephanie Ettmeier, Chi Hyun Kim and Alexander Kriwoluzky used corporate bonds from the four largest EU economies Germany, France, Italy and Spain to examine how yields are reacting to the corona pandemic. Their findings: Bond yields are rising dramatically in all countries and across all maturities following the global stock market crash on 9 March and the Italian lockdown. Bonds with five years to maturity show strongest increase However, yields on bonds with five years to maturity are showing the strongest increase. "This suggests that investors in the financial markets do not believe that the economy will be able to compensate for the damage caused by the corona measures this year or next," says study author Chi Hyun Kim. German rescue package also has positive effects in other countries It is also surprising that the yields of corporate bonds from the financial sector are not rising more strongly than those of corporate bonds from the real economy. "Obviously, the financial markets do not currently expect a bank crash resulting from the economic damage of the Corona pandemic - at least not yet," concludes study author Alexander Krivoluzky from the results. Yields calm down after announcement of the German rescue package The DIW economists also examined how yields reacted to the respective monetary and fiscal policy interventions. With the help of an event study, they examined the yields of the more than 2,600 bonds under review on the days or subsequent days on which the national governments announced crisis packages or the ECB, EU and G7 announced their measures. It becomes clear that the only time that yields on fiscal policy interventions calm down is after the announcement of the German rescue package - and not only German yields, but also the yields on Italian, French and Spanish bonds. By contrast, the rescue packages of the French, Italian and Spanish governments are largely ineffective in the bond market. Coordinating the measures "On the one hand, these results make it clear that the efforts of individual governments are only effective if they are very large-scale. And on the other hand, that measures coordinated at the European level are more likely to achieve their goals than national solo efforts," judges study author Stephanie Ettmeier. In particular, a fiscal policy response should be shared by all European countries, for example through a European economic stimulus package or European corporate loans"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to the aid organisation SOS Children's Villages, the indigenous peoples of Latin America are massively threatened by COVID-19. "Especially for peoples who have little or no contact with the outside world, the danger of being completely destroyed is real," says Michael Kirchmair, an employee of the aid organisation in Ecuador. Those affected would hardly have developed any defences against such viruses. In the past there have been repeated cases in which entire ethnic groups have fallen victim to epidemics. The Siekopai, who live in the Amazon near oil production sites, are among the most endangered peoples in Ecuador. Two elderly tribal leaders are believed to have died from the virus, and 14 other members have tested positive. "Today, there are only about 700 Siekopai left. They live far from clinics and hospitals. Since there is hardly any information in their language, they were taken by surprise by the virus and could not take precautions," Kirchmair says. The Kichwa, whose members live in remote mountain valleys, among other places, are also threatened. "If sick people do not manage to get to a health centre in time, it can become a danger for entire communities." Government policies are inadequate Governments' approaches are insufficient to protect indigenous peoples, and many indigenous peoples in Ecuador, Brazil and Peru have decided in a transnational decision to isolate themselves and close their territories to foreigners. The Siekopai case shows that there is no time to lose. "We must take all the measures we can to protect indigenous peoples now - before it is too late," says Kirchmair</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Rudi V #246;ller, Managing Director of Bayer 04 Leverkusen, has vehemently attacked the SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach and defended the continuation of the German football season with ghost games: "In the case of Mr. Lauterbach, who is a physician himself and bases his expert status on this fact, some assertions were and are simply not true", explains V #246;ller in an interview with the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger". The politician from Leverkusen had described the DFL concept on Wednesday as "schizophrenic and full of holes". He had previously spoken out vehemently against the Bundesliga plans several times. V #246;ller accuses the physician Lauterbach of "snubbing" his colleagues who were involved in developing the concept and wanting to "make a name for himself" at their expense. V #246;ller described the continuation of the Bundesliga season, which begins on Saturday with the 26th matchday, as exemplary: "If we manage to finish the season with this really good concept, it will give football a lot of hope in other countries. Sporting value of the games not affected He does not see the sporting value of the games impaired by the absence of spectators. "The champion rightly becomes the champion, and that's exactly how it will be with the Champions League qualifiers, the European League qualifiers, class retention and relegation. Everything will be decided correctly, perhaps even cleaner than usual," the 1990 world champion explains in the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Kiel political scientist Torben L #252;tjen doubts that the Corona crisis will necessarily harm US President Trump. "Basically, he is using the same ingredients as always: hostility to science, anti-intellectualism, hatred of the media," the political scientist told the Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung. In addition, Trump is serving a widespread belief in conspiracy among his followers. "At least at his party base, the scientific advisors are considered part of a bureaucratic conspiracy against the legitimately elected president anyway. The US president is an expression of an extremely divided society, in which the political camps are irreconcilable. This leads to the fact that the respective camp only trusts statements that are confirmed by its own life-world. The country is in a "Cold Civil War". L #252;tjen: "A highly explosive political cocktail is being mixed." The trend may also threaten in Germany According to L #252;tjen, this trend could also threaten Germany: "Centrifugal forces are also increasing in German society. Here, too, there is an echo chamber on the right-hand side that has built its own world," L #252;tjen analyses. "In the USA, it began the same way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The international aid organisation CARE is extremely concerned after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazaar (Bangladesh). A total of around 855,000 people live in the camps, almost all of whom are Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar. The Covid-19 outbreak is a cause for great concern, as it is almost impossible to maintain a safe distance in the overcrowded camps. In addition, local medical care is by no means sufficient to stop an outbreak. CARE Regional Director for Asia, Deepmala Mahla: "In Cox's Bazaar, 40,000 people live on every square kilometre - almost four times as many as in New York City. The lack of space, combined with inadequate hygiene and medical care, could encourage the spread of Covid-19. The Rohingya in Cox's bazaar have already suffered unspeakable trauma. We therefore urge the international community to provide financial support to aid organisations working in Bangladesh so that they can provide urgently needed assistance</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version KfW Capital has started the application procedure for the Corona Matching Facility approved by the German government. The Corona Matching Facility is the first pillar of the federal government's support for start-ups and small companies. The financial assistance supports VC-funded start-ups and young growth companies that have financing needs and a German connection during the Corona crisis. A further condition is that the start-ups and young growth companies were not yet in difficulties as of 31 December 2019. VC funds can mirror necessary financing rounds up to 31.12.2020 through federal funds via KfW Capital. Before funds are approved, all VC funds must have successfully undergone an audit. Only private VC funds are eligible to apply; information and application instructions can be found at www.kfw-capital.de/corona-matching-fazilitaet. Start-ups severely disrupted by the Corona crisis "Many innovative start-ups and young companies were severely disrupted on their growth path by the corona crisis.

    <TEXT>English version The decline in economic output in the first quarter of 2020 is far from showing the true extent of the crisis. This is the assessment of the Ifo Institute. "The measures imposed by the state to contain the corona pandemic only slowed down the production of goods and services in the course of March and thus at the end of the first quarter. Much of the impact will not be felt until April. According to estimates by the Ifo Institute, economic output slumped by 16 percent during the corona closures," says Timo Wollmersh #228;user, head of ifo economic research. Thanks to the cautious easing of government measures in the second half of April, production and sales in all economic sectors will gradually rise again in May and June. Nevertheless, at minus 12.2 percent, gross domestic product in the second quarter is likely to shrink many times more than at the beginning of the year. GDP decline in the first quarter amounts to 2.2 per cent According to the preliminary results of the national accounts published today by the Federal Statistical Office, the decline in gross domestic product in the first quarter was 2.2 percent. This means that the ifo Institute and the Joint Economic Forecast, with their estimates of minus 1.9 percent presented in April, were relatively close to the official first publication - despite the high degree of forecasting uncertainty. Value added has collapsed in the hotel and restaurant industry and among service providers The slump in value added has been particularly severe in the hotel and restaurant industry and among service providers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, as their business activities were directly restricted by government measures. But economic output also declined in the manufacturing sector. The production shutdowns by automobile manufacturers were particularly noticeable there. Only in the construction industry did its value added increase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona crisis poses new challenges for the German government's development policy. In addition to the important short-term aid provided through the German Government's Corona Emergency Programme, in the long term significantly more funds will be needed to combat hunger, poverty and lack of education as a result of the pandemic. The poorest countries in particular are suffering from the economic consequences of the crisis. This was declared by the children's aid organisation terre des hommes and Welthungerhilfe on the occasion of this year's presentation of the report on the reality of development policy. "For us, the respirator is the face of the corona crisis. For millions of children in poor countries, the corona crisis is the face of poverty and the end of educational opportunities," said Birte K #246;tter, spokeswoman of the board of terre des hommes. "The Corona emergency programme must therefore contain targeted measures in the area of food security and the promotion of basic education for children, so that they do not remain permanent losers of the crisis". One billion starving people "As a result of the crisis, the number of hungry people could rise from 820 million to one billion. The income opportunities of the poorest are immediately lost when day labourers and migrant workers are out of work from one day to the next due to corona restrictions. For them, the risk of dying of hunger is more threatening than the virus itself. Up to 70 percent of the working population in developing countries work in agriculture - without any social security," K #246;tter continues. The agricultural and food sector must be placed at the centre Any strategy to alleviate hardship and initiate economic recovery must focus on the agricultural and food sector. Farmers are systemically relevant, especially in developing countries. Funding for hunger alleviation and rural development must therefore not be reduced. The BMZ's emergency programme was important and had to be underpinned by around three billion from the supplementary budget, as demanded by Federal Minister M #252;ller, and not counteract long-term development efforts, said Mathias Mogge, Secretary-General of German Agro Action. Greater priority for children's rights Even outside the Corona crisis, terre des hommes pleaded for a significantly higher significance of children's rights in German development policy. "The rights of children must be much more firmly anchored in development policy. In the BMZ reform plan for 2030 they play practically no role. For the current sensitivity of development policy towards children's rights, the BMZ is receiving a Blue Letter from terre des hommes", explained Birte K #246;tter</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version No research institute or pharmaceutical company can win the battle against Corona alone. This is why experts from different disciplines are networking worldwide and sharing their knowledge and data on disease progression, treatment options, medication and vaccination strategies.the regulatory authorities should also follow suit and publish clinical study reports on all COVID-19 drugs and vaccines immediately on the day they are approved for marketing. This is the demand of Klaus Reinhardt, President of the German Medical Association. He is thus supporting an appeal to this effect by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG ) and the Cochrane Collaboration to the European Medicines Agency. Reinhardt said that complete transparency on methods and results of clinical trials of Covid-19 could accelerate the further development of active substances. "Corona can only be defeated together. This is why IQWIG's initiative is good and right," said the President of the German Medical Association. Equal access to drugs and vaccines In this context, Reinhardt is also in favour of the international community creating regulations for equal access of states to drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus. International cooperation in research projects and their funding is exemplary, he said. This was demonstrated not least by the international donor conference on the financing of global vaccine research. This solidarity must be maintained even after a vaccine has been approved. "In view of the global threat posed by corona, exclusive contracts between individual states for the first use of drugs and vaccines against the virus cannot be justified ethically and epidemiologically," said Reinhardt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The return to normal hospital operations demanded by Health Minister Jens Spahn is only hesitantly noticeable in the care of cancer patients; although individual positive developments have been reported, no significant improvement is yet noticeable. Therapies are still being shortened or postponed, and aftercare has been suspended. In addition, there are fears that the health care system is facing an increased number of late detected cancer diseases as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. This is because screening and early detection examinations do not take place as usual, and patients' fear of infection during visits to the doctor further exacerbates the problem. In its weekly report, the Corona Task Force of German Cancer Aid, the German Cancer Society (DKG) and the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) warns against such a development. The experts appeal to the population to continue to visit doctors and hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and to keep appointments for examinations. Still cause for concern "The latest Task Force figures continue to give cause for concern. We are not yet in normal clinical operation," said Gerd Nettekoven, Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Krebshilfe. "Those responsible must ensure that the care of cancer patients is not neglected. The suspended visits to doctors for clarification of symptoms and early diagnosis are also worrying." Cancer takes no account of the corona crisis "Cancer takes no account of the Corona crisis! Patients should therefore by no means hesitate to have suspicious symptoms clarified," said Professor Michael Baumann, Chairman of the Board of the German Cancer Research Center, adding: "If we continue to put off the bow wave of pending urgent examinations and postponed treatments, we must expect an increasing number of cancer-related deaths in Germany as well. Return to normal cancer screening "This makes it all the more important to return to normal cancer care," says Professor Olaf Ortmann, President of the German Cancer Society. "The Task Force has therefore also approached the boards of directors of the supporting institutions of large cancer centers in Germany with the urgent request to restore normal clinical operations and support our appeal to the population, also with the help of the existing regional clinical care networks. "Although we are now seeing improvements in various areas of care that were previously subject to restrictions, we believe that this is not the case. But now it is particularly important that the restoration of normal operations should pay special attention to patients with unresolved symptoms and postponed cancer therapies. Situation of cancer patients closely monitored Since the beginning of the crisis, the Task Force founded by the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), German Cancer Aid and the German Cancer Society has been closely monitoring the situation of cancer patients. The aim: to identify supply bottlenecks and restrictions in the interest of patients at an early stage and to seek dialogue with political decision-makers.

    <TEXT>English version The return to normal hospital operations demanded by Health Minister Jens Spahn is only hesitantly noticeable in the care of cancer patients; although individual positive developments have been reported, no significant improvement is yet noticeable. Therapies are still being shortened or postponed, and aftercare has been suspended. In addition, there are fears that the health care system is facing an increased number of late detected cancer diseases as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. This is because screening and early detection examinations do not take place as usual, and patients' fear of infection during visits to the doctor further exacerbates the problem. In its weekly report, the Corona Task Force of German Cancer Aid, the German Cancer Society (DKG) and the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) warns against such a development. The experts appeal to the population to continue to visit doctors and hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and to keep appointments for examinations. Still cause for concern "The latest Task Force figures continue to give cause for concern. We are not yet in normal clinical operation," said Gerd Nettekoven, Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Krebshilfe. "Those responsible must ensure that the care of cancer patients is not neglected. The suspended visits to doctors for clarification of symptoms and early diagnosis are also worrying." Cancer takes no account of the corona crisis "Cancer takes no account of the Corona crisis! Patients should therefore by no means hesitate to have suspicious symptoms clarified," said Professor Michael Baumann, Chairman of the Board of the German Cancer Research Center, adding: "If we continue to put off the bow wave of pending urgent examinations and postponed treatments, we must expect an increasing number of cancer-related deaths in Germany as well. Return to normal cancer screening "This makes it all the more important to return to normal cancer care," says Professor Olaf Ortmann, President of the German Cancer Society. "The Task Force has therefore also approached the boards of directors of the supporting institutions of large cancer centers in Germany with the urgent request to restore normal clinical operations and support our appeal to the population, also with the help of the existing regional clinical care networks. "Although we are now seeing improvements in various areas of care that were previously subject to restrictions, we believe that this is not the case. But now it is particularly important that the restoration of normal operations should pay special attention to patients with unresolved symptoms and postponed cancer therapies. Situation of cancer patients closely monitored Since the beginning of the crisis, the Task Force founded by the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), German Cancer Aid and the German Cancer Society has been closely monitoring the situation of cancer patients. The aim: to identify supply bottlenecks and restrictions in the interest of patients at an early stage and to seek dialogue with political decision-makers. Increasing number of inquiries This was triggered by an increasing number of inquiries from concerned cancer patients to oncological information and counselling services.

    <TEXT>English version As massive as the impact of COVID-19 is on current economic activities: The experts at J.P. Morgan Asset Management expect hardly any immediate consequences for long-term economic growth. "We are currently dealing with a recession and a bear market, but also with the beginning of a new cycle. This will have its own characteristics, some of which are already being shaped by numerous monetary and fiscal policy measures. However, it is important in this situation to mix non-cyclical issues with long-term challenges," says Tilmann Galler, capital market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Frankfurt. And so the recession caused by the coronavirus should not significantly impair potential growth in the long term. These and other insights are provided by the revised long-term capital market outlook Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMA) by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. This work with earnings expectations and background analyses for 50 asset classes and currencies has been published at the end of each year for a good quarter of a century. Drastic swings in asset prices "In view of the massive shock that COVID-19 has triggered on the capital markets and in the economy as a whole, we have examined how the drastic swings in asset prices will affect the long-term earnings prospects and thus portfolio construction," explains Tilmann Galler. In the process, no change was made to the assumptions themselves, but the entry price of the asset classes was updated from September 30, 2019 to the price on March 31, 2020. Equity markets: from bull market to bear market at record speed  #8222;Global equity markets have moved at record speed from bullish to bearish, and market volatility continues even now. Since market revaluations are and remain moving targets, we are particularly interested in how sensitively long-term yield forecasts react to the new entry prices," the expert explains. On this basis, the report determines revised long-term return expectations for the next ten to 15 years for the most important asset classes. Significant plunge in US government bond yields Due to their higher interest rates, the decline in US Treasury yields was particularly dramatic - the expected yields on 10-year US bonds fell by 70 basis points and the index for long-term US government bonds even had to record a 130 basis point drop. By contrast, expected yields on euro government bonds actually rose by 30 basis points, reflecting the exceptionally low level of yields that prevailed even before the coronavirus crisis began. Yield expectations for corporate bonds have increased Earnings expectations for corporate bonds have also risen and in some cases are approaching those of the equity markets. However, the expert also warns: "The expansion of the Federal Reserve's bond purchases to include corporate bonds, as announced in April, will reinforce the trend of pushing private investors into higher-yielding areas. Earnings in the high yield area and from spread products will remain relatively high despite the recent narrowing of spreads," Galler said. And as important as the diversification effect of government bonds is in a recession, the long-term outlook remains cautious due to expected financial repression. Equities and alternative investments benefit Due to the significant decline in the share price, the expected long-term returns on shares have risen by between 1 and 2.5 percent across the board. "Even though the current recession will have an impact on corporate profits this year and probably next year as well, and - if government aid is taken up - dividends as well, we believe that trend profits and margins will remain largely stable in our outlook in the long term. As a result, the major change in our forecasts is related to valuations and thus to the prevailing prices," explains Galler. Optimistic forecasts for alternative asset classes Similarly, the forecasts for alternative asset classes such as hedge funds or private equity continue to be optimistic and market volatility confirms that there are good medium-term prospects for additional returns in these segments. In the case of real assets, a large part of the discount on capital values is attributable to the short-term impairment of cash flows caused by the recession. These should recover over time - initially in more stable core sectors such as logistics and later in more cyclical sectors such as hotels. And so another conclusion of the report is that asset classes such as core real estate and infrastructure assets should gain in importance due to their diversifying and income-focused earnings characteristics. The more prices fall, the more optimistic the long-term outlook  #8222;It will be several months before the characteristics of the next cycle and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy measures become more apparent. But one thing is very clear from the revaluations in the LTCMA and is additionally confirmed by adjusted return expectations based on the changed entry prices: The stronger the short-term fall in prices, the stronger the impulse for the expected long-term returns. Or to put it another way: The more pessimistic the assessment of the situation today is, the more optimistic the long-term earnings outlook can be," says Galler. Fiscal incentives have a decisive influence Moreover, apart from the immediate impact of price volatility on expected returns, there are some long-term issues that will characterize the next cycle: "First, we believe that fiscal stimulus will have a decisive impact. While disinflationary pressures and low bond yields will of course occur simultaneously in the current recession, the demand-side stimulus provided by fiscal expansion is likely to mean steeper yield curves and reflationary pressures in the medium term," the expert explains. Support for equities This should provide strong support for equities relative to bonds over the entire ten to fifteen year forecast period. Nevertheless, steeper curves and more scope for a reflationary cycle in the next expansion could shift the lead in equity markets. "Value stocks have never really been successful over the past ten years because low yields and very low inflation have favored longer-term investments and a growth style - this could shift in the medium term," Galer says. Similarly, the rise of technology over the past decade has also been one of the reasons why the "American decade" has been so successful in terms of equity returns. "The technology issue will certainly remain with us, but other regions could catch up in the 2020s thanks to massive support for renewable energies and sustainability through government programs," the expert points out. Strong economic growth will begin And so Galler and the other authors of the LTCMA are certain that after this recession, strong economic growth will set in and investment opportunities will continue to arise. "The corona crisis is a cyclical development and will perhaps even act as a catalyst to reinforce issues and trends that we have seen before. However, central banks are currently manoeuvring themselves into a situation where their scope for acting independently is becoming increasingly limited. This is increasingly limiting them, and investors must prepare for further low interest rates and adapt their allocation more diversified and active than ever before to these challenges," concludes Galer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In an open letter to the German Chancellor on the occasion of World Biodiversity Day on 22 May, renowned scientists, representatives of foundations, entrepreneurs, celebrities and NGOs expect consistent action in the adoption of the "European Green Deal" and the new biodiversity strategy of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The close link between the loss of biological diversity and the occurrence of pandemics shows with unprecedented clarity the consequences for humanity if intact habitats with high species diversity continue to be destroyed unchecked. According to a recent representative survey commissioned by the Campaign for Nature, the expectations of citizens towards the Federal Government are clear: 95 percent consider the fight against species extinction to be important or very important, 86 percent want to see increased protection of intact natural areas in order to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to humans, four out of five would like the economic stimulus packages to give preference to companies and industries that pursue ambitious health, environmental and climate protection goals, 84 percent of all respondents would like the Federal Government to make the protection of climate and nature a priority. The signatories call for an interdepartmental and effective policy to protect biodiversity, based on clear, ambitious goals and positions. One of the central elements of this policy should be to effectively protect at least 30 percent of the Earth's sea and land area by 2030, while recognizing and supporting the rights of indigenous peoples. Protect 30 percent of the planet's surface area The signatories of the open letter emphasize that the protection of at least 30 percent of the area is a triple benefit for our planet. Scientists assumed that if effectively implemented, about 70 percent of biological diversity and basic ecosystem services will be preserved for humanity. Strengthened and expanded protection of natural habitats, especially in the tropical forests, would at the same time provide a natural shield for us humans against further pandemics. And, by preserving natural carbon sinks and binding emissions, it would make a major contribution to climate protection and strengthen resilience and adaptability to climate change. A healthy plan is important The current pandemic shows us in a frightening way how much our health and ultimately our survival depends on a healthy planet. At the same time, it offers a unique opportunity to initiate the essential fundamental changes in our economic and financial systems to ensure the future viability of humanity. "The European Green Deal points the way forward" The open letter states: "The European Green Deal, including the EU Biodiversity Strategy, indicates the direction in which transformative change must be initiated in Europe. We therefore expect the Federal Government to take action in preparation for the Council Presidency starting on 1 July: to work at national and European level to at least maintain the current level of the European Green Deal and to support its consistent and timely implementation, align the planning and implementation of economic stimulus packages with the core elements of the European Green Deal. It would be fatal to give in to the lobbyists now and thus entrench yesterday's economic methods and models or postpone difficult transformation processes in view of the current crisis. This includes in particular the immediate reorientation of agriculture as the main cause of the loss of biodiversity, to commit immediately to ambitious and concrete targets for the protection of biodiversity and to represent them nationally, within the EU and internationally This is linked to a clear commitment to the goal of placing at least 30 percent of the global marine and terrestrial area under effective protection by 2030 and to play a major role in mobilising the financial resources required for implementation.</TEXT>

The moment it pays a lot of money, it has a certain influence as a member country or as a private donor. That was always the assumption." Especially at the beginning of a pandemic "a strong proximity must of course be sought in order to ensure the flow of information at the beginning," Lindmeier continued. China had shared essential insights early and quickly. Most recently, the USA had accused the World Health Organization of having made itself the mouthpiece of China</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Declining passenger numbers in buses and trains as a result of the corona pandemic threaten to further worsen the CO2 balance of transport. This is shown by the calculations of a short Greenpeace study (online at https://act.gp/3cJVXlB). Out of fear of contagion, many people want to avoid public transport in the medium term as well. This could increase the number of passenger kilometres travelled by car in German cities alone by up to 20 billion per year. This would result in an additional 3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. "To prevent Corona from infecting the traffic turnaround, cities must now create more space for cyclists and pedestrians," says Greenpeace traffic expert Marion Tiemann. "With better cycling and walking paths, cities can prevent people from being forced back into their cars. This is a huge opportunity to make progress in switching to safe, clean and climate-friendly modes of transport." Road space is being redistributed Cities around the world are using the corona crisis to redistribute street space. Brussels recently declared the entire city centre a 20 km/h zone, with pedestrians and cyclists taking priority over cars. Milan and Madrid rededicated many streets to bicycle and pedestrian zones to allow people to move around at a safe distance. Berlin, too, has already closed off car lanes to create more space for cyclists. According to a Greenpeace survey of Germany's ten largest cities, also published today, the Berlin example has not yet been copied there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version UNO Refugee Aid, national partner of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is increasing its financial support for aid projects for the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. The organisation fears devastating effects from a simultaneous outbreak of the corona virus and threatening cyclones. The first cases of Covid 19 have been reported from the Rohingya refugee camps. In Kutupalong, the largest refugee camp in the world and one of the most densely populated places in the world, an outbreak would have fatal consequences, because safety distances and hygienic measures are hardly possible. The situation is further aggravated by the monsoon season which is now beginning. The first cyclone of the year has already formed in the Bay of Bengal and is heading for India and Bangladesh. It could hit the country as early as the middle of the week. "Covid-19 is a global challenge. But the Rohingya are also threatened by a cyclone that the makeshift huts in the camps cannot withstand. We must not abandon the people there to their fate," demands Peter Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Managing Director of UN Refugee Aid. Support for the government in Bangladesh Since March, the UNHCR and its partners have been supporting the government of Bangladesh, particularly in the preparation and prevention of COVID-19, and the response mechanisms have been activated with the first confirmed cases. These require additional international support, as only just under 30 percent of the measures are financially secured. More than 3,000 voluntary refugee helpers have been trained in COVID-19 and are working in the camps to ensure that key messages reach the refugees. Communication in the camps and the surrounding area takes place via radio spots, videos, posters and messages in Rohingya, Burmese and Bengali language, explaining how the virus spreads, how people can protect themselves and their families, how they can recognize symptoms and how they can seek care. Almost years three refugee crisis in Bangladesh After the outbreaks of violence in August 2017 against the Rohingya in Myanmar, hundreds of thousands of people had to flee within a few weeks. More than 900,000 refugees currently live in the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. After a gruelling escape, most people have found shelter in the Kutupalong and Nayapara refugee camps in south-eastern Bangladesh. They live in scattered shelters built on hills and made of bamboo, plastic tarpaulins and anything that can protect them from the monsoon rains. Toilets are few and clean water is scarce.

    <TEXT>English version With the global spread of COVID-19, the loss of forests in the tropics has increased massively. As a recent study by the WWF shows, forest destruction in 18 of the countries studied rose by an average of 150 percent in March 2020 compared to previous years. This means that a total of around 645,000 hectares of tropical forests disappeared in March of this year alone, which is about seven times the area of Berlin. Environmentalists are reporting the greatest loss in Indonesia with over 130,000 hectares, followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (100,000 hectares) and Brazil (95,000 hectares). According to the WWF, there is clear evidence that deforestation and the pandemic are linked: "Everything points to the fact that the exploding forest destruction is due to a corona effect," says Christoph Heinrich, Director of Nature Conservation at WWF Germany. "In many countries, the state has withdrawn from forest protection during the lockdown, which encourages illegal logging and the plundering of other resources. Indigenous territories and nature reserves would also be less secure in many places and would fall victim to criminals more easily. The police, rangers and other state inspectors are significantly less present, and the staff of the various civil society organisations are usually stuck in their home offices. Criminal energy and the pursuit of profit Criminal energy and the pursuit of profit were not the only drivers of environmental destruction in Corona times, however. In many places, falling incomes had put people in a difficult situation. In several African countries the legal timber trade and the processing of wood had come to a standstill. A substantial proportion of the Congo Basin's timber products is exported to China and Vietnam. This trade route has been interrupted by the closure of the ports. The forests are suddenly losing their value and the risk of forest conversion is increasing. In the Mekong region in Asia, declining income from tourism and from the sale of forest products such as honey, nuts and berries has caused many people to return to their home villages and are now increasingly using the forest as a source of firewood and income. Technical and financial assistance needed To protect the world's forests, the WWF is calling for support for developing and emerging countries. Technical and financial assistance could help to curb illegal deforestation. This would include not only better enforcement of laws, but also the creation of alternative sources of income and the mitigation of social problems caused by the consequences of the corona pandemic. The most powerful lever, however, is international trade relations. Here, he said, better and binding social and environmental standards are urgently needed, especially with regard to deforestation-free supply chains. The European Union had a special responsibility in this respect. About one sixth of all food traded here contributes to deforestation in the tropics. At present, the EU level is exploring which measures, such as deforestation-free supply chains for products, can be guaranteed on the entire EU market. Joint task of the international community "The protection of forests is a common task of the community of states, from which no one can escape. We urgently need to stop global deforestation and establish new near-natural forests, otherwise COVID-19 could only be a foretaste of future crises. We now know that the outbreaks of many infectious diseases are directly related to deforestation. An intact nature is a bulwark against pathogens and must finally be perceived as a key factor for our health. If we do not act quickly, the plundering of the planet will fall back on us with all its might", says Christoph Heinrich. To the analysis For the analysis "Forest Loss in Times of Corona Pandemic - Deforestation in the Tropics" the WWF evaluated satellite data to determine deforestation in 18 tropical countries - six each in Africa (Central African Republic, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Kenya, Tanzania), Asia (China, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand) and South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay). The deforestation figures of March 2020 were compared with the average deforestation in the same month of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The data are taken from the database "GLAD primary humid tropical forest alerts" of the University of Maryland and are based on Landsat satellite images</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version With the global spread of COVID-19, the loss of forests in the tropics has increased massively. As a recent study by the WWF shows, forest destruction in 18 of the countries studied rose by an average of 150 percent in March 2020 compared to previous years. This means that a total of around 645,000 hectares of tropical forests disappeared in March of this year alone, which is about seven times the area of Berlin. Environmentalists are reporting the greatest loss in Indonesia with over 130,000 hectares, followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (100,000 hectares) and Brazil (95,000 hectares). According to the WWF, there is clear evidence that deforestation and the pandemic are linked: "Everything points to the fact that the exploding forest destruction is due to a corona effect," says Christoph Heinrich, Director of Nature Conservation at WWF Germany. "In many countries, the state has withdrawn from forest protection during the lockdown, which encourages illegal logging and the plundering of other resources. Indigenous territories and nature reserves would also be less secure in many places and would fall victim to criminals more easily. The police, rangers and other state inspectors are significantly less present, and the staff of the various civil society organisations are usually stuck in their home offices. Criminal energy and the pursuit of profit Criminal energy and the pursuit of profit were not the only drivers of environmental destruction in Corona times, however. In many places, falling incomes had put people in a difficult situation. In several African countries the legal timber trade and the processing of wood had come to a standstill. A substantial proportion of the Congo Basin's timber products is exported to China and Vietnam. This trade route has been interrupted by the closure of the ports. The forests are suddenly losing their value and the risk of forest conversion is increasing. In the Mekong region in Asia, declining income from tourism and from the sale of forest products such as honey, nuts and berries has caused many people to return to their home villages and are now increasingly using the forest as a source of firewood and income. Technical and financial assistance needed To protect the world's forests, the WWF is calling for support for developing and emerging countries. Technical and financial assistance could help to curb illegal deforestation. This would include not only better enforcement of laws, but also the creation of alternative sources of income and the mitigation of social problems caused by the consequences of the corona pandemic.

    <TEXT>English version To mark International Biodiversity Day, an interdisciplinary Leopoldina science team presented a comprehensive report on the global state of biodiversity. The oldest natural science academy in the world presented a politically unfiltered ten-point plan for overcoming the biodiversity crisis. "The clear and scientifically proven analysis clearly shows that German policymakers must now also take responsibility for saving biological diversity 'without ifs and buts'. The Chancellor must make this a top priority in order to find an effective response to the ten-point plan," demands Georg Schwede of the Campaign for Nature. Like the World Biodiversity Council (IPBES) last year, the researchers paint a similarly bleak picture of the state of biodiversity worldwide. They see human existence threatened if a fundamental change in the way we treat nature is not achieved in a timely manner. According to Leopoldina, this includes significantly increased measures to protect existing natural habitats. They also call for the restoration of impaired habitats and, above all, a radical reversal in agriculture. Leopoldina blames agriculture for 80 percent of the loss of biodiversity. Ten point plan of the Leopoldina The Leopoldina's ten-point plan for a turnaround formulates demands on the Federal Government and the European Union. In many areas, these demands go beyond the measures planned for the protection of biodiversity in the European Commission's strategies presented this week, the Biodiversity Strategy and the "Farm to Fork" Strategy. In particular, the Campaign for Nature welcomes the scientists' demand following a political initiative to safeguard biodiversity on 50 per cent of the land area of all the Earth's ecoregions and on 40 per cent of the marine area by establishing, financing and monitoring effective protected areas, the financial strengthening of protected areas in emerging and developing countries, inter alia as a compensatory measure to offset the external ecological footprint of Germany and the EU To this end, for example, four billion euros are to be invested annually to provide long-term financing for existing protected areas in Africa, an action plan by the EU, Germany and the global community to achieve effective protection of the world's remaining primary forests, including a global community fund of 35 billion euros for ten years With this report, the Leopoldina is sending a further clear signal to the Federal Government on World Biodiversity Day that and how action must be taken to overcome the biodiversity crisis, said Georg Schwede. "This report by renowned scientists also confirms us in our demand to place at least 30 percent of land and sea areas under effective protection by 2030. This would halt the loss of biological diversity and at the same time make effective contributions to protection against pandemics and climate protection," said Schwede. pm, ots, mei</TEXT>

He sharply attacked Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) for his criticism of the move. "Russia has not adhered to the 'Open Skies' agreement for some time now", Grenell told the newspaper "Rheinische Post" in Duesseldorf. "Instead of complaining about the reaction of the USA, Heiko Maas should have increased the pressure on Russia to meet its obligations in recent years".

    <TEXT>English version In the meantime, the return of uncertainty on the markets has also reached the Nasdaq 100. The US index has suffered losses since the middle of the week - although it has recently shown itself to be particularly firm in a volatile market environment. In fact, it remains the only one of the major US indices to have been in the black since the beginning of the year - and its all-time high reached in February is already in sight again for the Nasdaq 100. The overall bullish mood in the market segment is also reflected in the fact that valuations have made a strong V-shaped recovery. Between March 2009 and February of this year, the price-earnings ratio in the index based on 12-month forecasts had widened from 12 to 25, only to collapse to 18 - and now, according to Commerzbank, it is back to 27. After such a steep rise in valuations, the latest market rally is expected to lose momentum and expire in the coming weeks. This is because the optimism of market participants is still not based on fundamental strength, but primarily on the effects of the Fed's expansive monetary policy. Nasdaq 100 is not a pure technology index Whether this argument also applies to the Nasdaq 100, however, is open to doubt. In contrast to what is often described, the Nasdaq 100 is not a pure technology index and also includes stocks such as United Airlines, which were heavily affected by the crisis. However, tech and online giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google's mother alphabet have by far the largest weight in the Nasdaq 100 and account for 50% of the market capitalisation. And these companies have so far been affected by the consequences of the corona crisis only to a very limited extent. They all reported sales growth in the first quarter. Amazon in particular is one of the big winners of the crisis. After all, the company has a dominant position in Internet retailing, which has gained enormously in popularity during lockdown periods. Amazon shares on the Nasdaq 100 are outshone by Zoom in terms of corona-related profits. The paper of the video chat provider is in the plus in the current year with over 150%. Long-term success speaks for the index In addition to the performance during the crisis, the long-term success of the Nasdaq 100 also seems to speak for itself. According to asset manager Unigestion, the companies included in the index not only show above-average sales growth, but have also achieved profit margins that are one and a half times higher than those of the S amp;P 500 over the past five years. While the Nasdaq 100, according to asset manager DNB, had an annual return of 13.5% between 1985 and 2019, the S amp;P 500 averaged only 11% over the same period. The tech sector remains interesting as many industries are looking to improve productivity through innovations such as 5G and artificial intelligence. There is also a concentration risk However, the high weighting of a few tech stocks in the Nasdaq also represents a concentration risk. In the medium term, a democratic victory in the US presidential elections would also seriously increase the likelihood of stronger regulation of the US tech industry, according to Unigestion. In the short term, however, the greatest danger is probably the resurgent tensions in the dispute between Washington and Beijing. The Nasdaq in particular could suffer from a resurgent trade conflict, as the US exports not only raw materials but also, above all, higher-value goods and services to China. However, the tighter export controls that have been agreed so far are not leaving the US technology sector unaffected.</TEXT>

"The Bundesliga is being watched very closely under the burning glass right now, there are people who don't like us playing again.

The 2014 world champion takes the general corona rules, which are anchored in the concept of the German Football League (DFL), very seriously. "I'm already paying extreme attention and limiting myself even more. This is also because the test result determines whether you can play in the next game. This is a new factor besides training performance, for example. The result must be negative, otherwise you are not in the game. That's why I largely do without visits.

    <TEXT>English version Mowing robots are a deadly danger to hedgehogs. The Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union NABU asks that these devices - if at all - should only be used during the day. "The electric helper is becoming more and more popular in Germany", says NABU garden expert Marja Rottleb, "Many people want to make gardening easier with such a device and often don't even know that it is life-threatening for animals, especially hedgehogs". When in danger, the spiny animals roll into a ball and freeze for a few minutes instead of fleeing. This behaviour is their undoing when they encounter a mowing robot. "The animals can suffer massive injuries from the sharp knives," says Rottleb. "Young animals are particularly endangered, if only because of their smaller body size." However, the massacre on the lawn often goes unnoticed, because the wild animals do not emit any painful sounds in case of injury and retreat into the undergrowth to die an agonizing death. Use mowing robot only during the day NABU therefore advises to use mowing robots only during the day, as hedgehogs are active at night. Caution is also required when using thread mowers. Rottleb: "Under hedges and in high grass you should always check with a leaf rake before mowing to see if a hedgehog is sleeping there. A lawn permanently maintained by the mowing robot will also harm the hedgehog and other garden animals in their search for food. Flowering plants and herbs are lost, the insect and small animal population necessary for the hedgehog is killed until only a biological worthless green area remains. "If you want to help hedgehogs, you should design your garden as close to nature as possible", advises Rottleb. "This includes native bushes and perennials, as well as a wild corner or a home-built hedgehog house to hide in." NABU offers more tips for a hedgehog-friendly garden at www.NABU.de/igelgarten</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Caritas international is highly alarmed about the development of the Corona pandemic in Latin America," said Claudio Moser, Head of the Latin America Department of the German Caritas Association's relief agency. "The countries of the continent are heading for a catastrophe. Latin America will be the new hotspot of the pandemic." Countries like Peru, Mexico and Ecuador have been hit hard. In Brazil, the situation is now devastating. More than 1,000 people die every day, and Brazil is now the third largest country in the world in terms of the number of people infected with the virus. President Jair Bolsonaro, however, is not willing to fight the pandemic seriously, but rather fuels it with a confused corona policy, thereby risking human lives in good conscience. "The Afro-Brazilian and indigenous population groups suffer most from this irresponsible governance," criticises Claudio Moser. In the favelas, many people die of Covid-19 In the favelas of the big cities, a disproportionately high number of people die in comparison to other population groups as a result of COVID-19, with the city of Manaus in the Amazon at the centre of the pandemic, where 2,800 people died in April, three times as many as in the comparable months of recent years. Indigenous peoples, who are particularly at risk of COVID-19, are once again affected to an above-average extent. The rural population also suffers from the situation, who live from selling their products in the cities, but can no longer sell them there. This aggravates the food situation. C #225;tia Cardoso, head of the Caritas regional office for the states of Bahia and Sergipe in the poor northeast of Brazil, criticises that hardly any help comes from the state.

"The state will withdraw as quickly as possible so that Lufthansa can then manage on its own. This also applies to similar cases on which we may have to make decisions in the future", Altmaier told the newspaper "Saarbr #252;cker Zeitung". The minister defended the planned entry of the state against criticism from the opposition. He said that Lufthansa was a strong company with a long tradition, which had got into great difficulties due to the Corona crisis through no fault of its own. "I have not yet heard a serious voice pleading for sending Lufthansa and all its employees into insolvency." The exact form of the rescue package for Lufthansa is still being intensively negotiated. Do not interfere in operational decisions "In doing so, we make sure that we stabilize the company, handle taxpayers' money responsibly, but do not interfere in individual operational decisions of the company. Altmaier refused to impose on Lufthansa the condition, similar to France, that it would give up domestic flights in favor of the environmentally friendly railway. "When you start imposing conditions on individual companies, the border to a state-controlled group becomes blurred very quickly," the minister said. However, the condition of not paying dividends and bonuses remains. "I agree with Finance Minister Olaf Scholz</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version What's wrong with FC Schalke 04? Are the salary cuts hitting the players on the stomach? After the 4-0 embarrassment against a Dortmund B-Elf, the team also loses its second game after the Bundesliga re-start against FC Augsburg 3-0, and that at home against a team that on paper was one of the league's potential relegation candidates. But one thing first: The Augsburg team deserved to win. Even at high altitudes, because Heiko Herrlich's team made efficient use of its chances. In contrast to the S04. The team presented itself in a similarly desolate state as in the Revierderby against Dortmund. David Wagner's team had 80 percent ball possession throughout the entire match. But this "superiority" did not result in goals. The Schalker set up was too slow and slow, so that the Augsburg team never had any problems to chase the ball away from the Schalkers and start counterattacks. S04 obviously did not have a so-called match plan against the defensive team from Bavaria, at least it was not recognizable. Pushes the ball in midfield Instead of getting speed on the pitch, the Schalker players pushed the balls to each other in midfield. But at the latest 20 metres before the Augsburg Gate, the ball pushing came to an end. Because from this zone on, the blue and white players could no longer think of anything else that would be truly dangerous. Furthermore, the aggressive Augsburg Pressing also showed its effect. Reaction promised, but crime not held Schalke coach, David Wagner, had actually promised the team's oft-cited "reaction" after the Dortmund defeat. But there was nothing to be seen of that for 90 minutes. Surprisingly, the S04 team also presented itself as lazy on the run this Sunday, 108 kilometres were on the clock for the players at the end of the 90 minutes. That was simply far too little to put the Augsburg team in serious trouble. It was also irritating for the spectators that the Schalker also presented themselves as weak in the duel. In this form, it will be difficult for the team to play the next games successfully. And one more conclusion remains: Without the fans, the team is only worth half. mei</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German Federal Court of Justice BGH ordered VW to pay damages. In the view of the court, the company had sold its customers illegal and therefore illegal engines. Even the purchase of a diesel vehicle with manipulated exhaust gas control was an intentional immoral damage by VW: "This is a great victory for consumers," said a delighted Ralph Sauer from the law firm Dr. Stoll  amp; Sauer Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH in Lahr. Sauer is now expecting a two wave of lawsuits, which will be brought against VW. Particularly with regard to pending proceedings before the European Court of Justice, Sauer assumes that the new generation of engines has also been equipped with impermissible cut-off devices. The two proprietors of the law firm have also represented the Federation of German Consumer Organisations in the test case against VW, in which an 830 million euro settlement was negotiated. "Diesel Gate 2.0 now really takes off" It was not only the BGH that had strengthened the rights of consumers with its ruling. The European Court of Justice has also already expressed itself in a consumer-friendly manner in the VW diesel exhaust scandal. However, the opinion of Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston on 30 April 2020 went even further than the current ruling of the BGH. "Dieselgate 2.0 is now really taking off", Ralph Sauer is sure. "Now things could get really expensive for VW," Sauer continues. This is because the so-called thermal window, a temperature-dependent exhaust regulation system installed in new VW EA 288 engines, was indirectly classified as an impermissible shut-off device in the final motions before the ECJ. Switch-off devices in diesel engines are inadmissible - even if the exhaust gas control system is regulated according to temperature, the expert opinion states. Without legal type approval on the road "If the court follows the report, millions of cars will be driving on German roads without a legal type approval," says Sauer. The consequence: an avalanche of lawsuits will be rolling towards all the car manufacturers concerned, such as VW, Daimler, Opel, Fiat and BMW. The vehicles could be shut down by the authorities. By the way, the software update of the VW EA 189 engine is nothing more than a thermal window. BGH ruling: VW liable for immoral damage In the fifth year of the diesel emissions scandal, the Federal Court of Justice ruled in the VW case for the first time on 25 May 2020 (Ref. VI ZR 252/19). The law firm Dr. Stoll  amp; Sauer summarizes the most important findings of the ruling: The court considers the installation of a shut-off device to be intentional immoral damage pursuant to  #167; 826 BGB. VW had failed to meet the minimum requirements in legal and business transactions in millions of cases. The customer could demand repayment of the purchase price against return of the vehicle. Even used cars could be returned by VW drivers. The argument of the car manufacturer that he could not be held liable at all if there was no contractual relationship with the purchaser was not convincing before the Federal Court of Justice. VW had to take account of the actions of senior employees - even if they were not on the board of directors. The damage was not remedied by the software update at EA 189. The damage had occurred when the contract for the allegedly environmentally friendly car was concluded. In retrospect, the customer would not have wanted such a vehicle. The plaintiff had to have a compensation for the use of the vehicle deducted. As a rule, this is done by setting the kilometres driven during the period of use in relation to the expected total mileage of the vehicle. The Federal Court of Justice did not change this rule. VW would benefit from the usage fee in order to minimise damages. There is a suspicion that the car manufacturer is protracting proceedings "in order to increase the fee and reduce the damages". However, the BGH based its decision on the case law of the European Court of Justice. There, a reassessment of the compensation for use may well be possible. Several proceedings in the diesel exhaust gas scandal are pending before the ECJ. The compensation for use is also pending for decision. On 21 and 28 July 2020, three further oral hearings are scheduled before the BGH. These will deal with interest payment from the date of purchase, the purchase of a vehicle after the exhaust gas scandal has become known, and the question of whether the software update for the VW EA 189 engine has or has not remedied the buyer's damage. And the question of when the EA 189 emissions scandal became statute-barred was also on the agenda. The background to the BGH ruling In the present case, the VW group must take back the applicant's car and pay him compensation of EUR 28 257,74. The car in question was a VW Sharan with an EA 189 diesel engine, which was purchased as a used car from an independent dealer in 2014. In June 2019, the Higher Regional Court (OLG) of Koblenz awarded the plaintiff compensation for the return of his "manipulated vehicle"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German Federal Court of Justice BGH ordered VW to pay damages. In the view of the court, the company had sold its customers illegal and therefore illegal engines. Even the purchase of a diesel vehicle with manipulated exhaust gas control was an intentional immoral damage by VW: "This is a great victory for consumers," said a delighted Ralph Sauer from the law firm Dr. Stoll  amp; Sauer Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH in Lahr. Sauer is now expecting a two wave of lawsuits, which will be brought against VW. Particularly with regard to pending proceedings before the European Court of Justice, Sauer assumes that the new generation of engines has also been equipped with impermissible cut-off devices. The two proprietors of the law firm have also represented the Federation of German Consumer Organisations in the test case against VW, in which an 830 million euro settlement was negotiated. "Diesel Gate 2.0 now really takes off" It was not only the BGH that had strengthened the rights of consumers with its ruling. The European Court of Justice has also already expressed itself in a consumer-friendly manner in the VW diesel exhaust scandal. However, the opinion of Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston on 30 April 2020 went even further than the current ruling of the BGH. "Dieselgate 2.0 is now really taking off", Ralph Sauer is sure. "Now things could get really expensive for VW," Sauer continues. This is because the so-called thermal window, a temperature-dependent exhaust regulation system installed in new VW EA 288 engines, was indirectly classified as an impermissible shut-off device in the final motions before the ECJ. Switch-off devices in diesel engines are inadmissible - even if the exhaust gas control system is regulated according to temperature, the expert opinion states. Without legal type approval on the road "If the court follows the report, millions of cars will be driving on German roads without a legal type approval," says Sauer. The consequence: an avalanche of lawsuits will be rolling towards all the car manufacturers concerned, such as VW, Daimler, Opel, Fiat and BMW. The vehicles could be shut down by the authorities. By the way, the software update of the VW EA 189 engine is nothing more than a thermal window. BGH ruling: VW liable for immoral damage In the fifth year of the diesel emissions scandal, the Federal Court of Justice ruled in the VW case for the first time on 25 May 2020 (Ref. VI ZR 252/19). The law firm Dr. Stoll  amp; Sauer summarizes the most important findings of the ruling: The court considers the installation of a shut-off device to be intentional immoral damage pursuant to  #167; 826 BGB. VW had failed to meet the minimum requirements in legal and business transactions in millions of cases. The customer could demand repayment of the purchase price against return of the vehicle. Even used cars could be returned by VW drivers. The argument of the car manufacturer that he could not be held liable at all if there was no contractual relationship with the purchaser was not convincing before the Federal Court of Justice. VW had to take account of the actions of senior employees - even if they were not on the board of directors. The damage was not remedied by the software update at EA 189. The damage had occurred when the contract for the allegedly environmentally friendly car was concluded. In retrospect, the customer would not have wanted such a vehicle. The plaintiff had to have a compensation for the use of the vehicle deducted. As a rule, this is done by setting the kilometres driven during the period of use in relation to the expected total mileage of the vehicle. The Federal Court of Justice did not change this rule. VW would benefit from the usage fee in order to minimise damages. There is a suspicion that the car manufacturer is protracting proceedings "in order to increase the fee and reduce the damages". However, the BGH based its decision on the case law of the European Court of Justice. There, a reassessment of the compensation for use may well be possible. Several proceedings in the diesel exhaust gas scandal are pending before the ECJ. The compensation for use is also pending for decision. On 21 and 28 July 2020, three further oral hearings are scheduled before the BGH. These will deal with interest payment from the date of purchase, the purchase of a vehicle after the exhaust gas scandal has become known, and the question of whether the software update for the VW EA 189 engine has or has not remedied the buyer's damage. And the question of when the EA 189 emissions scandal became statute-barred was also on the agenda. The background to the BGH ruling In the present case, the VW group must take back the applicant's car and pay him compensation of EUR 28 257,74. The car in question was a VW Sharan with an EA 189 diesel engine, which was purchased as a used car from an independent dealer in 2014. In June 2019, the Higher Regional Court (OLG) of Koblenz awarded the plaintiff compensation for the return of his "manipulated vehicle</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The uncertain effects of the corona pandemic have unsettled the German VC market. The business climate has plummeted to an all-time low: in the first quarter of 2020 the business climate indicator for the early-stage segment fell by 72.3 points to -61.3 balance points - an unprecedented slump of this magnitude. The assessments of both the current business situation and the business expectations by VC investors have deteriorated massively. The indicator for the current business situation falls by -66.6 points to -52.6 balance points, the indicator for business expectations by -77.9 points to -69.9 balance points. Almost all climate indicators fall clearly into the red in the first quarter. Thus, the mood regarding fundraising, exit opportunities, new investments and value adjustments has deteriorated sharply. Only the assessment of entry valuations - which, as experience shows, are developing in the opposite direction - is improving. Due to the uncertain further development of the corona pandemic, the economic outlook has deteriorated considerably and a recession is looming on the horizon. Caution with new investments The stock markets and thus the valuation standards have collapsed worldwide. A significant increase in pressure on portfolio and entry valuations is therefore understandable. The reluctance to make new investments is a well-known crisis phenomenon. However, the demand for VC has not collapsed. Although VC investors assess the amount and quality of their deal flow and its innovativeness worse than in the previous quarter, the decline is comparatively moderate. Mood comes to an abrupt end "The corona crisis in Germany has put an abrupt end to the very good mood on the VC market," says Dr. Friederike K #246;hler-Geib, Chief Economist at KfW. "Experience shows that VC investors in crises concentrate on portfolio management and hold back on new investments for the time being. This puts pressure on the investment level. But it is especially important now not to leave the very good start-ups that are still looking for VC investors standing in the rain. Otherwise they will hardly survive the capital-intensive time-to-market. To lose a start-up generation would be a hard blow. The very good fundraising climate of recent years should make it possible to bridge the gap. Demand should not drop noticeably "The demand for venture capital is not likely to drop noticeably as a result of the pandemic," adds Ulrike Hinrichs, managing BVK board member. "The challenge will be to ensure the continued financing of the start-ups both in terms of breadth and the large showcase start-ups. Otherwise there is a risk of irreparable damage to the start-up ecosystem that has been laboriously built up over the past few years. However, the venture capital industry is well capitalised. In addition, the German government has reacted and has already set up a start-up support programme, which should now be launched as quickly as possible</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version What are the characteristics of people who are currently participating in the protests against the current assembly bans and restrictions on fundamental rights and why do supporters of conspiracy theories currently have such a large following? This was the subject of a recent study by social psychologists Julia Becker and Luisa Liekefett of the University of Osnabr #252;ck, whose data have now been evaluated. From 5 to 11 May, around 1,000 people who had not been infected with the corona virus so far took part in the survey. "After evaluating the data, it was found that around 18 percent of those questioned would take part in an online protest and around 24 percent would sign a petition, but only nine percent would also go to a proper rally against the restrictions. Different groups take part in the demonstrations, there are the vaccination opponents, there are people who are simply angry with politics and there are also the right-wing populists. Many also support conspiracy theories and feel strongly threatened by the current restrictions," says Becker from the Institute of Psychology. The virus was created in the laboratory In relation to all 1,000 respondents, the study also found that at least a third of respondents agree with the indicators of the conspiracy theories and believe that the virus was created in the laboratory. "The main characteristic of those who believe in the conspiracy theories is that they believe they live in a threatening world. They are also bad at dealing with uncertainty, so conspiracy theories are welcome because they give them back control and certainty through simple explanations," Becker continued. An inclination towards Machiavellianism In terms of their personality, they tend to be more Machiavellian, which means that they are more suspicious of other people and are more likely to use unethical means to achieve goals. Most of the time they would not be so much afraid of the virus itself as of the social consequences of the pandemic, such as financial losses. Often such people don't see any sense in the 'corona restrictions' and don't follow the 'corona rules' because they don't want to be restricted in their basic rights</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The mood among German exporters has recovered somewhat after the catastrophic previous month. The Ifo export expectations of the industry have increased in May from minus 50.2 to minus 26.9 points. This strong increase is unprecedented. However, companies are still far from optimistic. At least the German export industry sees a silver lining on the horizon. In almost all sectors, exports are expected to continue to decline. However, the decline will be less severe than expected in the previous month. Export expectations have risen in all key sectors, in some cases significantly. The increase was clearest in the automotive industry. However, pessimism has also declined significantly in the electrical and electronic industry. In mechanical engineering, despite the improvement, sceptical voices continue to be clearly in the majority. The same applies to the metal production and processing sector</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In order to be able to compare the economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) has bundled important economic indicators in a "crisis monitor" on its website, which allows a direct comparison of the economic development during both crises. The beginning of the respective crisis is determined on the basis of the first quarter of recession: The starting point of the corona crisis in the first quarter of 2020 is compared with the second quarter of 2008. The figures for 2020 are updated continuously. A comparison of the development of the price-adjusted and seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), for example, shows the abrupt economic slump in the 1st quarter of 2020 by 2.2 % compared to the previous quarter. In contrast, the financial and economic crisis set in rather slowly: From the 2nd quarter of 2008, the economic downturn began with a 0.3 % decline in GDP, which intensified in the following quarters. Low point reached one year later The lowest point of the then financial and economic crisis in Germany was not reached until just under a year later, with GDP declining by 4.7 % in the first quarter of 2009, after which the economy increasingly recovered in the second half of 2009. Similar developments were seen in the production index, retail sales, foreign trade and various price indices, which are included in the crisis monitor along with other indicators</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Germany's defense spending is expected to rise to about 50.4 billion euros this year. This would be 44 percent higher than the 2010 defense spending. This is the result of the Ministry of Defence's answer to a written question by left-wing MP Sevim Dagdelen, which has been submitted to the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post" newspaper. Since at the same time economic output is likely to shrink considerably due to the Corona crisis, Germany will make considerable progress in meeting the so-called NATO quota in 2020. According to an estimate by the Institute of the German Economy (IW) based on its latest economic forecast, the share of defence spending in gross domestic product is likely to jump to 1.58 percent in the current year. Last year, the ratio had been 1.36 percent. "Anyone who is happy about a higher NATO quota because the gross domestic product is collapsing shows what a child of the mind he is. The slump in the economy is no reason to rejoice and additionally underlines the urgent need for a real reduction in military spending," Dagdelen told the newspaper. Germany had promised the Nato alliance to move towards the Nato target of two percent in defence spending by 2024</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German economy will probably shrink by 6.6 percent this year and then grow by 10.2 percent next year from this low level. This is the result of the update of the Ifo economic forecast for 2020/2021 "based on the evaluation of the Ifo survey conducted among companies in May. On average, they consider a normalisation of their own business situation within nine months to be the most likely case," says Timo Wollmersh #228;user, head of the ifo economic forecasts. "Following a sharp slump of 12.4 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the economy should therefore recover by the middle of next year. Only then will as many goods and services be produced again as in a situation without a corona crisis," adds Wollmersh #228;user. However, the forecast depends heavily on how quickly the business situation of companies returns to normal. In the best case, companies indicate that normalisation could take only five months on average. Then economic output would shrink by only 3.9 percent this year, and growth next year would be 7.4 percent. In the worst case with an average normalisation period of 16 months, economic output would shrink by 9.3 per cent this year and grow by 9.5 per cent next year. The recovery would then extend well into 2022. Normalization expected in eight months In most sectors of the economy, companies in the Ifo survey stated that the most likely time for their business situation to normalise was in eight or nine months. At 16 months, the ramp-up is likely to take the longest in aviation. However, travel agencies and tour operators, companies in the hotel and restaurant industry and the automotive industry also expect the recovery to take longer than average. In addition to the most likely duration of normalisation, the companies also provided information on the range they expect to see. According to this, the duration of normalisation could at best be reduced to an average of five months, but at worst it could increase significantly to an average of 16 months. Closure: Economic output shrank by 17 percent All three scenarios assume a gradual easing from the end of April. During the closure, average economic output is likely to have contracted by around 17 per cent. The estimates were based on the detailed results of economic output for the first quarter and the production, sales and foreign trade statistics for the month of March. In forecasting the economic trend in the summer half-year, the Ifo Institute took into account the sharp drop in incoming orders in the manufacturing industry in March and the results of the Ifo economic survey from May. Coronavirus is being contained According to the survey, the business expectations of companies in all sectors of the economy have brightened considerably. However, the assessment of the current business situation remained poor; in the manufacturing sector, the corresponding indicator even fell sharply once again. The new forecast was based on the assumption that, although the coronavirus will not be defeated in the coming months, its spread can be contained and a second wave of infection avoided. It also ruled out a wave of insolvencies, both in Germany and in its sales and procurement markets, which could lead to distortions in the financial system and require a realignment of global value chains</TEXT>

Then start "the shooting", the US president said in his tweet. In the American big city, riots broke out again in the night to Friday, triggered by the death of black George Floyd. Demonstrators broke into a police station and started fires. "These thugs" would dishonour the memory of George Floyd, Trump wrote on Twitter. Accusations against the mayor Meanwhile, Trump accused the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, of being a weak leader who could not control the situation in the city. The mayor vigorously rejected Trump's criticism.

    <TEXT>English version Is there a protective mechanism against infection risks? This is a question that concerns people around the globe, especially at present due to the corona pandemic. Too little is still known about the new SARS CoV-2 virus and the covid-19 disease it causes, which in some cases can have a severe, lung-damaging or even fatal outcome. Scientists are working feverishly on research into drugs and a vaccine that can keep the virus in check. At the same time, experts are working on the question of how the human immune system can be programmed or influenced in such a way that self-protection against corona viruses is highly effective. Hope is now coming from the field of nutrition science. Professor J #252;rgen Vormann from the IPEV (Institute of Prevention and Nutrition) is convinced that on the influence of the acidic pH value on the immune reaction. People all over the world are currently coming into contact with the coronavirus. Many people become infected, but by far not all become ill; and when the disease breaks out, the progression of the disease varies considerably. The risk seems to be much greater for older people than for young people, and some chronic pre-existing conditions also significantly increase the risk of infection and disease. Coping with the virus attack For Vormann it is obvious that the potential of the body's own immune system is a decisive factor in overcoming the viral attack. The nutritional scientist, who for years conducted basic medical research at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Freie Universit #228;t Berlin and is now an expert in the pathophysiology of minerals, trace elements, and vitamins, as well as the acid-base balance, has studied the relationship between coronavirus and the body's specific immune response. Acidosis favours corona infection Vormann: "Studies indicate that acidosis, i.e. a very high acid load, favours a corona infection twice over. Firstly, through the direct strain on the immune system, and secondly because the acidic pH value in the cells promotes the reproduction of viruses. This is where we can start immediately." The acid concentration is crucial The well-known entry point for coronaviruses is the nose-mouth-throat area. In order to infect a body cell, the virus receptors, which look like barbs, have to dock to the receptors of a host cell, penetrate and fuse with it. In the case of the coronavirus, the success of the intrusion is mainly determined by the surrounding acid concentration. If the pH value is at a corona virus-friendly, acidic level, the risk of infection is high. If the pH value is in the basic range, the viruses become largely uninfectious. Influence of the acid-base balance There is another reason why the acid-base balance has a major influence on the risk of contracting Covid-19: the virus tries to reproduce in the host cell. If the pH value is raised from the acidic to the basic range, this will not succeed. On the contrary: the corona virus dies in the basic environment of the host cell. Two scientifically based conclusions can be drawn from the analysis A basic pH value of over 7 supports the immune system in its defence against coronavirus infections. Even after a coronavirus infection, a rapid change in the intracellular pH to a basic level can help prevent the virus from multiplying. What do these new scientific findings mean for protection against corona viruses? Many people would have a disturbed acid-base balance, most of them unknowingly. The metabolism in young people still copes quite well with acidity, which is usually caused by nutrition - i.e. the change of the inner-body pH value to a low acidic range. In the second half of life, symptoms such as lack of drive, rapid fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle and joint complaints or skin problems often occur. Vormann: "My recommendation for active immune protection against corona viruses is to deprive the virus of its feel-good environment, either through an appropriate diet or through quickly effective base preparations available in every pharmacy. Ideally, of course, prophylactically." Basics for a well-functioning immune system For a well-functioning immune system every person should strive to keep the acid-base balance in an alkaline environment. This can be achieved through diet if at least half of the daily food is alkaline. These include fruit, vegetables and salad, for example, whereby many foods that are perceived as acidic, such as lemons, grapes, apples and vinegar, actually provide plenty of alkaline minerals and are therefore base formers. Acidifiers such as sausage, meat, fish, cereals and dairy products should, however, be reduced. An alkaline diet supports health. In Corona times this is more true than ever</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona pandemic has hit many industries hard. Many companies have seen their sales plummet because customers are staying at home or saving money. But where demand is still intact, production often comes to a halt - for example, because employees are in quarantine or supply chains have collapsed. Many decision-makers are therefore making every effort to cut costs and secure liquidity, according to the experts at management consultants KPMG. In the process, the companies are increasingly scrutinizing M amp;A transactions that they initiated before the crisis or have already completed. Due to the corona pandemic and the associated economic slump, acquisitions are often not an enrichment but an additional burden - at least for the time being, say the experts. Mix of disappointed expectations and high pressure The mix of disappointed expectations and high pressure to secure liquidity will inevitably lead to a significant increase in the number of M amp;A purchase price disputes in the coming weeks and months. KPMG consultants have already observed clear tendencies in the market towards intensive analyses with which buyers are pursuing a clear goal: to reduce the purchase price retroactively. This would make important business and legal issues more topical: What claims can corporate buyers assert? To what extent are there realistic chances of substantial purchase price reductions? What do contracting parties have to pay attention to if they want to enforce or ward off claims?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version As a result of the Corona pandemic, the financial markets are experiencing a year of extremes. These include, as well as the speed of the price slump and the severity of the market fluctuations during the panic phase in March, the recovery rally that has lasted for two and a half months. Its extent is extremely impressive and surprising. In the past week, the Dax gained 4.6%, after having already gained 5.8% the week before - in just ten trading days 10.7% or around 1120 points. Based on its recovery high, the index has gained no less than 43% compared to its crash low of mid-March. With this bull market, however, the stock markets have now completely detached themselves from reality, which is characterized by the worst economic crash since the Great Depression and currently hardly calculable prospects and risks for the rest of the year and also for the time after. Unique support in economic history To a certain extent, although not to the same extent, the recovery from the shock of the end of winter is understandable. In this crisis, monetary and fiscal policy are intervening worldwide to a degree that is unique in economic history. This is compounded by the increasing lifting of mobility restrictions, which is heralding a gradual recovery of the economy, and the high intensity of work on the development of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 worldwide. Lack of sufficient alternatives In addition, the lack of sufficient alternatives to equities has increased because interest rates around the world are virtually being abolished. The most recent example on Thursday was the Central Bank of Poland, which reduced its key rate from 0.50% to 0.10%. Last but not least, the markets are counting on the fact that the currency guardians of Great Britain and the USA could also push their key rates into the minus range. Stock markets do not trade the black reality It is perfectly normal that stock markets do not trade the black reality of the present. After all, market participants are anticipating the future - or at least trying to do so. However, there are considerable doubts about the scenario that is currently being priced in on the stock markets. In a nutshell, the extent of the bull market reflects the assessment that the pandemic and the severe economic crisis it has triggered will be overcome within a rather manageable period of time and that the pre-crisis situation can be restored relatively quickly. The stock markets are correct in their assessment that this crisis will be overcome, but probably not in terms of the speed of recovery. Market participants commit a timing error In other words, market participants are committing a timing error. The pandemic and the economic crisis will not pass quickly. It is not yet clear when a vaccine will be available and how bad the economic damage will be. In the longer term, there are other potential problems whose consequences are hard to calculate. These include renewed tensions between the USA and China, a partial deglobalization of world trade, or a weakening of shareholder value. The valuation situation looks critical In one respect, the situation at the turn of the year has been reached again. The stock markets have climbed to a level where confident scenarios are taken into account, but negative surprises are not at all. They are therefore highly susceptible to corrections, even if another crash like the ones in February and March is unlikely. The valuation situation, for example, looks critical. The Dax is currently at about the same level as at the end of February. Since then, however, the consensus for this year's Dax earnings per share has plummeted from 918 to 627 index points. As a result, the price-earnings ratio (P/E) of the index has jumped from 13 to 18.5 in the past three months. If Commerzbank were to fear that the Dax profit would still fall to 550 index points, the P/E ratio would even be 21.1. Most of the rally is behind us Although it cannot be ruled out that the Dax will continue to gain ground and reach levels well above 12,000 points, it is still possible that it will not be able to achieve the same level in the future. However, most of the rally should be behind us for the time being. A further 20% would lift the index to 13,904 points, and the P/E ratio based on the presumably even further declining profits or consensus forecast would then be 22.2. This would then be all the more excessive for the extremely uncertain and risky environment in which the stock market is moving this year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the weekly newspaper "Die Zeit", Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Minister President Manuela Schwesig speaks for the first time in detail about the fight against her cancer and the corona pandemic. The past few months, the Minister President says, have demanded her "full strength. How could it be otherwise when you have two threats at the same time that turn against you: the threat of corona for the country, for the population. And the threat of my own illness for me." When the pandemic struck, the last third of their cancer treatments had just begun. "Fortunately the worst time was behind me," Schwesig said. That's why she had decided to continue as prime minister. She had thought: "If we now expect doctors, nurses and salespeople to be on the front line in the fight against the pandemic or to keep the shop running - then that applies all the more to me as Prime Minister". Take special risks It was clear to her that she was taking a particular health risk. However, she had decided: "The captain is the last to leave the ship. Somehow, I thought you'd make it now." The therapy time felt like a marathon. "You become humbled before life," Schwesig says. It was a "liberation" Manuela Schwesig had made her cancer public in September 2019. At that time it had been a "liberation blow". "I had a time when only my husband and I carried the cancer diagnosis with us." At that time she had decided to resign the provisional SPD presidency she held during that time, but to keep the office of head of government in Schwerin. Politicians should show appreciation for each other Manuela Schwesig wants to pay more attention to the fact that politicians show appreciation for each other in the future after her breast cancer disease has been overcome. "At least I'm doing it for myself," says Schwesig. "When you meet in the political arena, it's often about problems, so there's little time to ask each other: How are you doing?" But when she missed a round of prime ministers on Zugspitze because of her cancer treatment, she received a card afterwards on which all colleagues had signed. "This doesn't happen in everyday politics", the SPD politician said in the newspaper "Die Zeit". In general, the public encouragement had touched her deeply in recent months. Otherwise politicians would often have to deal with anger and hostility. "I have learned that society is often much more human than we think," Schwesig says.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Patient protectors have complained of a "deprivation of freedom" of nursing home residents and demand a "humane" concept for all inpatient facilities from Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn. After the lifting of the ban on visits to the 11,200 homes, little has changed for those cared for: "Even spontaneous visits by relatives or short walks in the vicinity are not possible," said Eugen Brysch, Chairman of the German Foundation for Patient Protection, in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "Isolation and loneliness are daily companions of this deprivation of freedom," Brysch said literally. Although no one can ignore the fact that the corona virus is highly dangerous for home residents; one in five people infected in the facilities die, said the foundation's executive board. "But expanding the facilities into high-security zones must not be the answer. It has nothing to do with joy of life, self-determination and human dignity. To restrict all residents is disproportionate The demands of the foundation's board of directors: "It is necessary to document contacts and to separate infected and non-infected persons as well as people whose test results are not yet available. This also applies to new admissions. However, to restrict all residents equally is "disproportionate". In particular, the patient protection agency accused North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse of "resisting preventive row tests" and thus blocking more opportunities for visits. Brysch called on Health Minister Spahn to "be creative in the care of the elderly". His ministry must "ensure uniform standards for practicable opening concepts". Politicians do not have the homes in view But he criticized that politics still does not really have the homes in view. Meanwhile, doctors in private practice and hospitals have been prepared for a second wave of corona with eight billion euros from the federal government. For the 800,000 nursing home residents, "not even the first wave has passed", the patient protector complained, the needy and nursing staff for the elderly are "still in crisis mode". Financial rescue package for homes In addition to opening concepts, the homes would therefore also need a financial rescue package, especially to compensate for the loss of income due to empty beds caused by corona. The costs would have to be compensated - as is the case with hospitals. Spahn is also under obligation here, said Brysch, "because the financing of nursing services is a federal decision alone".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Englisch version Covid-19 spreads more slowly in regions with a higher sense of social responsibility than in areas where the common good is less important. This connection between socially responsible behaviour and the spread of the virus is not only evident in Germany, but also in Italy and Sweden. This is the result of a recent study by a team of ZEW researchers in cooperation with the Universities of Mannheim and Bonn. "Our data show that responsible behaviour plays a major role in containing the virus", says Professor Sebastian Siegloch, head of the ZEW research department "Social Security and Distribution". "In view of the current relaxation of the corona policy, everyone should always be aware of this responsibility". The researchers investigate the relationship between social capital, a common measure of social responsibility, and Covid-19 case numbers in seven European countries. These are Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Link between ownership and corona measures The study also points to an important link between ownership and corona measures by policy makers. For example, the link between the spread of the virus and social capital weakened after countries imposed a lockdown. These results have interesting implications for the current debate on regionalisation of corona policy. "Our results suggest that regions with a greater sense of social responsibility could tolerate more easing. In areas where social capital tends to be low, politicians should restrict everyday life more," says study author Sebastian Siegloch. Social capital plays a decisive role Without medical answers to Covid-19 in the form of drugs or vaccinations, social capital plays a crucial role. Since the beginning of the crisis, politicians have been appealing to the sense of responsibility of citizens to adhere to rules of conduct and hygiene, to reduce contacts, to keep their distance and to wear masks in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. All these rules mean restrictions and inconvenience for the individual. Whether individuals follow the rules depends on their own social capital. A common measure of social capital in the social sciences is voter turnout, since one's own vote does not influence the election results, but people go to vote out of a sense of civic responsibility. Accordingly, regions with low voter turnout are considered to have low social capital. This correlation is also supported by alternative measures of social capital, such as blood or organ donations or voluntary work. Regions with higher social capital have lower death toll Using econometric models, the study authors in each of the seven countries relate social capital at the county (or comparable) level to the number of Covid 19 cases. Using statistical methods, the authors make all counties in a country comparable with regard to the most important economic and social factors, such as gross domestic product, population, economic sectors and medical infrastructure. In addition to analysing the case numbers in seven European countries, the participating researchers take a closer look at the Italian case. On the one hand, they show that social capital also influences the number of fatalities. "Regions with higher social capital have lower death toll figures," says Siegloch. On the other hand, they document that social capital actually influences individual behavior. Using anonymized location data from mobile phones, the study shows that Italians in regions with high social capital have more restricted mobility than fellow countrymen in regions with lower social capital</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In May, 7.3 million employees in Germany were on short-time working, according to exclusive calculations by the Ifo Institute. "This figure has never been higher," says Ifo labour market expert Sebastian Link. "During the financial crisis, the peak of short-time work in May 2009 was almost 1.5 million people." In the Corona crisis, companies had originally registered 10.1 million workers for short-time work. According to data from the Ifo Institute, 71.6 percent of them were actually sent on short-time work. In business-related services, 2.4 million people were working short-time, or 24.5 percent of the workforce. In industry, 2.2 million people, or 31 percent of all employees, and in trade, 1.3 million people, or 29.7 percent. The number was particularly low in building construction and civil engineering, with 163,000 workers or 4.1 percent of the workforce. For the other sectors of the economy not covered by the survey, the Ifo estimates that short-time work was applied to 1.3 million people or 11.3 percent of the workforce. In contrast to the financial crisis, when more than 80 percent of short-time work was employed in industry, short-time work is used in the Corona crisis across almost all sectors of the economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona mass tests ordered by Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) would cost up to 7.6 billion euros this year and could require premium increases of 0.8 points for 73 million people with statutory health insurance. This is the result of a statement by the GKV-Spitzenverband, which is available to the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). In this statement, the health insurance companies demand that the federal government assume the entire costs as well as a significantly lower remuneration for laboratories. The 52.50 euros per test set by Spahn turned out to be "considerably too high". The Minister of Health had submitted a draft decree to departmental coordination, which provides for systematic corona tests in day-care centers, schools, hospitals and nursing homes to further contain the epidemic. According to the draft, all tests would initially be paid for by the public health insurance companies (GKV). Private and uninsured persons would not be included. This is how expensive testing of people without symptoms is In its statement, the GKV-Spitzenverband determined how expensive a broad testing of people without symptoms would become. With 4.5 million tests per week - if, as desired, all health professionals and all hospital patients were systematically tested - "the remaining 32 weeks would result in expenses of 7.6 billion euros or 10.6 billion euros by the end of March 2021 (approximately 0.8 contribution points)," the association writes. Currently, the contribution rate is between 14.6 and 17.3 percent. Additional contribution rate requirement of 0.2 percent With one million tests per week, the costs would still amount to 1.7 billion euros by the end of the year. For the entire period of validity of the Regulation until the end of March 2021, this would be EUR 2.4 billion. "This corresponds to an additional contribution of around 0.2 points," the opinion states. Precise and reliable regulation required In order to prevent exploding costs for those insured by statutory health insurance, the GKV-Spitzenverband demands two things. On the one hand, the legislator must "create a precise and reliable regulation for the prompt and complete reimbursement of payments by the federal government". The announcement that Spahn would be discussing federal subsidies with Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) in the second half of the year "is by no means sufficient", the situation of the SHI funds is already "foreseeably tense" without the financing of the tests. Drastically reduce test costs In addition, the insurance companies want to drastically reduce the test costs of 52.50 euros each. The remuneration for the laboratories is "considerably excessive", especially since the samples are now being analysed "almost fully automatically", they say. The personnel costs have "decreased considerably". Instead of evaluating each test individually, the cash register experts also demand "sample pooling", which makes a large part of the individual tests superfluous. The GKV-Spitzenverband does not make a separate proposal for reimbursement, but with a view to the impending avalanche of costs, it emphasized the "special importance of appropriate prices".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the current ZEW (Economic Institute) survey in May, the CEP indicator declines by 21.7 points to a value of 14.8 points. Thus, the increase of the previous month, which amounted to 25.4 points, is largely reversed. The CEP-Indicator, which is based on the China Economic Panel (CEP) in cooperation with Fudan University, Shanghai, reflects the economic expectations of international financial market experts for China on a 12-month horizon. "The strong fluctuations of the CEP-Indicator in the last months show that the experts are currently very uncertain about the further development of the Chinese economy", says Michael Schr #246;der, Senior Researcher in the ZEW research department "International Financial Markets and Financial Management" and project manager of the CEP survey. The forecasts for the real gross domestic product (GDP) have been lowered again. For the second quarter of 2020 the average forecast is currently only 0.5 percent; in April the experts still expected an increase of 2.0 percent. The forecast for the third quarter of 2020 was lowered from 4.2 percent to 3.5 percent. The assumed course of economic development with a turnaround this summer thus remains intact, but currently at a lower growth level. For the year 2020 as a whole, growth of only 2.1 percent is forecast (previous month: 3.4 percent). Increase in debt and government consumption "According to the experts, this economic growth, which is very low by Chinese standards, can only be achieved by a further significant increase in debt and government consumption. In contrast to private consumption and private investment, both of which are still considered to be quite weak, the government sector is increasingly expected to become a driving force of economic development," says Michael Schr #246;der. The relatively pessimistic assessment of the economic development in the coming months is also reflected in the industry assessments and the forecasts for China's most important economic regions. The negative signs are now also dominating the development of real estate prices</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to reports from TV stations, two people died during protests against police violence in Cicero (a suburb of Chicago). According to the American TV stations NBC and CBS, 60 people have been arrested and the city has been looted, including a liquor store. According to the TV station NBC, more than 100 police officers were on duty. In addition, Illinois state and Cook County Sheriff's Office police officers were ordered to Cicero. In St. Louis, Missouri, four police officers were injured by gunshots during protests, according to police reports. The injuries are not life-threatening. The starting point of the protests in the USA is the death of the African-American George Floyd after a brutal police operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota. According to media reports, former boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather wants to pay the costs of the funeral service for George Floyd. Donald Trump increasingly under criticism Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump is increasingly under criticism. His critics accuse him of not calling for reconciliation in the country. Rather, he is creating divisions within the population. For example, he has now threatened to send military troops to the protest regions, because in his opinion the affected states cannot keep the demonstrators in check</TEXT>

    <TEXT>More than half of the 70.8 million people on the run are under the age of 18. Too few of these children and young people have access to education. While 91 percent of all children worldwide attend school at primary school age, the figure for refugee children is only 63 percent. And the gap is even wider in secondary school: 84 percent of all children worldwide receive a secondary education - for refugees it is only 24 percent. UNO Refugee Aid, the national partner of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), fears that the Corona pandemic will exacerbate the situation. Often, schooling provides structure in an otherwise deprived everyday life, and children there also receive meals. Now that many schools are closed, many families are left on their own. Especially as the parents are struggling with the economic consequences of the corona protection measures and have no income.  #8222;Refugee children are often enough cut off from the education systems, the consequences of the Corona pandemic are aggravating the situation. A show of strength is necessary, because education means perspective, and they need refugee children worldwide," comments Peter Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Managing Director of UN Refugee Aid. Many spend their childhood in exile The experiences and adventures that children have in war and on the run leave deep wounds in their soul. Many of them spend their whole childhood in exile, often separated from their families. They often become witnesses or victims of violence and exploitation. Children are forcibly recruited and abducted as soldiers. Anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders and years of psychosomatic suffering are the consequences and can have a lasting effect on a child's development. Uncertainty about their own future also causes the young refugees a lot of trouble. Girls who have been victims of rape, but also child soldiers* who have been forced to commit even the cruellest acts, often suffer a lifetime of shame and exclusion. Education is considered a luxury "In the midst of war and conflict, education is often considered a luxury. But education is a human right and is also indispensable to give refugees hope and dignity again. Education is crucial to help refugees to stand on their own two feet again and to build a better future for themselves," says Ruhenstroth-Bauer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version "I can't breathe - I can't breathe." Mark Mason, CFO of Citigroup, wrote this sentence 10 times in a row - as many times as African-American George Floyd pleaded with the police before he died last week in Minneapolis under the knee of a white policeman pressed into his neck. America has been in turmoil ever since. Curfews due to the Covid 19 pandemic have become curfews to suppress nightly street fighting and looting. Mason did not write Floyd's last words on a poster for one of the many peaceful demonstrations. The sentences can be found on the website of the major US bank Citigroup in a blog in which Mason points out the daily dangers for African Americans like himself - the risk of not returning alive even from jogging. The blog caused a sensation. Mason is Citigroup's CFO, one of the highest ranking managers on Wall Street and one of the few African Americans in such a position. Other top managers on Wall Street also expressed their outrage at police violence and their understanding for - peaceful - demonstrations. Financial markets ignore the demonstrations The financial markets themselves seem to have largely ignored the issue so far. It is true that the share prices of companies that produce surveillance software for the police have risen. The stocks of weapons manufacturers were also in demand.

    <TEXT>English version World Medical Director Frank Ulrich Montgomery blamed politicians for the boat party in Berlin, where thousands of people celebrated on the weekend despite Corona. "With the chaos of regionally different regulations, no one should be surprised if some people get the impression that now there is no need to follow any rules at all," the chairman of the World Medical Association told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). The fact that the relaxation after the Corona lockdown differed from country to country was too much for the citizens. "Even those who want to show responsibility no longer understand why they are not allowed to do something that has already been allowed again elsewhere," said Montgomery. "The resulting chaos is causing uncertainty, and we are now seeing in Berlin what that can lead to." Urgent change in pandemic control The world medical chief therefore called for an urgent change in the fight against the pandemic: "We must return to a nationwide, uniform relaxation concept in order to catch and stop this again," he told the NOZ. "What has happened must be a reminder to us to make it clear to people what can be eased and where precautionary measures must continue to be strictly adhered to. Otherwise people will become too relaxed." What the virus is eating at The events on the Berlin Landwehr Canal were highly risky from the point of view of the world medical chief. "The boat party has the potential to become the next superspreader event When a large number of people come together, in the most joyful and possibly alcoholized mood, with songs and the like, it's a sure-fire way for the virus to feed," says Montgomery. "We can only hope that it went well and the wind blew the aerosols away.</TEXT>

In the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung", faction leader Dietmar Bartsch called for the super-rich in Europe to also contribute to the EU's reconstruction fund. Otherwise there was a danger that the right would be strengthened and nations would be played off against each other.

Instead, he referred to the, so literally, European moneyed aristocracy: "We need a European levy on large private fortunes of billionaires and multimillionaires." He said that was necessary, economically but also politically. According to Bartsch, the Reconstruction Fund should therefore be improved. He demanded that all countries should collect a contribution from their wealthy people in order to finance at least part of it. "Burden-sharing should become part of the fund or secure its financing. Otherwise, right-wing populists will create a mood by saying that workers will finance reconstruction elsewhere.

    <TEXT>English version The market capitalisation of the world's 100 most valuable public limited companies (AGs) has risen by around 400 billion US dollars within one year and stood at around 21.5 trillion dollars at the end of March 2020. This is one of the core results of this year's "Global Top 100" ranking, which is published once a year by the auditing and consulting firm Pricewaterhouse-Coopers (PwC). The current analysis compares company values as of March 31, 2020 with those as of March 31, 2019, and also examines regional and industry-specific changes. It also differentiates between the performance in the months prior to the COVID 19 pandemic and in the first quarter of 2020, which was marked by the pandemic. At the end of March 2020, the market capitalization of the top 100 was two percent higher than twelve months earlier. Nadja Picard, Capital Markets Leader at PwC Germany, says: "The onset of the corona crisis is having an impact on the ranking, but with regional differences. Europe stands out in particular: The total market capitalisation of the European public limited companies represented in the ranking fell by 956 billion dollars within twelve months. This corresponds to a minus of 25 percent. "This also shows that Europe has consistently implemented the 'lockdown'," said Picard. Market capitalization has fallen significantly US companies continue to dominate the "Global Top 100" ranking, although their market capitalization has also fallen significantly. For the sixth year in a row, more than half of the world's most valuable stock corporations come from the USA - this time it was 57. Their share of the market capitalization of the top 100, at around 61 percent (around 13.1 trillion dollars), is almost as high as in the previous year (63 percent). Country ranking: Saudi Arabia rising, Germany barely visible If one adds up the market capitalization of all companies from the same country represented in the ranking, Saudi Arabia is this year's top climber. The country climbed from 17th place last year to 3rd place in March 2020, "This is mainly due to the world's largest IPO to date: that of Saudi Aramco," explains PwC expert Nadja Picard. The world's largest oil production company climbed to number 1 in the ranking after the IPO - and maintained it, despite the fact that oil and gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months. SAP Software Group in the Top 100 The share of the companies from Greater China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) represented in the ranking accounted for around 14 percent of the total capitalisation of the top 100 at the end of March 2020 (2019: 15 percent). With market capitalisation of around USD 2.9 trillion, this region remains in second place in the country ranking after the USA. As in the previous year, only one German company is in the top 100: the Walldorf-based software group SAP. Its market capitalization on March 31, 2020 was 136 billion dollars (previous year: 142 billion). Industry analysis: Technology leads, finance and health follow The industry analysis shows: As in previous years, the technology sector is the heavyweight. It has a market capitalization of around 6.3 trillion dollars. This is mainly due to the high value of many US tech companies. The global financial sector is ranked second and third with a large gap, at around 3.2 trillion dollars, and the healthcare sector at around 3 trillion dollars. Companies: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in second to fifth place. Nevertheless, at the end of March 2020, Saudi Aramco was not the most valuable company in terms of technology, finance or health, but the world's largest oil production company. Its value on the cut-off date: 1.6 trillion dollars. Without the IPO in 2019, it would not be in the ranking - and without exception, technology and e-commerce companies would be in the top 5. Second place is occupied by the US company Microsoft (1.2 trillion dollars market capitalisation) and third place is also occupied by a US group: Apple with a market value of 1.1 trillion dollars. It is followed by the mail order company Amazon (971 billion dollars) and Google's parent company Alphabet (799 billion). US top companies still dominate Picard comments: "US top dogs still largely dominate. But companies from Asia, especially China, are catching up. This can be seen, for example, in the number of 'unicorns' - start-ups with a market value of more than a billion dollars." 26 of the top 100 unicorns are now from Greater China. In this ratio, too, China ranks directly behind number 1, the USA, which currently has 50 such start-ups</TEXT>

More than 24.1 million Yemenis needed humanitarian assistance. Since 2015 alone, more than 3.6 million people have been displaced and have been living in the country as internally displaced persons. However, humanitarian aid is dramatically underfunded. But also the conditions in neighbouring countries, such as Somalia, are so hopeless that more than 282,000 refugees and asylum seekers seek protection in Yemen. The civilian population is suffering from poverty, hunger, disease and bombing. In 2017 the world's worst cholera epidemic ever documented broke out in Yemen. The consequences of a corona pandemic in Yemen would be devastating. People are desperate "After five years of war, the country is on the ground, people are desperate. Only two points help: Peace and financial support," says Peter Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Executive Director of UN Refugee Aid. Help is urgently needed now, he said, as these groups are most exposed to the threat of COVID-19, which can have serious consequences if the aid organisations are not able to provide adequate support.

    <TEXT>English version The German automotive industry remains pessimistic. This is the result of the Ifo Institute's economic survey. The respondents' assessment of the current business situation is still worse than during the 2009 financial crisis. The index rose only to minus 84.4 points in May 2020 from minus 87.2 in April 2020. In April 2009 the index stood at minus 82.9 points. At least expectations are no longer quite so pessimistic. The corresponding index rose from minus 44.4 to minus 13.4 points. "In the dark basement, the industry climbs a few steps up the stairs, but still sees no light," says Klaus Wohlrabe, head of the Ifo surveys. Demand was still as bad as it has not been since 1991. The corresponding indicator rose to minus 78.7 points in May after minus 108.6 (seasonally adjusted) in April. During the Lehman crisis, the index stood at minus 78.6 in December 2008. Exports shrink more slowly The companies also continued to take a critical view of their order books. The corresponding index rose to minus 65.2 points in May after minus 75.2 in April. Many companies consider the inventory of finished goods in May to be too large. The index rose from plus 40.8 points in April to plus 42.5 points in May. At least the index of production expectations rose to plus 22.7 points in May after minus 41.5 points in April. Thus, more companies reported that they intend to expand their currently very low production. The indicator of export expectations rose to minus 9.8 points in May after minus 65.3 in April. This means that from now on companies expect their exports to shrink more slowly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version More poverty and violence, less education and medical care - the corona pandemic is leading not only acutely but also in the long term to drastic deterioration for children worldwide. "Achieving the UN development goals by 2030 will be impossible", says Luciana Dabramo, emergency aid coordinator of SOS Children's Villages worldwide. "The Corona crisis is undoing hard-won successes and, above all, children and families who were already disadvantaged before the pandemic will be the biggest losers". Dabramo predicts that poverty and hunger will increase dramatically. Violence against children will also increase steadily as a result of corona isolation, while the possibility of receiving education and medical care will continue to decline. Assessment of the UN development goals Poverty Since 1990, the number of people living in extreme poverty had fallen from 36 to ten percent. "Now millions more children and families will probably become destitute due to the global economic crisis," says Luciana Dabramo. According to UN University estimates, the number of people living in extreme poverty will rise by 80 to 420 million, depending on economic development. This year, the billion mark could be exceeded - for the first time since 2010. Hunger Even before Corona, the number of starving people had risen again for three consecutive years. "The pandemic will massively increase the negative trend," predicts Dabramo. Many countries are already heavily burdened by climate change, wars or other disasters such as the locust plague in Africa. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) fears that ten million more children will be affected by malnutrition - an increase of 20 percent. If small children are given too little to eat, this often leads to irreversible damage or even death after a short time. Education "The longer children do not attend school, the greater the likelihood that they will never go back," says Dabramo. The worldwide corona measures have led to more than 90 percent of all pupils having to stay at home at times. At the same time, many families have fallen into economic hardship, so that children have to work to earn money. Before the crisis, nine percent of all children worldwide did not go to school. "We assume that this number will increase! We are rapidly moving away from our goal of guaranteeing all children a high-quality education," says Dabramo. Child Mortality "The current crisis clearly reveals how fragile the health systems of many countries are," says Dabramo. He said it was to be expected that the congestion of hospitals combined with increasing poverty would lead to an increase in child mortality. While the number of annual deaths among children under five years of age has more than halved since 1990 from 12.7 million to around 5.3 million, current UN forecasts indicate that it could rise again. Before the corona crisis, an average of 15,000 infants under five years of age died every day worldwide. Now it could be around 6,000 more every day. "The terrible thing is that many of these deaths are preventable. For example, many children die from diseases like diarrhea. Unthinkable in the western world," explains Dabramo. Violence, abuse, exploitation Even the declared goal of the United Nations to protect all children from violence, abuse and exploitation by 2030 will not be achieved, according to fears of the SOS Children's Villages - on the contrary: "Already in the first weeks of the crisis we could observe that the combination of economic hardship, fear of the virus as well as limited space has led to an increase in domestic violence worldwide", says Luciana Dabramo. Exploitative child labour or forced marriages would also increase. "In times of need, a twelve-year-old is more likely to be married by her parents than to be starved to death," explains Dabramo. The conclusion of the SOS emergency aid coordinator: "The corona crisis presents us with the problems of the world through a magnifying glass and it is impossible to continue to ignore them. We must see this as an opportunity and finally change fundamental things for the good of the children!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version More poverty and violence, less education and medical care - the corona pandemic is leading not only acutely but also in the long term to drastic deterioration for children worldwide. "Achieving the UN development goals by 2030 will be impossible", says Luciana Dabramo, emergency aid coordinator of SOS Children's Villages worldwide. "The Corona crisis is undoing hard-won successes and, above all, children and families who were already disadvantaged before the pandemic will be the biggest losers". Dabramo predicts that poverty and hunger will increase dramatically. Violence against children will also increase steadily as a result of corona isolation, while the possibility of receiving education and medical care will continue to decline.

    <TEXT>English version The corona pandemic continues to pose major challenges to the health and social system in Germany. Cancer patients are also affected. In addition to oncological care, COVID-19 often exacerbates the financial situation of those affected. Short-time work or even the loss of a job is an additional burden. Even before the pandemic, the German Cancer Aid and cancer self-help organizations noted that there was an acute need for action regarding the financial situation of cancer patients. They fear that the corona crisis could further increase the risk of poverty. In a joint position paper, the German Cancer Aid and the Federal Association - House of Cancer Self-help point out deficits and appeal to representatives of politics and social insurance institutions to immediately improve the financial situation of affected cancer patients. Progress in medicine "Fortunately, progress in medicine has led to better chances of curing many oncological diseases," said Gerd Nettekoven, Chairman of the Board of German Cancer Aid. "As research on cancer survivors has shown, long-term survival is often associated with a loss of quality of life, physical and psychological limitations, but also with financial losses. Only 56 percent of working cancer patients return to work completely after therapy! Income decreases, data increase Studies show that cancer affects the economic situation of many people - including young families whose main breadwinner is ill, the self-employed, single earners or low-wage earners. Income decreases and expenses increase. The additional expenses include, for example, personal contributions and co-payments for medically necessary medication, sick leave and additional costs for childcare or domestic help. During the course of their illness, cancer patients also have to go to great lengths to file applications and provide evidence. Bureaucratic hurdles arise in connection with sickness benefits, rehabilitation or professional reintegration, among other things. "In addition to the physical and psychological limitations caused by the disease, this is an enormous additional burden for those affected," says Ernst-G #252;nther Carl, Chairman of the Board of the German Cancer Self-Help Association (HKSH-BV). Unsettled by the pandemic "Since the Corona crisis, numerous cancer patients who are unsettled by the pandemic have been contacting us," said Nettekoven. "In addition to questions about therapy and aftercare, those affected also describe to us their financial worries and burdens caused by Corona. This particularly concerns people who are worried about their livelihood because of short-time work or because they have already been laid off. Carl adds: "We assume that such inquiries will increase considerably as soon as the economic consequences of the pandemic become more apparent." 1400 people in Germany are diagnosed with cancer every day In Germany, 1,400 new cases of cancer occur every day. "This number makes it more than clear that cancer is a central health problem in our society," says Nettekoven. "It is therefore extremely important that cancer patients receive optimal care in every respect. This also includes financial security in certain life situations in order to be able to cope with the disease or live with it without worries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Corona crisis has hit Europe with full force. The economic policy countermeasures taken at central bank, EU and national level are correspondingly extensive. In Germany alone, the planned aid and guarantees exceed the trillion mark. But are they also effective? Four economists from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) have investigated this question, which is becoming even more relevant against the background of the reconstruction fund proposed by the EU, in a recent study. Although the long-term effects on the real economy cannot yet be quantified at this point in time, it is already clear that the announcements on the financial markets have on average had only a minor stabilising effect in the short term. Economic policy measures partly fizzled out According to the DIW model calculations, the changes in government bond yields and stock prices in the four largest EU economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - showed that the announcements of economic policy corona measures on the financial markets had partly evaporated in the short term. In particular, the ECB's monetary policy announcements did not immediately calm the government bond markets, as might have been expected. "The markets were rather disappointed by the ECB's very cautious first announcement on 12 March. In fact, government bond yields rose further instead of falling," explains study author Geraldine Dany-Knedlik. Crisis turns out even worse than expected However, even the announcement of the emergency purchase program PEPP was not really able to stabilize the bond markets in the short term. Economists see a possible reason for this in the fact that the scope of the programme may have signalled to the markets that the effects of the crisis are even worse than expected. Nevertheless, economists believe that the provision of sufficient liquidity to the banking sector in the near future will help to cope with the second-round effects of the crisis, such as a shortage of credit to the real economy and an increasing number of non-performing loans. Regulatory loosening has had an impact In contrast, announced regulatory loosening, such as the suspension of EU deficit rules, the abandonment of the black zero in Germany, but also loosening of banking regulations, had a stabilizing effect in the short term. "This indicates that these regulations have an effect simply by the fact that they can be suspended or relaxed in crisis situations," says study author Stefan Gebauer. This was particularly effective if the announcements were made at the same time. "This suggests that, in the event of a crisis, many market participants find a relaxation of regulation more effective in the short term to support the real economy than a regulated banking sector or a debt brake, even if the long-term effects of such relaxation are uncertain. National packages had little impact The national fiscal aid packages, on the other hand, would have little effect on their own. Only the aid package announced in Germany on 23 March significantly stabilised both the bond and stock markets. Accordingly, the EU's three-pillar strategy, which was announced at the beginning of April and is similar in scope to the German aid package, should have been expected to also calm the financial markets. "In fact, however, the EU's major aid package was received very cautiously by the markets, which is probably explained by the fact that it came rather late," explains DIW economist Kerstin Bernoth. At this point, the national aid packages had all been put together. "In order to react faster and more specifically in future crises, a European mechanism, such as a permanent stabilisation fund, should be established. The reconstruction fund now planned by the EU could thus move in the right direction. However, it would have to be expanded into a permanent mechanism," recommends study author Marius Clemens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the case of the missing Madeleine McCann, there are new findings. A 43-year-old German national has been targeted by investigators. Now the Federal Criminal Police Office is looking for evidence against the man, who is currently in custody, and is asking the public for help. On Wednesday evening, 3 June 2020, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), on behalf of the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office, asks in the ZDF Criminal-Show "Aktenzeichen-XY"-viewers for concrete clues in the case of Madeleine McCann from England, who has been missing since 2007. In the programme, BKA official Christian Hoppe spoke to Rudi Cerne about a lead in the internationally known case which, according to the latest findings, leads to Germany. Madeleine McCann had disappeared without trace from a hotel complex on 3 May 2007 as a three-year-old girl during a holiday in Portugal. The case had caused a worldwide media sensation, and the responsible investigating authorities have been following traces and clues in this missing persons case for 13 years. Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann were in 2013 in "Aktenzeichen XY... unsolved" in 2013. The BKA in Germany is now hoping for decisive clues with the renewed call in the programme. Background information On 03.05.2007 Madeleine (Maddie) Beth McCann, who was 3 years old at that time, disappeared without a trace from a hotel complex in Praia da Luz / Portugal. In this connection, the Federal Criminal Police Office is conducting an investigation at the request of the Braunschweig Public Prosecutor's Office into the suspicion of murder against a 43-year-old German national who is currently in custody on other matters. Between 1995 and 2007, he lived more or less permanently in the Algarve, including for a few years in a house between Lagos and Praia da Luz. During this period, he was engaged in several odd jobs in the Lagos area, including catering. There is also evidence that he made his living by committing crimes such as burglary in hotel complexes and holiday homes, and drug trafficking. Furthermore, the suspect has already been sentenced to imprisonment for sexual abuse of children on several occasions in the past. Most of his contact persons are unlikely to be aware of this. Used vehicles are known Some of the vehicles he used at the time, various contact points and a Portuguese mobile phone number are known to the investigating authorities. The Federal Criminal Police Office and the public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig are asking for your assistance in further clarifying the circumstances of the crime. In the context of the clarification of the circumstances of the crime, it is particularly important to determine the actual whereabouts of the accused at the presumed time of the crime, which is between 9:10 pm and 10:00 pm on the day of the crime. The suspect used a dark-coloured Jaguar XJR 6 at the time critical to the crime, there is no information available about the actual registration before the crime, the last known registration after the day of the crime was from the city of Augsburg, as well as a white-yellow VW T3 Westfalia with Portuguese registration. There are indications that he might have used one of these vehicles to commit the crime. Portuguese mobile phone number used In addition, he used the Portuguese mobile phone number + 351 912 730 680 with a probability bordering on certainty in the period of the crime in question. 3 May 2007, a telephone call was made with a previously unknown person at a time relevant to the crime in the area of Praia da Luz. The caller used the Portuguese telephone number + 351 916 510 683. The user of this number is considered an important witness, but was not in the area during the call. The Federal Criminal Police Office and the public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig are asking for your assistance: Can you give details of the vehicles used by the suspect or did you see them at the beginning of May 2007 or do you know where they were parked during the period mentioned? Can you provide information on the telephone numbers mentioned or their users in May 2007? Can you provide information on the houses, rooms or other contact points shown? Were you in the Algarve at the beginning of May 2007 and do you still have any pictures, such as holiday photos or videos? Have you been in contact with a person who was connected to the vehicles, buildings and telephone numbers shown and can you give details of their stay at the beginning of May 2007? Were you possibly yourself a victim of a crime committed by this person? Furthermore, there is reason to assume that there are other people besides the perpetrator who have concrete knowledge about the possible course of events and, if applicable, the location of the body. We expressly ask these persons to come forward and share their knowledge.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Bill  amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged US$ 1.6 billion over the next five years to the Gavi Vaccine Alliance to provide essential vaccines to the world's poorest countries. This financial commitment was announced at the 2020 Global Vaccine Summit hosted by the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. With commitments for the next funding period, the alliance could reach an additional 300 million children in the world's most vulnerable populations, saving up to eight million lives. The total number of children immunized with the support of the Gavi Alliance since the launch of the initiative in 2002 will thus exceed the billion mark. Gavi is committed to ensuring that routine vaccinations continue to be carried out despite the current Covid 19 crisis. In addition, the alliance is also playing a role in crisis management itself: as soon as Covid-19 vaccinations are available, Gavi will ensure that they become available in low-wage countries. Pandemic teaches the importance of vaccination "Outside of the global health sector, few people know Gavi. But over the past twenty years, Allianz has changed the way the world protects and funds children's health," said Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill  amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. "If the current pandemic has taught us anything, it is the importance of vaccination against deadly diseases. With today's funding, donors are helping Gavi save even more lives." One-tenth of the children have no basic immunization Working closely with developing country governments, vaccine manufacturers, donors and other partners around the world, "the Alliance has made impressive progress". Despite the extraordinary results, one tenth of all children will not have basic immunization in 2018. In addition, Covid-19 is overburdening healthcare systems, disrupting supply chains and preventing health professionals from safely vaccinating against preventable diseases - a risk for millions of people. The world needs more breakthrough research "To deal with the Covid 19 pandemic, the world needs more than groundbreaking research. It needs truly groundbreaking generosity. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now: public and private sector decision-makers are standing up for Gavi - especially Prime Minister Johnson," said Bill Gates, Co-Chairman of the Bill  amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. "When Covid-19 vaccines are available, this financial commitment and global coordination will ensure that people everywhere have access. 750 million children have been immunized Since its establishment more than two decades ago, the Gates Foundation has supported the vaccine alliance. It has helped to immunize three-quarters of a billion children, save 13 million lives and halve child mortality in the Gavi partner countries. "In one of the most difficult times we have ever experienced, with the Covid 19 pandemic weakening vaccination programmes around the world and causing immense economic damage, this financial commitment has a crucial role to play. This contribution can help countries prevent the recurrence of other deadly and vaccine-preventable diseases," said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, CEO of Gavi. US$ 100 million for Covid 19 vaccines In addition, the Gates Foundation is providing Gavi with $100 million to purchase Covid 19 vaccines for low-income countries. A new "COVID-19 Vaccine Advance Market Commitment" will be used for this purpose, i.e. a commitment to early market introduction. In addition to the US$ 50 million in new funds pledged today, this contribution includes the US$ 50 million announced at the international donor conference "Global Response" initiative in May. The Foundation's current financial commitment also includes the US$75 million for the Gavi Matching Fund announced in January 2020. About the Bill  amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Guided by the conviction that every life has equal value, the Bill  amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is committed to helping all people lead healthy, self-determined lives. The goal in developing countries is to improve people's health and give them the opportunity to free themselves from hunger and extreme poverty. In the USA, on the other hand, everyone - especially those with the fewest resources - should have the chance of education and a successful life. The Foundation, based in Seattle (Washington State), is headed by Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, CEO Mark Suzman and Co-Chair William H. Gates Sr</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona crisis has drastic consequences for corporate investments in Germany. 50 percent of the companies reported to the Ifo Institute in the May economic survey that they had postponed investments; in April, 46 percent said they had. 28 percent of the companies had even completely cancelled investment projects in May, compared to 22 percent in April. "These are worrying figures for the longer-term development of the economy," says Klaus Wohlrabe, head of the Ifo surveys. The industry is cutting back on investments on a particularly large scale. 64 percent postponed projects in May, 56 percent reported in April. They were completely cancelled by 32 percent of the companies in May and by 25 percent in April. Service providers were somewhat more reserved: 45 percent postponed projects according to the May survey. In April, 44 percent reported postponements. 28 percent of the companies said in May that they had even completely cancelled investments. In April the figure was 22 percent. The situation was similar in trade. 44 percent in May and 38 percent in April said they had postponed investments. They cut 20 percent in May and 19 percent in April. Construction was comparatively less affected: 30 percent in May and 31 percent in April said they had postponed investments. 15 percent in May and 13 percent in April reported that they had completely cancelled projects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Because of the danger of corona, the head of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, has called for the cancellation of the CDU party conference planned for December: "We must keep our distance from each other, observe the rules of hygiene and mass events must not be allowed to take place again under any circumstances," said the chairman of the board of the World Medical Association in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "Of course this also applies to party conferences. They would be risky and should be cancelled this year or only held online." Even an opening of football stadiums, as some prime ministers are again considering, "would be devastating and could set us back far behind again," Montgomery warned. Because of the virus, the CDU had already cancelled its special party conference planned for the end of April to elect a new party leadership. Now a successor for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is to be appointed at the regular party conference at the end of the year. The date is December 3 to 5 in the party calendar. New infection numbers could be deceptive about the extent of the danger The low numbers of new infections reported by the health authorities could be deceptive about the extent of the danger, said the world medical chief. "This does not mean that many more infections are not occurring in secret." From China, he said, it is known that people still have viruses even after surviving Covid-19 disease and are therefore still infectious. "This is not tested in our country, so there is an undiscovered danger lurking here," said the physician and long-time president of the German Medical Association. The opening of the border and tourism have also created a new risk of people from other countries bringing in the virus. In addition, there are the so-called superspreader events, in which a few infected persons infect many people at once. "We are still far from being on the safe side" "We're nowhere near safe," Montgomery warned. "If, as has happened several times now in Germany, one person can infect 60 or 80 others and we don't realize it, a week later it's already 600 or 800 again! Therefore, a second wave in autumn or winter still cannot be ruled out. "However, the chance that we will be spared it has increased considerably in the past few weeks. If we continue to comply with the rules and mass events remain banned, I am confident", added the World Medical Officer</TEXT>

At the same time he defended the long development period. "We will present the app in the course of next week. We needed this time for the development because we have high demands: The app must be able to be used on all end devices and should, for example, also measure when you listen to music on your mobile phone," Spahn told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". It must meet strict requirements in terms of data protection, data security and energy efficiency.

    <TEXT>English version German industry expects a further decline in production over the next three months, albeit more slowly than before. The Ifo index of production expectations rose to minus 20.4 points in May after minus 51.0 points in April. Although this is the biggest month-on-month rise in the index since reunification, it is still not enough to justify a further decline in production expectations. "But that only means that the nosedive is now becoming flatter," says Klaus Wohlrabe, head of the Ifo surveys. Only the expectations in the car industry are optimistic. The indicator rose to plus 23 points in May after minus 41 in April. "This is no surprise after production was almost completely stopped in many places," says Wohlrabe. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products expect a slight decline in production. The index fell to minus three points from plus 14 in April. The mood in the clothing industry remains extremely pessimistic. The index fell to minus 88 points in May after minus 72 in April. In metal production and processing and in the manufacture of metal products, expectations rose to minus 36 points in May, to minus 34 points for manufacturers of electrical equipment and to minus 33 points for mechanical engineering. In the chemical industry and among manufacturers of printed products, the expectations rose to minus 20 points. For the manufacturers of food and animal feed to minus 5 points. The index remains in negative territory In the manufacture of leather, leather goods and shoes, the index rose sharply from minus 97 to minus 27 points in May. In the case of beverage manufacturers, the index rose to minus 26 points after minus 78 points in April. In the manufacturing of furniture the index rose to minus 31 points after minus 76 points in April. The index for textile manufacturers rose to minus 33 points after minus 68 in April</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The world is in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, but the stock markets are in a jubilant mood: the US technology index Nasdaq Composite has now reached another all-time high. The sharp bend caused by the outbreak of the corona crisis has long since been ironed out, and the index is up almost ten percent compared to the beginning of the year. In contrast, the economic realities look bleak. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, for example, currently estimates in its very timely model "GDPnow" the current decline in US gross domestic product (GDP) at an annualized 53.8 percent. This is of course only a snapshot. The decline in economic output will be much less pronounced over the quarter and even more so over the year as a whole. Nevertheless, it is clear that the discrepancy with the situation on the stock market is greater than ever before. Unemployment stands at 25 percent The recent euphoria on Wall Street was triggered by US labour market data. According to this, the unemployment rate was only 13.3 per cent in May after 19.7 per cent in April. A further increase to around 20 percent had been expected. However, it should be noted that the US labour market statistics essentially consist of hot air. Based on the much broader U6 unemployment rate, 20.7 percent of the working US population is unemployed or involuntarily severely underemployed. If you add another 3 million unemployed who are not covered by the statistics at all, the figure would rise to 25 percent. 2029 growth trend before Corona is reached again One might object that the stock market focuses not on the present but on the future and anticipates a steep recovery. However, this is unrealistic: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects the US growth trend from before the crisis to be reached again in 2029 at the earliest. According to CBO calculations, the crisis has led to an economic output of 16 trillion euros. dollars or 5.3 percent of nominal US GDP has been permanently lost due to the crisis. Two million jobs are said to have already been permanently lost. Flooding the stock markets with liquid funds Behind the bull market on the stock market is the flooding of the financial markets with liquidity that has got completely out of hand: central bank money currently accounts for an enormous 22.3 percent of global GDP, compared with just 3.7 percent in 1992 and 7.2 percent in 2007.

    <TEXT>English version North Korea flips the switch. Now the communist country wants to cut all communication channels with South Korea. According to North Korean media, these measures are to take effect from noon (local time) today. This is the first step in breaking off all contact. Background for these measures are propaganda actions of South Korean activists on the border between the two countries. North Korea's accusation: South Korea is not stopping these actions. In this context, North Korea accused South Korea of "treacherous and cunning behaviour". The activists had "flown" leaflets across the border with hot air balloons, which were apparently directed against the government in Pyongyang. The existing political and military connections between the two countries are also to be cut because of the activists' action. North Korea also threatened to withdraw from a military agreement concluded in 2018. Summit meeting did not yet bring success Meanwhile, Korean relations have stagnated since the summit meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un last February. So far, both sides have been unable to agree on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear program</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version As a result of the Corona pandemic, millions of boys and girls could be forced to work. The SOS Children's Villages point this out on the "World Day against Child Labour" on 12 June. "A first critical step has already been taken in many families, where boys and girls have had to interrupt their education. This is often the first step towards child labour", says Boris Breyer, deputy press spokesman of the relief organisation. As before, almost 70 percent of all pupils worldwide could not go to school because of the lockdown. If their parents also find themselves in need, the probability is high that children will have to contribute to earning a living and never resume their education. Even before the Corona pandemic, the number of child labourers had reached 153 million, i.e. almost every tenth child. Of these, 73 million were engaged in particularly hard labour. The United Nations had stipulated in its development goals that child labour should be ended by 2025. "We are rapidly moving away from that. So far, our greatest concern has been that progress is too slow. Now we fear being set back years," says Breyer. The mechanisms are known The mechanisms that lead to child labour are well known. "Currently, we can put a check mark behind each one," says Breyer. According to UN forecasts, the number of people living in poverty will increase by 80 to 420 million as a result of the Corona pandemic and the economic crisis. "It is one of the first coping strategies that children have to cooperate," says the SOS spokesperson. Illness, death of parents or the break-up of families also led to an increase in child labor. Particularly in economically weak countries, families can hardly count on state support at the moment. Instead, existing programs are being cut back because the money is being used to contain the pandemic. "Boys and girls who had to work before the crisis will be very badly affected: for many, conditions will continue to deteriorate and working hours will increase," says Breyer.</TEXT>

Even before the Corona pandemic, the number of child labourers had reached 153 million, i.e. almost every tenth child. Of these, 73 million were engaged in particularly hard labour. The United Nations had stipulated in its development goals that child labour should be ended by 2025. "We are rapidly moving away from that. So far, our greatest concern has been that progress is too slow. Now we fear being set back years," says Breyer. The mechanisms are known The mechanisms that lead to child labour are well known. "Currently, we can put a check mark behind each one," says Breyer. According to UN forecasts, the number of people living in poverty will increase by 80 to 420 million as a result of the Corona pandemic and the economic crisis. "It is one of the first coping strategies that children have to cooperate," says the SOS spokesperson. Illness, death of parents or the break-up of families also led to an increase in child labor. Particularly in economically weak countries, families can hardly count on state support at the moment. Instead, existing programs are being cut back because the money is being used to contain the pandemic. "Boys and girls who had to work before the crisis will be very badly affected: for many, conditions will continue to deteriorate and working hours will increase," says Breyer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version After a peak in the years 2005 to 2017, the number of mergers and acquisitions in the European energy market has fallen by about half between 2017 and 2019. The transaction volume in 2019 also reached its lowest level in the past 15 years. Few industries have been exposed to as many regulatory reviews and changes as the European power generation sector in recent years", says Moritz Lubczyk, researcher at the ZEW's research department Innovation Economics and Business Dynamics. "The energy turnaround poses a number of challenges for companies in this sector. On the one hand, maintaining affordable energy prices is a top priority. On the other hand, regulators and consumers are creating incentives for the transition to more sustainable business models and the reduction of environmentally harmful methods of energy production. Competitive pressure triggers M amp;A activities The competitive pressure caused by the constantly changing regulations has triggered a wave of M amp;A activities among the companies concerned in recent years. Between 2005 and 2017, the EU power generation sector recorded an average of just over 150 transactions per year. These reached a total volume of almost 52 billion euros. However, the volume of transactions has declined noticeably since 2017. In the following two years, the number of mergers and acquisitions has fallen from over 160 in 2017 to just over 80 in 2019. While the total volume of transactions still rose between 2017 and 2018, it reached 12 billion euros in 2019, the lowest level for 15 years. Is the industry taking a break? "Current trends are visibly diverging from the long-term averages," says Lubczyk. "Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether the industry has passed its peak and there will be a steady decline in mergers and acquisitions, or whether the industry is simply taking a break before returning to earlier levels of activity." The question is whether the industry will be able to continue to grow at the same rate as the economy as a whole</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Corona researcher Hendrik Streeck has criticised the German lockdown with its serious consequences. After the ban on large events, the number of infections had already decreased. "I would then have made further measures such as contact restrictions dependent on the actual course of events, also to see how the individual restrictions work and whether additional steps are really necessary," said the director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital Bonn in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). Instead, he said, Germany "went into lockdown too quickly" because, apart from concerns about hospital capacity, there was "a certain amount of public pressure". If, contrary to his expectations, a major outbreak should occur again, "one will certainly be wary of taking such strong measures again," said Streeck. Initially, almost all virologists more or less agreed that Covid-19 "should not be trivialised, but also not dramatised". With the pictures from Bergamo and the USA and specific medical findings, the view has changed. "At present, however, we are again approaching the assessment from the early days," said the professor. The reason for the declining risk assessment is the enormous number of infections, which have no consequences. More deaths than in other years "I still do not believe that at the end of the year we will have had more deaths in Germany than in other years," said the physician, pointing to the average age of the pandemic deaths of 81, which is rather "above average life expectancy". Some people that Covid-19 spares in Germany will instead die "from another virus or bacterium". Plea for a realistic view With regard to the different positions on the pandemic in science and politics, Streeck said, "It is very easy to warn and admonish. When in doubt, a warning is a better social response." He argued, however, for a realistic view. "Streeck expected the wave to level off in the United States as well. "One of the reasons it went up so fast there is because Americans continue to work with coughs and sneezes. There is not this form of sick leave there like in Germany," said Streeck, who spent nine years researching in the USA.

    <TEXT>English version ... The effects of COVID-19 Specific research by the IEP shows that COVID-19 has a negative impact on peace around the world, with countries expected to become increasingly polarized in their ability to maintain peace and security. This reflects the potential of the virus to set countries back years of socio-economic development, exacerbate humanitarian crises, and aggravate and encourage unrest and conflict. The IEP recognizes the economic impact of lockdowns as a significant threat to peace. International aid is expected to be reduced as OEDC economies shrink, which will further destabilize fragile and conflict-affected countries such as Liberia, Afghanistan and Southern Sudan. Poorly rated countries such as Brazil, Pakistan and Argentina may also have difficulties in borrowing, repaying debt and maintaining their economies, leading to an increased risk of political instability, unrest and violence. Political instability in Europe However, even economically stable countries are experiencing major upheavals, as leaders are under increasing pressure to respond to their COVID 19 response, with the USA, Germany and France already registering protests. Increasing political instability is expected in Europe, with riots and general strikes on the increase. Positive impact on proxy wars On the other hand, the economic impact of the virus could have a more positive effect on proxy wars, as they will be harder to finance in the face of economic decline and falling oil prices. Saudi Arabia's activities in Yemen, Russian and Turkish intervention in Syria and Iran's support for militias such as Hezbollah will be notable examples in the coming year. In the face of this burgeoning turbulence, tensions between the United States and China and tensions in multilateral organisations such as the WHO, the WTO and the UN Security Council are also increasing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The 14th edition of the annual report of the Global Peace Index (GPI), the world's most important measure of global peace capacity, shows that in 2020 the average level of global preparedness for peace has deteriorated for the ninth time in twelve years. According to the report for 2020, a total of 81 countries improved in terms of peace, while 80 deteriorated. Increasing civil unrest is becoming a major risk factor for the future, especially as riots, general strikes and anti-government demonstrations have increased significantly since 2011. This year, the IEP's new research activity on COVID-19 also provides insight into a world facing increased risks in most areas of the GPI due to the looming economic downturn, which will be the worst since World War II. Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. The index is led by New Zealand, Austria, Portugal and Denmark. Afghanistan remains the least peaceful country, a position it has held for two years, followed by Syria, Iraq and Southern Sudan. Positive signs in Russia and Eurasia The biggest improvement in terms of peace was in Russia and Eurasia, where progress was made in the IEP's research areas of Ongoing Conflicts and Security, with Armenia showing the biggest improvement among all countries, climbing 15 places to 99th place. South America recorded the greatest deterioration South America experienced the greatest deterioration in terms of peacefulness due to problems of militarization and security. However, the Middle East and North Africa remain the least peaceful region. Benin experienced the greatest deterioration among all the countries of the world, falling 34 places. Steve Killelea says: "The fundamental tensions of the last decade over conflicts, environmental degradation and socio-economic disputes remain. It is likely that the economic impact of COVID-19 will exacerbate these tensions by increasing unemployment, widening inequality and worsening working conditions - leading to alienation from the political system and increasing civil unrest. So we are at a critical moment." Civil unrest, militarization and terrorism A major trend identified in this year's report is the increasing level of civil unrest around the world. At least 58% of GPI countries will have experienced violent protests in 2019, particularly Chile and Hong Kong, with citizens protesting against a range of issues including economic inequality, police brutality, political leadership and rising prices for key resources. A long-term trend This reflects a longer-term trend in which unrest around the world has increased by 282% over the last decade, while general strikes have risen by 821%. Europe experienced the most protests, riots and strikes - but only 35% of the total of around 1,600 incidents were classified as violent, the lowest percentage in the world. Improvement in militarisation The report shows a 4.4% improvement in "militarization" since 2008 and an increase in funding for peacekeeping by the United Nations in 2019. The number of countries importing and exporting arms has also fallen to levels not seen since 2009. However, the improvements in peacekeeping contributions are likely to be short-lived, while governments use their resources to promote their economies. Number of deaths from terrorism declines The number of deaths from terrorism also continues to decline, with the total number of deaths from terrorism falling from a peak of 33,555 in 2015 to just over 8,000 in 2019. Similarly, the mortality rate indicator has continued to improve over the past decade, with 57 countries improving and 42 countries deteriorating. In El Salvador, the country with the highest number of murders per 100,000 people, the number of homicides fell by 25%. Overall, the economic impact of violence in 2019 fell to USD 14.5 trillion, or 10.6% of global GDP, due to fewer deaths caused by conflict. Environmental pollution has a negative impact Environmental pollution continues to have a negative impact on peace. The IEP Register of Environmental Threats indicates that by 2050, 27 percent of countries will be facing catastrophic water shortages and 22 percent catastrophic food shortages. The report also points out that in 2019, an estimated 2.26 billion people were estimated to be living in areas with high or very high climate risks, with 1.24 billion of them already living in countries with low levels of peace. By 2050, climate change is expected to create up to 143 million migrants worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (86 million), South Asia (40 million) and Latin America (17 million). The effects of COVID-19 Specific research by the IEP shows that COVID-19 has a negative impact on peace around the world, with countries expected to become increasingly polarized in their ability to maintain peace and security. This reflects the potential of the virus to set countries back years of socio-economic development, exacerbate humanitarian crises, and aggravate and encourage unrest and conflict. The IEP recognizes the economic impact of lockdowns as a significant threat to peace. International aid is expected to be reduced as OEDC economies shrink, which will further destabilize fragile and conflict-affected countries such as Liberia, Afghanistan and Southern Sudan. Poorly rated countries such as Brazil, Pakistan and Argentina may also have difficulties in borrowing, repaying debt and maintaining their economies, leading to an increased risk of political instability, unrest and violence. Political instability in Europe However, even economically stable countries are experiencing major upheavals, as leaders are under increasing pressure to respond to their COVID 19 response, with the USA, Germany and France already registering protests. Increasing political instability is expected in Europe, with riots and general strikes on the increase. Positive impact on proxy wars On the other hand, the economic impact of the virus could have a more positive effect on proxy wars, as they will be harder to finance in the face of economic decline and falling oil prices. Saudi Arabia's activities in Yemen, Russian and Turkish intervention in Syria and Iran's support for militias such as Hezbollah will be notable examples in the coming year. In the face of this burgeoning turbulence, tensions between the United States and China and tensions in multilateral organisations such as the WHO, the WTO and the UN Security Council are also increasing. Regional overview Only two out of nine regions of the world improved in terms of peace in 2019: North America and Russia and Eurasia South America experienced the largest decline and was the only region to show deterioration in all three GPI areas: security, militarization and ongoing conflicts. Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world. Greece and Belgium recorded the greatest improvement in terms of peacefulness, Greece because of a better score on political terror, Belgium because of fewer deaths from internal conflicts and a reduction in the number of murders. Five countries in Asia-Pacific remain in the top 25 of the GPI. New Zealand ranks first in the region and second in the GPI 2020, although the score has fallen by 2.3% due to the attack in Christchurch on 15 March 2019. Peacefulness in Central America and the Caribbean has declined, with increasing deaths from external conflicts and declining scores on the political terror scale. Mexico is again the least peaceful country in the region, with a 2.3% deterioration in peacefulness. The death rate has increased by 29%. The Middle East and North Africa remain the least peaceful region in the world. Bahrain recorded the largest improvement in its score of 4.8% - the third largest improvement of all countries combined. The GPI 2020 notes for the first time since 2016 that North America has seen an average improvement in peacefulness. Peacefulness in South Asia deteriorated according to the GPI 2020, due to a decline in peacefulness in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Bhutan is the most peaceful country in South Asia and the only country outside Europe and the Asia-Pacific region to be included in the top 20 of the GPI. Sub-Saharan Africa recorded a 0.5% decline in its score for peacefulness. Twenty countries in the region improved in terms of peacefulness, while 24 countries deteriorated. Benin experienced the greatest deterioration of all countries in the world, falling 34 places in the GPI 2020 to 106th place. p</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The virologist Hendrick Streeck from Bonn doubts the benefit of the corona app announced by the German government. It would come "a little late", he said in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung", "especially since it is not known whether it can contribute anything at all to controlling a pandemic in Germany". The director of the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn also questioned the usefulness of the numerous corona tests in view of the high costs. "Depending on the laboratory, in the best case, 59 euros per test will come to the health system - at 400,000 per week, that means a lot of money. If systematic screening is then to be carried out, it will be even more. If we only see one positive result per 100 tests, it's hard to know if it's still worth it. Calls for discussion on compulsory masks Streeck also initiated a discussion about the compulsory wearing of masks. "At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a strong warning against masks. The reasons for this are still valid, even if, strangely enough, they no longer seem to play a role. People fold the masks into their trouser pockets, touch them all the time and strap them to their mouths again and again for two weeks, probably unwashed. It's a wonderful breeding ground for bacteria and fungi." With regard to schools and daycare centres, the professor explained, "Children are not the big virus spinners". From a virological point of view, all is said on the question of opening. "The decision must now be made politically.

    <TEXT>English version Leading experts have called for an urgent fresh start and more money for the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure that the fight against corona is also successful in poorer countries. The situation in the southern hemisphere is "dramatic", many countries there simply lack the funds for health care and vaccination of large parts of the population, said World Medical Officer Frank Ulrich Montgomery in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "This is where the World Health Organization must urgently step in." To this end, the member states of the WHO "must make more money available right now. Because if the fight against Corona is lost in southern Africa, it will be lost for the whole globe. We cannot lock the virus up on one continent, it will keep finding its way to us." WHO is bled dry in terms of personnel and funding The WHO has been "bled dry financially and in terms of personnel", SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach complained in the newspaper "NOZ". The organization now has a decisive role to play in fighting corona in developing countries and preventing future pandemics. "We must not wait until (US President Donald) Trump and (China's President) Xi (Jinping) stop fighting and the US gets back in. The other countries must immediately increase their contributions," said Lauterbach. There has never been a time when strengthening the organisation has been more important. The SPD politician and epidemiologist warned that the "health nato" for the EU proclaimed by Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) should not obscure the view of the challenges outside Europe. Everyone can exert pressure with money Top representatives of medical research say: "Whether states like the USA and China or people like Bill Gates: everyone can exert pressure with money. We have to stop that. In addition, there are numerous duplicate responsibilities, for example with sub-organisations of the United Nations such as UNAids and UNFPA, complains an expert on the international health system. Perhaps it would make more sense to have a WHO profile that relied on the networking of existing disease control centres in different regions of the world. Montgomery also urged "to free the WHO from political influence, to develop it into a World Health Organization and to strengthen its scientific competence". The new start must make the WHO a "powerful, but purely scientific-medical actor". Federal Government is only a spectator The chairman of the board of the World Medical Association accused the German government of being "only spectators, that is not enough" beyond its contributions to the WHO. Also from a medical-historical perspective, the importance of the organization could not be overestimated.

    <TEXT>English version The Federal Government wants to make the fight against child labour and the sexual exploitation of children a priority of the German EU Council Presidency and in this time create the foundations for a European supply chain law. "This includes fair wages for parents", Development Minister Gerd M #252;ller (CSU) told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). According to M #252;ller, no entrepreneur should be able to stand up and say that he has done nothing actively against child labour and slavery in his supply chain. Germany takes over the presidency of the Council of the European Union on 1 July. M #252;ller lamented that the Corona crisis threatened massive setbacks in the fight against child labour and exploitation. "Covid-19 has led to a dramatic hunger and economic crisis in many developing countries. Millions of parents are unemployed. One billion children cannot go to school, and many lose their only meal a day." 40 million children fall into extreme poverty The minister fears that the Corona crisis would cause another 40 million children to fall into extreme poverty this year. "One consequence is that children will have to work for their families to survive. And because of the plight of many poor families and the curfews, more children are also victims of sexual exploitation." M #252;ller demanded: "We must do everything to stop this most despicable form of child labor." Ban on child labor is a human right DGB leader Reiner Hoffmann also urged the NOZ to introduce a supply chain law. He stressed: "The prohibition of child labour is a human right that must be observed globally. Companies that operate from Germany and do business in Germany must also comply with it. This must be checked by a supply chain law and punished in case of violations. Due to the corona pandemic, child labour is increasing Birte K #246;tter, spokeswoman of the board of the children's charity terre des hommes, also expressed her fears that child labour will increase as a result of the Corona pandemic because millions of families have no income and the children have to work.

    <TEXT>English version Due to the decreasing number of Covid-19 patients in Europe, researchers complain about finding fewer and fewer subjects for clinical trials. The Neue Z #252;richer Zeitung (NZZ) reports that in many European countries, these are needed for the investigation of drugs and therapies developed from the observation of Covid-19 patients. Many vaccination studies would also have problems because the vaccinated volunteers would have little chance of encountering the virus. Continuing the studies in countries where the virus is still prevalent is also problematic. It is not possible to transfer funds from one country to another. This also applies to the EU. Here too, the organisations and donors must give their prior consent. Major problems in severely affected Covid-19 countries It would be even more difficult to attract patients from countries still strongly affected by the virus, such as the USA, Brazil, Russia and Iran. Under these circumstances, the study protocol has to be approved in the respective country. In addition, new organisers, sponsors, hospitals and medical teams must be found on site.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version 28.9 billion euros turnover (excluding transfer revenues) was generated by the European football market in the 2018/19 season, which is a new record, but for the first time in the history of Deloitte's Annual Review of Football Finance (ARFF), which now comprises 29 issues, it is currently becoming apparent that no new record turnover will be announced in the next ARFF. The current ranking of the financially strongest top leagues of top international football refers to the 2018/19 season and is not yet affected by the cuts caused by the global COVID 19 pandemic. "Football, like so many other economic sectors, is facing challenging times," confirms Stefan Ludwig, partner and head of the Sport Business Group at Deloitte. In almost all European leagues as well as the respective cup competitions, matches have been suspended for an initially indefinite period of time. The Bundesliga was the first league to continue on the basis of ghost games and an extensive hygiene concept in mid-May. The European Championship in summer 2020 was also postponed by one year. Football, both professional and amateur, faces immense challenges, some of which threaten its very existence. The fans play a key role "A key role is also played by the fans, because they are ultimately the backbone of economic success," said Ludwig. "Their enthusiasm in particular makes top-class football an attractive product for media and business partners from all over the world. The phase of the Ghost Games will probably once again make it particularly clear how important the atmosphere in the stadiums is for the players, but also for the TV viewers. The associations, leagues and clubs are currently faced with the challenge of meeting the required protective measures on the one hand and creating emotional football experiences under these special conditions on the other hand". Premiere League further increases the gap to second and third place In the 2018/19 season, which is the focus here, the "Big Five" leagues from England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France were once again the main growth drivers and responsible for 59 percent (approx. 17 billion euros) of sales in the European football market. The leader among the top leagues remains the Premier League with total sales of 5.9 billion euros in 2018/19 (excluding transfer revenues). The seven percent growth in revenues compared with the previous season (around 411 million Euro) is mainly attributable to significant increases in commercial revenues (up nine percent) and the increased payouts from UEFA competitions. Bundesliga and La Liga almost level In the battle for second place in the top-selling European leagues, the Spanish Primera Divisi #243;n and the German Bundesliga always make it exciting. After the Bundesliga was ahead in the previous season, in 2018/19 the Spanish La Liga, with total sales of around 3.4 billion euros (excluding transfer revenues in each case), was able to take the lead, just ahead of the Bundesliga with 3.3 billion euros. The most important driver of La Liga's ten percent overall growth continues to be income from media rights. There are significant differences in commercial revenues within the league. In this area, La Liga recorded a seven percent increase - FC Barcelona is largely responsible for this increase (88 percent). Serie A and Ligue 1 grow in all categories In fourth and fifth place were again the Italian Serie A with total revenues of around 2.5 billion euros and the French Ligue 1 with around 1.9 billion euros (excluding transfer revenues in each case). Both leagues were able to increase in all revenue categories considered, achieving overall growth of eleven (Serie A) and twelve percent (Ligue 1). While media rights revenues are the most important economic factor for the leagues in Italy and France as well, it is remarkable that - similar to La Liga - the growth in both commercial and matchday revenues can be attributed primarily to individual top clubs: In Serie A, the economic league primus is Juventus Turin, in Ligue 1 Paris Saint-Germain. Bundesliga profits from proceeds from media rights Compared with the previous season, the change in the composition of the Bundesliga, with promotions and relegations, was the main reason for a slight decline in commercial and matchday revenues. Despite this, the German top league recorded a remarkable growth in turnover totalling 177 million euros, an increase of six percent. This was mainly due to the significant increase in media rights revenues, which rose by 19 percent. "The negotiations for the next media rights cycle 2021/22 to 2024/25 promise to be exciting", says Kim Lachmann, Senior Manager of Deloitte's Sport Business Group. "The co-exclusive exploitation of the live rights packages for TV, web and mobile TV, which is regulated within the framework of the award, underlines the continued growing importance of digital channels". Personnel expenses increased by seven percent Personnel expenses for the 2018/19 Bundesliga season rose by seven percent. Despite the higher salary costs, the personnel expenses ratio rose only slightly (+ one percent) year-on-year to 54 percent. Even though this is the highest figure for the Bundesliga since the 2009/10 season, no other "Big Five" league has reached a comparable level in the past 20 years. Women's football as a driver of innovation? Remarkable developments are also emerging in women's football: The 2019 World Cup in France acted as a catalyst for the already growing interest in women's football. In the stadiums, an average of 21,756 spectators feverishly followed each game. An average of 17 million people worldwide watched the games on TV - more than twice as many as at the 2015 World Cup in Canada. Despite this development and a long tradition - German women's football celebrated its 50th anniversary this year - there is still a lot of development potential in this area. Re-Starts in women's football New ideas and concepts, such as a new competition structure on a national and international level, can often be introduced here even more easily than with male colleagues, as logistical hurdles such as packed schedules often slow down innovations. Women's football also offers attractive opportunities for commercial partners. The broadcasting of the restart of the Women's Bundesliga in May 2020 to 16 countries worldwide (Central America, Scandinavia, Great Britain) also underlines this potential. The successful World Cup 2019 certainly gives cause for optimism with regard to the upcoming major events in women's football - the 2021 Olympic Games, the European Championship 2022 and the World Cup 2023. Getting ready for the digital future Enter into digital exchange with the fans "Innovation is in demand everywhere in top-class football," Ludwig sums up. "Even though the longing is great, it will probably still be a while before we can return to our accustomed everyday football routine. The leagues and clubs should now seize the opportunity to focus more on digital exchange with fans. This not only comforts domestic fans over ghost games, but also creates opportunities to develop international markets"</TEXT>

The fans play a key role "A key role is also played by the fans, because they are ultimately the backbone of economic success," said Ludwig. "Their enthusiasm in particular makes top-class football an attractive product for media and business partners from all over the world. The phase of the Ghost Games will probably once again make it particularly clear how important the atmosphere in the stadiums is for the players, but also for the TV viewers. The associations, leagues and clubs are currently faced with the challenge of meeting the required protective measures on the one hand and creating emotional football experiences under these special conditions on the other hand". Premiere League further increases the gap to second and third place In the 2018/19 season, which is the focus here, the "Big Five" leagues from England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France were once again the main growth drivers and responsible for 59 percent (approx. 17 billion euros) of sales in the European football market. The leader among the top leagues remains the Premier League with total sales of 5.9 billion euros in 2018/19 (excluding transfer revenues). The seven percent growth in revenues compared with the previous season (around 411 million Euro) is mainly attributable to significant increases in commercial revenues (up nine percent) and the increased payouts from UEFA competitions. Bundesliga and La Liga almost level In the battle for second place in the top-selling European leagues, the Spanish Primera Divisi #243;n and the German Bundesliga always make it exciting. After the Bundesliga was ahead in the previous season, in 2018/19 the Spanish La Liga, with total sales of around 3.4 billion euros (excluding transfer revenues in each case), was able to take the lead, just ahead of the Bundesliga with 3.3 billion euros. The most important driver of La Liga's ten percent overall growth continues to be income from media rights. There are significant differences in commercial revenues within the league. In this area, La Liga recorded a seven percent increase - FC Barcelona is largely responsible for this increase (88 percent). Serie A and Ligue 1 grow in all categories In fourth and fifth place were again the Italian Serie A with total revenues of around 2.5 billion euros and the French Ligue 1 with around 1.9 billion euros (excluding transfer revenues in each case). Both leagues were able to increase in all revenue categories considered, achieving overall growth of eleven (Serie A) and twelve percent (Ligue 1). While media rights revenues are the most important economic factor for the leagues in Italy and France as well, it is remarkable that - similar to La Liga - the growth in both commercial and matchday revenues can be attributed primarily to individual top clubs: In Serie A, the economic league primus is Juventus Turin, in Ligue 1 Paris Saint-Germain. Bundesliga profits from proceeds from media rights Compared with the previous season, the change in the composition of the Bundesliga, with promotions and relegations, was the main reason for a slight decline in commercial and matchday revenues. Despite this, the German top league recorded a remarkable growth in turnover totalling 177 million euros, an increase of six percent. This was mainly due to the significant increase in media rights revenues, which rose by 19 percent. "The negotiations for the next media rights cycle 2021/22 to 2024/25 promise to be exciting", says Kim Lachmann, Senior Manager of Deloitte's Sport Business Group. "The co-exclusive exploitation of the live rights packages for TV, web and mobile TV, which is regulated within the framework of the award, underlines the continued growing importance of digital channels". Personnel expenses increased by seven percent Personnel expenses for the 2018/19 Bundesliga season rose by seven percent. Despite the higher salary costs, the personnel expenses ratio rose only slightly (+ one percent) year-on-year to 54 percent. Even though this is the highest figure for the Bundesliga since the 2009/10 season, no other "Big Five" league has reached a comparable level in the past 20 years. Women's football as a driver of innovation? Remarkable developments are also emerging in women's football: The 2019 World Cup in France acted as a catalyst for the already growing interest in women's football. In the stadiums, an average of 21,756 spectators feverishly followed each game. An average of 17 million people worldwide watched the games on TV - more than twice as many as at the 2015 World Cup in Canada. Despite this development and a long tradition - German women's football celebrated its 50th anniversary this year - there is still a lot of development potential in this area. Re-Starts in women's football New ideas and concepts, such as a new competition structure on a national and international level, can often be introduced here even more easily than with male colleagues, as logistical hurdles such as packed schedules often slow down innovations. Women's football also offers attractive opportunities for commercial partners. The broadcasting of the restart of the Women's Bundesliga in May 2020 to 16 countries worldwide (Central America, Scandinavia, Great Britain) also underlines this potential. The successful World Cup 2019 certainly gives cause for optimism with regard to the upcoming major events in women's football - the 2021 Olympic Games, the European Championship 2022 and the World Cup 2023. Getting ready for the digital future Enter into digital exchange with the fans "Innovation is in demand everywhere in top-class football," Ludwig sums up. "Even though the longing is great, it will probably still be a while before we can return to our accustomed everyday football routine. The leagues and clubs should now seize the opportunity to focus more on digital exchange with fans. This not only comforts domestic fans over ghost games, but also creates opportunities to develop international markets"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In 2019, the number of mergers and acquisitions by and with German companies fell for the second year in a row. In the second half of the year, the ZEW-ZEPHYR M amp;A Index, which records the number of completed M amp;A transactions with German participation since 2005, fell to a record low. In August 2019 the index fell to a value of 59 points, but at the beginning of 2020 the index showed first signs of recovery. The 12-month moving average shows an overall downward trend, which has been continuing since summer 2018. "Without the three major acquisitions of the last six months, the M amp;A Index would have recorded an even stronger decline", says Ilona Tsanko, researcher at the ZEW research unit "Innovation Economics and Business Dynamics". The index reflects the number of monthly M amp;A transactions in Germany and is compiled by the ZEW Mannheim on the basis of Bureau van Dijk's Zephyr database The largest deal in the German energy sector took place in September 2019. As part of the takeover of RWE subsidiary Innogy, which was founded in 2016, the energy giant E.ON purchased RWE shares with an estimated value of 37.8 billion euros. The takeover, which resulted in one of Europe's largest energy suppliers, was announced as early as 2018 and was carried out following the approval of the European competition authorities. Merck acquires American company In addition to this major takeover in the energy sector, two of the largest M amp;A deals in the German chemical industry took place in the past six months. In the second-largest M amp;A deal, which took place with German participation in the last six months, Merck KGaA, based in Darmstadt, Germany, acquired Versum Materials Inc, a leading manufacturer of electronic materials based in the United States, for around EUR 5.8 billion. This move brings Merck one step closer to its goal of becoming the market leader in the production of electronic materials for the semiconductor and display industry. Second megadeal in the chemical industry The second mega-deal in the chemical industry took place in February 2020 with the acquisition of the polyamide business of the Belgian company Solvay by the chemical giant BASF for 1.6 billion euros. The Ludwigshafen-based company has thus expanded its polyamide expertise in the field of engineering plastics. M amp;A activities decrease in times of crisis The impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of transactions cannot be determined at this stage. "In times of crisis, activity on the M amp;A market usually declines," says Ilona Tsanko. "Due to the coronavirus, there is currently uncertainty regarding M amp;A transactions. This concerns not only the question of whether an acquisition or sale is currently appropriate, but also the consequences of the virus for ongoing transactions. Is the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 so great that negotiations are being put on hold? Or can increasing M amp;A activity be expected in the medium term? However, it is still too early to say what consequences the pandemic will have for the M amp;A index</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona crisis has inflicted deep wounds on the German economy, which are only likely to heal slowly despite a courageous economic policy - this is what DIW Berlin's economic researchers consider to be the most likely scenario for economic development. In the current second quarter, economic output here will slump even more sharply than in the first quarter. Germany is thus in the deepest recession in post-war history. Compared to last year, gross domestic product is expected to fall by 9.4 percent, according to the latest economic forecast of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). This forecast is based on the assumption that the spread of the corona virus can be contained in the long term. If this is successful, economic output will expand again from the third quarter onwards as a result of the easing, but only very slowly. Despite the emergency aid measures for companies, a rapid recovery and a continuation of the economic development of the past ten years cannot be expected without further action. The losses will by no means be made up for in the coming year - from today's perspective, the German economy should then grow by 3.0 percent. The German government's recently adopted economic stimulus package is providing tangible support for the economy. If it is implemented in this way, the economic slump of -8.1 percent this year will be less severe and the recovery will be stronger next year at 4.3 percent. Economic forecasts are associated with uncertainties Economic forecasts are currently associated with considerable uncertainty - different scenarios seem possible. According to DIW Berlin, the most probable scenario for the development of the German economy is currently a U: The sharp slump is followed by a dry spell before gradually improving. Loss of income and uncertainty are putting pressure on overall economic demand. If a second wave of infection comes with renewed restrictions, it will be virtually impossible to avoid a significant increase in insolvencies and income losses. Such an L-scenario could develop into a banking and public debt crisis. A more rapid recovery could only be hoped for if a vaccine is soon available in sufficient quantities. Then, as in a V, things could also start to improve more quickly. Companies and private households are holding back Uncertainty about future developments is causing companies and private households to hold back on the purchase of capital and major consumer goods. Short-time work and redundancies are weighing on the purchasing power of people in Germany and reducing demand. Massive sales shortfalls and rising debt in turn restrict the scope for many companies to invest less or not at all in their production capacities and in some cases have to lay off employees. Unemployment in Germany, for example, is likely to rise by around 500,000 people to an annual average of a good 2.7 million. This corresponds to an unemployment rate of 6.0 percent. The crisis is not limited to the German sales market What makes things even more difficult for companies is that the crisis is not limited to the German sales market, but is affecting almost all countries - many of them even more so, for example the USA and the United Kingdom, but also important trading partners within the euro zone such as Spain and Italy. In many places, unemployment figures have skyrocketed, supply chains have been disrupted and companies have gone bankrupt. This is particularly affecting the German export industry, which specialises in capital goods such as machinery, plant and vehicles. All in all, the global economy is likely to collapse by around five percent this year. There is also the danger that trade conflicts will escalate further and that the European Union and the United Kingdom will not be able to agree on a brexite agreement. Stronger focus on investment would increase growth potential This makes it all the more important to help the economy in Germany get back on its feet. In the opinion of the DIW economic researchers, the Federal Government has reacted boldly and prudently. First of all, by jumping on the side of companies with loans, guarantees and sureties. Private households' incomes were also stabilized with instruments such as short-time working allowances, one-off payments and subsidies. Recently, a comprehensive economic stimulus package with a volume of around 130 billion euros was adopted, which, among other things, temporarily lowers VAT and grants families a child bonus of 300 euros per child. Many measures support consumer demand Many of the total of around 50 measures are likely to stabilise consumer demand in the short term, but initial steps have also been taken to stimulate investment in the areas of climate protection, digitisation and education. The bottom line, according to DIW calculations, is that the economic stimulus package should increase economic output by 1.3 percentage points this year and next year, thus making a significant contribution to getting the economy back on track. Strengthening investment activity makes sense A further strengthening of investment activity is desirable to increase future growth potential and thus also to facilitate the repayment of the debt taken up now in the future. A consistent reorientation of the German economy towards sustainability and digitisation has so far failed to materialise. In addition to, and in some cases instead of, the economic stimulus package that has been presented, DIW Berlin is proposing measures that are geared to additional investment needs in the direction of a digital, resource- and climate-friendly transformation of Germany as an industrialized nation. Investments in key technologies A special focus is on investments in key technologies, innovative start-ups, efficient education systems, environmentally friendly infrastructures and municipal services of general interest. This would even boost the growth of the German economy in the long term. A corresponding programme, which would include an investment fund for companies, debt relief for local authorities, impulses for digitisation and research and development, but also education and start-ups, would provide noticeable growth impulses. With a volume of around EUR 192 billion, annual growth over the next ten years would increase by an average of 0.5 percent per year and employment would be increased by more than 800,000 jobs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Neutralisation tests for the novel corona virus are complex and can only be carried out in special laboratories. Scientists at the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE) have now developed a new method that is faster, cheaper and can be used widely. A pre-print of the study has now been published to give the scientific community quick access to the method. Since a proportion of those infected show no or only mild symptoms, there are only estimates as to how many people in Germany have become infected with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2. It is not yet possible to say with certainty whether an infection that has survived will subsequently generate complete immunity and how long this will last, if necessary. However, a certain degree of protection is assumed. In this context, neutralizing antibodies are considered to be particularly important and are correlated with protection in animal experiments. Neutralisation tests come into play This makes it all the more important to test who has already been infected and has produced such neutralising antibodies. This is where the so-called neutralization tests come in. They are used to search for antibodies that are formed in response to an infection with a specific pathogen and which alone are sufficient to prevent the infection. Previously, with regard to SARS-CoV-2, each of these tests had to be counted individually under the microscope by medical personnel. Such plaque-reduction neutralisation tests (PRNTs) are correspondingly labour-intensive, time-consuming, expensive and only available in special laboratories. Quantification of neutralizing antibodies Scientists at the UDE Medical Faculty have now developed a new method that allows SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to be quantified faster, more cheaply and automatically. The neutralization test they have developed follows an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. By optimizing various parameters - such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses and infection duration - it has been possible to use SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as a direct antigen source for ELISAs. The reagents and equipment used are those available in most departments for routine diagnostics. The new test is also fast: the results are available in less than 48 hours and the actual measurement takes only seconds. Results comparable with labour-intensive classical methods The data of the Essen researchers suggest that the results obtained in this way are comparable to those obtained with the labour-intensive classical methods and even show greater selectivity as soon as higher virus quantities are used. Against this background, they recommend icELISA and icNT for the research and diagnostics of COVID-19. In order to make the test widely known as quickly as possible, the data and the protocol of the test have now been pre-published on the bioRxiv website. Foundation supported the research project The work was done at the Essen Institute of Virology, which is headed by Professor Ulf Dittmer. In addition to the virologist Khanh Le-Trilling, Lara Sch #246;ler, an outstanding young researcher from Essen, a member of Professor Mirko Trilling's research group, also contributed to the publication as an equal first author. Lara Sch #246;ler is a medical doctoral student and medical student and participated in the Essen excellence programmes ELAN and BIOME. She is now part of the graduate college of 1949. The scientific work was carried out with the support of the Foundation of Essen University Medicine, which provided funding for research into the new corona virus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Neutralisation tests for the novel corona virus are complex and can only be carried out in special laboratories. Scientists at the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE) have now developed a new method that is faster, cheaper and can be used widely. A pre-print of the study has now been published to give the scientific community quick access to the method. Since a proportion of those infected show no or only mild symptoms, there are only estimates as to how many people in Germany have become infected with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2. It is not yet possible to say with certainty whether an infection that has survived will subsequently generate complete immunity and how long this will last, if necessary. However, a certain degree of protection is assumed. In this context, neutralizing antibodies are considered to be particularly important and are correlated with protection in animal experiments. Neutralisation tests come into play This makes it all the more important to test who has already been infected and has produced such neutralising antibodies. This is where the so-called neutralization tests come in. They are used to search for antibodies that are formed in response to an infection with a specific pathogen and which alone are sufficient to prevent the infection. Previously, with regard to SARS-CoV-2, each of these tests had to be counted individually under the microscope by medical personnel. Such plaque-reduction neutralisation tests (PRNTs) are correspondingly labour-intensive, time-consuming, expensive and only available in special laboratories. Quantification of neutralizing antibodies Scientists at the UDE Medical Faculty have now developed a new method that allows SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to be quantified faster, more cheaply and automatically. The neutralization test they have developed follows an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. By optimizing various parameters - such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses and infection duration - it has been possible to use SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as a direct antigen source for ELISAs. The reagents and equipment used are those available in most departments for routine diagnostics. The new test is also fast: the results are available in less than 48 hours and the actual measurement takes only seconds. Results comparable with labour-intensive classical methods The data of the Essen researchers suggest that the results obtained in this way are comparable to those obtained with the labour-intensive classical methods and even show greater selectivity as soon as higher virus quantities are used. Against this background, they recommend icELISA and icNT for the research and diagnostics of COVID-19. In order to make the test widely known as quickly as possible, the data and the protocol of the test have now been pre-published on the bioRxiv website. Foundation supported the research project The work was done at the Essen Institute of Virology, which is headed by Professor Ulf Dittmer. In addition to the virologist Khanh Le-Trilling, Lara Sch #246;ler, an outstanding young researcher from Essen, a member of Professor Mirko Trilling's research group, also contributed to the publication as an equal first author. Lara Sch #246;ler is a medical doctoral student and medical student and participated in the Essen excellence programmes ELAN and BIOME. She is now part of the graduate college of 1949. The scientific work was carried out with the support of the Foundation of Essen University Medicine, which provided funding for research into the new corona virus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version As a result of the Corona crisis, global poverty is rising for the first time in 30 years. At least 60 million children and adults could slide into extreme poverty, according to the relief organization SOS Children's Villages, "And these are still conservative forecasts," says Shubha Murthi, head of SOS Children's Villages in Asia. Numerous successes in the fight against poverty and in development cooperation would be wiped out. The United Nations' goal of ending poverty by 2030 is moving into the distant future. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 1.6 billion people in the informal sector were already threatened with extinction in the first few months after the outbreak of COVID-19. In a country like India, where more than 80 percent of people live from casual jobs, it is to be feared that unemployment will soar from 7.6 percent to 35 percent. "In the slums almost nobody has an income any more. Millions of families currently do not know how to feed their children," says Murthi. No functioning social systems The fact that the majority of countries worldwide do not have a functioning social system is particularly problematic. If families fall into poverty, this has far-reaching consequences: "Children suffer from hunger and malnutrition, diseases are on the increase, many boys and girls have to drop out of education. This is particularly tragic, as it means that they lose the most important chance they have of escaping the cycle of poverty," says Murthi. If the gap between rich and poor widened further, social unrest would also increase. "In India, for example, there were repeated protests even before Corona. If we don't find effective solutions here, they threaten to escalate." Supporting people with food The top priority must now be to support the people with food and ensure their survival. Sustainable social networks had to be established worldwide. "Every human being has the right to food, protection, education and health - it is the responsibility of states to ensure this", said Murthi</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The COVID 19 pandemic continues to spread to countries already struggling with the effects of droughts, economic crises and conflicts. At this critical time, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) is providing the UN World Food Programme (WFP) with 5.49 million euros to enable it to continue to protect 1.2 million African farmers at risk with climate risk insurance, a contribution that comes at a crucial time. The COVID-19 pandemic clashes again and again with the climate crisis. While the immediate priority of many countries is to protect people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is essential that social safety nets are in place.  #8222;Protecting vulnerable people from the dual threat of COVID-19 and climate change impacts Heat-waves, floods, storms and droughts exacerbate the economic and health consequences of the pandemic by putting additional strain on overstretched health systems," says Gernot Laganda, WFP Director for Climate and Disaster Reduction.

Few foods lead to hunger crises Less food on the market could lead to hunger crises.

Trump was an unpredictable and self-centred president who had again made a lonely decision, M #252;tzenich told the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". "Donald Trump's self-image is more of a debt collector than a driver of liberal values and common security." The USA itself suffered most from this. The smooth operation of numerous facilities of American armed forces was now in doubt. The cooperation of German security policy with its European partners must be intensified both within and outside NATO. The security policy strategy should not be limited to military policy and defence spending. "The financial burdens of the Corona pandemic are forcing all countries to step up their efforts for more disarmament and lower military expenditure. This is a political task that Europe as a whole must face up to with confidence," said M #252;tzenich.</TEXT>

This would require clearer words on the security law in Hong Kong, the role of Taiwan and the police state that Beijing is establishing in Xinjiang to control the Uighur Muslim minority. "In order to develop a self-confident China policy," says B #252;tikofer, "we must first overcome the myth that we have no alternative because of economic dependence.

    <TEXT>English version The new supplementary budget of the Federal Government approved by the Cabinet also enables a significant expansion of the Federal Government's worldwide "Corona Emergency Programme". For projects in poor and underdeveloped countries an additional three billion euros are available in the current and next year, Development Minister Gerd M #252;ller (CSU) told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". He emphasized: "In this way Germany is sending an important signal of solidarity. So far, the emergency programme has had a volume of one billion euros, financed by reallocating budget funds. M #252;ller was pleased about the cabinet decision. "This way we can manage the consequences of the crisis more effectively, provide food for millions of people and help companies to keep jobs." According to the Minister, Germany is also participating in a worldwide vaccination campaign. "For this alone, we will invest 100 million euros in the global GAVI vaccine alliance." M #252;ller also referred to projects in Iraq. "There we will build six makeshift hospitals for 14,000 patients. This will double the intensive care medicine capacities in the country. In Ethiopia, we are converting textile factories to produce millions of protective masks. Tens of thousands of seamstresses remain in work this way. We can now extend these measures." The cabinet had previously launched a second supplementary budget of 62.5 billion euros. This brings the new debt planned for the current year to 218.5 billion euros. Among other things, the federal government wants to use the money to finance the economic stimulus package, which is intended to boost consumption and the economy in the coming months, but also to provide greater assistance to developing countries.</TEXT>

He emphasized: "In this way Germany is sending an important signal of solidarity. So far, the emergency programme has had a volume of one billion euros, financed by reallocating budget funds. M #252;ller was pleased about the cabinet decision. "This way we can manage the consequences of the crisis more effectively, provide food for millions of people and help companies to keep jobs." According to the Minister, Germany is also participating in a worldwide vaccination campaign. "For this alone, we will invest 100 million euros in the global GAVI vaccine alliance." M #252;ller also referred to projects in Iraq. "There we will build six makeshift hospitals for 14,000 patients. This will double the intensive care medicine capacities in the country. In Ethiopia, we are converting textile factories to produce millions of protective masks. Tens of thousands of seamstresses remain in work this way. We can now extend these measures." The cabinet had previously launched a second supplementary budget of 62.5 billion euros. This brings the new debt planned for the current year to 218.5 billion euros. Among other things, the federal government wants to use the money to finance the economic stimulus package, which is intended to boost consumption and the economy in the coming months, but also to provide greater assistance to developing countries. pm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the USA, key interest rates will remain at rock bottom for a very long time. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has prepared market participants for this after the latest meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. The reason for this is the prospect of a deep recession in the USA, which will force the Fed to keep interest rates close to zero. The US monetary authorities left the key monetary policy rate in the current range of 0 to 0.25 percent last week. In addition, they indicated in their interest rate outlook that they were not planning to raise the key interest rate in the next two years either. According to the Fed, the Covid 19 pandemic is weighing heavily on the US economy. The Federal Reserve expects the US economy to contract by 6.5 percent this year, measured by gross domestic product. But by 2021, the Fed expects it to rise again by 5 percent. However, some market participants consider such a V-shaped economic development - i.e. a rapid exit from the valley of tears - to be too optimistic and expect a U-shaped movement of the economy. Extension of the packages of measures If there is a second wave of infection and thus a further lockdown of the US economy - and not only of this economy - it could even become necessary for the US Federal Reserve, like other central banks, to expand the packages of measures or even initiate new stimulus measures in agreement with the governments. Then the Fed would have to keep interest rates low even longer than it has now announced with a two-year perspective. Central bankers go one step further And the US central bankers around Powell are already going one step further. Powell explained that the Fed would not even consider raising rates. Such a statement understandably gives a deep insight. The interest rate decision-making body also discussed yield curve control more broadly. For the time being, however, Powell wants to hold on to the security purchases as they are now being made and not yet switch to explicit control of the US yield curve, i.e. the yield curve of US government bonds. Japan is a role model in this respect. Central bank controls market yields The central bank generally controls the yields of the securities on the market directly by means of targeted purchases of government bonds at specific maturities. The central bank has a certain idea of where rates should be at certain points in the country's yield curve at maturity, and accordingly buys or sells bonds to achieve precisely these yield levels. The Fed can do this, for example, along the entire curve from 2 to 30 years maturity. An important maturity point here is usually the ten-year yields, the benchmark yields that are used worldwide for interest rate comparisons. Central bank buys government bonds Let's be honest: Where will the US economy have arrived, or what will it be facing immediately when Powell  amp; Co moves to control the yield curve? The government then procures money on the market via Treasury, and the central bank buys government bonds directly via the primary market or indirectly via the secondary market and directly controls the government's market interest rates. Mass unemployment is already prevalent in the USA, companies are complaining about heavy losses in sales and earnings, and the wave of insolvencies has not yet hit the economy to its full extent, which can only be speculated about to this day. If Fed yield curve control becomes a reality, the economy is far from a V-shaped recovery. Interest rates to remain low for two years And what would US yield curve control mean for the euro zone, i.e. German government bonds as benchmark securities of the common currency area? Supporters of a possible turnaround in interest rates were happy to refer to the USA and higher US government bond yields from time to time. Based on a recovery of the US economy and thus rising US government bond yields, it is argued that Bund yields should then also rise. With the Fed's interest rate outlook, however, this argument is now being ignored, at least for the next two years. Because according to the Fed, US interest rates will remain low for that long. If the interest rate curve in the USA is steered towards lower government bond yields, Bund yields will not feel any upward impulse from the USA for some time to come. In this country, too, it will continue to be called: lower for longer</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The ex-policeman who shot the African-American Rayshard Brooks outside a fast-food restaurant in Atlanta is to be charged with murder. The 27-year-old Brooks had resisted his liability in front of Wendy's fast-food restaurant and had run away. Thereupon the policeman Garrett Rolfe (27) shot him in the back. Brooks died of his injuries. Rolfe, who has since been dismissed from police service, is accused of several misdemeanours in this case. Among other things, assault with a deadly weapon and violation of the police oath. In the US state of Georgia, the maximum penalty for murder is "life without parole" or the death penalty. Looking at the case, District Attorney Paul Howard said, "Mr. Brooks never posed a threat. Rolfe's police partner will also testify against him, according to American media.

    <TEXT>English version On the occasion of the forthcoming German EU Council Presidency, Deutsches Aktieninstitut calls for Germany to put the Capital Market Union at the top of its political agenda. Strong capital markets for financing companies are crucial, especially in times of crisis. "After the Corona rescue and economic stimulus packages, the course must now be set for Europe's economic recovery," says Christine Bortenl #228;nger, Managing Director of Deutsches Aktieninstitut. In doing so, the EU should bear in mind that the economy is overcoming the crisis and repositioning itself in terms of digitisation and sustainability. Bortenl #228;nger demands "that the access of companies to the capital markets of the EU be improved and that more market economy in sustainability regulation be put in place. The Financial Transaction Tax must finally be put on hold." Improve access to capital In order to survive internationally and meet the current challenges, companies needed better access to financing via shares and bonds. The Covid 19 crisis showed that companies with access to the capital market were able to obtain reliable liquidity. However, Europe has a general need to catch up in the development of the capital markets, especially since an important part of the European capital market will leave the internal market with the brexite. Capital market union needs a new start The Capital Market Union therefore needs a new start. This is not only about removing obstacles to cross-border transactions. Above all, Germany must work to make the regulatory framework more attractive for listed companies. This would require a leaner and more tailored regulatory framework to enable companies to make better use of the European capital market. More market economy in the regulation of sustainability Deutsches Aktieninstitut supports the goal of the Green Deal to create a sustainable, CO2-neutral economy in Europe. This would not be possible with excessive reporting obligations. Instead, we in Europe need more market-based approaches to tackle the ecological challenges. The pricing of environmental costs should therefore be the focus of the German Council Presidency. Setting the right framework Now it is time to set the right framework conditions. What is needed is a streamlined legal framework that gives companies the flexibility to play out their innovative strength. Transition technologies would have to be taken into account and a "green vs. brown approach" avoided. After all, Germany had to make a stand for a better integration of companies in the topic of sustainable finance. At least one third of the platform for sustainable finance, which advises the EU Commission on this topic, must be staffed by representatives of the real economy. No financial transaction tax The financial transaction tax, which is currently being discussed in the form of a stock tax, makes the purchase of shares more expensive and less attractive. This effect is at the expense of investors and companies. Asset accumulation and pension provision are burdened and corporate financing via the stock exchange is made more difficult. Deutsches Aktieninstitut therefore demands that the Federal Government finally puts an end to the planned financial transaction tax at European and national level. There is an opportunity in every crisis "In every crisis there are opportunities. This must be used to ensure that Europe emerges stronger from the crisis. Healthy companies that have access to strong capital markets are an indispensable part of the solution. With the capital market impulses we propose, it will be possible to put Europe swiftly on the path of economic recovery. We look forward to accompanying the further debates constructively and will be available for discussions with the German Council Presidency", said Christine Bortenl #228;nger</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The internationally renowned psychiatrist, university lecturer and stress researcher Mazda Adli expects an increase in psychological stress in the population as a result of the Corona crisis. "I assume that this will also be reflected in figures after the pandemic at the latest," Adli said in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". "During the lockdown, our clinic was as busy as before the pandemic," explained the chief physician of the Fliedner Klinik Berlin, who also heads the research area Affective Disorders at Charit #233; Universit #228;tsmedizin Berlin. "We have to assume that many people with serious mental illnesses and need for help stayed at home during the lockdown and did not find their way to a doctor or to a clinic. The consequences of this will become apparent with a time lag," Adli continued in the interview. Social isolation holds potential for problems Social isolation in particular has potential for problems. "That is something we as psychiatrists regard with concern," said the head physician of the Fliedner Klinik. "Social isolation, caused by the corona rules, means a retreat into the domestic sphere. Those who live alone are then absolutely threatened by isolation and loneliness," said Adli. Not everyone has "the opportunity or the skills to connect virtually with people," he stressed. "When you consider that social isolation is one of the strongest stress factors for our health, this is worrying," Adli said. Mortality will increase Adli warned that social isolation was "a relevant negative influencing factor not only for mental health but also for physical health". "Mortality from physical illness is increasing, social isolation costs us years of life." Nevertheless, "most people, when they think about physical health, tend to focus on the classic risk factors such as obesity, smoking or high blood pressure," Adli said. "But loneliness is no less important than these common risk factors." He hopes that the pandemic will bring the topic of loneliness more into the social focus. "Loneliness is one of the taboo subjects. People find it difficult to admit that they are lonely, even to a psychiatrist," Adli reported. "If we as a society become more sensitive to it, it would already be successful prevention," said the psychiatrist</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany rises in June 2020 for the third time in a row. They now stand at 63.4 points, 12.4 points higher than in the previous month. The assessment of the economic situation for Germany has improved for the first time since January 2020. The situation indicator in the current survey stands at minus 83.1 points. It is thus 10.4 points higher than in the previous month. Confidence is growing that the economy will have bottomed out by summer 2020. This is suggested by the renewed increase in the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment together with the improvement in the assessment of the situation. The earnings expectations for the sectors in Germany were still very different. Earnings expectations for export-oriented sectors such as automotive and mechanical engineering and the financial sector are clearly negative. The outlook for the information technology, telecommunications and consumer-related services sectors, for example, is quite positive. The financial market experts still expect only a relatively slow increase in economic value added in the third and fourth quarter", comments ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach, Ph.D. Expectations of financial experts in the euro zone rise The expectations of the financial market experts regarding the economic development in the euro zone are also rising again. The expectation indicator for the euro zone stands at 58.6 points in June, 12.6 points higher than in the previous month. The indicator for the current economic situation in the euro area increases by 5.4 points to a value of minus 89.6 points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The People's Republic of China is to keep Germany on secret lists as an enemy of the state. This was reported by whistleblower Sayragul Sauytbay in an exclusive interview with the magazine Stern. Sauytbay was abducted to one of the secret re-education camps in China and forced to teach there as a teacher. She reports on secret documents in which China's attitude towards its Western economic partner is very explicitly addressed. For example, Germany is said to have been among the top five on a list of China's most dangerous enemies. "It was said that Germany was trying to sabotage China's development and spread lies about the Communist Party. That it wanted to divide China. In class we had to teach the prisoners that the democracies in the West had failed and were crumbling. It was about making it clear to the prisoners in the camp that China is the only power. You must submit," says the 43-year-old. Five months spent in a camp Sauytbay spent almost five months in one of the camps and is the first survivor who, as a forced recruit and key witness, can describe the secret structures and plans of the camps. Her descriptions of the conditions are as unique as they are monstrous. Torture and medical experiments are the order of the day, according to Sauytbay. She herself had also been brutally punished for "breaking the rules". "I was taken to the 'black room'. It was almost 20 square metres large and in the middle was a large table with many instruments of torture: metal bars, stun guns, a chair with nails. If someone had told me about it before, I wouldn't have believed it. They strapped me in an electric chair and tortured me until I passed out." The role of international corporations Sauytbay also reflects on the role of international corporations in the Xinjiang region and talks explicitly about the responsibility of the VW Group. Asked about her feelings on the occasion of the statements of company boss Herbert Diess, who said last year that he knew nothing about the conditions in the re-education camps, she asked the car boss for a personal meeting. "I would like to invite Mr. Diess and ask him if, as a German, he is not affected by what is happening to people in my country. especially in light of the Second World War." Regular threats over the phone Sauytbay, who now lives with her family in Sweden, continues to receive regular threats over the phone. The numbers of the callers always came from China. Sauytbay's descriptions are consistent with the testimonies of survivors and the research of many aid organisations that have been collecting information about the camps for years</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On the occasion of World Refugee Day, Gyde Jensen, spokeswoman for human rights policy of the FDP parliamentary group in the Bundestag, has called on the Federal Government to lobby in the EU for a common asylum procedure in the member states. "I demand that the Federal Government, within the framework of its Presidency of the Council, now works towards finally setting up a common asylum procedure in the EU. An asylum procedure that both fulfils the requirements of the Geneva Convention on Refugees and is enforceable throughout the European Union," Jensen told the daily Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung (NOZ). According to the UN Refugee Agency, there were 79.5 million displaced persons at the end of 2019, more refugees in the world than ever before. "These almost 80 million people who are on the run worldwide are among the most vulnerable members of our global society. We all have a responsibility to ensure that refugees can lead as self-sufficient a life as possible under humane conditions," said Jensen. Not compatible with the Geneva Convention These days there were again reports of operations of Greek officials at the Greek-Turkish border against fugitives, which are not compatible with the Geneva Convention.

"We will no longer accept this form of ruthless economic activity. It is unacceptable that people from Central and Eastern Europe are exploited in Germany so that unscrupulous companies can make billions in profits," Heil said, referring to Germany's largest pork entrepreneur and managing partner Clemens T #246;nnies.

In order for them to hire more staff again, we will prescribe how often companies must be inspected."

    <TEXT>English version After his release from extradition custody in Lower Saxony, the Ukrainian oligarch Alexander Onischenko has made accusations against the authorities in Germany. In an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" he said: "The time in jail cost me my health." He said that until his arrest in the Verden district last November, he had been a healthy man, now he was struggling with heart problems. Onischenko said: "I knew that if I was extradited to the Ukraine, everything would be done to kill me there. That's how I got my health problems." The Ukrainian had been arrested in November at the police station in Achim, where he had actually been asked by the police to testify as a witness. He felt cheated at a horse dealership and had filed a complaint. An arrest warrant had been available for some time An arrest warrant had been issued against Onischenko for some time, however, and the Ukraine had asked Germany for his extradition. "I feel betrayed by Germany. I had been in Germany several times before and got through passport control without any problems," Onischenko told the newspaper NOZ. He was convinced that third parties had interfered in the proceedings. In the past, the oligarch had fallen out with Ukrainian ex-president Petro Poroshenko. In the meantime, a trial has been started in his home country against Onischenko in his absence. It is about the alleged manipulation of gas prices. Ukrainian seeks residence permit Despite everything, the Ukrainian is striving for a residence permit in Germany. "Then I could move to Herzlake and live there I hope that works out." Onischenko owns a stud farm in the Emsland district. He himself had participated in the Olympic Games for Ukraine in the past.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version While the economy is slowly picking up again after the corona loosening, the industry remains in crisis mode. Orders are stagnating, supply chains are interrupted, and one in seven companies currently expects money shortages. This is the result of a nationwide survey of companies in their industries conducted by the IG Metall union, from which the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung quotes. IG Metall head J #246;rg Hofmann sees "hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk", and he said that "150,000 jobs are acutely threatened by the threat of insolvency alone, if economic impulses are not quickly made visible". Because: "The metal and electrical industry and steel are still in a downward spiral. In sectors such as mechanical and plant engineering, the slump in orders is only now really taking hold, with over 20 percent of companies only starting short-time working in May or June". Industry suffers from global recession Export-dependent German industry in particular continues to suffer from the global recession. The current phase will show how far short-time work is still sustainable and when companies will begin to reduce their costs by cutting staff. In the metal and electrical industry alone, more than two million employees are still on short-time work. According to the survey, seven out of ten companies are currently using short-time work, and the trend is still rising. This is because the order situation remains critical: 17 percent of the companies have completely stopped receiving orders, and more than 50 percent have reached crisis levels. Those who have orders are also finding it difficult to get off the ground, because the supply chains of more than one in two companies are disrupted or acutely endangered. This is noticeable in the company cash registers: Almost one in ten companies is currently experiencing liquidity bottlenecks, and one in seven (14.1 percent) expects the available money to run out over the next four to six weeks. The greatest concerns are in the steel industry (21.7 percent) and in metal production (19.4 percent), where one in five companies is already experiencing liquidity problems. Eleven percent of the companies are cutting permanent jobs 11 percent of the companies are also cutting back on permanent jobs. The non-permanent workforce is hit much harder: four out of ten companies have cut back on temporary workers, 35 percent have let temporary contracts expire, and 16 percent have terminated contracts for work. The concerns of the industry are not sufficiently addressed by IG-Metall leader Hofmann in the government's economic stimulus package. Of the 130 billion euros, only the smaller part, about 35 billion euros, is aimed at a short-term economic recovery. It is not clear what the reduction of the value added tax will achieve. "This is more like a shotgun. Restaurants will use it to earn more instead of lowering prices - which is understandable in their situation, but will not increase consumption," Hofmann said. "And the automakers will mainly use it to promote SUVs and large cars because they bring the biggest profit margins." More targeted stimuli wanted He would therefore have liked 'more targeted impulses such as the eco-rebate'. The fact that he was portrayed as a true champion of climate-damaging industries after his criticism of the SPD leadership, which had prevented this eco-rebate, is something he cannot leave standing. He said that the reduction in value-added tax now "primarily promotes cars in the higher price range, no matter what comes out of the exhaust. This is supposed to be more climate-friendly," Hofmann asks rhetorically. A "conditioned premium", on the other hand, would have boosted sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the first five months of this year, over 2,000 square kilometres of forest were lost in the world's largest tropical forest area, according to the Brazilian space institute INPE. This represents an increase of 34 percent over the same period last year and 49 percent more than the average of the last four years (2016 to 2019). The states of Par #225;, Amazonas and Mato Grosso were particularly affected. "The Amazon is heading for an existential catastrophe," warns Roberto Maldonado, Brazil consultant at WWF Germany. "In 2019 we had the highest destruction in ten years and now everything points to 2020 being an even worse year for the rainforest. If we don't reverse the trend soon, the Amazon could be lost in the long run. 20% of the rainforest has already been destroyed In total, around 20 percent of the original Amazon rainforest has already been destroyed. Scientists reckon that the tipping point will be reached at the latest when 25 percent of the area is destroyed. From this moment on, the ecosystem could be so disturbed that the Amazon loses its function as the earth's air conditioning system and is transformed into a steppe over a large area. The deforestation has mainly political reasons According to the WWF, the deforestation is mainly for political reasons. President Bolsonaro is doing everything possible to push through the short-term interests of the agro-lobby. Since he took office, the authorities that monitor and enforce forest protection have been massively weakened by budget cuts. "The message that illegal logging or landgrabbing is tolerated has been received. Wild west conditions prevail in parts of the Amazon today. We can now observe the consequences of this policy - protected areas and indigenous territories are virtually open for shooting. The victims are not only the environment, but also the indigenous people and the vast majority of all Brazilians." In the Corona month of March deforestation increased by 50 percent The destruction is currently being fueled by the corona pandemic, which has hit Brazil particularly hard. According to a recent analysis published by the WWF, deforestation in South America's largest country during the first "corona month" of March skyrocketed by more than 50 percent compared to previous years because of the significantly lower presence of state controllers. At the same time, during the pandemic, the Bolsonaro government is trying to soften the protection of the Amazon in a targeted manner. This is shown in a video of a cabinet meeting of the Brazilian federal government. In it, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles calls for corresponding changes in the law to liberalise and simplify deforestation. The current window of opportunity must be used to push through the reforms without a social outcry. Together with other Brazilian non-governmental organisations, the WWF demanded Salles' resignation. Companies must urgently review their supply chains Environmentalists also point out the responsibility of other states and foreign companies. German and European companies urgently need to review their supply chains and make them deforestation-free. This applies in particular to companies that purchase soya or other agricultural raw materials from Brazil or have them in their supply chains. The WWF expects the German Federal Government to work for better social and ecological standards in the negotiations on the free trade agreement between the EU and the South American Mercosur states. Furthermore, EU-wide legislation on deforestation-free supply chains is urgently needed. No goods should be imported for which the rainforest has been cleared. This principle must be binding and not depend on the discretion of individual companies. The European Union has a special responsibility here - about one sixth of all food traded here contributes to deforestation in the tropics</TEXT>

The current window of opportunity must be used to push through the reforms without a social outcry. Together with other Brazilian non-governmental organisations, the WWF demanded Salles' resignation. Companies must urgently review their supply chains Environmentalists also point out the responsibility of other states and foreign companies. German and European companies urgently need to review their supply chains and make them deforestation-free. This applies in particular to companies that purchase soya or other agricultural raw materials from Brazil or have them in their supply chains. The WWF expects the German Federal Government to work for better social and ecological standards in the negotiations on the free trade agreement between the EU and the South American Mercosur states. Furthermore, EU-wide legislation on deforestation-free supply chains is urgently needed. No goods should be imported for which the rainforest has been cleared. This principle must be binding and not depend on the discretion of individual companies. The European Union has a special responsibility here - about one sixth of all food traded here contributes to deforestation in the tropics</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Prior to his trip to Rome, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) called for European solidarity in the Corona crisis and an unprecedented European effort. "The corona pandemic hit Italy earlier and harder than others, but the consequences of the crisis are felt by all of us in Europe equally," Maas told the D #252;sseldorf-based newspaper "Rheinische Post". "The economic and social revival demands an effort from all of us, the like of which the European Union has never experienced before," Maas said. Together with his counterpart Luigi di Maio, the German minister will visit an institute for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. A few days before the start of the German EU Presidency, Maas wants to present the main points of the German programme to his Italian colleague. No country will be able to achieve the upturn alone "No country will be able to achieve recovery on its own if its neighbour gets stuck in a crisis, demand falls away, supply chains break down", said Maas. But there is also an opportunity in this: "If we succeed in overcoming old rifts, if we build on the cohesion and solidarity of recent weeks, then Europe can and will emerge from the crisis stronger," said Maas. This task will characterise the German EU Presidency, he said, and for this we need the cooperation of all member states.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Despite challenging external conditions, the DFL Deutsche Fu #223;ball Liga once again exceeded the billion mark in the award of German-language media rights, thus continuing the high level of revenues of previous years, the association announced. For the 2021/22 to 2024/25 seasons, the clubs can expect revenues averaging 1.1 billion euros. This corresponds to a total revenue of 4.4 billion euros. In the pay area, the company will continue to have two media partners: live coverage of the Bundesliga on Saturday (all individual matches in the afternoon, conference and top match) will continue to be provided by Sky - as well as all matches in the 2nd Bundesliga. DAZN will broadcast all Bundesliga matches live on Friday and Sunday. The Saturday evening match of the 2nd Bundesliga will also be available live on Sport1 on free TV. ProSiebenSat1 secures live rights package in free TV ProSiebenSat.1 also secured a comprehensive live rights package for free TV, including the season opening of the Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga, the relegation and the Supercup, according to the DFL. ARD again secured the summary (first broadcast on free TV) of the Bundesliga matches on early Saturday evening and Sunday evening. ZDF will continue to have its turn on Saturday evening with the secondary exploitation of the Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga on free TV as well as the free TV first exploitation of the Bundesliga top game. ARD gets summary of the 2nd Bundesliga Sport1 also retains the right to broadcast from Sunday morning onwards summaries of the Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga matches on Friday and Saturday. What is new is that ARD has been able to secure the 2nd Bundesliga summaries on Friday and Sunday as well - in addition to early Saturday evening - and, as things stand at present, exploitation is planned in part on channel One. "Stability for the clubs in uncertain times" "The result of the tender offers the clubs of the Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga as well as the fans the greatest possible stability in uncertain times. This applies both in terms of largely maintaining the revenue situation and in terms of viewing habits. A big thank you goes to the media partners of the coming rights period, who have expressed their confidence in the continued positive development of the Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga with their investments," said Christian Seifert, spokesman of the DFL Executive Committee and DFL Managing Director. Axel Springer: Bundesliga on call Axel Springer acquired the pay rights for on-demand summaries of Bundesliga and 2nd Bundesliga matches immediately after the end of the matches, as well as the "Digital out of Home" package, awarded for the first time, for the use of moving images of the matches on outdoor advertising spaces. ARD, ZDF and Sport1 secured the rights package for freely accessible summaries of the matches in both leagues starting Monday. Audio rights were also awarded - ARD prevailed in both areas (FM and Web/Mobile). All rights had been awarded "in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory tender", for which the Bundeskartellamt had given the green light. The DFL Presidium will decide on the distribution of the proceeds in due course, the association stated</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The role of virologists must be limited, demands one of Germany's chief virologists, Hendrik Streeck from the University of Bonn. "There are many questions a doctor can't answer." For example, when it comes to the proportionality of means. Streeck wants a pragmatic approach to the virus, which is part of our new life reality. "It will stay." Streeck said this in an interview with Stern magazine. Society must decide how it wants to deal with the virus in everyday life. "We as virologists have a role to play, but only a role." It should not be ignored "what it does to children when they are practically forbidden to play or touch with their friends." Child psychologists and sociologists should be more involved in the debate: "In my opinion, their voices are not heard enough." No problems sending the children to school Streeck himself would have no problem sending his children to school, even if a risk patient lived in the household. "I consider the risk of bringing Covid-19 home via children to be low," says the scientist. He would also send his children to grandma and grandpa's house during the summer holidays. Streeck pleads for not patronizing older people: "An 82-year-old woman has made many risk assessments in her life, she experienced the end of the Second World War. She can decide for herself whether she wants to take the risk of seeing her grandchildren. We don't have to do that for her."</TEXT>

"I am very pleased that today the federal cabinet will adopt a powerful 500 million programme to stabilise training," said Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek (CDU) to the D #252;sseldorf-based newspaper "Rheinische Post". She added that it would help small and medium-sized companies to continue to provide training even in economically difficult times. According to the ministry, small and medium-sized enterprises that continue to train as many people as in the previous three years will receive 2000 euros for each training contract concluded in the current training year 2020 after the probationary period. Companies that train more trainees than in the previous three years will receive the equivalent of 3000 euros. Federal government wants to prevent short-time working In addition, the federal government wants to prevent short-time work by paying 75 percent of the gross training allowance to companies for each month in which the company continues to train its apprentices despite a considerable loss of work. The company's loss of working hours must be at least 50 percent. In addition, companies receive a bonus of 3000 euros if they take on trainees from an insolvent company and provide them with further training. "Especially in these times, our young people need good career prospects," said Karliczek. Quite a few young people are feeling insecure in the current situation</TEXT>

This is the strongest rise ever measured. The current situation was assessed somewhat better by the companies. Their expectations also made a clear upward leap. The German economy sees light at the end of the tunnel. In the manufacturing sector, the business climate index has again risen noticeably. This was due to significantly improved expectations of industrial companies. Expectations have never risen so strongly before. However, the current situation is still considered poor by a large majority of companies. Pessimism has declined significantly In the services sector, the steep upward trend in the business climate continued in June. In particular, pessimism with regard to the coming six months decreased significantly. The assessments of the current situation also improved noticeably. In the retail sector, the business climate index again rose significantly. The indicators on the situation and expectations recovered noticeably compared to the previous month. Nevertheless, many traders continue to expect a poor business development. At present, the mood in retail is less pessimistic than in wholesale. In the construction industry, the business climate has improved. This was again due to less pessimistic expectations. Construction companies assessed their current situation somewhat better than in the previous month</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Kiel Ministry of the Environment confirmed the discovery of further stone reefs along the planned Baltic Sea tunnel route, which are under strict nature protection. In the summer of 2019, the environmental protection organisation NABU had already discovered two reefs there, which the Environment Ministry took as an opportunity to examine the seabed more closely. As a result, they have now found further reefs that will be affected by the Fehmarn Belt crossing. Last week, the EU Court of Auditors already massively criticised the billion-euro construction project. The cost planning was excessive and the traffic forecasts were incorrect. NABU President J #246;rg-Andreas Kr #252;ger said: "The construction planning of the Baltic Sea tunnel seems careless: The costs have now risen to around 8 billion euros, the traffic forecasts are flawed and the destruction of the unique marine ecosystem is irreversible. All this is out of all proportion to the benefits. For more than 10 years, NABU has been warning against the construction of this completely overpriced prestige project. We hope that this major project, which is harmful to the climate and the environment, will now be reassessed by the justified criticism from the EU Court of Auditors and the Kiel Ministry of the Environment"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Phase I/II clinical trials of the world's first inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products under the China National Biotec Group (CNBG), which is affiliated with the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), produced antibodies in all participants, the organizations said in a press release today.the results of the clinical trial showed that the vaccine was safe without serious side effects. And after different procedures and different vaccine doses were used, all participants in the vaccine group had high antibodies. Individuals who received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart were observed to achieve a 100% neutralizing antibody-positive conversion rate. According to the CNBG, the Phase I/II clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. On April 12, the vaccine received the world's first approval for a clinical trial and Phase I/II clinical trials were initiated in Wuzhi County, Henan Province. Clinical trials conducted over 66 days Under the direction and guidance of the Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the clinical trials were conducted on 66 consecutive days. This allowed data to be collected on the safety and efficacy of the inactivated vaccine COVID-19 after two injections. Subjects received two injections According to CNBG, the study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 59 years at low, medium and high doses and injections at 14, 21 and 28 day intervals. The study focused on the changes in cellular immunity after vaccination and investigated vaccination procedures, vaccination dose, safety, immunogenicity and changes in antibody levels in vivo. To date, all 1,120 volunteers who participated in the Phase I/II clinical trials have received two injections. Conversion rate of 98 and 100 percent In the 18- to 59-year-olds who received two medium-dose injections at 14-day and 21-day intervals, they would have had a neutralising antibody-positive conversion rate of 97.6%. In those who received two medium-dose injections at 28-day intervals, the conversion rate of positive neutralising antibodies reached 100%. Vaccine is within the range of the new genotype In response to the recent new cases in Beijing and the discovery of a new genotype of the virus by sequencing the entire genome, some experts fear that for the new genotype "the vaccine may appear weaker or even not work at all". Yang Xiaoming, chief scientist of the national vaccine project "863 Program" and chairman of the CNBG, told the "Science and Technology Daily" newspaper that he had noticed the new genotype but that it "is still within the range of the vaccine for which Phase I/II unblinding took place today" so that it will not affect the effectiveness of the current inactivated vaccine. Cooperation with foreign countries is being sought CNBG also shared its courage in announcing that it is now actively seeking cooperation abroad as part of phase III clinical research and has confirmed its willingness to cooperate with companies and institutions in various countries. The group has completed the construction of a high biosafety production facility, which is currently the only COVID-19 vaccine production facility in the world that meets biosafety and GMP standards and is capable of meeting the needs of widespread emergency vaccination</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German Weather Service (DWD) expects that the corona pandemic in winter could have a noticeable impact on weather forecasts. Detlev Majewski, head of the department of meteorological analysis and modeling at DWD, said in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" that he does not believe that data from airplanes will be back to pre-corona level before 2022. He said that airplanes are an "incredibly good source of information", especially over the sea between Europe and America. Majewski explained: "In this area, winter storms develop in winter. What strikes the mainland in Europe is what happened 48 hours earlier on the east coast of North America." However, due to the lack of data, such a low-pressure development could be discovered later than previously, Majewski said. Hope for a follow-up project "At the moment, we usually have a pretty good handle on this three days in advance and can predict trajectory and intensity," said the meteorologist. But: "If so few planes continue to fly in winter, I expect an effect. In other words, instead of three days in advance, you'll be able to predict such a low only perhaps two and a half days." At the moment, an EU research satellite called Aeolus is making up for part of the data shortfall. It will only be active for another year or two. So Majewski is hoping for a follow-up project and warned, "When it's gone, it's gone. And with it, the data."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the accounting scandal involving the financial services provider Wirecard, which today filed for insolvency, Christian Lindner, head of the FDP parliamentary group in the Bundestag, has called for a review of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin). "Bafin is no longer on a par with the new developments on the capital market," Lindner told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). The supervisory authority had to be able to work more internationally and needed more knowledge about the international capital markets. "It certainly needs more staff so that it can really understand and examine the complicated processes and structures", said Lindner. "It must be worked out why Bafin did not carry out an in-depth examination of the processes on its own initiative. There were reports of manipulations for months. This should have been an occasion for a detailed in-depth examination of this financial market player", said the FDP chairman. It is about possible air bookings The balance sheet scandal concerns suspected air bookings amounting to 1.9 billion euros, which have led the Wirecard group to the brink of the abyss. Lindner sees the integrity of the market economy called into question by the case. "This could result in effects that are not even foreseeable now - as was the case with the Enron bankruptcy in the United States at the time," warned Lindner. The question was raised why the banking supervisory authority Bafin had not intervened at a much earlier stage. Even small financial intermediaries will in future be supervised by Bafin  #8222;Next week, the German Bundestag will decide that small financial intermediaries will no longer be controlled by the local trade supervisory authority, but by the Bafin. So there is a mistrust of politics towards small financial intermediaries, but a very obvious failure of the Bafin with such a large service provider as Wirecard. This must be dealt with. The Finance Committee of the Bundestag must question the structures and capabilities of the Bafin", demanded Lindner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version For the development of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, scientists needed reliable findings from coronavirus research. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to filter out these findings. As the US magazine "Science" reports in its May issue, scientists are confronted with a veritable flood of research articles. With over 20,000 published papers, a lot of valuable time is lost in literature research. This is where the new CoVis tool comes in. In the EU-funded project, particularly relevant research results are compiled by experts in a freely accessible database. In addition, a so-called knowledge map provides a quick overview of research articles and data sets from eight key areas of biomedical research. This would facilitate the introduction to the topic. In order to do justice to the rapid scientific development, the database is constantly being expanded. Research times will be greatly reduced This is done collaboratively, among others with scientists from Harvard University. This would put coronavirus research on a secure basis and greatly reduce the time needed to identify the most important research results. CoVis was developed in a cooperation between the Austrian research infrastructure Open Knowledge Maps and the US start-up Scimpact, operator of the ReFigure platform. The tool is funded by the EU project EOSC Secretariat within the COVID-19 Fast-Track Funding. CoVis is made freely and openly available at https://openknowledgemaps.org/covis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version After initial resistance, the SPD has now agreed to a corona immunity card, which the German Ethics Council is now discussing for the first time. "As with any other medical test result, one has a right to documentation of the result of a corona test," said B #228;rbel Bas, deputy parliamentary party leader and health policy expert, in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). The decisive factor, she said, was "that no stigmatisation should arise from the immunity status. We will have to make sure that no other rights of freedom or personal rights apply to these persons", said Bas. After massive resistance from coalition partner SPD, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) had put his plans for an immunity card on hold for the time being at the beginning of May. At that time, SPD Secretary-General Lars Klingbeil, for example, had complained about a "completely wrong signal", because the certificate was intended to reward people who would not protect themselves from infection. Calling the German Ethics Council Spahn then called the German Ethics Council. The 24-member committee will discuss the topic for the first time this Thursday, a spokeswoman for the NOZ said. However, she said that a statement for or against the planned decision on the same day was not yet expected. Immunity cannot be proven SPD vice faction leader Bas emphasized that immunity has not yet been proven. Therefore, at this point in time, "no non-infectivity can and may" be certified. But in the future, a scientifically proven statement could be possible, and then those tested would also be entitled to it. She expressly welcomed the fact that the Ethics Council was dealing with the question and stressed that "there must be no discrimination either on the basis of immunity status or on the basis of membership of a risk group". Nearly one in three people is in a risk group. Not excluding people from public life "We must not exclude these people from public life." Nor must there be a "two-tier society of people with and without immunity". Bas sharply criticized attempts like the one by the Hamburg start-up au-schein.de to sell fake immunity cards on the net already now. Immunity has not yet been proven. "Offers like those of 'au-schein.de' should be prohibited, and I consider them to be money-making, which gives customers a false sense of security," said Bas.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The mood among German exporters has recovered noticeably. Ifo export expectations for industry rose from minus 26.7 to minus 2.3 points in June - the strongest rise ever within a single month. German industry is working its way out of the basement. In the automotive industry the upward trend from the previous month continued. The manufacturers expect a significant increase in exports in the coming months. The same applies to the pharmaceutical industry. In the other sectors no export growth is expected yet, but the mood has brightened noticeably. In the chemical industry, companies expect exports to remain constant. In the electrical engineering and mechanical engineering sectors, however, foreign sales are still expected to decline. These will be less pronounced than in previous months</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version On June 25, 2020, Wirecard AG filed for insolvency with the Munich Local Court. Shareholders and affected investors now wondered whether the insolvency proceedings would affect their claim for damages due to omitted ad hoc announcements and falsification of the balance sheet. The Hamburg-based specialist lawyer Peter Hahn of Hahn Rechtsanw #228;lte comments on the Wirecard case:. "On the one hand, the claim for damages against Wirecard AG still exists, even if the banks and the bondholders would be given priority in insolvency proceedings and insolvency claims of shareholders would only be considered on a subordinate basis. In addition, the Wirecard balance sheet scandal could also give rise to claims for damages against the auditing company Ernst  amp; Young. E amp;Y had overlooked the falsification of the balance sheet for years and certified incorrect annual financial statements. In doing so, the company had breached its auditing obligations. Private and institutional investors who invested in shares, bonds or derivatives of Wirecard were thus deprived of information that could have deterred them from their investment. The omissions were only disclosed by a special audit commissioned by Wirecard itself and conducted by the auditing company KPMG. Claim for damages "In our opinion, consumers who purchased shares, bonds or derivatives of Wirecard AG between February 24, 2016 and June 18, 2020 are entitled to compensation. This can be asserted against Wirecard AG and also against the auditing company E amp;Y", Hahn continues</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The chairman of the Sports Committee in the German Bundestag, Dagmar Freitag, considers Alexander Zverev's participation in the Adriatic Tour organized by tennis superstar Novak Djokovic to be irresponsible. In the meantime four players, including Djokovic himself, have tested positive for the corona virus. "The current incidence of infection following the tournament speaks for itself. It should be clear to everyone that participation under the casual conditions prevailing there could lead to an acute threat to their private and professional environment and ultimately to society," the SPD politician told the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". The tournament series, which has since been cancelled, is generally criticised for its lax approach to hygiene and distance rules. Top athletes such as Zverev, who are said to be role models, must be aware of their responsibility. "As regrettable as the infections that have now become known in the aftermath of the tournament are: they are a more than urgent warning not to do the same. In our own interests, but also in the interests of society as a whole," Freitag said</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Dutch payment group Adyen does not want to take over its ailing German competitor Wirecard. "We are not making any acquisitions," the company announced at the request of "Finance Forward" and "Capital.de". Pieter van der Does, head of the Dutch payment services provider, had already emphasized in the past that his company did not want to grow through mergers. The payment service provider is sticking to this strategy despite the extraordinary situation: Wirecard is in its biggest crisis and filed for insolvency on Thursday morning. The scandal revolves around balance sheet manipulations in the billions. "For Wirecard, filing for insolvency is an opportunity to sell the healthy parts of the company," emphasizes payment expert Marcus Mosen. Now the industry is speculating whether parts of the Dax Group could be taken over and if so, by whom. Other competitors include Worldline and Ingenico. Stock market valuation of 40 billion euros Adyen is one of the most important payment service providers in the world with a stock market valuation of around 40 billion euros. Even major Wirecard customers could now migrate to the competition, including the supermarket chain Aldi, for example. "We always talk to the merchants," says Adyen. The Wirecard crisis is now providing even more "impetus for further talks" with potential customers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Phase I/II clinical trials of the world's first inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products under the China National Biotec Group (CNBG), which is affiliated with the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), produced antibodies in all participants, the organizations said in a press release today.the results of the clinical trial showed that the vaccine was safe without serious side effects. And after different procedures and different vaccine doses were used, all participants in the vaccine group had high antibodies. Individuals who received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart were observed to achieve a 100% neutralizing antibody-positive conversion rate. According to the CNBG, the Phase I/II clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. On April 12, the vaccine received the world's first approval for a clinical trial and Phase I/II clinical trials were initiated in Wuzhi County, Henan Province. Clinical trials conducted over 66 days Under the direction and guidance of the Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the clinical trials were conducted on 66 consecutive days. This allowed data to be collected on the safety and efficacy of the inactivated vaccine COVID-19 after two injections. Subjects received two injections According to CNBG, the study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 59 years at low, medium and high doses and injections at 14, 21 and 28 day intervals. The study focused on the changes in cellular immunity after vaccination and investigated vaccination procedures, vaccination dose, safety, immunogenicity and changes in antibody levels in vivo. To date, all 1,120 volunteers who participated in the Phase I/II clinical trials have received two injections. Conversion rate of 98 and 100 percent In the 18- to 59-year-olds who received two medium-dose injections at 14-day and 21-day intervals, they would have had a neutralising antibody-positive conversion rate of 97.6%. In those who received two medium-dose injections at 28-day intervals, the conversion rate of positive neutralising antibodies reached 100%. Vaccine is within the range of the new genotype In response to the recent new cases in Beijing and the discovery of a new genotype of the virus by sequencing the entire genome, some experts fear that for the new genotype "the vaccine may appear weaker or even not work at all". Yang Xiaoming, chief scientist of the national vaccine project "863 Program" and chairman of the CNBG, told the "Science and Technology Daily" newspaper that he had noticed the new genotype but that it "is still within the range of the vaccine for which Phase I/II unblinding took place today" so that it will not affect the effectiveness of the current inactivated vaccine. Cooperation with foreign countries is being sought CNBG also shared its courage in announcing that it is now actively seeking cooperation abroad as part of phase III clinical research and has confirmed its willingness to cooperate with companies and institutions in various countries. The group has completed the construction of a high biosafety production facility, which is currently the only COVID-19 vaccine production facility in the world that meets biosafety and GMP standards and is capable of meeting the needs of widespread emergency vaccination</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In order to combat the economic consequences of the pandemic at home or to finance the relevant government measures, Italian private investors can subscribe to the issue of the BTP Futura between 6 and 10 July, starting from a minimum of EUR 1,000, i.e. a retail investor-friendly denomination. Understandably, there is no upper limit for subscription to the bond. The Italian Ministry of Finance has not yet provided any information on the volume of the bond; presumably they will not want to set an upper limit in view of the capital requirements. The new paper is based on Italy's patriotic bond, the so-called BTP Italia, but has some new features. The paper with a ten-year term (maturity 14 July 2030) attracts investors with a so-called loyalty bonus. The fixed yield of the bond - the guaranteed minimum yield is to be announced on July 3 - is to rise after certain points in time (step-up), namely after the fourth and seventh year; anyone who holds the bond until maturity will then receive a premium. All of this is intended to motivate investors to stay with the stock, i.e. to buy and hold it. A minimum 1% premium is to be paid, a maximum of 3%, and the whole thing is made dependent on the economic development of the country, i.e. on the growth of the gross domestic product. Bond is in the clearly positive yield range What kind of response will the product probably meet with? If the bond were offered to institutional investors, the current state of the market and investors' appetite for bonds from the eurozone periphery would almost certainly lead to a record order book. The premiums alone would ensure this, as the bond is clearly in the positive yield range. Presumably a good reception can also be assumed among private investors. If it becomes a bankruptcy because the buyers go on strike, that is certainly an alarm signal, not only for Italy. New bond documents the sensibility Italy's BTP Futura bond shows the ingenuity when it comes to mobilising capital. And the BTP Futura is certainly not the last innovation to come onto the market in terms of bonds in connection with Covid-19. It will be interesting to see what new forms of fixed income will reach the bond market and, above all, who the issuer will be, that is, who will follow in Italy's footsteps.</TEXT>

And the BTP Futura is certainly not the last innovation to come onto the market in terms of bonds in connection with Covid-19. It will be interesting to see what new forms of fixed income will reach the bond market and, above all, who the issuer will be, that is, who will follow in Italy's footsteps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German Society for Securities Analysis (DGWA) will include the topic of sports investments in its portfolio with immediate effect. DGWA-Sportinvest will in future bring together investors interested in sports on the one hand and capital-seeking clubs/companies on the other hand within the framework of its professional advice and market expertise. One focus of DGWA-Sportinvest is professional football - by far the most important sport in Europe. Here, investors are offered, among other things, a wide range of opportunities with football corporations. How investor-affine the industry is, is currently demonstrated, for example, by the initial public offering of Spielvereinigung Unterhaching and the investment of a major investor in Bundesliga club Hertha BSC Berlin. The fact that Deutsche B #246;rse AG is a sponsor of Eintracht Frankfurt can also be seen as a clear sign in this direction. DGWA-Sportinvest focuses on ambitious traditional clubs (2nd to 4th league) in the German-speaking countries. DGWA-Sportinvest sees great potential and growth opportunities in this segment. Ambitious start-ups in the industry Further options for investors are offered by ambitious start-ups across the entire breadth of the sport, among others. In the course of the increasing digitalization of the sports industry, more and more young companies are entering the market with innovative ideas and products. These include, for example, tech products for golf training as well as special tech apps for the rental of sports equipment and e-sports games. In addition to the rapidly growing eSports sector, sports betting also has enormous growth potential worldwide. With its broad expertise, DGWA-Sportinvest also supports investments in medium-sized sporting goods manufacturers and other sports and sports segments with potential. The sports market in Germany Background Sports Market: The Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) together with the Federal Institute for Sports Science presented figures on the German sports market. The sport-related contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the industry is currently around 72 billion euros. In total, expenditure on all sports consumption in Germany amounted to 85 billion euros. Of this amount, 32.7% was spent on products of the manufacturing industry and 32.6% on services. Looking at the value added shares of various economic sectors in Germany, sport, at 2.2%, is roughly on a par with the producing metal industry (2.1%) and the transport sector (2.4%). In this context, it should be mentioned that the global potential of the sports industry is huge and by far not yet fully tapped. We continue to assume that there will be major catch-up effects in the sports industry after the corona pandemic. Please get in touch with us: About DGWA DGWA, the German Society for Securities Analysis, is the partner for the European financial markets - known and appreciated as one of the leading German corporate boutiques for global small and mid-cap consulting and investments.

    <TEXT>English version The Catholic professor of theology Julia Knop sees in the rise of church exits to the highest value ever reached the "scandal of an erosion from within". After the year 2018 had shown with the presentation of the so-called MGH study on the extent of the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church that crises cost members, the beginning reform debate in 2019 had not brought about a trend reversal, the Erfurt professor of dogmatics stated. "No wonder, the ability to reform must first be proven. The marginalization of the institution will not be stopped by this." In the meantime even "those from the church who care about it", Knop continued. These people need "a church for which contemporaneity is not a nuisance but a concern".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Scientific Institute of the AOK (WIdO) has for the first time examined the decline in the number of cases in hospital treatments due to the coronavirus lockdown on a valid nationwide database. The evaluation of the hospital cases of the 27 million AOK-insured persons shows that during the lockdown phase in March and April 2020, there was an overall significant drop in the number of cases of 39 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. Particularly high decreases were recorded for plannable, non-urgent interventions such as operations for arthritis-related hip replacement (minus 79 percent). However, there were also sharp declines in the treatment of life-threatening emergencies such as heart attacks (minus 31 percent) and strokes (minus 18 percent). The current WIdO report specifies the first internal evaluations from April 2020, which were reported on by various media. 241,000 people were treated During the lockdown phase from March 16 to April 5, 2020, a total of about 241,000 cases of AOK-insured patients were treated in German hospitals. This was about 157,000 cases less than in the corresponding period of the previous year. In absolute terms, according to the WIdO report, the largest decrease in case numbers was in diseases of the cardiovascular system, which fell by 42 percent (minus 27,000 cases). The biggest relative decrease in the number of cases, 65 per cent, was observed in diseases of the musculoskeletal system (minus 22,000 cases). The extent of the decreases varies regionally and ranges from 34 percent in Saxony to 43 percent in Rhineland-Palatinate</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version How could Donald Trump become US President? The well-known documentary activist Michael Moore measures America's operating temperature in "Fahrenheit 11/9". In his own polemical manner, he asks the question: Who is to blame for the situation? And he examines serious and less serious answers. The 128-minute documentary "Fahrenheit 11/9 by Michael Moore" can be seen on ZDF on Wednesday, July 1, 2020, 0.35 a.m. ZDFinfo will broadcast it for the first time on Monday, 6 July 2020, 21.45 hrs. The documentary film will be available at the ZDFmediathek from Wednesday, 1 July 2020, 10.00 a.m., until Monday, 20 July 2020. Michael Moore predicted the result Hardly any other election has occupied the public as much as that of Donald Trump four years ago as the 45th President of the United States. As one of the few who predicted the outcome, Academy Award winner Michael Moore revealed the circumstances and mechanisms that led to the electoral success of the controversial candidate. In the Critique: The Failure of the Democrats His criticism focuses not only on the president himself, but above all on the failure of the Democrats. In a provocative, one-sided and entertaining way, Michael Moore dissects the political and social processes leading up to Donald Trump's inauguration and denounces social inequality. He does not stop at the question of how it came about, but calls on all Americans to show political commitment and resistance. "Fahrenheit 11/9" celebrated its world premiere in 2018 at the Toronto International Film Festival.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, severe overweight and high blood pressure - with these underlying diseases the risk of a severe course increases when a Covid-19 infection is added. All these diseases have one thing in common: they are often accompanied by low vitamin D levels. The same applies to older people, for example, who also frequently suffer from vitamin D deficiency and who are among the risk groups. Professor Hans-Konrad Biesalski from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart points out this correlation. The nutritional physician has analysed 30 studies - and identified a vitamin D deficit as a potential indicator of the severity and mortality of Covid-19 disease. The vitamin D supply might also play a role in the course of the disease because this vitamin regulates the immune system and inflammatory processes in the body. The expert therefore recommends that in the case of covid-19 disease, it is essential to keep an eye on vitamin D levels. The complete study was recently published in the NCCR Journal: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nfs.2020.06.001 Vitamin D is in short supply in many people around the world - and in the case of covid-19 disease, this can be taken as an indicator of an increased risk of a severe course. Biesalski has described this in a summary publication. "Previously, basic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and severe overweight were regarded as risk factors," said the physician. "But it is precisely these diseases that are often associated with vitamin D deficiency. This has consequences for the course of Covid-19 disease." And this also applies to people over 65 or people who are rarely outdoors. "The most important source of vitamin D is the formation in the skin by sunlight," the expert said, "and in old age this only works to a limited extent." Vitamin D ensures the balance between inflammatory processes Among other things, vitamin D regulates the immune system and the so-called renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the body, which is particularly important for regulating blood pressure. In the event of an infection, vitamin D ensures that these two systems do not get out of hand. "Since the corona virus affects an important switch point of these regulatory circuits, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes no longer balance each other out," said Biesalski. "The system gets confused. Especially if there is a vitamin D deficiency at the same time." The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes shifts in favour of the pro-inflammatory ones, which then really pick up speed. "This results in severe changes in the alveoli, leading to a severe complication of Covid-19 disease, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome." In case of covid 19 disease, watch your vitamin D levels If an infection with the coronavirus is suspected, the vitamin D status should be checked and a possible deficit should be remedied quickly, the physician recommends. "This is particularly recommended for people with one of the underlying diseases or for older people. The vitamin D level is often devastatingly low in people living in old people's homes. In times of the home office, many people stay in closed rooms for longer periods of time, which also contributes to a poor vitamin D supply". Vitamin D can positively influence the course of disease However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, Prof. Dr. Biesalski emphasises: "Vitamin D is not a drug that can be used to cure Covid-19 diseases. But it can have a positive effect on the course of the disease by enabling the organism to restore the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes". Doctor should check vitamin D levels According to Biesalski, a sufficient vitamin D level can hardly be achieved through food. "Fat fish and sun-dried mushrooms are particularly rich in vitamin D. But this is not enough, and in Germany - unlike many other countries - food is not fortified." However, the physician does not recommend taking dietary supplements at any price. "In case of doubt, this is too little to improve a really bad vitamin D status in the short term. As a prophylactic measure, however, one should stay outdoors a lot, pay attention to one's diet - and at the latest, if an infection is suspected, ask the family doctor to check the vitamin D level".

It was published in the NCCR Journal, the scientific journal of the Society, which also covered the publication costs</TEXT>

Nevertheless, it is important that we proceed systematically," said Reinhardt. Reinhardt told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". He referred to the limited capacities: "We need the test capacities so that sufficient tests are available for suspect cases, risk groups and clinic patients and, above all, so that a quick test evaluation is possible". In addition, he said that employees in patient care should be tested on a voluntary basis at regular and short intervals. The medical president emphasized: "Mass tests for everyone would certainly provide interesting scientific findings, but as long as capacities are limited, I believe that rapid and targeted testing of clearly defined population groups makes more sense".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Due to the failure of the supervisory authorities in the Wirecard scandal, calls for a fundamental revision of the control rules in Germany are becoming ever louder: "In view of new technologies in the financial market, the supervisory bodies need a kind of general supervision of groups of companies that is less dependent on what business model a company has," said the financial expert of the Left Party parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Fabio De Masi, in an interview with the daily newspaper "neues deutschland". For a long time, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority Bafin had felt responsible only for Wirecard Bank and had made insufficient use of the securities supervision of Wirecard AG. Moreover, the authority "often has to stand at the door unannounced". The Bafin was inactive De Masi accuses the Bafin of inaction in the Wirecard case, as there have been repeated media reports of irregularities at the financial services provider. The left-wing politician suspects that the Bafin "did not want to stir up too much dust so as not to endanger the economic success of this company". De Masi also makes serious accusations against Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD). "We have known for a long time that Bafin has a supervisory problem." That should have interested the Minister of Finance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Engiish version Professor Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital of T #252;bingen is testing the Covid 19 vaccine developed by the company CureVac in a clinical study. In the podcast "Klartext Corona" he explains how such a study works and by when the vaccine can be approved at the earliest. 23 Vaccines have so far been tested in clinical trials worldwide. One of them was developed by the T #252;bingen-based company CureVac. Several independent university hospitals are now testing whether this vaccine is effective and compatible with humans. For example, the Tropical Institute at the University Hospital in T #252;bingen. Peter Kremsner, head of the study, and his team have just injected the vaccine into the first volunteers. Kremsner is optimistic about the course of the study: "It is progressing very well: We hope to have the first results from phase 1 in about two months' time, when the vaccine will be tested on younger, healthy volunteers. Then phase 2 will begin with older volunteers who belong to the risk group, and if possible, phase 3 will start this year, in which efficacy and tolerability will be tested in a particularly affected country. Everything is completely in line with the rules, despite the significantly accelerated procedures: "I am sure that all standards of the regulatory authorities and ethics committees in the European Union are met - everything must be correct in detail as always, but it must all happen very, very quickly. Provisional approval possible at the end of the year At the end of the winter, he believes that there could be a provisional approval for the vaccine, which could then be administered at the beginning of the year. Currently, there are approximately 200 vaccine candidates. At the same time, production capacities are being increased worldwide. Kremsner believes that there will be a whole range of vaccines, and that this is a good thing: "These can then be made available to broad sections of the population all over the world and thus make real control of Covid-19 possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The year 2020 could be another record heat year. "At the same time, however, it seems as if the climate crisis, last year's big issue, never existed. The consequences, especially for children in Africa, are already dramatic," says Liberal Seburikoko, climate expert at SOS Children's Villages in Rwanda, "Global warming has led to significantly more droughts, extreme rainfall and flooding," Seburikoko continues. "And at the same time we are currently experiencing the worst plague of locusts in 70 years - this is also a consequence of climate change." The swarms would have destroyed entire harvests, many people would be faced with nothing. The forecasts for the coming decades are also gloomy: "In countries like South Africa or Zimbabwe, maize yields could fall by more than 30 percent by 2050. Chad, Niger and Zambia run the risk of losing their entire agricultural sector by 2100. 60 million children on the continent would already be starving. Diseases are on the rise due to climate change Diseases would also increase due to climate change. "Rising temperatures could lead to the malaria mosquito spreading further and even settling above 2000 metres. Floods contribute to the spread of cholera, typhoid or dysentery. The longer we remain inactive, the greater the danger that we are heading for a catastrophe: children and families will then lose not only their livelihood but their lives," says Seburikoko. Switching to climate-friendly management after the pandemic In the fight against COVID-19, the world has shown that it is capable of making massive cuts very quickly. "If we do not act just as boldly against climate change, it can only mean that we lack the will! It will be decisive whether we succeed in switching to a sustainable, climate-friendly economy after the end of the pandemic and finally take consistent action against global warming. After all, the risks are far greater than those posed by COVID-19 - except that we cannot develop a vaccine against climate change," says Seburikoko</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The head of the German study on the corona drug Remdesivir, Gerd F #228;tkenheuer, has criticised the prices demanded by the manufacturing company Gilead Sciences as "enormously high". "I would expect that social and ethical aspects play a role with a drug like Remdesivir", the infectiologist from Cologne told the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger" (Thursday edition). In the USA, an ampoule is said to cost 390 US dollars, which corresponds to a total sum of 2340 US dollars for a five-day application. For the USA the price is "particularly alarming. Only people who can afford Remdesivir can be treated here. In any case, the pandemic is affecting poorer people, who are also more frequently prone to the disease, most severely in many respects.

    <TEXT>English version The German Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP) was commissioned by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority to review the financial statements of Wirecard AG for the first half of 2018 from February 2019. However, after fifteen months, no results had yet been presented. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection has now terminated the agreement with FREP in due time as of December 31, 2021. "This 'pawn sacrifice' is to be interpreted as an admission of guilt by the responsible ministry," says Hamburg-based specialist lawyer Peter Hahn of HAHN Rechtsanw #228;lte. He sees this failure as a viable basis for state liability. "Since February 2019, BaFin has felt compelled to investigate Wirecard for balance sheet manipulation. On account of the two-tiered nature of supervisory law in this area, the BaFin passed the investigation mandate on to the FREP. The FREP is an association under private law, which is entrusted with sovereign duties in this respect. The FREP seconded a single employee for the Wirecard investigation.

    <TEXT>English version Hans Sijbesma, head of the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Germany, believes that his company is well positioned in the research for a corona vaccine, and in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" he said: "We hope to receive data from the first phase I/II study in Great Britain in the coming months and results from the larger phase II/III studies in autumn this year. But this will depend on the rate of infection within the clinical trial communities." They hope that the vaccine is safe and effective, but they have to wait for the results of the clinical trial programme. The pharmaceutical company has teamed up with the University of Oxford to develop and then distribute a vaccine. According to Sijbesma, the company has secured the worldwide supply capacity for more than two billion doses of the vaccine, including some for Germany. "Europe now has a commitment to receive up to 400 million doses of the vaccine. Production of the vaccine will take place mainly in several European countries," says the pharmaceutical boss. Competition among vaccine manufacturers Sijbesma is not afraid of competition from other vaccine manufacturers. "We hope and expect that other vaccines will be available in the future, which means that there will be competition. This would also be good to ensure that we have a global supply as soon as possible and also to keep prices under control," says the head of pharmaceuticals.</TEXT>

But this will depend on the rate of infection within the clinical trial communities." They hope that the vaccine is safe and effective, but they have to wait for the results of the clinical trial programme. The pharmaceutical company has teamed up with the University of Oxford to develop and then distribute a vaccine. According to Sijbesma, the company has secured the worldwide supply capacity for more than two billion doses of the vaccine, including some for Germany. "Europe now has a commitment to receive up to 400 million doses of the vaccine. Production of the vaccine will take place mainly in several European countries," says the pharmaceutical boss. Competition among vaccine manufacturers Sijbesma is not afraid of competition from other vaccine manufacturers. "We hope and expect that other vaccines will be available in the future, which means that there will be competition. This would also be good to ensure that we have a global supply as soon as possible and also to keep prices under control," says the head of pharmaceuticals.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Green and CDU politicians have criticised Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for being too soft on China in relation to its influence on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. "The language vis- #224;-vis China must be made much clearer. The condemnation of the attack on Hong Kong's autonomy and the freedom of its citizens must be clearly expressed", said CDU foreign affairs expert Norbert R #246;ttgen to the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". China is extremely interested in international reputation, he said. "We must ensure that China at least pays for its wrongs in this currency. This is one of the few ways we have to influence China's present and future behaviour." No other European country has even remotely as intense and balanced an economic relationship with China as Germany. Massive attack on international legal obligations Green politician J #252;rgen Trittin said: "Hong Kong's new security law and its first applications are a massive attack on China's international legal obligations to Britain. Von der Leyen (CDU) had announced negative consequences, but left open what they were. "We must immediately review and, if necessary, suspend the mutual legal assistance agreement in criminal matters and the extradition agreement between Europe and Hong Kong."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Like almost all economic data coming out of the US ministries since March, the June labour market report leads to premature conclusions. After the report for April, when over 20 million jobs were cut, economists warned of a crash that could be deeper than during the Great Depression 90 years ago. The turnaround in May then proved them wrong. Nevertheless, the 4.8 million new jobs created in June by no means mean that the worst is over. The unemployment rate is still above the highest level reached during the financial crisis. That is sobering in itself. What is more important, however, is to embed the development in the overall economic context. Finally, the inability of the government of US President Donald Trump to develop a national strategy to combat the corona pandemic has created new threats to economic recovery. Advice from health experts ignored Many countries began to reopen their economies weeks ago. East-coast states, above all New York, waited with the easing of their contact restrictions until the infection rate decreased noticeably. Others, especially in the Republican-dominated South, ignored the advice of health experts and listened to only one voice: that of their president, who tirelessly pressed for the opening of the economy in the interest of his own re-election and did not want to hear about undeniable facts. The consequences for the large countries are devastating The consequences, especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona, which are among the largest states and account for a significant share of the gross domestic product, are devastating. Because contact restrictions were ignored, curfews were short-lived and people continued to hang out in bars, nightclubs, swimming pools and on beaches, daily sickness rates are reaching record levels. Intensive care units are hopelessly overloaded, and now even the Trump-loyal governors must react and slow the pace of opening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the red light districts of the Thai port city of Pattaya, thousands of women work in bars and clubs to earn a living. But to protect the population from COVID-19, the government imposed a curfew, introduced travel restrictions and even postponed the celebration of the Thai New Year Songkran indefinitely. "No tourists and closed bars mean no revenue for the women working there, so many of them had to vacate their rooms in the bars and are now living without shelter and without income," explains Tobias Sch #252; #223;ler, founder of the non-profit organization Global Micro Initiative (GMI). "Many of these women are desperate. Because of travel restrictions, they are not even able to go home to their families in the villages", says Sch #252; #223;ler. New life away from prostitution Together with the Thai organization Tamar Center, GMI has been helping women from the bars who want to start a new life away from prostitution for several years. "Alcohol, drugs, HIV, unwanted pregnancies, frightening sex practices, humiliation - it's not uncommon for these things to lead women to seek a way out of the bars and turn to our partner organization," adds Silvia Sch #252; #223;ler, co-founder of the German aid organization GMI. With her previous experience as a volunteer working for aid organisations in the red light districts of Brussels and Amsterdam, the women from the bars in Pattaya are particularly close to her heart. Free accommodation and psychological support In addition to free accommodation and psychological support, the Tamar Center in Pattaya offers courses in which the participants learn to organize their everyday life themselves. In a creative workshop, the women make greeting cards and other items that are sold through an online shop. In addition to a regular salary, the women receive a number of additional benefits, such as free accommodation, rice, transport to and from work, day care and sponsorships for their children's education. "GMI provides donation-financed starter kits for these courses," Sch #252; #223;ler said. "In addition to the required materials, these "sets" include extensive training and the women learn about jobs such as hairdressing, cooking and sewing. GMI also co-finances these training courses. Regular contact with partner organisations "Unfortunately, the Tamar Center had to close and can currently only help sporadically", report Silvia and Tobias Sch #252; #223;ler. "But already now the staff is preparing to be there for Pattaya's women even more intensively after the end of the curfew. We are also in regular contact with our partner organisation to talk about strategies and possibilities for the time after curfew. We are happy that we will be able to support the Tamar Center even more thanks to our donors. About Global Micro Initiative The Global Micro Initiative is a non-profit organization that is financed exclusively by donations. The initiative promotes education and provides microcredits to people in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, who can use them to build their own businesses and get the chance to live independently. Even with small contributions, a lot can be achieved locally. The Global Micro Initiative was founded in 2012 by the then 20-year-old Tobias Sch #252; #223;ler. After stays abroad in the Philippines and Indonesia, it became his goal and a matter of the heart to help the people on the spot</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Economic output in the euro area experienced a sharp decline in the second quarter, followed by a slower recovery. This is what the Ifo Institute in Munich and the KOF in Zurich expect in their new Euro Zone Economic Outlook. The overall forecast is uncertain because nobody knows how the corona pandemic will continue, how the liquidity situation of companies will develop and how consumers will behave. The institutes estimate that the second quarter will see a 12.3 per cent drop against the first quarter, which has already fallen by 3.6 per cent. In the third quarter, output is expected to grow by 8.3 percent, in the fourth by a further 2.8 percent. However, for the year as a whole, this means that all goods and services produced will shrink by 8.1 percent. All important figures are in the red In the second quarter, all the important figures are in the red: industrial production shrinks by 18.9 per cent due to corona-related closures, private consumption by 11.8 per cent and investments by 15.4 per cent compared to the previous quarter.in the third quarter, after the restart, industrial production will rise by 14.7 per cent, in the fourth by 2.7 per cent, which on balance results in minus 11.3 per cent for the year as a whole. The other key figures are similar: Prices will fall by 0.9 percent in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, they will rise by 0.3 per cent, resulting in 0.0 per cent for the year as a whole.

The board of the university hospital and the Berlin Senate are also counting on federal aid to compensate for these losses, reports the "Tagesspiegel". During the lockdown weeks alone, the University Hospital lost more than 44 million euros in revenue. The sum is based on a comparison of the revenues from mid-March to the end of May of the years 2019 and 2020, according to which the losses result from the corona precautions: All hospitals had postponed scheduled operations in order to keep beds free for potential Covid-19 patients. 30 million euros because of Covid-19 treatments Together with the 30 million euros spent on equipment, protective material and conversions due to Covid-19 treatments, the Charit #233; now has almost 75 million euros pandemic minus.

The sum is based on a comparison of the revenues from mid-March to the end of May of the years 2019 and 2020, according to which the losses result from the corona precautions: All hospitals had postponed scheduled operations in order to keep beds free for potential Covid-19 patients. 30 million euros because of Covid-19 treatments Together with the 30 million euros spent on equipment, protective material and conversions due to Covid-19 treatments, the Charit #233; now has almost 75 million euros pandemic minus. The figures are taken from an answer by State Secretary for Science Steffen Krach (SPD) to a question by CDU member of parliament Adrian Grasse, which is available to the "Tagesspiegel"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Scientists of the Dr. Rath Research Institute under the direction of Dr. Alexandra Niedzwiecki could have shown for the first time that a combination of specific micronutrients can significantly reduce the number of receptors on human cells that are necessary for an infection of the body with the coronavirus. Ever since the angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor was identified as the "gateway" of coronaviruses to infect the human body, it has been a goal of worldwide research to close this "gateway". A group of researchers has started to search for a vaccine that creates antibodies in the body of patients that are able to block these "entry points". Another group of researchers took a more direct approach: they tried to find ways to reduce the number of "entry points" in general by downregulating their production at the level of DNA in the cell nucleus. Experimental design reflects actual infection A team of researchers from the Dr. Rath Research Institute has now been able to show that a defined composition of micronutrients consisting of bioactive natural molecules is able to significantly reduce the number of ACE2 receptors in those cell types that are preferentially attacked by the coronavirus: the lung (epithelial) cells and the blood vessel (endothelial) cells. It is particularly significant that under stimulation with pro-inflammatory signal molecules (cytokines) - an experimental set-up that reflects an actual infection in the body - the formation (expression) of the ACE2 receptors could be suppressed by 81%, so that less than 20% of these viral "entry points" were available. Vitamins are essential for the immune system In addition, vitamins are essential for the optimal functioning of the immune system by improving the production of defence cells, their migration and also their ability to kill pathogens. All these facts are documented in every leading textbook in biology and biochemistry. Such a broad spectrum of biological defence is a prerequisite for the prevention of future pandemics. The Dr. Rath Research Institute is part of a non-profit organization. It is willing to license its knowledge free of charge to governments and public institutions worldwide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The jury of the SWR Doku Festival met this year via video conference due to the exceptional situation caused by Corona - the winners were also chosen online in 2020 The German Documentary Film Award was awarded in four categories. The main prize, endowed with 20,000 euros and donated by S #252;dwestrundfunk and MFG Filmf #246;rderung Baden-W #252;rttemberg, was divided this year: It goes to Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss for "Lovemobil" and to the Syrian documentary filmmaker Feras Fayyad for the film "Eine Klinik im Untergrund - The Cave". Films in further categories Ulrike Ottinger received the Norbert Daldrop Prize for Art and Culture, endowed with 5,000 euros, for "Paris Calligrammes". Oliver Schwabe was awarded the Music Prize of Opus GmbH for a documentary film in the field of music for his film "Love Eats Life, Tobias Gruben, His Songs and the Earth", which carries a prize money of 5,000 euros. The film "Lost in Face" by Valentin Riedl was awarded the F #246;rderpreis des Hauses des Dokumentarfilms, endowed with 3,000 euros. "Lovemobil" by Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss For her film, filmmaker Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss, born in 1979, returned again and again for three years to her home in Lower Saxony near Wolfsburg to visit prostitutes from all over the world in their mobile homes by the roadside, to gain their trust, to film them. "Lovemobil" tells of home, trust, hope and the abyss of a microcosm that makes prostitution tangible as the tough final stage of a globalized capitalism. The jury: "This restrained and at the same time courageous pre-touching on the visual and content level is the approach of the film, which bit by bit opens up the world in the VW-mobiles and captures the aberrations, aspirations and hopes that led all those involved here: from the women, the clients to the village priest, who gets into a fight with the operator of the Lovemobiles. (...) A journey into an inner and outer reality, as perhaps only a creative documentary film can: at eye level, with plenty of time and cinematic differentiation, exposing hidden layers of reality - without ever judging or condemning, so that the audience has room for their own thoughts and feelings. (...) Human and cinematic sensitivity characterize this film." Lovemobil: Germany 2019 - 103 minutes; Written and directed by Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss; Camera: Christoph Rohrscheidt; Montage: Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss; Sound: Henrik Cordes, Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss; Music: Dascha Dauenhauer; Production: Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss Co-production: NDR; Film funding: nordmedia Film- und Mediengesellschaft Niedersachsen/Bremen mbH; Scholarship "cast amp;cut" of the foundation Kulturregion Hannover "An Underground Clinic - The Cave" by Feras Fayyad The documentary accompanies the 30-year-old future pediatrician Dr. Amani in war-torn Syria as she goes about her daily work in a hidden underground field hospital. As head of a team of doctors and civilian caregivers, she works tirelessly to provide the most important medical aid to the victims of bomb attacks and chemical warfare in Al Ghouta near Damascus. In his film, Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad shows the daily courage of Dr. Amani and her team, revealing the essence of humanity. In the jury's statement it says: "Children with bomb fragments and victims of chlorine gas attacks - the war shows itself here in its senseless rawness. When, for example, the operating doctor listens to classical music on his smartphone during an operation or a nurse cooks food for the staff, a completely different level is revealed in this film. This underground clinic not only saves lives, but also sheds light on the ambivalence of being human. The horrors of war are shown, but beyond that, 'The Cave' deals with the preservation of humanity in its universal validity. That's what makes this film so deeply touching and intelligent, because it involves us all." "A Clinic Underground - The Cave": Syria, Denmark, Germany, USA and Qatar 2019 - 95 minutes; Book: Alisar Hasan, Feras Fayyad; Director: Feras Fayyad; Camera: Muhammed Khair Al Shami, Ammar Suleiman, Mohammed Eyad; Montage: Per K.

    <TEXT>English version Many young girls and women from rural areas of Thailand do not have access to education due to the poverty of their parents. Often they have no choice but to earn their money through prostitution in the cities. There they often experience violence and abuse. To help them find a way out of prostitution, the Global Micro Initiative (GMI) together with the Tamar Center offers help. Sexual exploitation and violence against women has long been one of the main problems in Thailand, along with severe poverty and natural disasters. Even though the income of Thai citizens has risen significantly over the last 20 years, around ten percent of the population still live on less than five euros a day. Especially in rural areas, the poverty rate is still far above average. The families there are largely self-sufficient, growing rice and fruit. But often they could not afford an education for their children, primarily their daughters. Sent by the families to the big cities Many young girls would instead be sent by their families to the big cities to earn money. They usually have no choice but to work in the bars in red light districts and thus secure income for themselves and their families. In their home country, the relatives are grateful for the support, but in the city they are ostracized, marginalized and threatened. They are also at risk of unwanted pregnancy or contracting a sexually transmitted disease. It is not unusual for them to become addicted to alcohol and drugs. Help for the girls and women In order to help these women to get out of prostitution, the Global Micro Initiative, together with the Tamar Center, offers the women a possibility to secure their existence in another way. With donor-financed starter sets for just 60 euros, the women could make their own greeting cards, which are sold in the Tamar Center's online shop. In addition, the girls and women there receive free accommodation, psychological support and educational opportunities to enable them to start a new and better future</TEXT>

This was announced by the Ministry of Economics on request of the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post". By the end of June 2021, companies in Germany will then be able to produce up to seven billion masks annually in certified quality. These include FFP2, FFP3 and medical face masks. The Ministry of Economics is investing 60 million euros in subsidies to enable the companies to convert their production accordingly. Funding will also be given to plants that produce the so-called filter fleece for the masks, which is used to keep viruses away. The Ministry of Economic Affairs was unable to provide information on the current production capacities in Germany. "There is also no detailed overview of how many masks can be produced per day and in which quality," it was said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The relief organisation Action against Hunger is very concerned in a report on the consequences of COVID-19 in countries of the Global South, which states that up to one billion people are threatened by a famine catastrophe if the international community does not act immediately. In the Global South, the pandemic is hitting countries that are already marked by wars, conflicts and the consequences of climate change. Action against Hunger calls on all relevant actors to acknowledge the scale of the crisis and make binding financial commitments to prevent a global hunger crisis. COVID-19 is a global crisis with far-reaching social and economic consequences. It exacerbates existing food insecurity. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that the pandemic will increase the number of people suffering from hunger by 135 million. This is in addition to the 821 million people who are already starving since 2019 according to FAO. "In many countries where Action Against Hunger is working, the situation is worsening dramatically. We fear that the unimaginable number of one billion starving people will soon be reached," warns Jan Sebastian Friedrich-Rust, Managing Director of Action against Hunger. The worldwide action against Covid-19 was necessary The global measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 were necessary, but also had the effect of massively reducing access to food: People could no longer work or earn money to buy food. Food supply chains were disrupted, resulting in an extremely limited supply of food. As a result, food prices have risen massively. Situation in West and Central Africa is worrying The situation in West and Central Africa is worrying: even before the outbreak of the pandemic, the food situation of 19 million people was already at risk due to wars and structural problems. The impact of COVID-19 on already overburdened health care systems, social systems and precarious living conditions could lead to even more people suffering from hunger: It is estimated that the number in the Region could rise to around 50 million people. Seven immediate actions identified In the report presented, "The seeds of a future pandemic?", Action Against Hunger identified seven immediate measures to prevent hunger from increasing in the world. They aim to respond to the current pandemic and to develop sustainable solutions for current and future crises. Governments must make firm commitments to tackle this unprecedented challenge together: All restrictions on humanitarian aid must be lifted, access to basic services and food security for all must be guaranteed, and more resilient health and nutrition systems must be built for the long term to prevent crises</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The overall sentiment of the Citi investment barometer Q2 2020 is slightly clouded after the first recovery wave following the corona crash. In particular the interest rate sentiment, which fell by 20 points (from +9 to -11), is pulling the overall barometer down. This means that the recovery in interest rate expectations, which had started from the all-time low in the third quarter of 2019, has been abruptly broken. Only 11 % still believe in rising interest rates (Q1 2020: 29 %). A full 65% now expect interest rates to move sideways (Q1 2020: 44%). A similar picture emerges for the medium term: Here, too, the respondents are not convinced that interest rates in the Eurozone will rise. Only just under 12% still considered such a scenario likely (Q1 2020: 32%). With a two-thirds share, the majority of investors (66%) also believed that historically low interest rates would continue to move sideways in the coming year. Price of the fine ounce of gold will rise As a logical consequence market participants are much more optimistic about physical gold: the gold sentiment has climbed from 24 points in the previous quarter to 37 points. This is also reflected in price expectations. For example, 54% of those surveyed, more than twice as many as in Q1 (24%), assumed that the price of the troy ounce would rise in the short term. Also over the medium term, more than half of the respondents now expect the price of the precious metal to rise (51%). Mixed picture for stocks The picture is less uniform for equities, however. In the short term, i.e. on a three-month horizon, bulls and bears are almost on a par for European equities. The bull rate among the respondents is around 30% (Q1 2020: 31%). With 28 % of investors, the bear camp is similarly large. Looking ahead over the next 12 months, this picture is changing and bulls are clearly in the majority: over the medium term, a full 50% (Q1 2020: 44%) expect prices to rise and only 22% (Q1 2020: 19%) expect share prices to fall. Declining optimism in US equities For US equities, Q2 shows signs of waning optimism. While in the previous quarter roughly the same number of respondents still expected short-term price rises (32 %) or declines (35 %), in Q2 a difference of nearly ten percentage points has now emerged, at 28 % (rising) and 37 % (falling). After the overall sentiment was still at 19 points in the last quarter, it has lost only one point despite the ongoing corona effects and remains almost unchanged at 18 points in the second quarter of 2020. The overall sentiment can take on values from -100 to +100 points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version For the first time since 2011, the troy ounce of gold will again cost more than $ 1,800. As the precious metals experts at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs note, the gold market is set to dwarf the all-time high of around 1,921 dollars. The analysts expect an increase to 2,000 dollars within twelve months. If one looks for the reasons for this remarkable price increase, one surely first thinks of the fact that gold has traditionally served as a safe haven for assets in times of crisis of all kinds. Currently, however, it is noticeable that although there was strong interest in gold at the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic, especially from private investors, this interest has normalised again in the meantime, if one takes the German demand for coins and bullion gold as an example. Gold has also traditionally been seen as a vehicle for preserving value in times of high inflation. Although there is currently no sign of a rising currency devaluation, quite a few investors fear that the enormous aid programmes of governments and central banks could trigger a surge in inflation. However, this does not really explain the current high demand for the precious metal either, as there is currently rather a threat of a second pandemic wave - with the need for extensive countermeasures by governments that could stall the economy again. Moreover, there are other real assets such as real estate for these purposes. Institutional investors responsible for the rally Looking at where gold demand is currently coming from, the real reason for the rally becomes apparent. It is institutional investors who are pumping very substantial funds into gold ETFs. Due to their construction, gold ETFs are less suitable for hedging in times of crisis, they are rather a means for tactical investments in the gold market in order to participate in price movements. Central banks provide enormous liquidity injections Especially through the ETF gold has become a part of the "Everything Bubble" triggered by the central banks with their enormous liquidity injections, which traditionally drives investment objects like shares, bonds and also gold in step with each other. And because an end to ultra-loose monetary policy would inevitably trigger a financial crisis with a severe global depression, one can assume that the trend will continue for a long time to come. A gold price of 2,000 dollars is thus indeed achievable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Roger Federer, 38, one of the best tennis players in the world, has long struggled with himself not to let go during his matches. As a junior player, he himself commented loudly and audibly on every ball he hit, which is why his parents "almost snapped" in the spectator stands, he told the ZEITmagazin. "If you carry on like this," they threatened, "we won't be able to go on tour with you anymore, it's embarrassing." After a defeat in 2001 - two years before his first Wimbledon victory - Federer smashed his racket and swore to himself: "Well, now it's done, I can't behave like this anymore." Counselling by a psychologist He then consulted a psychologist. "It was an extremely lengthy process. It wasn't until two years later that I really knew how to behave on the court, so as not to be too indifferent on the one hand, and not always be 180 on the other." "What do you always do here?" But he still talks to himself during his games. "Sometimes you have to talk to yourself to distract yourself, to refocus." He often asks himself: "'What are you always doing here?! Sometimes you have to be hard on yourself." Tennis is the loneliest sport.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In a survey of more than 3,500 football fans, "FC PlayFair! Verein f #252;r Integrit #228;t im Profifu #223;ball (FC PlayFair! Club for Integrity in Professional Football) determined the opinion of the fans regarding the ghost games of the past season. The survey, conducted together with cooperation partner Sportbuzzer, essentially yielded the following results: Although more than 52 percent of those questioned believe that ghost games in their current form are unacceptable, more than 60 percent of the DFL nevertheless state that they have worked out a good concept for the start of the league in the middle of the Corona era. The statement "I was glad that the Bundesliga was back on TV" received 65 percent approval. Contrary to this rather positive mood, however, almost 50 per cent are still of the opinion that football has been given an unjustified special role here. Without fans, football lacks the "fascination And 85 percent agreed with the thesis that football would have lost its fascination without the fans. It is also interesting to look ahead to the coming season. Almost 65 percent of football fans agree with the statement that the 2020/21 season should only start when fans are allowed back into the stadiums. At the end of a total of 14 questions, the fans gave an overall score of 4.2 for the ghost games. At school, they passed with four minus.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German government's economic stimulus package is not expected to have too great an impact on growth. The growth impulse in 2020 is expected to amount to 30 billion euros, which is significantly less than the associated costs of 88 billion euros. "Nevertheless, it makes sense to support the economy in this critical situation with fiscal policy funds," writes Ifo President Clemens Fuest in an article for the Ifo-Schnelldienst. The measures could not solve the specific problems of the crisis, but they could help prevent a downward spiral towards a deeper crisis. Politicians must carefully weigh up "As public debt rises, politicians must carefully weigh up whether the benefits of individual economic policy measures justify the costs," warns Fuest. The temporary reduction in value-added tax is one of the less convincing elements of the economic stimulus package. "It entails a considerable administrative burden and it is questionable to what extent companies will pass the reduction on to consumers and generate additional demand," says Florian Dorn, co-author of the article. With the temporary reduction in VAT, it is to be expected that the fiscal costs will ultimately be significantly higher than the positive economic impulse generated by the reduction. Recovery plan contains convincing elements The economic stimulus package also contains several convincing elements that could make a targeted contribution to the recovery of the German economy and generate growth impetus in the medium to long term. "Public investment in future technologies, infrastructure and climate protection as well as measures to strengthen municipalities and families are particularly positive," says Florian Neumeier, co-author of the article. In addition, the accelerated depreciation of capital goods and the expansion of tax loss compensation are also to be welcomed. "Whether the measures taken so far are sufficient to stabilize the economy in the long term depends on the further course of the epidemic and the political reactions to it," concludes Fuest</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to SOS Children's Villages forecasts, the corona pandemic and the worldwide school closures will lead to the permanent loss of access to education for many boys and girls worldwide. Even before the spread of the virus, the number of children not attending school was already at a high 258 million. "Now it is to be feared that it will increase significantly," says George Protopapas, head of the relief organisation in Greece. The United Nations' goal of guaranteeing all children a quality education by 2030 is thus a long way off. Children from poor families in particular are at risk of becoming educational losers. Protopapas says: "It starts with the fact that the vast majority of them have no chance to take part in online lessons because they lack the technical equipment. The pupils lose their connection. Without support, it becomes extremely difficult for them to catch up!" To protect against the corona virus, more than 60 percent of all schools are still closed, 500 million pupils have no chance to learn online due to a lack of conditions, according to the UN. Economic cutbacks have serious consequences The economic cutbacks caused by the pandemic would also have a serious impact on children's education. "Many families that were previously poor are now in dire straits. School is not a priority for them at the moment. It is about survival," says Protopapas. But the lack of education is one of the decisive factors that further increases social imbalance and cements poverty in the long term - with all its side effects. "These include psychological problems, but also child labour and a lack of medical care," says Protopapas. The situation is particularly dramatic for the children in the refugee camps, whose support has been further reduced during the lockdown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The call for a less integrated world in the wake of the corona pandemic is leading to a loss of income and prosperity, according to a recent study by the Ifo Institute. "Turning back globalisation, for example by bringing back production to Germany on a larger scale, would not be a solution to the current crisis," says Lisandra Flach, head of the Ifo Centre for Foreign Trade. "We can show that the economic consequences of Covid-19 would be only marginally smaller if we turn back globalization now," adds Flach. In Germany, renationalization and the recovery of production would have enormous negative consequences for economic power. "In a world with 100 percentage points higher trade costs between all trading partners, the Covid-19 shock would lead to a 7.4 percent reduction in real income," adds Marina Steininger, co-author of the study. The impact of the crisis is uneven "In a less integrated world, our economic output (GDP) would already be at a much lower level," explains Flach. According to the ifo Institute's calculations, Germany's GDP, which was reduced by Covid-19, is at the same level as in 2013. In a less globalized world, today's GDP level would be comparable to the 1996 level. It is true that the Covid-19 shock affects globalized countries more than closed economies. But globalisation has already lifted the countries involved to levels that would never have been reached without global value creation "The crisis is having a very uneven impact on different sectors. The manufacturing industry is the hardest hit in percentage terms, especially the automotive and pharmaceutical industries," says Marina Steininger</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version A UN report published today warns that as a result of the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic, people in some 25 countries will face devastating hunger in the coming months. While the greatest need is in Africa, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia - including middle-income countries - are also affected by crippling hunger. This is the conclusion of the Early Warning Analysis of Acute Famine Crisis, prepared by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. "Three months ago, I told world leaders at the UN Security Council that we are in danger of falling into a famine of biblical proportions," said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. "Today our latest data show us that since then millions of the world's poorest families have been pushed even closer to the brink of the abyss. Livelihoods are being destroyed on an unprecedented scale and now these families are at imminent risk of starvation. We must not make any mistakes now - because if we do not act now to end this pandemic of human suffering, many people will die". Food aid extended to 138 million people To prevent the worst from happening, WFP is expanding its food aid to an unprecedented 138 million people who cannot adequately feed themselves, while the pandemic is increasingly affecting some of the world's most vulnerable countries. The cost of WFP's food aid to tackle the dramatic increase in hunger is estimated at US$4.9 billion, with a further US$500 million earmarked to prevent the outbreak of famine in the most vulnerable countries. Largest appeal for funds in UN history This is more than half of the updated so-called COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, the largest appeal for donations in the history of the United Nations, which today asked for more than 10 billion US dollars. The plan lists the huge humanitarian needs in more than 60 countries, many of which were already suffering the effects of conflict, climate change and economic crises before COVID-19. Number of malnourished people rises to 270 million The number of acutely malnourished people in these vulnerable countries could rise from 149 million before the COVID 19 outbreak to an estimated 270 million by the end of the year, unless life-saving assistance is provided immediately.

    <TEXT>English version Millionaires have hardly been represented in population surveys so far - accordingly little was known about them. The exact extent of the concentration of wealth in Germany also remained unclear. Researchers of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) have now succeeded in closing this data gap with a new additional sample in which people with high wealth are strongly overrepresented in order to correct their underrepresentation in the regular SOEP sample. Calculations on this basis and with the addition of publicly available wealth lists show that the concentration of individual net wealth in Germany is higher than previously reported. The top ten percent own a good two-thirds of net wealth, compared to just under 59 percent previously. The richest one percent of the population alone accounts for around 35 percent (instead of just under 22 percent) of net wealth. Around 1.5 percent of adults in Germany have individual net assets, i.e. gross assets minus debts, of at least one million euros. They differ from the rest of the population not only in terms of the amount of assets they have: an above-average number of them are men who are older, better educated, independent and more satisfied with their lives. Without a blind spot, the distribution of wealth is more meaningful "Thanks to the new data, we can take a closer look at millionaires for the first time and provide a truly reliable description of their assets as well as characteristics such as age, education and occupation. Studies on wealth distribution in Germany, for example, will be much more meaningful without the previously blind spot in the area of high wealth," explains Carsten Schr #246;der from the Socio-Economic Panel, who co-authored the study with Markus Grabka, Charlotte Bartels, Johannes K #246;nig and Konstantin G #246;bler. The average assets are 22,800 euros The calculations provide a complete picture of the distribution of wealth in Germany. The median, i.e. the person's assets exactly in the middle of the wealth distribution, remains almost unchanged (22,800 euros instead of 22,000 euros previously). The group of the richest percentage of the wealth distribution, for example, starts with net assets of more than 1.3 million euros instead of the previous figure of a good million euros. 30 percent of millionaires are women Among millionaires, the proportion of women is relatively low at just over 30 percent. 14 percent have a migration background, six percent come from the new federal states and 40 percent are over 65 years old. Despite their advanced age, 62 percent are still employed, the majority of them self-employed. Overall, millionaires are significantly more satisfied than the average of the rest of the population, both in general with their lives and in almost all sub-areas such as family, income and health. Only satisfaction with regard to leisure time is an exception - this is probably due to the fact that millionaires report a significantly higher weekly working time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The number of new corona infections in the USA is rising dramatically day by day and the number of infections is also increasing again in many other countries. The danger of a further lockdown with restrictive contact restrictions does not seem to have been averted yet. But how can this be avoided? And how can society and the economy even survive a second wave? These questions were discussed by Paul Romer, winner of the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics 2018 and Professor of Economics at New York University, at an online conference of the Global Behavioral Economics Network with Nora Szech, Chair of Political Economy at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and several hundred guests. The crisis goes far beyond the economy "We cannot repair the economy if we do not have a clear plan on how to deal with the pandemic," Romer is convinced. The crisis goes far beyond the economy. "It is also a crisis of science that clings to theories instead of looking for new ways. This virus is different. And science must learn to respond differently." Not hoping for a panacea vaccine One example of this is digital contact tracing. Although this works well in theory, it fails in practice because of people's distrust of the technology or politics. Similarly, according to Romer, it is not a sound strategy to hope for the panacea of a possible vaccination: "It is naive to believe that this will immediately put an end to everything. On the contrary, in practice people's mistrust coupled with widespread vaccination scepticism can create undreamt-of hurdles. Faster and more testing Romer's approach: Faster and more testing to isolate potential suprespreaders in time. And in the process, he says, one must learn to deal with the fact that some results are still inaccurate. "To know more is always better than less. And even with many inaccurate tests, we know more afterwards than before. People just have to learn that getting tested regularly helps."

    <TEXT>English version While the USA is currently at the epicentre of the wave of insolvencies, in some other countries the calm before the storm still prevails - as in Germany. However, by autumn at the latest, the wave of bankruptcies is likely to begin all over the world, continuing throughout the first half of 2021. This is the conclusion reached by credit insurer Euler Hermes in its latest study. The experts currently expect a cumulative rise in global insolvencies of 35% in the two years 2020 and 2021 to a new negative record (17% in 2020, 16% in 2021). However, the development is very heterogeneous: In two out of three countries a massive increase in bankruptcies is already evident, while in the other third the biggest rise will not occur until 2021. "However, this is by no means an all-clear, but rather a ticking time bomb," says Ron van het Hof, CEO of Euler Hermes in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. "This time bomb will go off in the third quarter of the year at the latest, and the shock waves are likely to spread to the entire first half of 2021. No relief in sight There are no signs of an easing of the situation in 2021 with a further increase in global insolvencies. "If we compare the forecasts for 2021 with the case figures for 2019, the cumulative increase in global bankruptcies over the two years is more than a third (+35%) to a new negative record," says Maxime Lemerle, Head of Insolvency and Sector Analyses at the Euler Hermes Group. "If the respective government support measures are terminated too soon, the increase is likely to be even higher by 5-10 percentage points". Germany as an export nation strongly dependent on international developments Not good news for Germany as an export nation, where negative developments in export markets usually have a stronger impact than in other countries. Nevertheless, Germany is likely to come through the crisis better than many others in comparison. "Compared to many other countries, Germany could get off with a black eye," says Van het Hof. "In addition to the better starting position and the shorter, less strict lockdown, the main reasons for this are the government's rapid and very extensive emergency measures. In particular, the joint protective umbrella for German companies provided by the federal government and credit insurers has stabilized trade for the time being and provided additional protection for supply chains". Other countries are hit much harder and sooner Overall, the number of bankruptcies in this country in the course of the Covid 19 pandemic is likely to increase by a total of 12% in the two years up to 2021 to around 21,000 cases. At +8%, the lion's share is likely to be in 2021. In 2020 the leading credit insurer expects the number of cases to increase by +4% to around 19,500. This means that Germany, along with the UK, France, Belgium, Switzerland and India, is one of the third of the countries that will experience the negative effects with a time lag. Apart from the emergency measures taken by the state, one of the main reasons for this is the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency in Germany until the autumn. Accumulation of major insolvencies in key sectors in the first half of 2020 "Companies in difficulties currently only have to report this to an insolvency court in the autumn," says Van het Hof. "That's why we currently see relatively few cases in Germany. But appearances are deceptive and the moment of truth will strike in the fall for many. Even if only a few insolvencies have been filed recently due to the temporary suspension of the obligation to file, this should not obscure the fact that we are nevertheless already seeing an accumulation of major insolvencies in the first half of 2020 - especially in key sectors such as the automotive and metalworking industries. New business models in demand In addition, there are major challenges for companies with regard to the drastically changing business models - not least due to Covid-19. "For example, no company is geared to suddenly serving only half of its customers. Many companies have to fundamentally rethink and adapt their business model. They first have to finance this, and to do so they need margins and a solution for restructuring their mountains of debt, which have grown considerably for many companies thanks to Covid-19. Together with the digital transformation, these are many variables that will determine the future development even after 2021." USA with strongest increase, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands and China with wave of bankruptcies Nevertheless, many companies in other countries are being hit earlier and harder: the USA (+47% increase in insolvencies in 2020) leads the negative ranking of countries that are already suffering a massive increase in insolvencies in 2020. They share their fate with two out of three countries worldwide. These include the USA, Brazil (+32% in 2020) and China (+21%) as well as many European countries such as Portugal (+30%), the Netherlands (+29%), Spain (+20%) and Italy (+18%).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version A new study published by Global FinPrint in Nature reveals that sharks are no longer found in many of the world's coral reefs, indicating that they have become too rare to play their normal role in the ecosystem and have become functionally extinct. 371 reefs in 58 countries have been studied, and in nearly 20% of them no sharks have been observed. This is an indication of a comprehensive decline, the magnitude of which has not yet been documented. The study also identifies conservation measures that could contribute to the recovery of these famous predators. Virtually no sharks were found in the reefs of six countries: Dominican Republic, French Antilles, Kenya, Vietnam, Lesser Antilles and Qatar. In total, only three sharks were recorded here in more than 800 hours of observation. There are also signs of hope "While Global FinPrint's results show a tragic decline in shark numbers on many of the world's reefs, there are also signs of hope," said Jody Allen, co-founder and chairperson of the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. "The data gathered in this world's first study of sharks in coral reefs can guide plans for the meaningful and long-term protection of the remaining reef sharks." Decline of a key species This parameter for the status of reef sharks worldwide reveals an alarming global decline of this key species, which is a major food source, tourist attraction and top predator in coral reefs. This loss is mainly caused by overfishing of sharks. The greatest contribution is made by destructive fishing practices, such as the use of trawl lines and drift nets. Robust shark populations can coexist "While our study shows a significant negative human impact on reef shark populations, it is clear that the main problem is the link between high human population density, destructive fishing practices and poor management," said Dr. Demian Chapman, one of the directors of Global FinPrint and Associate Professor in the Department of Biology and Environmental Studies at Florida International University. "We have found that robust shark populations can coexist with humans if these humans have the will, the resources and a plan to implement conservation measures." In a number of countries, shark conservation is working The study found a number of countries where shark protection works, and specific measures that can be effective. Among the nations that scored best compared to the average for their region were Australia, the Bahamas, the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, the Maldives and the United States. These nations exhibit important characteristics that have been found to be associated with higher shark populations: a functioning administration and either a ban on shark fishing or a strong, science-based management system that limits how many sharks can be caught. Have a clear picture "These nations have more sharks in their waters because they have demonstrated good management on this issue," said Dr. Aaron MacNeil, lead author of the Global FinPrint study and Associate Professor at Dalhousie University. "We now have a clear picture of what can be done to limit catches of reef sharks throughout the tropics. Measures range from equipment restrictions to fishing quotas to national bans on fishing and trade." Protective measures have limited effect The FinPrint team is aware of the fact that protective measures for sharks have a limited effect. The researchers are now looking at whether shark recovery requires management of the wider ecosystem to ensure that there is sufficient food for the shark in the reefs. Study is now completed "The study is now complete and we are addressing how the loss of sharks can destabilize the reef ecosystem," said Dr. Mike Heithaus, one of the directors of Global FinPrint and Dean of the Institute of Arts, Science and Education at Florida International University. "At a time when corals are struggling to survive in a changing climate, the loss of reef sharks could have serious long-term consequences for entire reef systems. Baptized in 2015 Global FinPrint was launched in summer 2015. Data was collected using Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). A video camera is placed in front of a standard quantity of bait - a "bait camera". The coral reef ecosystems were monitored by BRUVS in four major regions: Indo-Pacific, Pacific, Western Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean. 15,000 hours of video recordings Over the course of four years, the team produced and analyzed more than 15,000 hours of video recordings in studies of 371 reefs in 58 countries, states and territories around the world.

    <TEXT>English version By agreeing on an economic recovery fund, the EU has sent an important signal of solidarity, capacity to act and far-reaching change. This is the assessment of the results of the EU summit by Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute. This is a major difference to the euro crisis. For at that time only loans were granted, combined with far-reaching conditions. Now the economic recovery of the countries most severely affected by the crisis is being supported by the fund, with transfers flowing virtually unconditionally. Fuest explains: "The EU is thus showing that it is changing profoundly. At the same time, it is giving a leap of faith to the recipient countries". He goes on to say: "However, economic recovery will only work if the affected countries themselves make considerable reform efforts." At the same time, further reforms are needed at EU level: "The EU should become more involved in the provision of European public goods, such as security and defence policy, migration policy and development aid, and shift budgets accordingly</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The head of the Chancellor's Office, Helge Braun (CDU), has reiterated his demand for a state act for the corona victims in Germany and called for the almost 10,000 corona victims not to be forgotten. An act of state would be "a good sign at the end of the pandemic if a safe vaccine is available", Braun told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). The Chancellor's Office Minister warned of sensitivity towards the previous victims and their relatives in the pandemic. "When we talk about how well we have come through the crisis, we must not forget that we already have almost 10,000 corona deaths in Germany, too. There are people who mourn for their family members and friends. They miss these people. When talking about case numbers and economic figures, we must not forget this," Braun told the NOZ. "Unfortunately, getting through the crisis well does not mean getting through it unscathed," the CDU politician continued. Tailwind comes from North Rhine-Westphalia Tailwind for his proposal to hold a state ceremony in Germany as well comes from North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU). "I find the idea basically very sympathetic," Laumann told the NOZ. The Schleswig-Holstein Health Minister Heiner Garg (FDP) can also "definitely imagine" a state act for the corona victims at the end of the pandemic. "With all the efforts to fight the pandemic, grief has fallen by the wayside in many places. We must also remember that many relatives of loved ones were not able to say goodbye to prevent the virus from spreading. An act of state in which we all pause for a moment and jointly remember those who died of the virus would be good for our social cohesion," Garg explained. Many other people are also dying Bremen's mayor Andreas Bovenschulte (SPD), however, was sceptical. He was "not completely" convinced by the idea of an act of state. "Many other people also die every year from illness or suffer fatal accidents. Here too, there is a great deal of human suffering.

    <TEXT>English version Infectiologist Gerd F #228;tkenheuer considers the recent increase in corona numbers to be a "fire hazard" development. The scientist from the University Hospital of Cologne described as a major risk factor "what is currently going on in people's heads". People feel much safer today than they did a quarter of a year ago. "With the sharp drop in the numbers, the dangers that still emanate from the virus are no longer being perceived to the appropriate degree", F #228;tkenheuer told the newspaper "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger". He added that it was still possible to keep the infection under control if all precautions were consistently observed. "Another sharp increase would not be fateful, but rather an expression of our inadequate handling of the pandemic." In this context F #228;tkenheuer praised the introduction of a compulsory test for returnees from risk areas. From a medical point of view this is "absolutely correct". The scientist rejects the term "second wave" F #228;tkenheuer, who has made a major contribution to the development of the Covid-19 drug Remdesivir, rejected talk of a "second wave". "The word 'wave' sounds like something fateful, from which we might escape, but which we can't influence." This is no longer true in the current situation.

    <TEXT>English version Infectiologist Gerd F #228;tkenheuer considers the recent increase in corona numbers to be a "fire hazard" development. The scientist from the University Hospital of Cologne described as a major risk factor "what is currently going on in people's heads". People feel much safer today than they did a quarter of a year ago. "With the sharp drop in the numbers, the dangers that still emanate from the virus are no longer being perceived to the appropriate degree", F #228;tkenheuer told the newspaper "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger". He added that it was still possible to keep the infection under control if all precautions were consistently observed. "Another sharp increase would not be fateful, but rather an expression of our inadequate handling of the pandemic." In this context F #228;tkenheuer praised the introduction of a compulsory test for returnees from risk areas. From a medical point of view this is "absolutely correct". The scientist rejects the term "second wave" F #228;tkenheuer, who has made a major contribution to the development of the Covid-19 drug Remdesivir, rejected talk of a "second wave". "The word 'wave' sounds like something fateful, from which we might escape, but which we can't influence." This is no longer true in the current situation. The pandemic is still out there "The pandemic's not coming back, it's here. We have been and are in the same pandemic, which we have sometimes better, sometimes worse control. The danger, however, is definitely there. And we have to be very careful that we do not, at the latest after the end of the summer with falling temperatures and the shifting of social life into closed rooms, run into a situation that is worse than in March and April," F #228;tkenheuer continues. "The situation becomes uncontrollable" "If you let things go, the situation becomes uncontrollable." This is the bitter lesson and the urgent warning from the comparison with the USA. "We have achieved a lot, but we can also gamble away what we have achieved and our lead. And then it will be extremely difficult to take countermeasures.

    <TEXT>English version According to the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), about 350 German Islamists have returned to Germany from Syria and Iraq, 90 of them to North Rhine-Westphalia: "For more than 100 returnees, there is evidence that they have actively participated in fighting in Syria or Iraq or have been trained for this purpose", a spokeswoman of the Federal Criminal Police Office told the D #252;sseldorf-based newspaper "Rheinische Post". A spokesperson for the NRW interior ministry added that in many cases the returnees pose a considerable danger because they are trained in weapons and have combat experience. "And because they have internalized the violent jihadist ideology and deeply despise our way of life." Some 110 people may still return to their homes According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there are still about 110 persons with NRW connections in the areas formerly controlled by the Islamic state who could return. "Of those, about 50 persons are in camps and prisons in Syria, Iraq or Turkey," said the spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior. According to the security authorities, many German Islamists have died in the fighting. "There are indications that more than 260 people have died in Syria and Iraq; of the deceased, more than 80 people were considered to be in danger," said the BKA spokesperson. According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 80 Islamists from North Rhine-Westphalia are said to have died.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), the outbreak of the corona crisis at the beginning of the current year has brought the positive trend in the labour market integration of refugees to a standstill. "Unfortunately, the corona crisis is having a very bad effect on the employment of refugees: They are the group on the labour market that is most affected by redundancies," said IAB migration researcher Herbert Br #252;cker to the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post" newspaper. This is because refugees often pursued occupations that could not be done in the home office, such as security services or jobs in the catering trade. "In addition, they had only been employed for a short time or only had temporary contracts," said Br #252;cker. Until the outbreak of the Corona crisis, however, the employment of refugees had risen steadily. About half of the refugees have a job "If you ask me: Is the Merkel sentence 'We can do this' correct from today's perspective? If I say: Yes, until the outbreak of the Corona crisis we were really on a very good way to integrate the 1.2 million refugees into the labour market faster than in the past," said Br #252;cker. "The fundamentally positive trend has continued until the end of 2019, i.e. before the outbreak of the corona crisis. After five years, around half of those who fled to us in 2013 to 2016 have a job," explained the IAB researcher</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Germany's largest tourism group Tui considers the travel warning issued for the whole of Mallorca to be wrong. This was said by Thomas Ellerbeck, the group's manager responsible for politics and communication, to the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". "We regret that Germany has now issued a travel warning for the whole of Mallorca. A regional travel warning for Palma, Magaluf or other places with increased cases would have been better," he said. He adds: "Most holidaymakers are very responsible and stick to the rules." The blanket warning is also questionable because large parts of the island are only minimally affected by the pandemic. There has not been an incident at any Tui hotel in Mallorca. The company and also the German Travel Association (DRV) said they hoped the travel warning would end soon.</TEXT>

This investment may be justified in the crisis, but it should also be terminated quickly after the crisis," he told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". At the same time, Wambach, who is also President of the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), welcomed the fact that Curevac has gone public on the US stock exchange despite the state participation: "It is good that Curevac has stuck to its plans for an IPO in the US and has successfully carried it out. A state participation should not result in companies being prevented from making sensible business decisions".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Greenpeace activists have documented a methane leak in the British sector of the North Sea caused by the oil and gas industry on board the ship Esperanza, using a remote-controlled underwater robot to film two of the gas-emitting craters (diameter: 50 and 15 metres respectively) on the seabed at a depth of about 100 metres. Caused by an uncontrolled gas eruption during a drilling of Mobil North Sea (today Exxon Mobil) 30 years ago, the leak still emits large amounts of the highly effective greenhouse gas, which is 28 times more harmful to the climate than carbon dioxide. Regardless of such serious accidents, methane leaks from drilling for oil and gas are common. Drilling platform has long disappeared "The drilling platform has long since disappeared, but massive amounts of climate-damaging methane have been bubbling out of the seabed here for decades. Nobody wants to take responsibility, it's a scandal," says Greenpeace marine biologist Sandra Sch #246;ttner. "We are in the midst of a climate crisis, but the oil and gas industry is constantly drilling more holes in the seabed and politicians are looking the other way - this must stop! Around 15,000 boreholes in the North Sea Independent scientists estimated in 2015 that up to 90 liters of methane per second will escape at this point. According to current scientific studies, between 8,000 and 30,000 tons of methane are released annually from the approximately 15,000 boreholes in the North Sea. In addition, 72,000 tons of methane are already released into the atmosphere each year during normal operation of the platforms in the North Sea, as a recent Greenpeace report shows. [https://act.gp/Nordsee]. The platforms also pollute our climate with 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, 110,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides, 78,000 tonnes of volatile organic compounds and 3,771 tonnes of sulphur dioxide.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Pediatricians sound the alarm: in the corona crisis, they observe an increase in physical and above all psychological complaints. School and kindergarten closures as well as restrictions on contact put a particular strain on the psyche of their young patients, according to the conclusion of the physicians.89 percent observe an increase in psychological problems. 37 percent diagnosed an increase in physical complaints. These are the results of the study "Homeschooling und Gesundheit 2020" by pronova BKK, for which 150 paediatricians in private practice were surveyed. According to the experience gained during consultation hours, children and adolescents aged six years and older are particularly affected. An increase in behavioural changes such as listlessness or withdrawal, but also irritability and anxiety disorders is observed by every second paediatrician. 46 percent report increased aggressive behaviour, 45 percent sleep disorders. Abdominal pain, depression, headaches and concentration problems have also become more frequent. Children suffer from corona restrictions Paediatricians see the reason for the increase in complaints in the restrictions in daily life during the corona crisis. Children were severely affected, and the cuts in their daily lives were considerable. A majority of the physicians felt that the lack of recreational opportunities such as sports in clubs (70 percent) and too much time on the screen of mobile phones and computers (69 percent) had particularly serious consequences. Added to this was the lack of a daily structure (69 percent) as a result of the closure of kindergartens and schools and conflicts in the families (67 percent). 66 percent of the pediatricians speak of isolation of their young patients. Lack of opportunities for retreat The cramped conditions at home, the lack of retreat possibilities and the transmission of fears from parents to the child also caused the offspring problems, as more than every second paediatrician noted. "Only the resumption of routine appointments and the return to schools and daycare centres should bring to light the full extent of the problems that have arisen for children and young people," says Dr. Gerd Herold, consultant doctor at pronova BKK. Signs of developmental delays in adolescents "Not only the adults, but also the children have experienced the first months of the Corona crisis as an exceptional situation and have often found it disturbing or even threatening. It is now up to the adults to accompany and support the children in coping with these experiences," says Herold. The effects of corona restrictions on children could leave even deeper traces: Almost four out of ten paediatricians observe signs of developmental delays in their patients, which they attribute to the corona crisis. Motor skills particularly affected In the case of motor skills, children between six and nine years of age are particularly affected; in the case of cognitive skills, the delays affect children between three and thirteen years of age. The physicians assume that the reasons for the difficulties are again too much media consumption, excessive demands on the parents and lack of contact with peers. More children need medical help This has direct consequences for the practices: 54 percent of paediatricians expect that more children will need help from occupational and physiotherapists; 43 percent expect that they will need to be referred to psychotherapists more often. "It will only be possible to estimate the full extent of the corona consequences for children's health in the coming months," says Herold. 57 percent of the pediatricians surveyed say that many preventive examinations and vaccinations were postponed during the corona crisis. "Only the resumption of routine appointments, but also the return to schools and day-care centres should bring to light any problems that have arisen in children and young people," says Herold</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Despite its involvement in the Wirecard scandal, the German government still intends to commission the consulting firm Ernst  amp; Young (EY). This emerges from a response of the Federal Government to a minor question of the Left parliamentary group, which is exclusively available to the Tagesspiegel. At present, the auditing company Apas is investigating EY for its audit of Wirecard's balance sheets. "However, the professional supervision proceedings in connection with the audits of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements of Wirecard AG have not yet been concluded," writes Ulrich Nu #223;baum, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics in the reply. The initiation of such proceedings alone "does not yet constitute a reason for the Federal Government to examine the existence of a reason for exclusion before awarding public contracts". EY has been auditing the consolidated balance sheets of the insolvent Dax company for years and has not found any irregularities until this year. Apas has therefore been auditing the work of EY since October 2019. Decision of the Federal Government not comprehensible "In view of the Wirecard scandal, it is incomprehensible that the Federal Government is awarding contracts to these auditors by private contract despite APAS' investigations into EY," Fabio De Masi, spokesman for fiscal policy of the Left Party, told the Tagesspiegel. "The extent of freehand awards to EY without a call for tenders by the Ministry of Health brings back unpleasant memories of the McKinsey felt in the Ministry of Defence."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Sch #228;uble, demands more rigour and control from the EU Commission in the allocation of grants and loans in the Corona crisis. "The EU must make it clearer to its member states what it is getting 750 billion euros for and what it is not getting 750 billion euros for," Sch #228;uble told the Neue Westf #228;lische, which is being published in Bielefeld. Even now, the member states would by no means call up all the funds from Brussels, especially not poorer countries, said Sch #228;uble."We therefore need concrete proposals as to how the aid is to be invested in a targeted manner, and stronger monitoring is needed," said the President of the Bundestag.

    <TEXT>English version The German Society for Securities Analysis (DGWA - Finest Financial Engineering) has added the topic of sports investments to its portfolio. The company has now announced this. The DGWA Sportinvest wants in the future sport-interested investors on the one hand and capital-looking for associations as well as enterprises on the other hand in the context of its professional consultation and market expertise together. One focus of DGWA-Sportinvest is professional soccer - by far the most important sport in Europe. Among other things, investors are offered a wide range of opportunities with soccer corporations. How investor-affine the industry is, proves Currently, for example, the IPO of Spielvereinigung Unterhaching and the investment of a major investor in Bundesliga club Hertha BSC Berlin. The fact that Deutsche B #246;rse AG and Deutsche Bank are active as sponsors of Eintracht Frankfurt can also be seen as a clear sign in this direction. The DGWA-Sportinvest focuses on ambitious traditional clubs (2nd to 4th league) in the German-speaking countries. DGWA-Sportinvest sees great potential and growth opportunities in this segment. Ambitious start-ups in the industry Further options for investors are offered by ambitious start-ups across the entire breadth of the sport, among others. In the course of the increasing digitalization of the sports industry, more and more young companies are entering the market with innovative ideas and products. These include, for example, tech products for golf and soccer training as well as special tech apps for the rental of sports equipment and e-sports games. Rapidly growing markets in the sports sector In addition to the rapidly growing eSports sector, the topic of sports betting also has enormous growth potential worldwide. With its broad expertise, DGWA-Sportinvest also supports investments in medium-sized sporting goods manufacturers and other sports and sports segments with potential. Background sports market The Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) together with the Federal Institute for Sports Science presented figures on the German sports market. The sport-related contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the industry is currently around 72 billion euros. In total, expenditure on all sports consumption in Germany amounted to 85 billion euros. Of this amount, 32.7% was spent on products of the manufacturing industry and 32.6% on services. Looking at the value-added shares of various economic sectors in Germany, sport, at 2.2%, is roughly on a par with the producing metal industry (2.1%) and the transport sector (2.4%). In this context it should be mentioned that the global potential of the sports industry is huge and far from being fully tapped. We continue to assume that there will be major catch-up effects in the sports industry after the corona pandemic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version German exporters have become somewhat more cautious. Industry's ifo export expectations fell from 7.5 to 5.1 points in AugustThe German export industry is doing relatively well in view of the difficult economic situation in many consumer countries. After a very strong increase in the previous month, export expectations in the automotive industry have fallen. However, manufacturers are still planning to achieve significant growth. The chemical industry also suffered a setback. In the mechanical engineering sector, the export crisis appears to have been overcome, and further declines are not expected for the time being. Greater optimism in foreign business was evident in the electrical sector. The same applies to manufacturers of metal products</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version What is professional soccer currently doing for climate protection? The non-profit organization myclimate has been investigating this central question. All 18 clubs in the first men's soccer league, season 2019/2020, were randomly surveyed. With the results of their research, the climate protection consultants provide a snapshot of the efforts of top German soccer. 15 Bundesliga clubs took part in the survey. "The focus of our survey was specifically on the issues that are most important in the ecological balance sheet of a professional soccer club. In other words, mobility, energy, catering, merchandising and waste. We also asked whether the clubs regularly carry out a CO2 balance sheet. We summarized the answers in a graphic," explains Stefan Baumeister, Managing Director of myclimate Germany. Climate protection has long since arrived in soccer The inventory shows that the topic of climate protection has long since arrived in professional soccer. All the clubs are aware that they also bear an ecological responsibility and have already implemented a large number of corresponding measures. In most cases they document this on their website. The clubs are also aware that the topic of climate protection is very extensive and must be considered in all business activities without exception. Against this background, it is also clear that the Bundesliga clubs are far from having exhausted their potential for improvement. The overriding goal: to achieve the goal jointly defined by the United Nations of limiting global warming to well below 2  #176;C. Clubs enjoy enormous public interest "The Bundesliga clubs enjoy enormous public interest. They therefore have a particularly great responsibility. The clubs can use their charisma to set an example for society and the economy in many areas - including climate protection. The German government's goal of becoming completely climate-neutral by 2050 affects us all. So it also applies to professional football clubs. It is crucial that the clubs realize their full potential. Because CO2 emissions should first and foremost be avoided and reduced," says Baumeister. The survey results in detail 60 percent of the clubs surveyed already calculate their CO2 footprint, according to their own statements, from which those responsible at the soccer clubs could read off very precisely how many tons of CO2 are produced in the areas of mobility, energy, catering, etc. Such an analysis always forms the foundation for effective climate protection. Because: Only what is analyzed can be managed and controlled. Category Mobility The mobility sector is the most important factor in the overall result of all CO2 emissions generated by a soccer club. Here, all teams consistently state that on match days the stadium ticket can also be used for free travel by public transport. The travel behavior of the professional clubs themselves presents a less homogeneous picture. It is true that the majority of clubs, with a share of 67 percent, did not attend training camps or test matches outside Europe last year. However, BVB, Borussia M #246;nchengladbach, Hertha BSC, SV Werder Bremen and Vfl Wolfsburg also travelled further afield. "A training camp with guest appearances in the USA may make economic sense for many clubs, but it places an additional burden on the climate. Therefore, the shorter the journey and the lower-emission means of transportation, the better - even if Borussia Dortmund and Vfl Wolfsburg claim to have compensated for their team trips," Baumeister classifies. Energy Category When it comes to energy production, ten soccer companies state that their stadium's power requirements are already covered 91-100 percent by renewable energies. All others are still well below this figure. Since the switch to certified green electricity can be made without great effort, this is probably one of the most easily changed, but at the same time also one of the biggest levers for improving the climate balance. In addition, six clubs have a certified environmental/energy management system. This provides them with a tool for systematically recording and continuously improving environmental effects and energy consumption. Category Catering Organic bratwursts look in vain for hungry people in most stadiums. Only Wolfsburg was able to answer this question with a "yes" at the moment. "Because with meat products the organic seal primarily stands for a more species-appropriate attitude, it is important to additionally ensure that the product ingredients also originate from the region," Baumeister said. For food the standard applies: organic and regional - not either/or, but at the same time. However, vegan and vegetarian dishes from the region are the most climate-friendly. The question of draught beer also focused on the topic of regionalism. In the case of the popular hop drink, in addition to the raw materials and the production process, the transport route plays a significant role in the greenhouse gas emissions produced. On average, the Bundesliga clubs obtain their beer from a brewery located about 90 km from the stadium. FC Augsburg, Fortuna D #252;sseldorf and SV Werder Bremen reduce this average considerably and bring it within a distance of only 5 km to the brewery of their choice. Other clubs, on the other hand, buy their beer from breweries located well over 100 km away from the stadium. Category Merchandising There is nothing else that players and fans can use to express their affiliation with their soccer club to the outside world better than team jerseys. But myclimate wanted to find out from the first division clubs where these are produced and found out: Only three clubs obtain their jerseys from European production. The vast majority of the soccer companies use textile products from outside Europe, such as from India, for example - which causes higher transport emissions in comparison. After all, 73% of the clubs participating in the survey offer textile goods in their fan stores with an environmental label that, according to their own statements, also takes climate protection into account. "When it comes to fan merchandise and merchandising, German professional soccer clubs have a great deal of influence in placing the issue of sustainability and climate protection with their partners, outfitters and suppliers. What is already common practice in other areas of the economy could still take German professional soccer to a new level," says Baumeister. Waste Category Unfortunately, large quantities of waste are inseparably linked to major events such as Bundesliga soccer matches. Especially mountains of discarded cups have been an integral part of stadiums for many years. The myclimate survey shows that the majority of clubs have switched to returnable cup systems, which generally have a better CO2 balance than disposable cups. Many clubs make sure that the returnable cups do not have to travel far for rinsing in order to reduce transport distances. Borussia M #246;nchengladbach even states that the cups are washed directly in the stadium. Borussia Dortmund is the only club that relies on a cup mix of reusable and recycled PET disposable cups. Conclusion The random Bundesliga survey by myclimate shows that the professional soccer clubs are already making progress in terms of sustainability - and that is a good thing. On the other hand, there is still room for improvement at all clubs. myclimate therefore advises all Bundesliga clubs to systematically address the topic of climate protection and to carry out an annual CO2 balance. This is the only way for the clubs to obtain an individual and comprehensive overall picture of the complex issue of their own CO2 footprint. myclimate would like to ask the clubs at regular intervals what progress the Bundesliga clubs will make in the individual categories in the coming years</TEXT>

A turnaround is imminent on the German labor market. After layoffs in recent months, the first signals for new hires have now appeared. In industry, the barometer has risen significantly. Nevertheless, more companies still want to lay off employees than hire them. In the service sector there are first signs of new hires. Especially in the IT sector new employees are being sought. The retail sector continues to be reluctant to recruit new staff and is expecting layoffs as a tendency. Only in the construction industry is there currently little momentum in employment growth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The legendary US entrepreneur, billionaire and former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, is one of the most important financiers of the German start-up scene. According to information from the business magazine Capital and the finance portal Finance Forward, Bloomberg is the major financier behind the London fund Hedosophia, which in turn holds shares in young German showpiece companies such as the banking app N26 and the long-distance bus provider Flixbus. This reveals one of the biggest secrets of the start-up scene. Earlier this year, Finance Forward reported on the London investment firm Hedosophia and its founder Ian Osborne. Largely unnoticed by the public, the fund has become one of the most important global Fintech financiers in recent years. However, it remained unclear for a long time who the financiers behind Hedosophia are. Close connection between Osborne and Bloomberg Insiders confirmed the close connection between Osborne and Bloomberg: The 37-year-old Briton advised him during his time as mayor, and in the following years he built up a top-class network in politics and business. His contacts included Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former British Prime Minister David Cameron. Start-up fund is one billion dollars Eight years ago, Osborne finally set up his own start-up fund, Hedosophia, which is now worth more than $1 billion. Bloomberg contributed part of the money to the project. According to Forbes, the founder of the media and software service Bloomberg has assets of 55 billion dollars. In November, he applied for the Democratic presidential candidacy, spending around $1 billion on it within a few weeks, but he was unable to win the primary elections.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Biochemists and virologists from Goethe University Frankfurt and University Hospital Frankfurt have now for the first time taken a complete picture of all communication pathways of a human cell infected by SARS-CoV-2 and observed the changes triggered by the virus attack. For this purpose, they analyzed the totality of all proteins that carry a phosphorus group in a snapshot, the so-called phospho-proteome. The result: The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to use signaling pathways of the host cell in particular, in which a growth signal is transmitted into the cell from outside. If these signaling pathways are disrupted, the virus can no longer multiply. Dr. Christian M #252;nch from the Institute of Biochemistry II at Goethe University explains: "The signaling pathways of growth factors can be blocked directly where the signal from outside the cell docks to a signal receiver - a growth factor receptor. However, there are a number of very effective cancer drugs that interrupt growth factor signaling pathways slightly deeper in the cascade, thereby blocking signals from different growth factor receptors. We have tested five of these drugs on our cells, and all five led to a complete halt in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Experiments on cultured cells in the laboratory Professor Jindrich Cinatl from the Institute of Medical Virology at Frankfurt University Hospital explains: "We performed our experiments on cultured cells in the laboratory. So the results cannot be transferred to humans without further testing. However, by studying other infectious viruses, we know that viruses often alter signaling pathways in their human host cells and that this is important for virus replication. At the same time, drugs that have already been approved have a tremendous developmental advantage, so that based on our results and fewer further experiments, clinical trials could be started very quickly. Scientists have patented processes Innovectis has patented the method of interrupting signaling pathways with certain inhibitors to treat COVID-19 disease. Innovectis was founded in 2000 as a subsidiary of the Goethe University Frankfurt and since then has been operating successfully as a service provider for the transfer of academic know-how into commercial practice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version As head of the House of Hohenzollern, Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia criticized the protests in front of the Reichstag, abusing the insignia of the German Empire. In an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung", the descendant of Emperor Wilhelm II declared that he had "for many years advocated that we should consciously confront our history, including all its bright and dark sides, so that its interpretation would not one day be left to those who would try to instrumentalize it for their own ideological purposes". The events of the past weekend have now sadly brought to light the consequences of a lack of historical awareness, explained the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II. At the demonstration of general corona skeptics, but also of citizens of the Reich and right-wing extremists, the black, white and red flag of the German Empire was often seen, and occasionally the Reich war flag. Both are legal symbols, but are associated with right-wing radicalism. Posters and appeals could be seen There were also posters and appeals showing Wilhelm II. In addition, citizens of the Reich regularly raised the question of whether George Frederick Prince of Prussia could play a role at the head of a newly formed German state. "Together we people are calling back our King of Prussia, His Royal Highness Prince George Frederick of Hohenzollern, who is German Emperor," was one of the statements made in a call for demonstrations from Bavaria.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version While elsewhere the largest Tech-IPO wave since the turn of the millennium is rolling, in this country one of the few heavyweights in the sector, which is already underrepresented in the financial center, is announcing its role backwards. Rocket Internet, whose going public was once celebrated as an "icebreaker" and "beacon", is providing a completely different signal with its announced withdrawal from the stock market. As usual, the founder and main shareholder Oliver Samwer, never at a loss for a full-bodied saying, is not lacking in chutzpah. The compensation offer at the minimum price of 18.57 euros is a slap in the face for the free float, which after all makes up around 45 percent of the share capital and which, for the most part, is likely to have only made a loss with this investment. Because the Rocket share, placed at the upper end of the bookbuilding range at 42.50 Euro, already fell by around 10 percent on the day of the initial listing and, after a short-winded initial recovery rally, only knew one direction, namely south. In any case, the start-up company, hyped as a "beacon" for the technology segment on the local stock exchange, never paid dividends. Poverty testimony for banks that accompany the emmision The IPO of the Internet company was thus also a poor show for the issuing banks, which completely disregarded conventional standards in pricing. In fact, the share price development can hardly come as a surprise, considering that the "Internet incubator" was valued at EUR 6 billion at the start of the stock market, even though the investment portfolio was only worth EUR 2.6 billion at the same time. The management then lacked the ingenuity to close the fantasy gap. Instead, after a few successful exits - including Delivery Hero - Samwer revealed an undisguised lack of ideas about new investment opportunities. Instead, the Rocket management sat more or less helplessly in front of the full cash box and indulged in share buybacks and strategically unclear, especially short-lived investments. Inglorious end to a stock market story The inglorious end of this stock market story is marked by the blatant announcement that, firstly, the public capital market is not really needed for corporate financing and, secondly, that business can be conducted more efficiently without the need for tiresome publicity. This is a truly disconcerting realization for an MDax company, which once again puts the quality of the blue chips in the financial center in a dubious light.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The number of short-time workers in Germany fell to 4.6 million in August from 5.6 million in July. This is the result of exclusive calculations and estimates by the Ifo Institute based on its economic survey. The proportion of employees subject to social security contributions thus shrank from 17 to 14 percent. "The decline was comparatively strong in trade, the hotel and restaurant industry and other economic services, but much smaller in industry," says Ifo labor market expert Sebastian Link. According to the estimate, the number of short-time workers in industry fell only slightly from 2.1 to 1.9 million people, i.e. from 30 to 27 percent of the workforce. For example, an estimated 465,000 people in the metal industry were still on short-time work in August, after 509,000 in July. The proportion shrank from 45 to 41 percent of the workforce. Short-time work in figures In vehicle construction, the number fell from 423,000 to 347,000 and the share from 38 to 31 percent. In mechanical engineering, it fell from 378,000 to 336,000 people, and the share dropped from 35 to 31 percent. In the electrical industry, 234,000 people are now on short-time work, compared to 271,000 in July. The share of employment was 29 percent, after 34 percent in July. Short-time work fell sharply at service providers Short-time work at service providers fell much more sharply. In the hospitality industry, the number of short-time workers fell from 465,000 to 377,000 people, which still represents 34 percent. In July, the figure was 42 percent. In transport and warehousing it remained stable at 256,000, or 14 percent. In other economic services there was a decline from 603,000 to 457,000, i.e. from 26 to 20 percent of the workforce. The number of short-time workers also continued to fall sharply in the retail sector, from 637,000 to 414,000. In the retail sector, the number of employees fell from 240,000 to 104,000, a drop from 10 to 4 percent of the workforce.

    <TEXT>English version World Medical Director Frank Ulrich Montgomery supports demands for a reduction in the isolation time in the event of suspected corona, but considers a seven-day period to be necessary: "The reduction in the isolation time makes sense. Potentially infected persons could be released to freedom after seven days instead of the previous 14 days", said the chairman of the World Medical Association in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). Five days after the start of isolation, a PCR test must be carried out. As a rule, the results are obtained two days later at the latest, so that if the decision is negative, the isolation can be ended "Although there is a residual risk of one to two percent after seven days. But that is acceptable, and we can accept that, because we don't want to lose the acceptance of the population," said Montgomery.</TEXT>

Abandonment of corona mass testing in people without symptoms The world medical chief thus supports the proposal of Charit #233; chief virologist Christian Drosten for a shorter isolation period, as several health politicians have already done. Drosten even considers a reduction to five days possible. With it he goes "up to the pain threshold of epidemiology", he had said on the NDR Podcast. Montgomery reiterated his demand to refrain from mass testing of people without symptoms, but instead to send all persons who have returned from corona risk areas or had contact with infected persons to domestic isolation. "That would be much wiser," said the doctor, also in view of the limited resources of the test laboratories</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The left-wing faction in the Bundestag warns in sharp form against hypocrisy in the discussion about sanctions after the poison attack on the Kremlin critic Alexei Nawalny. The former parliamentary party leader Sahra Wagenknecht explained to the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" that anyone who demands an end to the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline with reference to Nawalny must evaluate all other raw material suppliers to Germany according to the same criteria and demand consequences there too. Wagenknecht stressed that poisoning an opposition politician with the nerve poison Novichok was a heinous crime. "But even if the Kremlin should be responsible for it (for which there is no evidence so far), it is no more heinous than beheading or whipping opposition members to death, as is common practice in Saudi Arabia, from which we obtain oil. Nor is it any more heinous than shredding innocent civilians with drones, as the United States, which supplies us with its fracking gas, has done in well over a thousand cases. Politicians call for a halt to construction In Berlin, more and more politicians are calling for a halt to the construction work on Nord Stream 2 or are threatening to do so, including representatives of the CDU/CSU and the Greens as well as Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. "In any case, I hope that the Russians will not force us to change our position on Nord Stream 2," Maas told the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag". However, Maas also admitted that stopping the almost completed pipeline would also harm German and European companies: "Anyone who demands this must be aware of the consequences. More than 100 companies from twelve European countries are involved in Nord Stream 2, about half of them from Germany". Treated at the Charit #233; hospital in Berlin since the end of August Nawalny has been undergoing treatment at the Berlin Charit #233; hospital since August 22, after he collapsed two days earlier during a flight in Russia. The German government has stated that Nawalny was "without doubt" poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the so-called Novichok group. It is already discussing possible sanctions against Russia with its EU partners. The government in Moscow, however, denies Russia's involvement in the poisoning of the 44-year-old opposition member.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Cologne poverty researcher Christoph Butterwegge sees increasing injustice in Germany due to the corona pandemic. "Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the economic effects of the lockdown it caused on large parts of public life, and the distributional imbalance of most state aid measures, the gap between rich and poor has recently widened even further," writes Butterwegge in a guest article for the "K #246;lner Stadt-Anzeiger" newspaper. Companies with high turnover in any case, such as Amazon or Zalando, but also discounters like Aldi and Lidl have profited from the crisis. "The groups most severely affected by the pandemic, on the other hand, were only marginally considered in the economic and crisis management package, if at all. Among the main sufferers are the homeless, residents of shared accommodation, refugees, people with disabilities, people in need of care, addicts, prostitutes and unemployment benefit recipients. The depressing conclusion was: "The rich got richer in the Corona crisis and the poor got more numerous. Poor more affected by the pandemic The poor are also more affected by the pandemic in terms of health. "The risk of infection for the unemployed, the poor and the socially disadvantaged is significantly higher than for the rich. Socially caused pre-existing conditions such as obesity, asthma, diabetes mellitus, rheumatism or COPD (smoker's lung), catastrophic working conditions (e.g. in the meat industry) as well as cramped and hygienically precarious living conditions increased the risk of both a Sars-CoV-2 infection and a severe Covid-19 disease course.

    <TEXT>English version In connection with the Corona protests, the head of the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Burkhard Freier, warns against "individual terrorism". "This group of people obviously has the feeling that they are being threatened. And they want someone to finally do something about the alleged threat. This can lead to individual terrorism - i.e. radicalization without being part of a real-world group," Freier told the "Rheinische Post". "If then the impression is added that you are no longer alone, others think the same way, then this leads to Christchurch, El Paso, to Halle and to Hanau. In these most serious terrorist attacks, a conspiracy ideology was always the main motive in the background," said Freier. That is why the NRW Office for the Protection of the Constitution assumes that the current protests are not just an expression of concern and dissatisfaction because people have the impression that they do not agree with the government's decisions. "Rather, they are protests that also make it clear that there are people who are hostile to democracy and do not share our values. These protests are a sounding board for extremists," said Freier</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The German Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) is pushing for fair wages and minimum wages throughout Europe and warns against placing an additional burden on workers in the Corona crisis. Heil told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung": "The workers who have achieved enormous things during the crisis must not be allowed to foot the bill for overcoming the crisis. We must avoid that people from different member states are played off against each other". Social division weakens the EU, solidarity and cohesion make the EU strong, the SPD politician emphasized. His ministry is organizing an international online conference on "Social Europe" this Wednesday as part of the German EU Council Presidency. The Minister sees a need for action, among other things, on minimum wages within the EU. He criticized: "In 21 member states, the minimum wages are below 60 percent of the average wage. In addition, the wage gap in the EU member states is very large. According to the Labour Minister, strong social partners and collective agreements are the best protection against "indecent wages". For this reason, he said, the EU is not only talking about common criteria for minimum wages, but also about strengthening social partnership. Making even better use of the European Youth Guarantee Heil also advocated making even better use of the European Youth Guarantee instrument. According to this guarantee of the EU member states, young people under 25 are entitled to a job, further training, an apprenticeship or practical training four months after unemployment. According to Heil, the current focus is on getting more young people to participate in the measures and preparing them even better for tomorrow's job market. "This is what we are currently negotiating with the Member States. I am confident that we will achieve a good result in the near future". There was a broad common understanding that social Europe must not be an empty promise, especially for young people. Five million people invested in youth guarantee programs Since 2014, more than five million young people have registered annually in youth guarantee programs, according to a balance sheet of the EU Commission. And further: "Since then, more than 3.5 million of them have accepted job, further education, internship or training offers every year. More than 2.4 million young people in the EU have already received direct support under the program</TEXT>

Presenter Katrin M #252;ller-Hohenstein and expert Per Mertesacker will welcome ZDF viewers from the Allianz Arena in Munich at 8.15 p.m. Reporter Claudia Neumann will take the kick-off at 20.30 hrs. Boris B #252;chler and Gari Paubandt will be available for interviews in the stadium. No easy task for David Wagner's team to start directly at the season opener at the Primus in Munich. Especially since the current quarrels about the cancelled cup match against Schweinfurt are an additional burden for the Schalkers. After their top performances in the recent past, the Bavarians can go into the match relatively relaxed. May Leroy San #233; against its ex-club ran The only question marks are in the line-up: Will Leroy San #233; be allowed to play against his former club, or will Kingsley Coman be used? Is Jerome Boateng fit again after his injury, or is Niklas S #252;le in the starting eleven of coach Hansi Flick? On Saturday, September 19, 2020, "das aktuelle sportstudio" will report on the first matchday of the German Soccer League from 23.30 hrs. Among other things, there will be the first free-TV pictures of the top match on Saturday evening between Borussia Dortmund and Borussia M #246;nchengladbach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version When East German companies were privatized after 1990, the Treuhand sold more productive firms more frequently and more quickly, and received more money in return. At the same time, it was more likely to hand these companies over to West German investors. "Productive GDR companies in particular were less likely to remain in East German ownership," write ifo researchers Lukas Mergele, Moritz Hennicke (Free University of Brussels) and Moritz Lubczyk (ZEW) in a study they have now published in the ifo Schnelldienst. "After Treuhand's main activity was completed in 1995, around 51 percent of the companies, 64 percent of the turnover and 68 percent of the jobs from the GDR state-owned companies analyzed in the sample were in the majority West German hands," Mergele and Lubczyk summarize. The more productive the companies, the higher the proportion of West Germans among the owners. Better access to financial capital The researchers explain this result as follows: "West German investors had better access to financial capital at the time of reunification. They were more experienced in managing market-oriented companies. In addition, they were probably also economically and politically better networked in relation to investors from eastern Germany. In terms of the criteria set by the Treuhand, West German investors were thus possibly better suited as future company owners. But the redistribution of company ownership from East to West remains to be noted". There were closures of productive firms Regarding the accusations that the Treuhand had handled productive companies, the researchers write: "There were certainly closures of productive companies. However, our results show that more productive companies were closed less frequently". Among the least productive firms, the Treuhand privatized less than 40 percent. Among the most productive, this share rose to over 70 percent. On average, the Treuhand also achieved higher employment and investment commitments for more productive companies, the researchers continue. On the basis of the available data, however, it cannot be determined that the Treuhand achieved the best possible result for the public sector in negotiations with potential investors.</TEXT>

"We need players who take responsibility, not only for the playing, but also emotionally, players who drive the others and show that they are determined to win," Vogts said in an interview with the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". One such player for him is Joshua Kimmich. For Vogts, the Bayern professional could become one of the dominant German players of the next few years - like record national player Lothar Matthias in his day. "If Kimmich stays healthy, he can be one like Lothar, he can come very close to the role Lothar played. In his way, he reminds me of Lothar, who always wanted to take over the game and lead a team - and openly demanded it," Vogts continued</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Rap star Capital Bra was addicted to the painkiller Tilidin. In an interview with the research format STRG_F (NDR/funk) he reports how he came into contact with the prescription drug at the age of 15. "The first time was the worst crash," says the rapper. He vomited for two days and lay in bed. After that, he regularly consumed Tilidin. "You don't go rocking at 15, one of you gets grass, one gets Tilidin, then you just chill all day. And every day from the beginning." After all, he was an addict. "You can't go without. You sit there like a cracked junkie." In the future he wanted to rap less about drugs in his songs. Capital Bra mentions the calming, but also euphoric and disinhibiting pain medication most often in his songs of all German rap artists. Since 2016 he has made it the subject of 16 songs. Now he wants to warn against Tilidin. He never wanted to portray it as cool, but only showed how he lives. Because it was the cheapest drug for him, he had regularly consumed Tilidin in his youth. "Imagine you have no money, you are in Hohensch #246;nhausen. You all hang out together. Everyone has a little bit of change in their pockets." Helped to repress stress At the beginning of his rap career, Tilidin helped him to suppress stress. "All of a sudden you're a rap star," he says. "We took this to get by. Because everything is too much, everyone takes photos." Tilidin has calmed him down during this time. But then the situation came to a head, according to him. "At some point, it will also go on your head. When you no longer have control over something, it's shit", says Capital Bra. Finally, he decided to stop the drug. It had been a catastrophe. "The first two days you think it's bad, but then it gets bad. If you hold out for a month, you have made it. "I also wanted to pick up my children from kindergarten. I didn't want to be foggy or whatever." Tilidin is considered a rap drug Tilidine is considered a rap drug. Numerous artists glorify the painkiller in their texts. At the same time as the hype, Tilidin prescriptions have risen 30-fold within two years among those in the 15 to 20-year-old age group with statutory health insurance. Many songs that focus on Tilidin were also released in this period from 2017. Even if the connection is not clear, fans emphasize that they want to be closer to their idols through consumption. "This feeling is definitely not cool," says Capital Bra. "It certainly doesn't. You're not getting closer to me." And he appeals to possible imitators: "If you want to try it and be cool, you should try it. But he is fucked after it. You definitely have to know that for sure."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Producers of medical products must not make unreasonable profits from the Corona crisis, demand Caritas international as the aid agency of the German Caritas Association, the Information Office Peru, Misereor and the Archdiocese of Freiburg as well as another 30 non-governmental organizations and partnership groups. Rather, companies must live up to their social responsibility and must not, for example through their pricing policies, deepen social inequalities in societies. "Regardless of their financial means, all people must have the chance to survive the Corona crisis unscathed," demands Claudio Moser, Head of Unit for Latin America and Europe at Caritas international. The German-American company Linde, which produces and sells medical and industrial oxygen worldwide, is particularly in focus. In an open letter, Caritas international, the relief organization of the German Caritas Association, the Peru Information Center and the other signatories appeal to the company to improve the supply of medical oxygen to the Peruvian population and, above all, to make it economically affordable for all those affected. Peru is the worst affected Despite an early lockdown, Peru is one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. According to official figures, 744,400 people were infected with the virus on September 18, 2020. 31,051 people have died from or because of the virus. With 2,268 infected persons per 100,000 inhabitants*, the infection rate is the second highest in America and the mortality rate with 95 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants* is now the highest worldwide. Lack of medical oxygen Among many other problems, this is also due to the great lack of medical oxygen, the necessary equipment and the extremely high prices for oxygen. Peruvian hospitals have to send patients home because they have no or too little oxygen equipment and oxygen. Claudio Moser: "Then the families themselves have to get oxygen to enable the simplest possible ventilation. And this at prices that people often cannot afford". According to reports, a 10-cubic meter bottle costs the equivalent of 42 euros. Two such bottles are needed every day by people suffering from severe Covid-19 disease. That makes around 560 euros per week - twice the monthly minimum wage in Peru. Local suppliers had to give up Since 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Health has prescribed a purity level of 99% for medical oxygen. The consequence: local suppliers had to give up. Since then, Linde and the US company AirProducts control the market. The fact that the government has now withdrawn the regulation in the Corona crisis has not changed the basic problem. Companies should change business practices The Peru Observatory and Caritas international, as well as the other signatories, are calling on the company to change its business practices in light of the Corona crisis: "Linde must live up to its social responsibility and significantly reduce the price of medical oxygen," demands Annette Brox, Managing Director of the Peru Observatory. The company should do everything possible to ensure an adequate supply of medical oxygen in Peru.</TEXT>

According to reports, a 10-cubic meter bottle costs the equivalent of 42 euros. Two such bottles are needed every day by people suffering from severe Covid-19 disease. That makes around 560 euros per week - twice the monthly minimum wage in Peru. Local suppliers had to give up Since 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Health has prescribed a purity level of 99% for medical oxygen. The consequence: local suppliers had to give up. Since then, Linde and the US company AirProducts control the market. The fact that the government has now withdrawn the regulation in the Corona crisis has not changed the basic problem. Companies should change business practices The Peru Observatory and Caritas international, as well as the other signatories, are calling on the company to change its business practices in light of the Corona crisis: "Linde must live up to its social responsibility and significantly reduce the price of medical oxygen," demands Annette Brox, Managing Director of the Peru Observatory. The company should do everything possible to ensure an adequate supply of medical oxygen in Peru.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) wants to prepare Germany for a possible further increase in the number of corona infections with fever outpatient clinics, a new testing strategy and special protection for risk groups. "We need regional and local so-called fever outpatient clinics in the fall, to which patients with classic respiratory symptoms such as corona and influenza can turn," Spahn told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post" newspaper. Spahn emphasized that he was counting on the associations of panel physicians to offer such central contact points on site. "Conceptually, they already exist - ideally they should be accessible nationwide in autumn. Spahn intends to take his time until mid-October to further develop the test strategy. "It is crucial that we continue to develop our test and quarantine strategy for the fall and winter on a sound and careful basis. I think that, in consultation with the federal states, this will rather take until mid-October," said the Minister. He pointed out that a redefinition of the test strategy is already underway. The free tests for travel returnees have been completed. Spahn also announced: "In October, the Federal Ministry of the Interior will adjust the requirements for the quarantine period for returnees from risk areas. Rapid antigen tests part of the strategy In addition, rapid antigen tests should become part of the test strategy. "This would be a qualitative step forward." Spahn further explained that the test capacities had been increased enormously. "In the last four weeks alone, about one third of all tests since the beginning of the pandemic have been performed. According to Spahn, there should be a separate strategy for the risk groups. "It is important that we continue to provide special protection for the particularly affected risk groups and sharpen the concepts for this in everyday life," said the Minister. "For this reason, preventive row tests in sensitive areas such as nursing homes will become a fixed component of the testing strategy for autumn and winter. There we must prevent the virus from entering the home. The highest level of vigilance is still required.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Integration warns the member states not to underestimate the ageing of the population. "Not all countries in the Community are as well equipped for demographic development as they should be," Nicolas Schmit told the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". He emphasized: "Ageing presents us with major challenges because it is associated with high costs. It would be irresponsible to underestimate this".In order to improve the sustainability of social security and pension systems "the states should look more at each other and be open to good solutions. But sometimes I miss the willingness to learn from each other within the EU," the EU Social Affairs Commissioner told the "NOZ". Competitive economy is necessary The EU Commissioner for Social Affairs sees immigration as a way to defuse the trend. "If, as a result of the demographic development, there are no longer enough skilled and unskilled workers available, this will put a strain on the economy. And without a competitive economy, the social systems are no longer sustainable. For economic reasons alone, Europe needs managed and targeted immigration," the Luxembourger affirmed. Taking fears of foreign infiltration seriously Nevertheless, the fears of alienation that exist in parts of the population must be taken seriously. "A policy that does not do this will fail. This makes a structured immigration policy and successful integration all the more important," said Schmit. In terms of integration, he sees "in almost all EU countries there is still a great deal of catching up to do". In an interview with the "NOZ", Schmit went on to say: "If integration, including integration into the labor markets, does not work, we will have an enormous social problem, which will cause society to drift further apart. This will become a central task in the coming years. Because it is also clear that we cannot have parallel societies in which people live according to values that are not European values".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The crash of the German economy is less severe than expected. According to the Ifo Institute, it will shrink by 5.2 percent this year. In the summer, the researchers had predicted minus 6.7 percent. "The decline in the second quarter and the recovery at present are going more favorably than we had expected," says Ifo Economic Director Timo Wollmersh #228;user. On the other hand, growth in economic output will be lower next year: The ifo Institute is now expecting 5.1 percent instead of 6.4 percent. In 2022, the ifo Institute expects growth of 1.7 percent."The uncertainty in the forecasts is very high because nobody knows how the corona pandemic will continue, whether there will be hard brexite after all and whether the trade wars will be settled," says Wollmersh #228;user. 2.7 million unemployed expected this year The number of unemployed will rise from an average of 2.3 million last year to 2.7 million in the current year. Next year, it will fall to 2.6 million and then to 2.5 million in 2022. This means that the rate will increase this year from 5.0 percent to 5.9 percent. In 2021 it will fall to 5.7 percent and in the year after next to 5.5 percent. The government surplus of 52.5 billion euros in 2019 plunges this year to minus 170.6 billion euros because spending is rising drastically and revenues are falling as a result of the economic stimulus package. Next year the deficit will reach 86.9 billion, and in the year after next it will be 68.4 billion. Surplus in the current account declines The much criticized German surplus in the current account (exports, imports, services, transfers) will also fall this year, from 244 billion to 215.4 billion, because exports will decline much faster than imports in 2020. Next year, however, the surplus will rise again to 276.2 billion. In 2022 it will reach 290.1 billion</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The climate protection movement "Fridays For Future" has asked for understanding for their demonstrations planned for Friday despite the Corona crisis. It was a difficult decision to call for a climate strike in the middle of the pandemic, Carla Reemtsma and Nick Heubeck of the movement in Germany told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post" newspaper. "But for us, taking responsibility also means that we cannot wait until the end of one crisis to tackle the other". Nothing draws attention to the climate crisis more impressively than the planet itself: The flames in California, the floods over homes in Southeast Asia, the melting of the Arctic. Despite these obvious consequences of climate change, however, political decision-makers "remain reluctant to act". The willing have no power "Our situation is bizarre: the powerful have no will and the willing have no power," said Reemtsma. The window of opportunity for the target set in the Paris Climate Change Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees is shrinking with every day of inaction. Heubeck warned that this was a crisis whose effects "have never been more dangerous than today". Distance rules are the main task Both are preparing for the strikes to be talked down. "Where for a long time the densely packed crowd was our most important trump card to make ourselves heard, suddenly the observance of distance rules has become our main task.

    <TEXT>English version A double interview with Christian Drosten, head of the Institute of Virology at Charit #233; and speaker at the World Health Summit and Detlev Ganten, president and founder of the World Health Summit. about Covid-19 and the consequences of the pandemic. Professor Drosten, Professor Ganten, what was the biggest surprise for you regarding COVID-19? CHRISTIAN DROSTEN: I never expected that this virus would be so easily transmitted. It was clear to me very quickly that this is a SARS virus, the same species, the same type of virus that I have known for 17 years. But I never thought that this one would behave so completely differently. This is due to a tiny detail in the surface protein of the virus. DETLEV GANTEN: For me, the biggest surprise was right at the beginning, when the virus was still far away. Suddenly, the rapid spread of the virus began - these were not individual cases but clusters. I would never have thought that the virus spread so quickly and that the systems were so overwhelmed with all the catastrophic consequences. After all, we had seen severe waves of influenza, but they were all controllable. What is the most important in the fight against COVID 19? GANTEN: Quite clearly: transparency, cooperation, communication and: education! It is crucial that the population is well and clearly informed so that precautionary measures are understood and followed and no myths are spread. "Education is the best vaccination" - education is the best vaccination. An educated society can deal with such things better, even with false reports. The fact that the educational infrastructure in Germany is so little modern, I think it is a huge disaster. Even worse than the fact that the health authorities have been neglected in the past. DROSTEN: Things have to change in science, too: In Germany, for example, medical research is very cancer-oriented. And infectious diseases are extremely important in medicine, and we are noticing this not only now. We need much more research in this area. Antibiotic resistance is the next big topic. This also affects us in high-performance medicine. We can see how it takes its revenge if we neglect fields of activity that apparently do not affect us. But really only apparently. How can we get COVID-19 under control in the countries of the global south? DROSTEN: From our western perspective, one would say we need a vaccination. But that is not so easy when you think of the global South. The clock is ticking. The spread in such countries is not slow. And we have no idea how many people are infected there. However, it seems that there are relatively few deaths in African countries. There are possibly obvious reasons for this. One is the age profile: the population is simply younger. And for another, the immune system is used to many infections. Worm infections, for example, are universally spread there. They influence the immune system. Although we do not know the exact effect on this particular COVID-19 virus disease, it could be an explanation. Germany currently holds the EU presidency - what role can Germany and Europe play in the global fight against the pandemic? GANTEN: In the current situation, in the increasingly bipolar world with the blocks USA and China, Europe has a decisive role to play. The most important is international, multilateral cooperation, especially with countries that have not always been cooperative in the past. So what is the key to improving global health care? GANTEN: Viruses and other health threats to people know no national borders. Therefore: International structures must be strengthened. We can only act together - with courage, good ideas and across all borders. This also applies to science. How can we ensure that everyone in the world has access to a vaccine? DROSTEN: You have to use existing structures: There are international organizations and programs that have experience in supplying countries of the global South. GANTEN: And the WHO must be strengthened. Europe and Germany are doing this in an exemplary manner. And there is another thing I consider important: international, moral pressure from the scientific community. The academies of science, which advise their respective governments and are heard in public, are particularly good at this. If individual countries then fail to join in, they will ultimately be unable to resist the public pressure. Do you think that more attention will be paid to science in the future? DROSTEN: The credibility of science is currently high, but that can change quickly. At the moment, nobody knows exactly how the epidemic will continue. There is a possibility that despite scientific explanation, the whole thing is no longer so easy to control and that science has simply been too slow with the availability of vaccines, for example. We will only know in the end how science has fared. Because this pandemic is not a scientific phenomenon for the time being, it is a natural disaster. GANTEN: Science will be asked if it is credible. It must therefore take a holistic view of the whole event, i.e. the big picture, and also take an interdisciplinary view: that means not only the virological aspects, but also, for example, the economic, social and political aspects of a pandemic. No one can predict with precision what will happen. Science must take a critical and self-critical approach to problems. And then communicate it in the same way. Christian Drosten does this in an exemplary manner. What is the most important lesson we can learn for the future? DROSTEN: The pandemic is only just beginning. Even for us. We can only speak of lessons from the first wave in Europe. There are huge differences there alone. But what we can already say in any case is that it is relatively important to inform the population well and comprehensively. It can cause great harm if politicians use the dynamics of a pandemic for political messages. This is very difficult - the virus immediately serves the bill. You can see what it does in the USA. In Germany, too, we see the consequences. GANTEN: The message for me is very clear: health is the most important thing for the individual and it is the basis for a functioning society. The economy, culture and all that just doesn't work anymore if what we consider guaranteed is no longer there. I'm not sure whether everyone is really so clear about this. DROSTEN: I don't think so. If you had free wishes - what would they be? DROSTEN: In order to control the situation in the coming months, we have to change things. We need pragmatic decisions. There are already holiday speeches being made about German success, but it is not quite clear where it came from. This success came simply because we reacted about four weeks earlier than other countries. We reacted with exactly the same means as others. We did not do anything particularly well. We just did it earlier. That is why we were successful. We were not successful because our health authorities were better than the French, or because our hospitals are better equipped than the Italian ones. If you carry this over into the fall, you must of course realize that we continue to do nothing better than others. What does that mean? DROSTEN: In Argentina, for example, the spread is very difficult to control despite measures - it's winter there. We should look abroad in Germany in a much more differentiated and precise way. We have to stop talking about things like soccer stadiums. That is really completely misleading. GANTEN:: Of course I would like to have an effective therapy and a vaccine. But I also think it is very important that it finally becomes really clear how vital international and multilateral cooperation is. And I repeat: education, education, education. An educated society understands necessary measures, behaves rationally and does not run into the arms of rat catchers. When can we say that we have done it and can shake hands again? DROSTEN: What does it mean, "one has made it"? Probably when the spread has broken through following an epidemic pattern. That is, when there is no longer a free wave of infection running through the population, but only localized outbreaks that can be controlled. This situation will be reached in different countries at different times. In countries of the global south this could be the case earlier because the age structure is different. In our case, of course, it depends on when there are enough vaccines for the risk groups. So priority on risk groups? DROSTEN: Yes, then we don't need 50 million vaccine doses in Germany. Apart from the expected competition for distribution, it is not so easy to fill so many vaccine doses into bottles and then vaccinate them. Even if the vaccine is there. Even if one or two approved vaccines are available in January, it will all have to be bottled and vaccinated. GANTEN: A vaccine and an effective therapy would indeed be a huge step forward. But one thing must not be forgotten: the other diseases are still there, the many avoidable deaths, for example in cardiovascular diseases or infectious diseases that cannot be controlled when antibiotics are no longer effective. I hope that the lesson we have learned from this Covid-19 pandemic is that we will be better prepared for challenges of this kind in the future. Prevention may cost money - but not being prepared can have dramatic consequences.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach reckons that the corona crisis will affect an entire generation for decades to come - yet he considers the climate crisis to be much more serious. "It is underestimated that world-wide very many humans will suffer very long, also on decades from the Corona consequences. There will be a generation that will remember Corona for a lifetime," Lauterbach told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post. With severe courses of Covid 19, people suffered permanently from lung damage, heart complications, kidney weakness and chronic exhaustion. Lauterbach compared the management of the corona crisis with that of the financial market crisis: "We will overcome it in the existing system. This was a "relative trifle" compared to the climate crisis. "Climate change will change the whole system." This would have more monstrous effects on life, the economy and the world than Corona.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Bosch has developed a new rapid test for its Vivalytic analyzer to detect the SARS CoV-2 pathogen. The test result is reliably determined in 39 minutes - currently no other PCR test worldwide is faster, the company says, and the new rapid test is predestined for decentralized use in mobile test centers at highway rest stops or airports. People tested can obtain a reliable result directly at the place where the sample is taken. The CE-marked test is available in Europe with immediate effect and helps to avoid quarantine periods, relieve the burden on laboratories and make travel and work safer again: "One key to combating the corona pandemic is the rapid detection of sources of infection. That's why it was important for us to make a much faster one possible after our first corona test," says Dr. Volkmar Denner, Chairman of the Board of Management of Robert Bosch GmbH. The PCR singleplex test, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has a sensitivity of 98 percent and a specificity of 100 percent. It was jointly developed by the Bosch subsidiary Bosch Healthcare Solutions and the German biotechnology company R-Biopharm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version At the Corona summit on Tuesday in Berlin, Germany's administrative districts are calling for the establishment of a nationwide upper limit for private parties of less than 50 participants. The current patchwork rug irritates people, said District Assembly President Reinhard Sager in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). Therefore, at least some uniform rules are needed. "Above all, I think a clear upper limit for private celebrations is urgently needed, whether they take place in Munich or Flensburg," said Sager. "Starting from 50 participants, it becomes logistically extremely difficult to track contacts if a Covid positive was among the society. Therefore I plead for an upper limit below 50". Rushing wedding with 150 guests So far there is no uniform limit on the number of participants in private parties, but this will have to be introduced at the summit on Monday. "In Hamm, we can see what a glittering wedding with 150 guests can lead to," said Sager, referring to the mass outbreak in the NRW city. Therefore, "we need a visitors' cap, and compliance with it must be monitored and the violation must be sanctioned, otherwise it will not help," explained the president of the 294 German districts. A limitation to fewer than 50 participants would indeed affect many events. "But that would be justified because without this measure we would probably have to restrict people's freedom even more if we don't want to lose control of Corona in autumn and winter," the CDU politician justified his initiative. Decentralized approach is a model for success At the same time, Sager warned the federal and state governments to abandon the course of "containment appropriate to the situation and impose the same measures on all districts and cities. The decentralized approach is "a model of success and must be maintained," he demanded. "If we were to forbid people in sparsely populated Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to drink a beer in public because all signals are red in Munich, this would drastically weaken acceptance". In his view, there is also nothing to be said against "allowing Christmas markets in circles hardly affected by Corona if reasonable hygiene concepts are in place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The European Investment Bank (EIB) is seeking additional equity capital from the EU member states in order to strengthen its investments in climate protection in Europe. EIB President Werner Hoyer told the Tagesspiegel newspaper that if the bank is to "significantly expand its climate protection investments once again", "our shareholders, the 27 EU member states, must grant us a capital increase". The EIB could achieve its climate protection goals with the capital resources it has available to date. "But, to cut a long story short: if the bank is to be desired to do more, then we need additional equity capital," said Hoyer. He pointed out that the EIB was endowed with almost 250 billion euros in equity capital, an excellent rating and the confidence of the capital markets. "We would be reluctant to jeopardize this by changing our leverage ratio between equity and loans from 2.5". The EIB announced in November 2019 that it would mobilize one trillion euros for climate and environmental protection by 2030. EIB wants to finance hydrogen production Commenting on a stricter climate protection policy, as recently announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Hoyer said: "Personally, I think it is right that we are more ambitious. It remains to be seen what the member states will say about this". The EIB is prepared to finance the development of hydrogen production outside Europe so that green energy can be imported into the EU. "Europe will have to finance hydrogen infrastructure outside the EU in substantial parts, for its own benefit. It is a win-win situation if we succeed in actually using hydrogen in the way we dream of", Hoyer said in the Tagesspiegel interview. Cushioning the social hardships of the conversion However, in the transformation to a climate-friendly economy, care must also be taken to cushion the social hardships of this transformation: "The last miner to emerge from the P #252;tt in Silesia will not be the boss of a digital start-up two years later.

Companies once again assessed their current situation more positively than in the previous month. They also expect their businesses to continue to recover. The German economy is stabilizing despite rising infection figures. In the manufacturing sector, the business climate indicator has risen noticeably. Significantly fewer companies assessed their current business situation as bad. In addition, more industrial companies expected their economic situation to improve further. The electrical and electronic industry in particular is optimistic. In the service sector, on the other hand, the index declined, after four consecutive increases in the last four years. This was due to less optimistic expectations. However, the companies assessed the current situation as slightly better. Retailers are noticeably more satisfied The business climate in the retail sector has brightened considerably. Retailers were noticeably more satisfied with their current business situation. In addition, many of them are expecting a further upturn in the coming months. The index rose once again in the construction sector. The indicator of the current situation climbed to its highest level since March of this year. The outlook remains pessimistic, but somewhat less so than in August.</TEXT>

This is the highest value since October 2018, with the upturn in industrial production in many important consumer countries benefiting German exports. In the chemical industry, significantly more companies expect their exports to increase in the fourth quarter. The same applies to manufacturers of electrical equipment. The automotive industry also expects sales growth in foreign business. The mechanical engineering sector, on the other hand, does not expect any major leaps forward for the time being, with companies there being rather reluctant to invest.

    <TEXT>English version No sooner does it get cold and wet outside than the number of colds increases. But while a flu-like infection - i.e. a cold - usually passes quickly, the "real flu" is a serious illness: In the past flu season, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany officially recorded more than 186,000 cases of flu. "Typical for a viral flu is a sudden onset with high fever, a strong feeling of illness and distinct muscle and joint pain. It becomes dangerous when complications arise, for example pneumonia," explains Dr. Wiete Schramm, head of the occupational medicine department at T #220;V Rheinland. A special feature of the coming flu season is the Corona Pandemic. "Against the background of the corona pandemic, we should prevent avoidable illnesses as well as possible. An important measure for this are above all the vaccinations recommended by the Standing Commission on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute," says Wiete Schramm. Current vaccination recommendations 2020 As in the previous year, the Permanent Commission on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute also recommends corona times: The focus for vaccinations should be clearly on risk groups for severe disease progression. Accordingly, people over 60 years of age in particular should be vaccinated against influenza. In addition, the vaccination recommendation applies to particularly vulnerable persons such as adults, adolescents and children with certain chronic diseases, pregnant women from the 4th month of pregnancy and people in old people's and nursing homes. A flu vaccination is also recommended for working people who have a lot of contact with people or are active in a health profession. Vaccination of risk groups particularly important due to corona pandemic Vaccination protects twice over: it saves most vaccinated persons from a disease and its potentially serious consequences. At the same time, every person who is not ill prevents other people from becoming infected and the flu from spreading in the population. This relieves the burden on the healthcare system. The best vaccination dates: October and November The data of the Robert Koch Institute show that most influenza illnesses occur around the turn of the year. Therefore, a flu vaccination in October or November makes sense. The reason: After the vaccination it takes about two weeks until the vaccination protection is built up. With a vaccination in the autumn is thus provided in time for the coming illness period. Yearly adjusted vaccines The flu vaccination provides protection for nine to twelve months. Therefore the vaccination must be repeated every autumn. In addition, the most widespread influenza pathogens change again and again. The vaccine used for the best possible protection is therefore adapted each year to the most frequently occurring pathogens. "Many companies offer their employees a flu vaccination from the company doctor in the fall - a way to get through the cold season well protected," says Schramm</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The events of 2015 are in the headlines again. Thousands of people made their way to Europe, mainly because of armed conflicts and the deteriorating living conditions in the crisis countries of the Middle East. In the main countries of origin of the refugees - Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - the humanitarian situation has not improved since then. On the contrary. Due to the Corona pandemic, there are now fears that the situation could worsen. The UN Refugee Agency, the national partner of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), draws attention to this worrying development. "Too little has been learned from the experiences of 2015. Then as now, the UNHCR has far too little money for its life-saving aid. Today the situation is exacerbated by Covid-19. The international community must act now and ensure humane living conditions," demands Peter Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Managing Director of UN Refugee Aid. Since 2015, the number of refugees seeking protection and security in EU countries has declined significantly: Whereas in 2015 there were still more than one million refugees arriving by sea and land, this year the number has so far been around 55,000. Despite this massive decline, nothing has changed in the original reasons for flight. According to the UNHCR study "Consequences of Underfunding in 2020" published in September 2020, the humanitarian situation of refugees in numerous countries, including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, is threatening to deteriorate further: due to a lack of aid funds and the rampant corona pandemic. According to UNHCR figures, only 49 percent of the funds needed for relief operations this year have arrived. Example Syria The situation of most Syrian refugees is desperate: In the tenth year after the outbreak of the conflict, 79 percent of Syrians in Jordan live below the poverty line. Corona has made the situation even worse. According to estimates, 17 percent of Jordanians and a third of Syrians living in the country have lost their jobs during the pandemic. If the funds needed for UNHCR's Syrian aid do not arrive, the vital winter aid for millions of vulnerable displaced and refugee Syrians in the region would also have to be reduced and stopped.

    <TEXT>English version Munich-based epidemiologist R #252;diger von Kries has criticized the sluggish preparation for the distribution of a corona vaccine. The scientist, who is a member of the Permanent Commission on Vaccination, said in an interview with the ARD magazine "FAKT": "If we want to vaccinate all people in the health care system, we must sensibly let the company doctors do it. If we want to vaccinate in nursing homes, there must be organizations that go to these homes and vaccinate them," said von Kries. All this has to be planned and "a concept has to be developed for this and I don't see that yet. The Standing Commission on Vaccination is developing vaccination recommendations for Germany and had already published a first statement on future vaccination against the SARS-COV-2 virus in mid-August. In it, the expert committee had proposed to vaccinate old people and people from the health care system in a first wave as soon as an approved vaccine is available. According to von Kries, this would mean up to 35 million people. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) had also promised this distribution, but had so far left open how exactly the vaccinations would be organized</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The President of the German Teachers' Association, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, has criticized the decisions of the Minister President Conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on future corona measures as insufficient and called for a nationwide corona traffic light for schools. "We are disappointed that the resolutions do not contain any precise, uniform guidelines for hygiene protection measures in schools that are related to the respective infection incidence," Meidinger told the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post". "Even after such a resolution, we are still miles away from a corona school traffic light that applies in all German states and clearly regulates from which infection occurrence which health protection measures must be taken at educational institutions. Meidinger expressed the fear "that each state will continue to do its own thing at its schools, which will further fuel uncertainty within schools as well as among parents, teachers, school administrators and students. He called for a Corona school traffic light, which should apply in every country, in every community. Distance and distance rules from 50 people According to the study, it could be on green if there are fewer than 35 infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week. In that case, a normal hygiene concept with masks on the playground and isolation of learning groups could be maintained. With 35 to 50 infections the Corona traffic light could jump to yellow, "for example with mask obligation also for younger pupils in instruction as well as increased testing", said Meidinger. Starting from 50 again distance rules with distance instruction phases would have to apply. Such a Corona traffic light coupled to the infection happening carries also the different infection numbers between the Lands of the Federal Republic and within individual regions and municipalities calculation, said Meidinger. Mandatory installation of room air filter systems "That there is resistance against it in individual Lands of the Federal Republic, is absolutely incomprehensible for the German teacher federation , so the federation boss. "We also miss the recommendation and announcement of concrete support and aid measures for schools," said Meidinger. We also miss the recommendation and announcement of concrete support and assistance measures for schools," said Meidinger. "For example, the mandatory installation of room air filter systems if classrooms cannot be ventilated properly because windows cannot be opened or can only be opened in gaps. The clustering mentioned in the resolutions could often not be implemented at all in school practice, for example in the upper grades of comprehensive schools and grammar schools as well as at vocational schools</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version According to the SOS Children's Villages, more and more massacres and cruel murders are being committed in Colombia. Armed groups are using these cruel murders deliberately to spread fear and strengthen their power. Among other things, the supremacy in drug trafficking and land ownership are at stake. Particularly frightening: Among the victims are more and more often young people and even children. In August alone, 33 young people were murdered within two weeks. In 2020, the organization "Indepaz" counted 61 massacres with 246 dead by September 22. Angela Maria Rosales, director of the SOS Children's Villages in Colombia, says: "They are victims of a society that should have protected them. This is where the government's historical failures become apparent. To this day, it is not doing enough to combat violence!" Still far from real peace Almost four years after the signing of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC rebels, the Colombian government is still far from achieving real peace. Families in remote areas were particularly affected by the violence. "They are left completely alone. It must be an absolute priority to support them," says Angela Maria Rosales. The restrictions imposed by the Corona pandemic have made the situation even worse. "Many social organizations, whose presence has at least provided some protection, have been forced to stop working". Children experience violence every day Angela Maria Rosales demands that these restrictions be lifted immediately. In the long term, the problem can only be solved by going to the roots. "The majority of children experience violence in their families and communities on a daily basis. Only if we manage to change this can we permanently break the cycle of violence that has gripped Colombia for decades," Rosales said. The SOS Children's Villages provide a wide range of support for abandoned children and families in need in Colombia. With intensive support from families, educational work and campaigns, they take targeted action against violence</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The interest in effective pandemic vaccines is not just a health issue, but has implications for the global economy. It is about money. A lot of money: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the economic damage caused by the pandemic at 375 billion dollars a month. An effective and safe vaccine would therefore also have the effect of a gigantic economic injection. In the race for the vaccine with the highest economic benefit in the history of mankind, it would probably be right at the top. But the vaccine still has to be developed. And then be produced in large quantities at a rapid pace. Just to put that in perspective: At the moment, there is a global production capacity for half a billion doses of classic influenza vaccines. But you would probably need twenty times* that. This is what Professor Dieter Cassel (University of Duisburg-Essen), Professor Volker Ulrich (University of Bayreuth) and the two health economists Dr. Andreas Heigl and Dr. Andreas J #228;cker, who work in the pharmaceutical industry, write in the article "Impfstoff f #252;r alle - wie soll das gehen? It was published in the journal "RPG Recht und Politik im Gesundheitswesen". "Bottlenecks" in the supply of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 But these are by far not all "bottlenecks". The existing supply infrastructure is naturally not equipped for such quantities. There is probably a lack of transport and refrigeration capacity, right up to the question: Are there actually enough doctors available for vaccination? In a thesis paper, Professor Matthias Schrappe, University of Cologne, assumes that it would take around one thousand working days, i.e. about four years, to vaccinate around 60 million people in Germany - and that would only be the case if 60,000 vaccinations were administered every day. Therefore, according to Ulrich, every effort must be made now in the German health care system to increase this "daily capacity" significantly. Big run on a scarce commodity A big run on a very scarce commodity: The economist calls this a "demand overhang". "It is foreseeable that the available vaccine doses globally will not be sufficient for vaccination for some time to come," says Ulrich. "And it is to be feared that an unfair race, if not even a distribution battle, could develop internationally. Ulrich could therefore imagine that supranational institutions such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization and organizations such as the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, possibly flanked by a "Corona Ethics Council", could regulate the global distribution of vaccines. According to Ulrich, this should be done "according to epidemiologically assessable needs or global systemic relevance, but not according to state or union borders. Europe wants to accomplish a feat A sensible idea, but one that probably has little chance of being realized. You don't even have to look across the pond to see where "whatever-first" policies are in fashion. "In this situation, Europe is also trying to do the trick of securing its own security through pre-emptive rights with pharmaceutical companies on the one hand and appealing to global solidarity on the other," says the health economist. The vaccination cascade: Distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in Germany Too few vaccines for too many people - what does this mean for Germany? The authors also pursue this question. The fur that is to be distributed does not yet exist. But given the challenges, it makes sense to think about how possible vaccines can be distributed sensibly. The team of authors has therefore developed a "vaccination cascade". It would have to be issued by the federal government in the form of a "COVID-19 Vaccine Ordinance" before the first vaccine is approved. The vaccine cascade works with three stages In stage I (prioritization with compulsory vaccination of medical staff) a worst-case scenario is assumed: Germany has only a small contingent of doses. In this stage, the self-employed and dependent working population, which are essential to maintain medical care, should be given the highest priority (Group A). They should be vaccinated until the end of the pandemic. However, this is not the same as compulsory vaccination. Those who refuse to be vaccinated, however, are temporarily not allowed to work close to patients and instead take on non-priority tasks in the health care system. In stage II (prioritization of persons not requiring vaccination), progressive vaccination coverage of group A is assumed. Now, in a group B, those who are exposed to particular health risks in the event of an infection could be vaccinated: e.g. the very elderly, persons in need of care and disabled persons, diabetics or people with risk-relevant previous illnesses. As Group C, the authors see people who are not primarily concerned with the self-protection of the vaccinated persons, but rather with reducing the risk for third parties; for example, parents, caring relatives or educators: "Protecting them in particular is not only ethically imperative, but also for reasons of maintaining our economic, social and political system," the RPG article states. Groups B and C should be able to decide on the vaccination themselves and be rewarded with a "vaccination pass" to exempt them from measures restricting their mobility. And finally, Stage III (COVID-19 vaccinations in mainstream care): This provides for the vaccination of the previously unprotected part of the population (Group D). If there is still an excess of demand here, the team of authors suggests maintaining electronic waiting lists of the health authorities. Here too, the decision to vaccinate should be voluntary. The management of the vaccination is marked with many question marks: How high is herd immunity; in other words, how many should actually be vaccinated and how often until the pandemic is really effectively combated? How quickly can a nationwide system of vaccination stations be established? How many people actually want to be vaccinated? How effective is the new vaccine? Only one thing is certain: it must happen quickly when the long-awaited vaccines are available. Implement vaccine ordinance quickly In view of the size of the task, it makes sense to quickly implement the "COVID-19 Vaccine Regulation" suggested by the authors in order to then be able to set the course for transparent vaccine management. Because only "a rational, economically and ethically justifiable vaccine distribution could help to overcome this predicament without splitting society," says Ulrich. Development of corona vaccines: High economic risk But the ball is still in the laboratories of scientific institutes, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies all over the world. They are taking a high economic risk because the development of new vaccines "is expensive, protracted and accompanied by a high risk of failure," explains Prof. Ulrich. In the case of the HI virus, for example, they have been trying for more than twenty years. "The record for the fastest development of a vaccine is held by the vaccine against mumps with a development time of four years. Vaccines are a public good during the crisis Anyone developing pandemic vaccines must think about how to produce as much as possible quickly before approval is granted and invest accordingly - an additional economic risk. Ulrich therefore accompanies with concern discussions about the lifting of patent protection, arguing that in times of crisis vaccines are something like a public good. Anyone who demands this, he says, "overlooks the fact that they first have to be developed before they can be distributed. Anything that reduces incentives for innovation is unsuitable in the current pandemic". Creating an innovation-friendly environment He sees innovation-friendly framework conditions as a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to be able to invest the same energy in developing solutions in the event of future pandemics as they do in this one. Incentives for innovation are the driving force behind the development of vaccines and drugs. Who wants to end up without them?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>German Federal Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU) reacted stunned that the Berlin district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg categorically rejects the help of the German Armed Forces in the corona contact tracing despite strongly rising infection numbers. The CDU leader told the newspaper "Tagesspiegel" that this bears the danger of a worsening of the situation for the whole of Berlin. "I lack any understanding that red-red-green is more likely to run the risk of rapidly rising infection rates, that chains of infection cannot be tracked or contained than to let the Bundeswehr help," Kramp-Karrenbauer told the "Tagesspiegel".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version With the Berlin Wall 30 years ago, not only the inner-German border fell, but also the iron curtain in Europe. Today, however, people in East and West Germany have different attitudes towards the European Union. This is reported by the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, which is published in Halle. According to the paper, two thirds of citizens in the West see more advantages than disadvantages in Germany's EU membership, while the East is divided - there it is only about half. This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Green parliamentary group in the EU Parliament on the occasion of German Unity Day. According to the survey, two thirds of East Germans would like to see more referendums at EU level - 13 percent more than in West Germany. "Even if the people in eastern Germany are certainly more reserved in their assessment of the EU, also because of its history, this should not be seen as a rejection, but rather as a desire to participate," said German Green MEP Anna Cavazzini, who commissioned the survey</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Leading economists see the rapid aging of the population and low immigration as the greatest risks for the economic future of eastern Germany. "Demographics will be the main problem for East Germany in the near future: the population is older on average, the labor force participation rate is lower, and immigrants tend to opt for West Germany," said Oliver Holtem #246;ller, Vice Chairman of the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research Halle (IWH), to the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post". "The new states have a special challenge: demographic aging. Here, sustainable work must be done, through family friendliness, good infrastructure networks, outstanding educational opportunities and medical care," said Michael H #252;ther, Director of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) in Cologne. 30 years after reunification, the balance of internal migration in Germany is balanced. Foreigners avoid the new states But foreigners avoid the new countries. Highly qualified people in particular tend to be attracted to the West German growth areas in Bavaria, Baden-W #252;rttemberg, Hamburg or North Rhine-Westphalia. "You can see this, for example, in the distribution of bluecards for highly qualified people: only a few of them arrive in the eastern German Fl #228;chenl #228;nder", said IWH economist Holtem #246;ller. "The new states will have to change the social mood in order to attract more qualified immigrants. In addition, the school drop-out rate in the East is higher. "Without qualified people there will be no economic growth, and without growth the gap between East and West will again widen," said the top economist</TEXT>

The SPD member of the Bundestag and physician Karl Lauterbach expects in view of the strongly rising corona infection numbers that "quasi whole Germany becomes a risk area. He told the Berlin "Tagesspiegel" (Monday edition): "I assume that we will very soon exceed the number of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week in many regions in Germany. The existing quarantine regulations would therefore soon "hardly make any sense", said Lauterbach. "Whether one travels or not will hardly make any difference. Quarantine regulations could therefore no longer play a major role for travel in Germany in a few weeks' time".

    <TEXT>English version SPD health expert Karl loud brook demanded in view of rising infection numbers a instruction stop for individual school subjects and a beginning of instruction staggered after clock times. "Presence instruction can become the Superspreadingevent in the autumn and winter , said loud brook the Dsseldorfer Rheini post office . In order to curb the incidence of infection, lessons should begin in the morning for some of the students and at noon for the others at all schools, suggested Lauterbach, who is himself an epidemiologist. "This requires a streamlined curriculum for the current school year, in which some subjects do not have to be taught as an exception - or only virtually". This would prevent overcrowded classrooms and rush hours at the schools and reduce the risk of infection in buses and trains, for example. Missing concepts of the ministries of education "The schools follow because of missing concepts of the Ministries of education the slogan: Mask on and by , said loud brook further. "Thus the responsible authorities endanger under circumstances the health of the pupils, teachers and parents and risk ever further rising infection numbers, because pupils can pass the virus on exactly the same way as adults , said loud brook. Not to expect children and young people to be vaccinated The SPD politician dampened expectations that young people could be vaccinated at the same time as adults. "It is not to be expected that we will be able to vaccinate children and young people next year," he said. They are not part of ongoing studies, "which is why a possible vaccine for young people cannot be approved," said Lauterbach. This increases the pressure on schools to radically change their teaching practices. "With Corona, schools will have to fight the whole school year 2020/2021," Lauterbach predicted</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the current survey, the CEP indicator (China Economic Panel) rises by 18.3 points to 44.4 points. This is by far the highest value of the indicator since the beginning of the survey in mid-2013. The CEP-Indicator, which is collected in the ZEW cooperation with Fudan University, Shanghai, reflects the economic expectations of international financial market experts for China on a 12-month horizon. The assessment of the current economic situation also increases very strongly by 31.1 points. The situation indicator now stands at 1.9 points, indicating a "normal" economic situation. The point forecasts for the real gross domestic product (GDP) also improve considerably. GDP growth of 2.7 percent is now expected for the current year (in the previous month this figure was 2.1 percent), and the forecast for 2021 has been raised from 4.3 percent to 5.7 percent. China could achieve pre-corona growth "According to the forecasts, the Chinese economy would reach the growth rates as before the corona crisis next year", comments Dr. Michael Schr #246;der, researcher at the ZEW research area "International Financial Markets and Financial Management". Expectations are rising sharply for all components of GDP, - this applies to exports as well as to consumption and private investments. Sustainable economic recovery is expected And the experts are also optimistic on the level of industries and the most important economic regions. They are therefore assuming a sustained economic recovery. Nevertheless, the indicator values for domestic and foreign debt remain very high. "Although the Chinese leadership has succeeded in stimulating the economy again through active economic policy, it has not yet been able to achieve its goals. But the improved economy has its price - in the form of significantly higher debt," says Michael Schr #246;der.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Sustainable capital investments (ESG investment products) are highly valued by financial market experts. This is the result of a special question in the current ZEW Financial Market Survey, in which about 150 financial market experts participated. Around 59 percent see greater market potential for ESG investment products than for conventional investments. Financial analysts assess their risk as somewhat lower, but have to accept a slight reduction in returns. For two thirds of the experts, however, ESG investment products are part of their own portfolio, even if only to a share of less than 50 percent. However, there is a backlog of demand for ESG papers in terms of social and environmental aspects. The survey was conducted by the ZEW Mannheim Economic Research Institute in September 2020. "Sustainable investments are generally viewed positively by the respondents. Compared to the 2007 survey, they have clearly gained momentum", says Dr. Michael Schr #246;der, researcher at the ZEW research department "International Financial Markets and Financial Management" and co-author of the evaluation. Great market potential expected 59.2 percent currently see a greater market potential for sustainable investments than for conventional investments; 29.3 percent assume that the market potential is equally good. Only 11.6 percent see only a lower potential. In 2007, the experts estimated the market potential to be even lower. Increasing weighting of ESG systems in own portfolios ESG investments also keep pace with conventional investments in terms of risk/return characteristics. In contrast to conventional investments, financial market experts tend to assess the risk and also the return of sustainable investments somewhat less. "According to the experts, yield and sustainability are therefore not mutually exclusive. In 2007, they assessed the risk higher and the return lower for sustainable investments", comments Frank Br #252;ckbauer, researcher at the ZEW Research Department "International Financial Markets and Financial Management" and second co-author of the evaluation. Increasing weighting in the portfolio That ESG investments are becoming increasingly important for investors is also shown by the increasing weighting in their own portfolios. While in the 2007 survey 37.1 percent did not want to include any ESG investments in their portfolio, this proportion of the strong skeptics has fallen to just 4.1 percent in the current survey (see Figure 2). A majority of 68.5 percent would like to keep a portfolio share below 50 percent, of which 39.7 percent would like to keep between 0 and 25 percent. 15.8 percent of the experts would even like to invest the largest part of their portfolio (between 75 and 100 percent) in ESG systems. Sustainable investments have a lot of catching up to do "Sustainable investments still have a considerable amount of catching up to do in terms of their focus on social and ecological aspects. At present, many financial market experts still consider the criteria to be insufficiently considered," says Michael Schr #246;der. 57.7 percent of the experts are of the opinion that supposedly sustainable investments hardly take these aspects into account. However, trust in sustainable investments has also grown in this respect: 42.3 percent state that ESG investments take social and ecological aspects strongly into account, while only 34.4 percent were of this opinion in the 2007 survey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier, head of the "Max Planck Research Center for the Science of Pathogens" in Berlin, will be awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Jennifer A. Doudna. Federal Research Minister Anja Karliczek congratulates the scientist. I congratulate Professor Emmanuelle Charpentier on winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Born in France, she has already worked as a scientist in Germany for several years. Professor Charpentier is Director of the Max Planck Research Center for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin. Both decisions of the Stockholm Prize Committee show that Germany is an excellent and competitive science location. As Federal Minister of Education and Research, I and all scientists in the country are delighted about this double award for two researchers working in Germany. Professor Charpentier shares the Nobel Prize with the US American Jennifer A. Doudna for the development of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene scissors. This is a new fascinating method for genome editing. It allows selected parts of the genome to be cut out very precisely and efficiently and the genome to be modified. This opens up extensive application possibilities in many areas of molecular genetics, for example in plant breeding or medicine. This new method opens up completely new paths in both disciplines. Benefits and risks must be carefully discussed with and within society. Charpentier heads Max Planck Research Unit Ms. Charpentier has been head of the "Max Planck Research Center for the Science of Pathogens" in Berlin since 2018, after having accepted the position of Director of the Department "Regulation in Infection Biology" at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin in 2015. Professor Charpentier, like Professor Genzel, is representative of the internationality of science today. Studying and doing her doctorate in Paris She studied biochemistry and microbiology at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris and also obtained her doctorate. After research stays in the USA she habilitated at the University of Vienna and then went to Sweden. Then she came to Germany. From 2013 to 2015 she was professor at the Medical University of Hannover and headed the Department of Regulation in Infection Biology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig. In 2014, she was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, through which top foreign scientists are attracted to research in Germany. From 2015 to 2018 she was director at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. In 2016 she received the Leibniz Award - one of the most prestigious awards German science has to offer. Since 2018, Ms. Charpentier has been founding and acting director of the Max Planck Research Center for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin. Germany is highly attractive At this point, I would like to emphasize once again that the conditions that the Federal Government and the L #228;nder guarantee German science with the Pact for Research and Innovation are internationally unique. As you can see, this now attracts many top international scientists. Germany is highly attractive. This benefits all of us, because in the end, top-level research also benefits the people in our country, which means that we remain a country of innovation and thus lay the foundation for the prosperity of future generations</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Experts worldwide expect economic output to shrink by 4.4 percent in the current year. The recovery is likely to be slower than the crash (plus 3.2 percent in 2021). In many places, it could drag on at least until 2022, before the pre-crisis level is reached again. This is shown by a survey of 950 economic experts from 110 countries conducted by the Ifo Institute/the EconPol Europe research network. The experts cite liquidity support for small and medium-sized companies and improvements in the healthcare systems as the most effective economic policy measures. Economists from countries where short-time work is used consider it particularly suitable. The experts' expectations regarding the duration of the recovery phase vary widely. Looking at all respondents together, more than a third (36.4 percent) expect economic output to return to pre-crisis levels in 2022. By contrast, 19.4 percent believe that a full recovery will not set in until 2023. 24.4 percent are more optimistic and expect this to happen as early as 2021. 15.7 percent believe that this will not happen until later than 2023. Liquidity assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises According to the experts, liquidity support for small and medium-sized enterprises is the most effective economic policy response. On a scale of 1 to 6, they are rated on average 5.0. This measure is rated highest in the EU, the US and other advanced economies. For the experts* in the emerging and developing countries of Asia, Latin America or Africa, improvements in the health care system are at the top of the list of priorities. Tax deferrals and short-time work In addition, the respondents consider temporary tax deferrals for companies (4.4), short-time work (4.3) and additional childcare services (4.2) to be good policy measures in most groups of countries. The exception is the USA, where the experts are much less convinced of temporary tax deferments (3.4). Liquidity assistance for larger companies (4.0) is also considered important, but is much less relevant than assistance for small and medium-sized companies.</TEXT>

In many places, it could drag on at least until 2022, before the pre-crisis level is reached again. This is shown by a survey of 950 economic experts from 110 countries conducted by the Ifo Institute/the EconPol Europe research network. The experts cite liquidity support for small and medium-sized companies and improvements in the healthcare systems as the most effective economic policy measures. Economists from countries where short-time work is used consider it particularly suitable. The experts' expectations regarding the duration of the recovery phase vary widely. Looking at all respondents together, more than a third (36.4 percent) expect economic output to return to pre-crisis levels in 2022. By contrast, 19.4 percent believe that a full recovery will not set in until 2023. 24.4 percent are more optimistic and expect this to happen as early as 2021. 15.7 percent believe that this will not happen until later than 2023. Liquidity assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises According to the experts, liquidity support for small and medium-sized enterprises is the most effective economic policy response. On a scale of 1 to 6, they are rated on average 5.0. This measure is rated highest in the EU, the US and other advanced economies. For the experts* in the emerging and developing countries of Asia, Latin America or Africa, improvements in the health care system are at the top of the list of priorities. Tax deferrals and short-time work In addition, the respondents consider temporary tax deferrals for companies (4.4), short-time work (4.3) and additional childcare services (4.2) to be good policy measures in most groups of countries. The exception is the USA, where the experts are much less convinced of temporary tax deferments (3.4). Liquidity assistance for larger companies (4.0) is also considered important, but is much less relevant than assistance for small and medium-sized companies</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Economic growth in the euro zone will flatten out in the fourth quarter, following a massive recovery in the third quarter. This is what the research institutes Ifo from Munich, KOF from Zurich and Istat from Rome expect in their new Eurozone Economic Outlook. However, reliable forecasts are difficult to make in the current environment because nobody knows how infection figures will develop, when a vaccine will be available and how economic policy will work. The institutes estimate a growth of only 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, after a plus of 8.2 percent in the third and a crash of minus 11.8 percent in the second. For 2020 as a whole, the institutes expect economic output to shrink by 8.0 percent. In the first quarter of 2021, they then expect growth of 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter. In the current third quarter, all key figures are in positive territory: industrial production is growing by 15.2 percent, private consumption by 9.2 percent and investments by 10.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Thereafter, all growth rates flattened off again significantly, with the result that the year as a whole ended up deep in the red, with the rate of price increases fluctuating around zero. The forecast is based on an oil price of 43 dollars for a barrel of North Sea oil and a rate of 1.18 dollars per euro.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ), Russia's ambassador in Berlin, Sergei Netschajew, accused the Foreign Office of bias and an opaque agenda. "Berlin's attempts to present itself only as a 'bearer of bad news' are not convincing," the diplomat said. Most recently, Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) had called on Russia, after further indications of an attack on the Russian opposition politician Alexei Nawalny, to contribute to the clarification with a chemical warfare agent instead of making "absurd accusations". Otherwise sanctions would be expected. The case becomes enormously politicized Netschajew, on the other hand, explained that "the case is being enormously politicized. It is politicians who are speaking out, not experts. Our multiple proposals to establish cooperation between doctors, toxicologists, experts from the responsible investigative authorities are either rejected or left unanswered by Berlin. These are the facts. You may draw your own conclusions. Poisoning in Siberia is unbelievable Netschajew called the account of how Nawalny was allegedly poisoned in Siberia unbelievable. "Is there at least a pinch of common sense here? How naive, to put it mildly, do you have to be to take something like this seriously?", asked the diplomat. Instead, all other possible representations of the process in Germany had been declared absurd in advance. "That is why we insist that the German authorities reveal their cards," said Russian President Vladimir Putin's representative in Germany. Avoiding ultimatums and threats "From our point of view it is important at this point to avoid mutual accusations, ultimatums and threats. Because it won't work that way," the ambassador continued. "The positive potential of German-Russian relations, which has been carefully built up in the past, needs to be treated more carefully. It is a pity that I have to make this appeal today to some German politicians and members of parliament whose anti-Russian rhetoric often crosses all 'red lines'. Four requests for judicial assistance not granted In the "NOZ", Russia's ambassador reiterated his incomprehension that the German authorities have so far failed to comply with four Russian requests for judicial assistance, contrary to international practice. "I don't understand at all why Germany is refusing to cooperate with Russia in a case that it itself insists on clarifying," said Netschajew. "So the question arises: Are our German partners interested in an objective investigation of the case?"</TEXT>

"The hospitals are very well prepared and have the highest intensive care bed capacities in Europe. We are therefore in a position to activate at least 12,000 additional intensive care beds within a short period of time," said Gerald Ga #223;, President of the German Hospital Federation (DKG), to the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post". The reason for this was that the first wave had provided valuable experience in dealing with Covid-19, and now we could react much more precisely and quickly, Ga #223; continued. The DKG president emphasized, however, that politics must give the clinics its backing. "Politics is not only needed for containment measures, but also for the framework conditions for the clinics in a state of emergency. Free-of-charge flat rates and the suspension of rigid personnel requirements will also be necessary during the second wave"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Since the outbreak of the corona crisis in March, there have been 37 infections with the corona virus in the German Bundestag. This was reported by the "Saarbr #252;cker Zeitung" with reference to data from the Bundestag administration, according to which around 10,000 people are employed in the buildings of the German Bundestag, including members of parliament, faction and administrative staff as well as tradesmen and other service providers. The 37 cases of infection came from this group of people, a spokeswoman for the administration told the newspaper. "This does not mean, however, that the incidence of infection took place in the Bundestag." The infections could also have found their way to the state in the constituency, on vacation or in the places of residence. Mask duty in the properties of the Bundestag Since Tuesday, the obligation to wear masks issued by the President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Sch #228;uble (CDU), has been in effect in the properties of the Bundestag. The parliamentary secretary of the FDP, Marco Buschmann, criticized the AfD in this regard. There had been "systematic and intentional violations" of the AfD against the previous recommendation to wear masks.

    <TEXT>English version In the event of a second term of office for U.S. President Donald Trump, the German government's Transatlantic Coordinator sees massive challenges ahead for NATO. "NATO would once again be high on a Trump II agenda. We should prepare ourselves for an even tougher course," said Peter Beyer in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung". Although the CDU member of the Bundestag considers "a declared unilateral cancellation of NATO membership to be unlikely", Beyer said that the CDU was not prepared to accept this. However, he said that it could "amount to a kind of attrition in that Washington repeatedly confronts the alliance with new demands for the transfer and reduction of troops and thus attempts to shape NATO according to its own ideas or to reduce its size in terms of the US contribution. Second term of office associated with imponderables Beyer emphasized in the NOZ: "For NATO's ability to act, a second term of Trump's office would certainly involve imponderables. The main beneficiaries of such a policy would be Russia and of course China. With regard to German defense spending, which US President Trump has branded as too low, the Transatlantic Coordinator said: "In an increasingly complicated and rougher world, Germany must invest more money in the Bundeswehr so that we can reach NATO's two-percent target more quickly. Not all of Trump's criticism is wrong, "just because it comes from Trump and is made abundantly clear</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version More than half of the races of this year's Formula 1 season have already been completed and series world champion Lewis Hamilton is heading for his next title. The information platform Wettbasis (www.wettbasis.com) has now determined which drivers dominate the social networks. The company has analyzed the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles of all 21 drivers who have already completed a Formula 1 race this season. No German driver among the top three The six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has the most followers across all platforms. He reaches around 31 million users worldwide via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, making him the number one in social media rankings. With 6.8 million and 6 million followers respectively, Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen rank second and third. The first German driver in the ranking is Nico H #252;lkenberg. The 33-year-old finished ninth with a total reach of 2.2 million followers. Sebastian Vettel is the only Formula 1 driver not to use social media and therefore finds himself in last place in the ranking. Carlos Sainz with the most posts In terms of the number of posts on Instagram and Twitter, however, the Spaniard Carlos Sainz leads the ranking with a total of 9,400 contributions. Drivers with lower ranges are also to be found in the other two places in the top three. The Frenchman Romain Grosjean (8,700 posts) takes second place ahead of Lando Norris from Great Britain (8,000 posts).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The Nobel Prize awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, the inventors of the CRISPR/Cas-"Gene Scissors", comments Christoph Then for Testbiotech (Institute for Independent Impact Assessment in Biotechnology) This is a Nobel Prize for Pandora's box. This technology and the Nobel Prize mean an enormous challenge and responsibility for all involved. The future of life on this planet depends very much on whether we manage to set clear limits to the applications of this new genetic engineering. We must prevent the genetic material of humans, animals and plants from becoming the plaything of profit interests and technical hubris. The CRISPR-Cas gene scissors open up new possibilities for modifying the genetic material: they enable changes to be made both by removing natural genetic material and by inserting artificial, synthesized DNA. Testbiotech warns against the uncontrolled use of the CRISPR-Cas gene scissors in agriculture and the environment and also against increasing patenting of seeds and farm animals. Testbiotech is concerned that a growing number of companies and experts are increasingly focusing on economic expectations and want to abolish mandatory risk assessments. Decisive role in the development of Gene Drives The possible applications extend not only to crops and livestock, but also to natural biodiversity such as insects, wildlife, trees and grasses. Testbiotech has recently published a report on how New Genetic Engineering threatens biodiversity. CRISPR technology also plays a crucial role in the development of so-called Gene Drives, which should make it possible to modify or eradicate entire natural populations. This corresponds to an intervention in the "germ line" of biological diversity. Testbiotech also sees problems in the rapidly increasing number of animal experiments in the field of genetic engineering.</TEXT>

This is the result of the latest economic survey by the ifo Institute. In September the indicator rose to minus 19.0 points, after minus 35.9 in August. The low point in April was minus 87.0 points. "The situation was catastrophic, and later on it was very bad. Now it is only bad. This is where the improvement lies," says Ifo-expert Stefan Sauer. Business expectations for the coming months fell to plus 28.8 points, after plus 36.1 in August and even plus 41.6 in July. The companies also expect further staff reductions. The corresponding indicator shows minus 38.6 points, after minus 46.1 in August. Export expectations give hope. They have brightened somewhat. The indicator rose slightly to 32.2 points, up from 31.1 in August. Production plans are also still expansive. The corresponding indicator reached a good 53.1 points, after 48.2 in August. The order backlog has further improved compared to the previous month. The indicator rose to 53.7 points, compared with 39.1 in August. Demand, however, deteriorated significantly compared with the previous month. It fell to 36.8 points, following 61.9 in August. Inventories of finished goods remained at a low level.</TEXT>

However, they are still well above the average for all employees subject to social insurance contributions. This is currently around 11 percent," says Ifo labor market expert Sebastian Link. In September, 31 percent of employees in the metal industry were on short-time work, 29 percent in mechanical engineering, 26 percent in the hospitality industry, 24 percent in vehicle construction, and 23 percent in the electrical industry, followed by companies in the textile and clothing industry, manufacturers of leather, wood, and paper, as well as print shops with 20 percent, other economic services with 18 percent, the furniture industry with 15 percent, and the wholesale trade with 13 percent. The petroleum and chemical industries, pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers of rubber, plastics and glass account for 12 percent, while transport and warehousing account for 11 percent.

    <TEXT>English version Andreas Gassen, head of the statutory health insurance fund, has criticized warnings that the corona pandemic is getting out of control as misleading, also in view of the increasing number of new infections. "We have to stop staring at the number of new infections like a rabbit at a snake, that leads to false alarmism," said the Chairman of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in an interview with the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" (NOZ). "Even 10,000 infections a day would not be a drama if only one in 1,000 became seriously ill, as we are currently observing." Gassen was reacting to statements by Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, who had warned of a loss of control. In spring, up to 150 corona deaths occurred daily in 4000 new cases, explained Gassen. "That is over. Now there are single-digit death figures. As long as the ratio remains like this, new infections in the five-digit range are hardly relevant". An overloading of the health system is "not foreseeable even in autumn and winter", said the doctor to the NOZ. Breakdown of infection incidence by age group Gassen demanded: "We must move away from focusing solely on the number of new infections. Among the under 20-year-olds there had been two deaths until last week, both persons had been pre-infected. This age group would not be reached with warnings about the danger of the disease. His appeal: "We should break down the incidence of infection much more strongly according to age groups and react more specifically. I am convinced that with sensible communication we can definitely allow more normality again - with the possibility of quickly putting the brakes on again". "The figure must be adapted to developments" Specifically, the head of the panel physician demanded that the threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants, above which districts and cities are declared risk areas, be raised significantly: The number 50 comes from a time when 400,000 tests were carried out every week and the rate of positive results was high. In the meantime, three times as many tests are performed with much fewer test positives. "The number must be adapted to the developments, taking into account the lower positive rate one would currently reach a threshold of 84 per 100,000", explained the KBV chairman. As a rigid and sole indicator for taking drastic measures, the number is in any case unsuitable. Countries outperform with more rigid measures Instead of acting in a targeted manner, "individual countries repeatedly outdo each other with calls for more rigid measures, almost to the point of new lockdown demands," complained Gassen in the NOZ. "This would certainly bring the country to its knees for good, both economically and morally. Medically that is at present also not to be justified. Profiling attempts of individual sovereigns did not benefit the cause, said Gassen. "The federal hullabaloo should stop. We will only keep the people in line if there is progress, if the citizens realize that their discipline pays off, otherwise they will shut down mentally," he warned. "In England, quarantine measures are disregarded. If we also end up there, it would be disastrous.</TEXT>

"Who goes with this infection happening there mulled wine to drink, risks on Christmas Eve a hospital stay. There is hardly a hygiene concept, with which one can ensure enough safety distance at the booths, said the SPD politician. "In addition, the authorities could not sufficiently control Christmas markets", said Lauterbach. In view of the strongly rising infection numbers, he said: "People must be prepared for the fact that the measures now taken will remain valid until April or May with a few adjustments.

    <TEXT>English version The increasing number of confirmed corona cases in Germany is due to more infections, but also to additional tests. This has been shown by calculations of the Ifo Institute. "The figures from October cannot be directly compared with those from April. For this reason, political decision-makers and economic players should not react with either too rigid restrictions or too lax measures," says Ifo President Clemens Fuest. "We need restrictions that allow economic activity rather than preventing it." "The incidence of infection is indeed increasing, but not as much as a direct comparison of new infections today and during the first wave would suggest," explains Fuest. 10,000 more cases discovered "If as many tests had been carried out in April as today, then at the peak a good 10,000 more cases would have been discovered," Fuest added: "Making masks compulsory and providing additional tests will enable citizens to carry out activities that would otherwise fall victim to health protection: Children can go to school and customers can come to stores. At the same time, there can be no economic recovery if the pandemic is not under control. There is therefore no real conflict between health and economic policy concerns.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version In the plenary session of the European Parliament, Engin Eroglu MEP called for lessons to be learned from the Wirecard scandal. "For years, Wirecard has shown billions of dollars in cash on its balance sheet, which were not available. Ernst  amp; Young audited the financial statements, which are obviously wrong and charged millions for them, thus earning some extra money". Investors obviously trusted these false figures and were thus driven to make the wrong investment decisions. The share price of the Wirecard share had lost more than 99% of its value within days of this fraud becoming known. Wirecard had to file for insolvency in the meantime. "My appeal is: In the future, let us deprive the auditors of the opportunity to pull out of the affair in this way. Auditors, like thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs and myself, must also be liable for their work". Commission remained vague in its answer Eroglu thus took up his question to the Commission. Although the Commission had remained vague in its answer, it indicated that the national authorities had acted unfortunate here: "The competent national authorities must monitor the activities of market participants in order to ensure that markets function properly and to guarantee investor protection," concluded Eroglu</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The corona crisis is leaving clear traces in the German economy and hitting it harder than expected in spring. In their autumn reports, the leading economic research institutes have revised their forecasts for this year and next year downwards by a good one percentage point each. They now expect gross domestic product to fall by 5.4 percent in 2020 (previously -4.2 percent) and grow by 4.7 percent (5.8 percent) in 2021. In 2022, economic output is then expected to grow by 2.7 percent. The reason for the comparatively more pessimistic assessment is that the institutes now assess the further recovery process as somewhat weaker than in spring. "Although a good part of the slump from the spring has already been made up, the remaining catch-up process represents the more arduous route back to normality," said Stefan Kooths, head of economic research at IfW Kiel. Gastronomy, tourism and event industry suffer The recovery is slowed down by those industries that are particularly dependent on social contacts, such as restaurants and tourism, the event industry or air transport. "This part of the German economy will continue to suffer from the corona pandemic for some time to come and will not participate in the recovery process until infection control measures are largely eliminated, which we do not expect until the next summer half-year," said Kooths. Reluctance to invest on the part of companies On the other hand, companies' reluctance to invest is slowing down the upswing because their equity positions have deteriorated in many cases as a result of the crisis. The recovery is being driven primarily by exports, which had slumped particularly dramatically in the course of the crisis.</TEXT>

"The multiple disregard of constitutional principles by the executive branch is massively damaging the reputation of our democratic order," the FDP politician told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post" newspaper. The fatal impression is created that the constitution does not apply in pandemic times, Kubicki warned. "Therefore it is imperative that the parliaments take the necessary decisions into their hands again", demanded the deputy chairman of the FDP. Public parliamentary discussions were not only a necessary corrective for the partly disproportionate measures, but also indispensable for acceptance. "If arguments are exchanged openly and problems are debated in an unembellished manner, there is no room for conspiracy theorists or corona deniers," Kubicki emphasized</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Despite the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on various EU products, German exports to the USA have actually increased further since 2016. This is the result of a still unpublished study by the Institute of the German Economy (IW), which is available to the D #252;sseldorf "Rheinische Post". According to the study, German merchandise exports increased from around 107 to 119 billion euros annually between 2016 and 2019. Thus, the share of exports to the USA in all German exports remained unchanged at 8.9 percent. Since German imports of U.S. products grew somewhat faster than exports, the German balance of trade surplus fell slightly by around 2.5 percent from just under EUR 48.5 to 47.3 billion. Trump has therefore clearly failed in its declared goal of reducing the German trade surplus with the help of protectionist measures. "Trade war" had hardly any major impact "Since 2018 Donald Trump has been waging a trade war with the EU. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, sued for illegal Airbus subsidies and repeatedly threatened to erect trade barriers for European automobile exports, which would hit the German economy particularly hard. In retrospect, however, it is clear that none of this has had any major economic impact," said IW study author J #252;rgen Matthes. Matthes sees one reason for the robust trade relations in the stable economic development in the USA and Germany before the Corona crisis. In addition, US customs duties have so far only affected a small proportion of German industrial products</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The municipalities have welcomed the decisions of the Federal Government and the L #228;nder on corona control. Gerd Landsberg, Chief Executive of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, told the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post": "We are clearly running the risk of the pandemic getting out of hand. The Federal Government, the L #228;nder, but also the local authorities and the people must work together to counteract this. "It is right to focus the measures on the risk areas, the so-called hotspots," said Landsberg. "The stricter obligation to wear masks in risk areas, the restrictions on contacts in public and at private events with the corresponding determination of the number of participants can have the necessary effect. Private celebrations were the drivers of the pandemic It was therefore right to clearly limit private celebrations in risk areas. "We have learned in the course of the pandemic that it is private events and the disregard of distance, mask and hygiene regulations that are driving the infection. Alcohol and the associated disinhibition and indifference to existing rules played an important role in this, he said. Landsberg therefore welcomed the planned closing time. "This is certainly better than having to close restaurants and bars in the end - as is now the case in the Netherlands". Special challenge for local public order offices He regretted that there were no uniform rules on the prohibition of accommodation. "After all, the appeal to refrain from unnecessary travel to or from high-risk areas is shared by all", he said. The measures adopted must now be implemented consistently and their implementation monitored. "This is a particular challenge for the local public order offices, which are already often working at the limits of their capacity. We therefore expect further support from the state and federal police forces</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Following the Minister President's Conference, Clemens Fuest, head of Ifo, warned the Federal Government and the L #228;nder of weak and delayed rules to curb the corona crisis: "Curbing new corona infections is not only of great importance in terms of health policy, but also economically", Fuest told the D #252;sseldorf newspaper "Rheinische Post". "Studies of past epidemics and initial findings from the corona pandemic show that the economic damage is particularly great if measures to contain the infections are taken too late because they then have to be drastically reduced," said the President of the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research. Enabling economic and social life "We must avoid getting into a situation like the one we had in April", said Mr Fuest. "Economically, restrictions that allow economic and social life are preferable, such as compulsory masks and more tests including rapid tests. Measures such as accommodation bans are more harmful", Mr Fuest said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version UK companies could be particularly hard hit by the brexite. This is the result of a study by the Ifo Institute and the research network EconPol Europe. This is because British companies import many intermediate products from the EU, which are sourced from a small number of suppliers. "The current Covid 19 crisis has shown how important it is to diversify supply chains in order to mitigate the negative effects of unexpected supply shocks," says Lisandra Flach, head of the ifo Centre for Foreign Trade. "Our results show how important it is to achieve a trade agreement that reduces uncertainty in trade relations and thus minimises costs for the parties involved," Flach continues. German economy strongly affected by brexite A look at Germany's bilateral trade relations shows that the German economy would also be strongly affected by brexite. The majority of goods with five or less suppliers coming from the UK are intermediate products. Examples are special types of propulsion engines or chemical substances. They are used as inputs in manufacturing. They are not easily substitutable. Groups of goods from suppliers were examined Groups of products for which there are five or fewer suppliers were examined. Less than 10% of these goods are sourced by the EU from the UK. Conversely, the UK imports the majority of these product groups from the EU. "There are few products for which the EU is currently dependent on supplies from the UK. In principle, these product groups could be replaced by producers within the EU. Overall, the effects of brexite affect the EU27 countries less than the UK", explains Mr Flach. Intermediate products could become a problem "Germany is an important element in the complex supply chains of many industries worldwide. Regardless of the outcome of negotiations, trade costs between the UK and the EU will increase in response to the brexite", says Feodora Teti, co-author of the study. The issue of intermediate products could also still cause problems for EU Member States such as France, Italy and especially Ireland: For product groups with fewer suppliers, mainly British intermediate goods are sourced instead of end products.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version Experts expect the number of new corona infections to reach another record level in just a few days. In Germany, too, the number of new infections will probably exceed the 10,000 mark in the coming week," said the President of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, to the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". According to the physician, even the measures taken now could do little to change this, because they will only take effect "in five to ten days at the earliest" The SPD parliamentary party vice president and epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach fears that if the number of cases continues to rise permanently, hospital capacities will not be sufficient to treat the severe corona cases adequately. In two months too few intensive care beds "With 10,000 cases a day, the point is reached in two months at the latest where too few intensive care beds are available for corona patients," said Lauterbach to the "Rheinische Post". The health expert recommends however to let only once the measures decided now work. "Whether they are really sufficient, however, is questionable, said the Leverkusen member of parliament</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version German economists fear that in the corona crisis the number of zombie companies is "rather increasing". 66 percent of the economists surveyed by the Ifo Institute share this concern. This is a central finding of the economic panel jointly compiled by the Ifo Institute and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "Unfortunately, some of the government aid measures have undesirable side effects," says Niklas Potrafke, head of the Ifo Centre for Public Finance and Political Economy. "They encourage companies to be kept alive artificially, even those that do not have a convincing business model. Short-time working allowance supports zombie companies 86 percent of those surveyed see a risk of so-called zombie companies emerging because the obligation to file for bankruptcy in the event of insolvency has been suspended. However, this special rule no longer applies since 1 October. According to 50 percent of those surveyed, the short-time working allowance also supports zombie companies. In the same vein, 32 per cent also consider state loans to companies via the Kreditanstalt f #252;r Wiederaufbau to be risky. After the end of economic aid, bankruptcies are on the rise 64 percent of those surveyed expect the number of bankruptcies to "tend to rise" after the end of state economic aid. A further 32 percent even expect the number of insolvencies to "rise sharply". Oliver Landmann, an economist from Freiburg, adds that it is premature to stop the aid already now.

    <TEXT>English version Against the background of a second wave of corona infections, the CDU Economic Council fears new restrictions for companies and has criticised the different approaches of the L #228;nder. "I miss a stringent nationwide strategy," said Wolfgang Steiger, Secretary General of the Economic Council, to the D #252;sseldorf-based "Rheinische Post". Against the background of recent scientific findings, he warned against "continuing the outbidding competition between the federal states", said Steiger. "A second shutdown or even border closures like in spring will be very difficult to afford even for our rich state, even if it is only partial". Instead of unsettling the economy, violations of distance regulations, masks and quarantine requirements should be dealt with much harder and more consistently, Steiger demanded. Loss of control in large cities Otherwise, the population's approval of measures to combat corona will in future decline massively. "The loss of control in some large cities is also due to the fact that for months essential chains of infection have been obscured under the ciphers of 'party scene' or 'family celebrations'. Broad, multilingual information campaigns are urgently needed here," said Steiger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>English version The number of wolf packs living in Germany has again increased significantly. According to information from the "Neue Osnabr #252;cker Zeitung" the federal states counted almost 130 packs in the monitoring year 2019/2020. In addition there were 34 pairs of wolves and ten so-called territorial single animals. Compared to the previous monitoring, the number of herds has thus increased by a good 20 percent. Ten years ago there were only seven packs in Germany. The Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, which is responsible for publishing the monitoring, initially neither denied nor confirmed the figures. The evaluation of the reports from the federal states is still ongoing. A spokeswoman for the "NOZ" newspaper said that publication was planned for November. A monitoring year runs from 1 May to 30 April. Acceptance of the wolf in the countryside is declining Helmut Dammann-Tamke, Vice President of the German Hunting Association (DJV), told the paper with regard to the increasing number of wolf cracks, which has been rising for years: "It is becoming apparent that we are completely losing acceptance of the wolf among the population in rural areas. Germany had to act quickly. "An unchecked spread is not an option. The DJV Vice-President said: "If neighbouring countries such as France decide to regulate wolf populations, then this must also be possible in Germany". 35 packs live in Lower Saxony Lower Saxony's Environment Minister Olaf Lies (SPD), however, was critical. He expects that in the future the figures will be published faster and more up-to-date by the competent federal authority. Although the wolf count is working well, the published figures always lag far behind the actual development. As his ministry informed the "NOZ", a total of 26 packs had been registered for nationwide monitoring by the deadline of 30 April.

    <TEXT>English version In view of the sharp rise in the number of corona infections, the Federal Government and the L #228;nder are planning to take more consistent action against mask grouches in public transport. A spokesman for NRW Transport Minister Hendrik W #252;st (CDU) confirmed that coordination between the Conference of Transport Ministers, Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) and the Federal Police is currently underway for a nationwide focus control before the end of this year, at the request of the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), which is published in Essen. "For passengers, wearing the mouth-nose cover is only a minor inconvenience, which will prevent a major catastrophe. Especially now, controls also strengthen confidence and the certainty that bus and train are safe means of transport," W #252;st told the WAZ. Low risk of infection in bus and train The mask on trains is the most effective remedy against coronavirus. The Ministry of Transport refers to a new study by Berlin's Charit #233; hospital, which had analysed a comparatively low risk of infection in buses and trains, provided that everyone obeyed the rules. Contrary to expectations, train conductors with many personal contacts were no more frequently infected with corona than other professional groups. Nevertheless, the current crisis seems to be leading to an increasing withdrawal into private transport. Still many mask grouches on the road Although the state government had already introduced a fine of 150 euros in the summer for violations of the obligation to cover one's mouth and nose on public transport, there are still many masked-up people in NRW. In September and October alone, for example, a large number of conscientious objectors were again conspicuous during local priority checks carried out by the Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association (VRR), the Rhineland Regional Transport Authority (NVR) and Westphalia-Lippe (NWL). On eight days 1981 infringements According to the Ministry of Transport, a total of 1981 infringements were detected on eight days of checks. The stations inspected were Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen, M #246;nchengladbach, Hagen, Neuss, D #252;ren, Horrem, Cologne, Troisdorf, Siegburg, Hamm and Paderborn. Prior to this, the state had already held a joint mask inspection day in public transport on 24 August together with the federal police and public order offices. At that time 1707 violations were detected. If the mouth-nose cover is not worn or not worn correctly in the train or station building, it is at the inspectors' discretion to immediately impose a fine of 150 euros</TEXT>
