    <TEXT>Hello /r/knitting ! I was wondering if any of you knew of a fairly simple yet elegant pattern for a shawl or scarf ? My grandma is turning 90 this year and I'd love to make her something beautiful and from the heart. I know all the basic stitches and have worked through some *kinda* intricate knit/purl patterns. And if there ever is a video tutorial I never fail. Any help to steer me in the right direction to find some simple, easy to pick up patterns would be much appreciated :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice on planning to buy a house !</TITLE>
    <DATE>2015-08-18 21:09:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello Personal Finance! My fianc #233; and I are considering buying a house when our lease is up. We recently moved into an apartment where everything has gone to shit. Simple maintenance requests haven't been filled and personal property has been stolen and nothing has been done by the office staff. Basically we're fed up with the renting life. Looking at the housing market in my area (Pacific Northwest Region), there seems to be a bunch of good deals. Scenarios where we'd be paying less monthly for an entire house than we're paying right now. But I don't know if my math is entirely accurate on that. My main questions for you are; a) What's a good formula for figuring out potential monthly mortgage costs? and b) Savings wise, where should we be before we can even actually go through with buying a house? We both have good credit and already pay utilities separate to our monthly rent costs. But any advice on making the transition to home ownership would be greatly appreciated :)</TEXT>

You have to go down a small hallway to get to it, but this hallway is often mistaken for a way to the bathrooms. Usually customers realize its not the bathroom when they see the door with big red letters that say "EMERGENCY EXIT ALARM WILL SOUND". Well, tonight we had a customer set it off. We asked her if she was looking for the bathroom only to find out she was trying to catch a Pokemon. . . I mean, I play too, but *come on* you were definitely close enough to catch it from your table. . .</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-09-20 05:34:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I liked Progressive. It had it's short comings but over all, I liked the general theme. The opening scene of episode one had me hooked, with the dark decay and destruction as Thank You, My Twilight played in the background. I even enjoyed the different art styles throughout the season, and while I felt some of it was poorly animated, I still appreciated how the art styles helped to paint a bigger picture. With Alternative, the opening got me going but then it just sort of. . . Fell flat. I already dont like "day-in-the-life high school girl" animes, so maybe that has something to do with it? Maybe it's because I can't really relate to the main characters, as my friend group wasn't so close knit in high school? I dont know. I'm going to watch it all the way through and give it a few more rewatches, but I'm really not getting a lot of the praise others here are giving it. It's probably just different taste in styles? The majority of this sub seemed to hate Progressive, but I enjoyed it. Now, everyone seems to be enjoying Alternative but I find it lackluster.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-20 06:22:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I tend to not make actual posts here, and I try to leave politics out of the comments I make while on this sub. But I feel today's events are a prime example of the hypocrisy many of us are fed up with. For those out of the loop, video footage surfaced today of a group of private school boys wearing MAGA hats surrounding and harassing a Native American Vet. Now, that alone is gross and needs no further explanation here. But the part I think this sub can sympathize with is that this group of boys were in the area to attend a pro life march. That's right. A group of high school boys attended a march to celebrate "potential and existing life", yet saw an opportunity to absolutely shit on the "existing" life part. It is something that leaves me utterly disgusted in my country, as well as my species as a whole. The fact that so many people can view life as being precious, but still show so little respect for actual life just drives me mad.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>PSA: Your hairdresser is probably much more familiar with trich than you think</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-17 07:29:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I know going to get your hair done can be hard when you have trich. But I think treating yourself to something like a nice cut and color can often help boost your confidence and maybe give you a new drive to refrain from pulling. I've been going to this salon by my house off and on for the last couple of years. The first time I went was just to trim up some split ends. The girl was looking at my hair and noticed my scattering of bald spots at the back of my head and asked, in a friendly way, what was going on there. I just said, matter of factly, that I have trich. She was so understanding and even recommended a new shampoo that would help with the itching that I have been using since, and it really has helped. I went in again a couple weeks ago and got my hair done by a guy I'd never worked with before. He asked the same question as he was trimming up the back of my head and I told him with the same tone of voice I would tell someone my eye color. He also instantly understood and even mentioned that he used to have a client who also had trich. I guess this is just a long winded way of saying, treat yourself to a nice salon day. The few times I've gone, i have left feeling more confident about my hair. Not only because a professional trimmed it up and made it look nice, but because they often provided helpful advice and understanding when I thought I would be greeted with judgement. Always remember, these people work with hair for a living, they probably see all kinds of crazy hair issues on the daily and know all sorts of tricks to help combat every day stressors like bald spots and regrowth patches. Edit: the shampoo I use now is Pureology. I use their color fix but they also have a hydrating and a thin hair formula.</TEXT>

It basically looks like an Airbnb specifically for dogs! My area mostly has large, fenced in backyards listed with a few acreage properties as well. I thought it was a fun idea some people over here might like to hear about. Seems like a good alternative to the dog park if your pup has any issue in that setting. Has anyone here dealt with the app before? My dogs do great at the dog park but they love exploring new areas so I thought I'd give it a try!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree that it's not true that all animals suffer all the time, and sure hyenas cannibalizing a pack member is more out of necessity than it is fun, but I think that brings up an important topic of where we draw the lines of instincts=okay or bad. I personally see an act being classified as cruel if the act itself is cruel, not if the being doing the act finds pleasure in it. Take pet ownership, there are people who own pets but don't care enough to provide those pets with a safe and healthy environment. They don't necessarily get enjoyment out of neglecting their pets, they are either too lazy or uneducated in how to properly take care of that pet. Their behavior is still cruel. In terms of instincts, obviously every living being has the instinct to eat in order to survive. Us humans were able to capitalize on that instinct to the point of exploiting other animals and land so we don't have to worry about lack of food. Put us in a post-apocolyptic scenario and we might be more inclined to turn to cannibalism to survive. Sure, it's our instincts that are pushing us to eat a member of our own pack in order to survive, but the act of consuming one of our own is still cruel. It's one of many acts that may be for the Greater Good, but is still cruel in nature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Breeders can easily be a bad choice if you go into the buying process without educating yourself, it's incredibly easy to end up buying from a backyard breeder or puppy mill if all you're looking for is "cute puppy of x breed". I always encourage people to look into rescuing before buying because you are capable of adopting any type of dog through a shelter or rescue, they just might not be that 8-week old puppy. But just because they're a little older and might have some scars doesn't mean they aren't capable of providing you with unconditional love and companionship. Every dog deserves a loving home, and there would be a lot less homeless pets out there if people stopped blindly supporting unethical breeders.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Eating hunted meat is arguably 1000 times better for the environment than switching to a plant based diet. You aren't destroying acres of natural habitat for farm land, the license you pay to hunt goes directly to environmental conservation, nothing about it leads to colony collapse in bees, and the only pollution you're contributing to is the gas you need to get your car to and from the hunt site (which is considerably less gas than food transportation trucks use). I've always been fascinated by the study of plant intelligence in relation to ethically consuming foods because it sheds a new light in how our farming practices need to change to be more harmonious with the other life forms on this planet. Obviously we all shouldn't be eating red meat three times a day, every day, but there is something close to arrogance about veganism that tends to turn it's back to the circle of life. I'm not saying it's okay to support factory farms and cruel living conditions, of course, but that I think we could all do well to keep an open mind to the circle of life and how we can symbiotically play a role in it. Edit: thanks for down voting a civil comment that adds to the discussion, it really shows how cultish you all can be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am very much aware of how the food chain works, though thank you for thinking I am not. Yes, the animals we eat are herbivores themselves. Perhaps I didn't explain my thinking well enough. In terms of the circle of life, and the food chain in direct relation, I think many of us forget the critical concept of One is All and All is One. The herbivores eat the plants, the carnivores eat the herbivores, the omnivores eat a bit of both, and eventually we all die and nourish the ground to allow vegetation to flourish, this allowing the cycle to repeat. We are all connected and rely on a system of symbiotic biology for there to be a sustainable ecosystem. And I'm not talking about saving plants, I'm talking about saving natural habitats. Remember, I am not advocating for the support of factory farming, but I am also not advocating for the destruction of natural habitats. Yes, livestock is currently taking up the majority of natural habitat destruction, and I take issue with that. The first link you posted mentioned livestock ranchers erradicating native predators in favor of their cattle. This is an issue I take very close to heart, as I have personally emailed my state's governor urging him *not* to side with said ranchers to conduct mass shootings on our local wolf populations. But I also take issue with wiping out native ecosystems to grow a farm of non-native plants for our consumption. Or exploiting our pollinators to the point that we only just started seeing colony collapse after using them for mass-pollination. Imagine if we all took on a little more responsibility, and instead of relying on capitalism to source our food we relied on ourselves. Instead wiping out native species in favor of non native plants and livestock, we sourced our own vegan and vegetarian diets from our own backyards and community gardens. Think of all the land that would free up to allow natural ecosystems to reconquer their native habitats. Yes, this thinking is ideal and doesn't paint reality, but it is a sentiment I think is important to hold on to when discussing alternative ways to source food. Again, as stated in a previous comment, I don't believe in a meat heavy diet. What I do believe in is a way of sourcing food that relies on ourselves instead of our money, and encroaches as little as possible on the homes of our earthly neighbors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The reasons you stated above are in relation to factory farming and ranching, not hunting. Hunting a herbivorous animal isn't taking up natural habitat with non native species to feed and sustain it, it is being sustained within the natural ecosystem of its environment. I agree there are too many people, but everyone seems to get their panties in a bunch when you ask them to cool it with their baby-makers. I also agree that meat is no effecient enough with the way we regard it currently. That's why I don't believe in meat heavy diet, or if it makes more sense this way; I believe in a plant-heavy diet. Yes, we can get sufficient nutrients from a plant based diet. But if we truly want to allow the Earth to be at it's most sustainable, we would create opportunities for natural habitats to regain their territory and flourish to a point that we could source meat as a fraction of our diet, and those actions would actually help those ecosystems to prosper. It's just too bad we keep fucking it up with over population and capitalism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not the person you replied to, but might shed some insight behind this line of thinking. To start, yes I am typing this on my phone. I would love to know a way to get by in this world without one. I also like in the US, a country built entirely off the exploitation of slaves. I don't condone slavery the same way I don't condone capitalism and an end to both would be a benefit for this world even though both concepts were able to accomplish so much. But as to why capitalism needs to end for us to truly save the planet has a few different parts. The obvious aspect is the corporate greed and billionaires who loby against change in favor of them keeping their wealth. But even if we do tackle that initial hurdle, there is still the fact that we are living in a consumerist-centric society. Yes, companies can switch packaging and delivery methods to be more in harmony with the environment, but at the end of the day capitalism promotes a "buy buy buy" mentality. It is still taking resources from the planet to satisfy consumer demands. Think of all the iPhones that are being abandoned right now in favor of the newest model, will that type of consumer behavior change even after taking corporate greed out of it? How many parts go into a phone that can be switched out for a more renewable material? If we really want to make changes to ensure the future of the planet, we should nip any possibilities of exploitation in the bud.</TEXT>

I posted here a while ago about tarot cards because I find them to be very interesting; and while there is a lot of woo behind them, there is still a rational explanation of how they work. Just because something isn't 100% rational doesn't mean it doesn't belong in this sub. There are a lot of aspects to being a psychonaut that aren't 100% rational, but I think it's important to be able to explore the rational side of those subjects with others who also wish to keep the discussions rational.</TEXT>

I had made a post here a while ago in relation to tarot and it's practical applications, I had stated in my post that I wished to pursue a rational discussion on the matter (as the roots of how tarot works are actually pretty rational in itself). Regardless of stating that I wanted to have a rational discussion, I still got the majority of comments telling me that it wasn't a topic that belonged here. No one was necessarily rude, but it was disheartening to be denied the chance to explore the rational side of an intriguing topic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well put. I was hoping for a discussion in my original post on how the imagery and symbolism of tarot is vague enough that whatever your subconscious picks up from it is what you intuitively take from it. But I was also very new to tarot when I made the post and probably came off a little too enthusiastic. And while it's true that dualism is inherently unscientific, I find it silly for so many users here to urge a closed mind after exploring psychedelics. Taking psychedelics is an irrational decision to make in and of itself. You consent to altering your state of reality, but then only wish to discuss the pure rational side of it (and I don't mean you, personally)? It just seems a little backwards. Psychedelics helped me realize the importance of balance in life, and I think this sub would be a great place if we all could accept a healthy balance between the dualists and the scientists.</TEXT>

Even with responsible breeding and health testing there is still a possibility of joint dysplasia in breeds that are predisposed to it, there are simply too many variables that attribute to that kind of health issue to completely rule it out through selective breeding. To condone dogs to a life in the shelter because you're scared of the possibility of a health issue just seems insincere to the reality that life is full of unexpected health issues for all of us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Employers rely on tip culture to keep their operation costs down. A good server in the US can pull $20-$30 an hour after tips. Good servers are a good chunk of the reason people come back to a place. If restaurant owners take away tip culture but keep their best employees, they need to pay a competitive rate to what was being made after tips. They would also need to raise the wages for kitchen and support staff considering many servers tip out a portion of their income to the BOH and support staff. So you're essentially looking at raising the wages of an entire operation by more than double, and while there are customers who are okay with paying that cost, there are also a lot of cheap asses in the states that stop supporting that business.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But most people don't leave a job where they're making that much bank. If you want a business to change their practices, you have to mess with their revenue. Stop supporting business that you don't agree with, is it really that hard of a concept to grasp? Edit: I should clarify, by "bring that rate down" I'm actually talking about the concept of "paying a living wage". Most servers are making anywhere from $20-$50+/hr after tips and everyone who in favor of getting rid of tipping is talking about only paying servers $15-$18/hr. You take that much of a pay cut and you'll look to other industries. Hell, I just left the industry and took that kind of pay cut, the only way I could rationalize it is I'm not dealing with the bullshit that exists in the food industry any more (and the bullshit had nothing to do with tipping and everything to do with asshole customers)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I actually love this detail of the show because it has so many different nuances. There's the obvious, that Aang is inexperienced in Fire Nation attire. There's also the point brought up in the OP, that the upside down headband represents his arrow. Then there's the implication that comes with wearing a symbol in reverse. It signifies rebellion against an establishment, you don't see Patriots sporting the flag upside down and you don't see Christians parading around with an upside down cross (unless they're sporting a poorly placed tattoo), the people you see embracing those things upside down are people who are against the establishment that those symbols represent. So yeah, Aang wearing his headband upside down is mostly out of being oblivious, but the symbolism behind the act also speaks volumes to Aang's character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So the way I see it, and the way you worded it, both OP and his ex GF are pushed by society to be something they aren't. For OP, he was always either too white or too colored depending on the person he was dealing with, for his GF she was always too manly for herself and supposed to embrace that. I can agree that sex dysphoria is a very isolated issue that is hard to fully relate to, but in a world where it's hard to come by tolerance for trans people, you would think it would be more important to bond over similarities instead of getting worked up over differences. Of course OP can't fully relate to having dysphoria, but from his side of the story it sounded more like an attempt to be empathetic in a trying time. Edit: I should also bring up the fact that his ex said that he would "never know what it's like for your body and mind to not be one and the same", and from OP's experience with racism, it's sounds like he has dealt with exactly those kinds of emotions.</TEXT>

Hell, last week I got a call from my husband while I was at work asking how I was doing in the middle of the storm- only there was no storm where I was and I was only a 20 min. drive away.

    <TEXT>What you're discussing are biproducts of living in a society, something that has not always been part of human existence. People chose to have children in prehistoric times as well. But many children that are able to survive today are only able to do so because of society, put them in a foraging group of hunter-gatherers and any kid born of C-section or with any disability wouldn't be able to survive *in the natural world we evolved from*. Hell, there's evidence of postnatal abortions being common in foraging groups, that is *certainly* not an approachable idea in any form of civilized society. My argument is that human nature has changed; Considering the invention of agriculture and civilization has moved us farther and farther away from our natural environment, we have also changed how we behave in our environments. The concept of a single mom wouldn't exist in foraging groups because raising kids was a communal effort, and yet there are so many single parents struggling today because of the requirements and pressures a civilized society puts on them.

    <TEXT>I get that, and what I am saying is that in the span of all of human history, human nature *has* changed. The biggest cause of human nature changing was the lurch into a civilized world, so of course the human nature of civilized humans from 5,000 years ago isn't different from that of today. But it is vastly different from what we originally evolved from. To narrow down the time frame is to ignore the parts of history that actually show how human nature has changed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We don't have a way of knowing concretely what Hunter gatherers thought, but archeologists have concrete evidence that they lived very different lives from even the Romans, and anthropologists have studied the handful of remaining foraging tribes that still exist help solidify those claims. The fact of the matter is that it hasn't *always* been Kings, Churches, and Businesses as driving forces of authority. Hunter-gatherers lead eaglitarian lifestyles where power never resided in one individual, it was constantly flowing. I get what you're saying, but you're essentially just moving the goal post to only encompass civilized history- I am talking about *all* of human history.</TEXT>

I definitely like to theorize and play in the space of possibilities to what's out there.

    <TEXT>But by that line of that you have to admit to believing in yourself as being a delusional thought. As you said, we cannot prove or disprove the existence of anything, that includes ourselves. For all we know, *we* could be the hallucinations or a simulation. But believing in yourself shouldn't be considered a delusional thought, much like I don't think the way people perceive the world after psychadelics should be considered delusional. I remember a post made to the DMT sub a while ago that kept referencing the machine elves working on the OP's eyes to make them better, well after he had smoked DMT. Sure the way the OP worded it could come off as delusional, but it was still a description of how he was experiencing reality. I can understand users on psychonatic subs getting fed up with much of the same, but I find it very disheartening for people to discredit people with a different perspective as being delusional. It's all about perspective in the end, and it comes off as disingenuous to scoff at "woo" and "spirituality" when we really *don't* know what's out there. At the end of the day, the people who believe in and practice woo do it because it helps give their life meaning, and are any of us really so deep into the machine of civilization that we can't respect the basic need for joy in life?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But you can't truly discard the existence of entities without also discarding your own existence. Everything you experience on a day to day basis is just chemicals firing in you brain. By your standards, you also shouldn't think the energy you get from coffee is real because it's just altering the chemicals in your brain. Our bodies naturally produce DMT, when we smoke it, we are just blocking the inhibitors that keep those hallucinations dormant until we enter sleep cycles. So no, what we see on DMT may not be real in our 3rd dimension reality, but that absolutely does not mean that what we see doesn't exist in some other dimensions. If anything, it's more delusional to discard the things you experience as fake simply because they don't fit the reality you are used to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It helps to not refer to the things that bring you happiness as work. We have this weird way of wording everything so that it seems like a chore. Instead of calling it "working out", call it "exercise". Instead of "working" on your mental health, start a journey of self discovery. Instead of a project you're "working on", you're building something new. The way we use our words has influence on how we experience the world. Sadly, a lot of us do have to go to work to make money to live, so the word "work" comes with unpleasant connotations. We shouldn't shackle the activities that help us be healthy and happy with such a negative word, it only dissuades us from following through on them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, I'm glad you brought up hearing voices, as it's really quite interesting. The Hearing Voices Network was founded in the 1980s by a Dutch social psychiatrist who had a hunch that far more people were hearing voices than originally thought. What's even more interesting is that most people who hear voices aren't hearing detrimental thoughts (like their parents are aliens trying to kill them). But going through a traumatic event in childhood increases the possibility of harsh voices(confirmed by studies like the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study). An anthropologist from Stanford named Tanya Luhrmann "found that #160;voice-hearing #160;experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture  #8211; in the United States, the #160;voices #160;are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful." It seems that taking a more westernized approach of categorizing these types of experiences as delusion and not a natural part of the human experience ends up having an even more detrimental effect to our psyches.</TEXT>

We place babies in sterilized incubators; send our children to schools with armed guards, metal detectors, and teachers who are legally forbidden to touch even a crying child; drop bombs across the globe that create more potential terrorists than they kill; and administer drugs that quiet voices we should be listening to. It hasn't worked and never will- a fact to which we seem to be slowly waking up.

There's a lot wrong with society, but how can you enact change if you can't even be kind enough to yourself to get you healthy? What I was talking about originally was changing how you word things to motivate yourself to actually do the things that are proven to improve health and happiness. Revolutions don't start when you're too depressed to get off the couch.

    <TEXT>If anything it's completely delusional to say that just because it doesn't fit your preconceived notions of reality that it couldn't possibly be real. The things you interact with on a day to day basis are just a result of chemicals in your brain, how can you say for certain that the reality you know isn't some elaborate dreamscape and everything and everyone you interact with are just being made of the same dream chemicals that get released when you smoke DMT. There's something seriously wrong with Western society where we would all rather turn our backs on the unknown and write something off as delusional if it doesn't fit our sterilized narrative of what we've come to think reality is. It's strange to think that people who hear voices and experience schizophrenic episodes in undeveloped or developing areas have friendly, sometimes spiritual experiences while many people in Western society experience hostility in their hallucinations. Sure, the things that people hallucinate may not be very real in the physical sense, but is everyone complaining here so delusionally sure of their notion of reality that they would rather write something off as bogus simply because they don't understand it? And before you come back with "because drugs altered your brain chemicals"- that's not true for schizophrenics and voice-hearers. And for those of us who have used drugs to alter those chemicals, so what? The experiences were still very there and very real using chemicals that *already naturally exist in our brains*. Everyone here saying it's okay to write off the hallucinatory experience as delusional should also be writing off the caffeine they get from coffee and the pain relief they get from Advil as delusional, because those are just drugs that effect the chemicals in our brain.</TEXT>

Yes, you need to coordinate with others on your esports team so that you can all practice together, but you don't need to pay a coaches salary or worry about team uniforms until you get to the professional level. Whereas ametuer football players still need to worry about those upfront costs. Idk, the other person making this argument may not be selling it the best, but it's a pretty logical statement to make.

Day two is the day I trip, and I make a point of doing it while the sun is up. I know I will take a walk at some point in the trip, and I have music, my journal, and painting/drawing supplies scattered about at home so that I can pick them up whenever I feel compelled to. Something I started doing on my third or fourth trip that I HIGHLY recommend to everyone, was I got a bathbomb from Lush, and took a bath with a preferential joint once my visuals start to fade. That's usually when I start to really listen to the kinds of thoughts my subconscious has bubbling under the surface, and that's when I start asking myself questions that will help get to the root of those thoughts. Again, I don't go into the trip with the intention of working on one specific thing. I think it's really important to listen to what could be laying under the surface because there are so many things that affect us that we may not even be aware of- I let my mind lead me to what it feels needs my attention. Day three is my "get your shit together" day, where I reflect on the things I've discovered with a more sober, albeit sleep deprived, mind.</TEXT>

You can start playing competitive esports at any age, and you're bank account will not be affected by it because the supplies needed to start playing are already part of your every day life (internet and computer), but if you want to start playing football competitively at any age, you need to join a team which comes with team dues, uniform fees, and you need to buy gear that is not part of most people's every day lives.

    <TEXT>Hi! I'm not OP and have no direct experience with dealing anything, but am very close with some ex-dealers and people who used to deal everything but now only deal psychadelics (as far as I know). If you're in a financial predicament that requires fast money, I totally get it. If you want to switch that cash flow to something more main stream, I would suggest the restaurant industry. I worked that gig for 6ish years, and depending on the company you get with, you're looking at at least weekly (maybe biweekly) pay. That being said, you're experience in the industry can vary drastically based off the company you work for. But if you have any semblence of a work ethic, you should be able to keep you head above water. The upside is that a restaurant gig encompasses a lot of different skills that you can use to build your resume, while having flexible hours and decent pay in the mean time. It's hell, but if you find the right team to vibe with it's more barrable than dealing with the real world alone. In my opinion, the goal of it all is to have the finances to have your basics covered while allowing yourself enough personal time to find the things you like in life (hence having flexible hours and decent pay). That way you know your living costs are met while still having time to explore what makes you *you*. Digging yourself out of a financial hole can be daunting, but finding the right things to make you rock can be it's own journey. It may take baby steps to get to that balance in life, but it is certainly something to pursue.</TEXT>

Like, no, you don't *need* a Rhodesian Ridgeback as your running partner. There are plenty of dogs in shelters or up for adoption through rescues that would make great running partners. In that sense, a dog *is* a dog. But yes, owning a pug is vastly different from owning a husky which is very different from owning a golden. People need to asses the type of lifestyle they need a dog to fit into, but unless they need that dog to do a specific job, there's probably a dog up for adoption that checks all their boxes.</TEXT>

I can understand wanting some more reasurrances and going to a reputable breeder, I wouldn't personally do it but I can understand it. But even getting a dog through a reputable breeder requires a decent amount of research and effort on the owner's part before even seeing their potential dog. The people who don't care enough to put in that effort are the ones who go the BYB route, and to them I stand by my statement that there is undoubtedly a dog in the shelter that would meet their needs.</TEXT>

On a smaller scale, you can think of the cycle of abuse as a kid growing up in a physically abusive family who grows up and feels justified in their own verbally abusive behavior towards their children because of what they went through. So their kids are now likely to go on and be abusive to others as well. On the larger scale, the cycle of abuse we are all experiencing is feeling justified in insulting the other side, thinking it's justified because of the shit hand they dealt us. Our behavior isn't any better than theirs, it just perpetuates the cycle to continue.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Literally did not die the same death, it just "means both" it's original definition and it's exact opposite now. And that small change in language has caused a substantial amount of miscommunication because of it. Never before has a term used to mark a generation been converted into any other meaning. In a sense, generational labels have been untouchable. Taking a term used to define a bracket of time that people were born into and changing it to reflect a "mindset" is a slippery slope. It's no different from people incorrectly referring to all young people as Millennials- just because they think the term encompasses anyone with a youthful outlook does not change the fact that their incorrect usage of the word makes them look like a total moron. I'm not mad about language changing, I'm mad that people think it's okay to focus on pissing off their fellow citizens over the issues the 1% created.</TEXT>

My husband has been in the legal industry up in Washington since 2013 and has always been interested in the different cannabinoids that affect us in different ways. According to him, CBD and CBG work in tandem with each other and are pretty similar. If your local shop is selling a heavy CBG strain, I'd say buy a gram and see what happens! But also, I'm hoping someone else here does have a study or article to link, because it truly is interesting how our receptors interact with different cannabinoids.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But there are aspects of woo that we have some explanation to. Chakras are associated with the 7 major glands along the endocrine system, including the third-eye which refers to the pineal gland. Dismissing them as woo is dismissing the fact that different cultures call the same things by different names. Considering we all evolved from the same single-celled organism, it's a bit silly to dismiss oneness as woo without also dismissing the theory of evolution. No, crystals can't actually heal you, but our brain is a powerful thing that can assign "power" to inanimate objects. An amethyst could *remind* you to relax instead of actually causing you to do so, the same way me seeing a dime on the street reminds me of my Nana's love instead of actually channeling her love to me. The way OP stated "you can keep your [woo]. . . Except love" before launching into their medical background comes off as not only dismissal, but a complete disregard to idea that there are aspects of woo that are grounded in reality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, chakras are not part of modern medicine, because modern medicine simply refers to it as the nervous system. "Chakra" first appeared in ancient Hindu scripture, so it is still a case of different cultures referring to the same thing with different words. As for the placebo effect, you hit the nail on the head. Just because someone achieves placebo through crystals instead of a sugar pill does not mean their placebo is any less real and effective.

    <TEXT>Considering they were talking about doctors prescribing things exclusively, it seems they are referring to both medical practice as well as modern medicine study. Now, I can't speak to the rest of the world in how they prescribe and treat illnesses, but there does seem to be an issue with treating symptoms instead of finding an underlying cause across the board with modern medicinal practices. And back to chakras, as mentioned in my previous comment, modern medicine refers to it as the endocrine system, which is understandable seeing that they don't form many medical terms from ancient Hindu scripture. That doesn't change the fact they are referring to the same thing (third eye chakra translates to pineal gland, root chakra translates to adrenal gland, etc.)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[An article about European doctors over prescribing antibiotics](https://www.healtheuropa.eu/overprescribed-with-antibiotics/89904/), and [an article claiming European doctors are suseptible to money from drug firms just like US doctors](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/30/individual-nhs-doctors-receiving-100000-per-year-from-drugs-firm/amp/). I could bombard you with a wall of text and argue how the meaning of chakras can correlate with the actual functions of the glands they are associated with, but I never intended to argue to legitimacy of chakras as a whole- I merely wanted to establish that they in fact have grounding in reality like the rest of woo does. I by no means buy into chakra meditation keeping me free of illness and physical harm (as some will argue), but I acknowledge that it's concept is rooted in actual physical parts of our reality. Considering the person you originally replied to referred to an individual doctor performing a specific task in addition to modern medicine as a whole, I'll stand by my statement there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>ELI5: The Democrats and Republicans are like immature middle schoolers (this is not part of the analogy, this is a statement on their behavior). These middle schoolers have two different basketball teams for their school. The blue team complains to the school that the red team's biggest player is playing unfairly and should be removed. The school's athletic department reviews the red team's player and finds that he is playing unfairly, but it is up the the school board as to if it's actually okay to remove the player from the game. Only the school board has a lot of members whose kids play for the red team and therefore benefit from having a champion play for their team- it means they are more likely to win again in the future. This is a terrible ELI5 as I know it doesn't follow logic in how school sports actually function. But then again, the Republicans backing this clown also doesn't follow any logic. Any true Republican, and any true American for that matter, would be appalled at this President's behavior and would be able to follow the facts and see he is worthy of both impeachment and removal of office. But our politics have become so divided that the Republicans would rather dig their heels into insanity if it means they can continue to hold power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So you dodge taxes, grown your own food, travel by your own means (ie by foot or build your own transport), and make all your own goods? If not, then you are part of society. Not that you should find shame in being part of it, just stop telling yourself lies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Being a loner means you are a loner. But not being part of society, as you claim, means you do not participate I society in anyway. That includes not paying taxes (which benefit society), and not using the tools that society has produced (like modern transportation, or the internet). Nothing I have said implies that I love society, only that I implore you to stop being a hypocrite. I by no means love society, but I also don't encourage being a hypocrite that claims to be not part of something I am deeply engrained in. What I do encourage is being real with yourself. Come on, you're using Reddit to complain about society when society is what sustains Reddit in the first place. If you were true to your word, you wouldn't be on Reddit to complain. But you are. If you hate society, *stop lying to yourself* and realize that the only way to get rid of the society that you hate is by taking it down from the inside out. No one is stopping you from living in the woods or on an unihabited island other than yourself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You claim that I am a society lover yet you belittle the mere act of "living like apes". Yeah, I think you're projecting there, buddy. You don't need money to live without society, it may make it easier but it isn't necessary, our ancient ancestors were doing it well before any of this civilization bullshit came along. Learn to forage and make your own shelters, or tell me that you aren't willing to live like a being of the natural world. But don't claim to be above society while belittling the beings that are able to live in this world without it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Living in a city, buying from markets and using public transportation is the definition of participating in a society, Creating a commune is participating in that commune's society. Just because you choose not to interact with people who don't understand you doesn't mean you aren't participating in society. As I said to the other poster, there isn't issue with participating in society, but stop making hypocritical claims about being separate from society when you are actively participating in it. Edit: and we all must constantly change, that's how we grow. Someone unwilling to see how they are capable of changing is a sure sign of immaturity, imo.</TEXT>

Society has made it increasingly easier for people to find their niche groups thanks to things like the internet and the mere fact we have overproduced to the point of having 8 billion people on this planet.

    <TEXT>The difference between us seems to be that I am using the full literal definition of the word society while you are cherry picking aspects of the word that do or don't work for you. As I addressed in my last comment, society isn't only about services but social groups as well- so we seem to be on the same page of that part of the word's meaning. Your top comment states: "I am not part of society", considering the last three replies I've gotten from you admit that you are part of society, it seems I have succeeded in pointing out the hypocrisy of that original statement. Thanks for the replies, have a good one.</TEXT>

I don't even want to get into Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. . .

Throughout the year, whenever you see something that a family member or friend would like, buy it and then feed it to Christmas. Then, on December 23rd next year, all you need to do is go out and buy wrapping paper and ask Christmas for all your purchases back.

    <TEXT>The imagery reminds me of [The Magician Tarot Card](https://images.app.goo.gl/wXs9AcvARuGVSE888). "He stands with one arm stretched upwards towards the Universe, and the other pointing down to the earth. His positioning represents his connection between the spiritual realms and the material realms. The Magician uses this relationship to create and manifest his goals in the physical realm. He is the conduit that converts energy into matter." For the subject in question, instead of pointing to the universe and earth, he holds them in his left and center hands, converting energy into matter with the bowl of ayuhuasca in his right. "On the table in front of him are the four symbols of the Tarot suits  #8211; a cup, pentacle, sword and wand  #8211; each symbolising one of the four elements  #8211; water, earth, air and fire. It is also a sign that he has all the tools (and elements) he needs to manifest his intentions into being. #160;" For our subject, I view these tools as the sage, mushrooms, crystals, and skulls around his feet. "Above his head is the infinity symbol, and around his waist is a snake biting its own tail  #8211; both of which signal that he has access to unlimited potential." His infinity symbol is the eagle soaring upwards, and his oroboros is the third eye mushroom directly in front of him. There are obviously differences between the piece you posted here and the interpretations of the tarot, but I thought the similarities were interesting. All quoted text was pulled from Biddy Tarot, for anyone wondering.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you provide some more info on him and how he's an oligarch? I wasn't paying much attention to him until Iowa and New Hampshire and have only done some reading up on his policies through his own website. Right now my only issue with him is the same issue I have with the Democratic nomination process in general, everyone is essentially spouting the same campaign promises that Bernie has consistently been fighting for his entire career. . . .But it would be pretty cool to be able to factually say we have a gay president.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not necessarily how the system is set up now, though. Most products sold on Amazon are fulfilled by independent sellers who ship their items in bulk to Amazon warehouses (to more easily fill Prime orders)- this is considered FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon), as opposed to FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) where the independent seller is responsible for shipping their items. Source: I work for a retailer that sells part of it's inventory on Amazon. So, instead of having one truck ship products from a factory to a retailer, we have trucks taking product from a factory to a retailer, who then have a truck take the product from the retailer to an Amazon warehouse, where we them have multiple additional taking those products to multiple different neighborhoods. Essentially we have anywhere from 2-4 times the amount of trucks running deliveries under Amazon's current model, in a world where it is still common for people to go out to the store with their own cars. That doesn't even include the amount of wasteful steps Amazon mandates their sellers take to participate in FBA. Everything needs to be in ziplock polybags, taped shut, with a barcode and suffocation warning label- I have had to do this for products that otherwise would not need all the extra packaging if it were being sold on the shelf at a store. It's nice of Jeff Bezos to pledge money towards fighting climate change, but it would be a lot nicer if the business that made him his billions didn't have such a shitty means of production.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amazon requires all the extra, wasteful steps to improve efficiency at their warehouse. We do not go through nearly as much waste (both in terms of truck shipping and packaging waste) when we ship the same products out through our own store. Amazon demands these extremely wasteful steps in the name of efficiency/cost savings- it makes it easier for their warehouse worked to quickly grab an item and stay on top of their absurd time quotas they have to make. The process is good for Amazon, but terrible for the environment and a waste of time for workers like me who have to individually bag and label products for their warehouses.</TEXT>

The long of it is that those restaurant owners are bags of shit (the obvious) that realize there is some weird balance that can be achieved through tip culture. Tip culture allows employers to pay their employees minimum wage (and sometimes less than that) with the implication that customers will ensure those employees get what they're worth after the fact. If employers wanted to pay their employees what they are worth, employers would raise their menu prices or charge a service fee to cover the cost of labor that having a wait staff entails.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well put. I started taking this same defense for religions after I started experimenting with psychadelics. Before, I was a hard core athiest, but now I see there is inherent worth in regarding what different religions have to offer in perceiving the world. I like to refer to it as trying on hats. Sometimes it's nice to wear a Christian hat, sometimes it's nice to wear a Hindu hat, sometimes an athiest hat. Depending on the situation, there is usually a "hat" to wear that will help in understanding the bigger picture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for this. I've been wanting a post like this in this sub for a while, though I could never articulate it as well as you did. I was getting ready to unsub from here with all the hate woo was getting. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there should be room here for people who push crystal medicine, essential oils and chakra meditation as a cure for cancer. But that doesn't mean that these kinds of practices can't be beneficial in other ways. I've recently taken up reading tarot as a tool for self-reflection. Having a practice that encourages me to sit and reflect and ask my inner self big or hard questions has been a very useful way for me to address parts of myself that need work while still celebrating parts of my life that bring joy. On my last acid trip, I actually had a pretty profound tarot reading to help mold my mindset for the trip. When I tried posting to this sub about it, seeking further rational discussion, half the comments just discarded it or told me to seek therapy while others simply said it didn't belong here (which I didn't understand because I stated I was seeking a *rational* discussion). Yeah, therapy is great and helps and all that, but I'm not made of money and can't just skip ahead on my therapist's waiting list whenever I feel like it- but my cards/ritual is always ready and there when I feel the need. Sorry, I started to ramble there. Again, thank you for this well articulated post. I would love if this sub could start incorporating more rational discussions of woo that don't divulge into "superior intellect" belittling of it. Life is about balance, and like sugar, a bit of woo helps make life sweeter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On your last point, do you think meditation, reading and journaling would be more fulfilling than therapy, or tarot reading? Meditation and journaling are already part of my tarot reading practice. Without getting too into it, a tarot reading for myself looks like: meditation and inner reflection, as I search inside for the type of question that would best to ask the tarot (typically anywhere from 10-20 min of meditation), once I have my question, I ask the tarot and conduct the reading, based on the cards pulled and my intuitive response to them, I journal the question I asked, the cards I pull, and my interpretation of what they mean and how they can help me grow in whatever field is relevant. It's extremely fulfilling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No expert, but gen Z has gotten more opportunities to train with new technologies in school. I have an old high school friend who teaches fourth grade in a low-income public school but they still have programs that allow students to work with 3D printers, learn coding etc. Us millennials didn't really have those opportunities, or they only started becoming available to us at the tail end of our education. With low-income Gen Z kids being able to learn these skills in a public school instead of having to wait for higher education (if that's even possible for them), they're more likely to enter the workforce with at least a couple of relevant skills under their belt.</TEXT>

And especially when much more dangerous drugs exist, like alcohol (or have you never seen a mentally ill person dealing with alcoholism).

It literally doesn't make a difference, the shirts are still clean and wrinkle free either way. If you don't want your kid to pick up the habit, have him suffer the consequences of acting like your wife and make him turn his clothes right-side-in before you help him get dressed.

Something that made me feel less lost was reading Civilized to Death by Christopher Ryan. This book is an interesting read at worst and mirror of truth at best. All in all, it gave me a lot to think about in ways that have helped me find an understanding with these "lost" feelings.

    <TEXT>Just to tack on to the anti-prong collar gang, doing both wouldn't necessarily stop them from more hurting way later. Dogs learn through assosiaction. While teaching them that walking properly on leash by associating good behavior with treats may take longer, it is definitely the safer approach to ensuring they don't hurt more later on. When using a prong collar, the goal is to have the dog associate pain with pulling on the leash, but that may not be the stimulation they associate with the pain. For example, they could be pulling on the leash and having the prong "correct" them as another dog passes by their line of sight, or a person wearing sunglasses or anything else. You don't know what association your dog is making with the prong correction and because of that, it can lead to reactivity issues later on. I know I wouldn't feel too great about other dogs if every time I saw one and tried to go say hi I got pronged in the neck. That doesn't even go into the physical harm that is caused by prong collars and they type of damage it does to a dog's trachea.</TEXT>

Plenty of individuals have had their own unique turns of fate that have sent them down cascading paths of financial instability, but not everyone has been able to sympathize with them until now. The only money Bernie wants to take and directly redistribute is money from billionaires. The kind of people that made their fortune by exploiting the working class. Think about how much the government would be able to help it's citizens without going further into debt if we had been taxing the rich individuals and corporations accordingly in the first place. It is not the panhandler on the street nor the government trying to help him that you should have beef with.

    <TEXT>Thanks for the links. Pretty interesting reads. I'd say it's positive because I'm only just now coming into a point of privilege where those kinds of numbers can come off as "scary" for me. But now that I have that kind of money that I obtained through capital gains and through estates, I'm only just now being able to afford taking care of my personal and mental health. It shouldn't have to be that way in American, someone shouldn't have to trudge through financial instability until they can start claiming estate or capital gains (if they're lucky) to be able to afford living a healthy life. I honestly find that to be more absurd than the notion that everyone should contribute to everyone else's well being. Have fun supporting a pedophile. Maybe one day you'll realize we're all on this rock together and the number behind the dollar sign was made up by us and shouldn't be the barrier between everyone living well or not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not like these restaurants voluntarily signed up for it, they're just working with the hand dealt to them. For a lot of restaurants their options are to either remain open with take out/delivery being operated by a skeleton crew or close their doors indefinitely (and maybe not reopen). This also all happened pretty quickly, it's not like these restaurants had time to form a comprehensive plan for ensuring their delivery/take out operations were air tight. Sorry, but bitchy Karen's get no sympathy from me. Complaining about an incorrect take out order in the middle of a global pandemic has to be the epitome of first world problems and entitlement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Or they have and people have already bought the new product. Most stores are still adjusting. Normally they only need to restock a portion of inventory, not the entire shelf's worth. Most suppliers aren't able to fill every store's full inventory needs right now. So stores may get their usual 10 packs of toilet paper even though they need 50 to be fully stocked. And all it takes is ten people (or couple completely selfish ones) to get there before you to clear that inventory out. Trucks are still delivering to stores daily, so there are still items for employees to stock. It's just that everything is still in high demand and therefore gets bought up more quickly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't disagree with that, and I jump between bitterness and acceptance. Psychadelics have definitely helped me see continued beauty in the world. However, going through what I went through, I would never take the chance to bring someone else into this world to experience suffering. My parent's family life checked all the boxes for the perfect nuclear family, but mental illness turned everything on its head in what felt like a matter of seconds. My own personal suffering stops with me, that is true. But we all collectively experience suffering together. Life does not guarantee pleasure or happiness- it's only guarantee is death. And because I can never guarantee that my offspring will not experience the pains of mental illness, I will never subject them to this world. If others wish to continue to reproduce and subject their own to the pains of life, then so be it- I just hope they have a decent answer if their children ever ask why they so selfishly involuntarily signed them up for this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are correct that life is always capable of suffering. And yes life will always "find a way", so bringing the voluntary extinction of our specie's would only be a drop in the bucket to ending suffering for all living things, but it is the only aspect of life that we have direct control over and therefore is the only aspect to life that we can change. As a more lax anti-natalist, I don't try to get others to think like me as I know I'm essentially asking others to go against their nature and that my views are somewhat unpopular. If people want to continue to reproduce and risk subjecting their children to extreme or unknowable suffering, then that's their perogitive and they can do so if they wish. I just know I wouldn't sign up for this if I had the choice, so it seems hypocritical of me to sign others up for it as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your original comment simply quoted Carl Sagan. All I did was offer a different perspective. How was I supposed to know that's your coping mechanism without any context? It wasn't my intention to ever shit on your coping mechanism. Once you mentioned your coping mechanism, I brought mine up as well because you're right- everyone copes differently. I only stated that psychadelics helped me personally, I did not advocate that it would be the same for others. Psychadelics taught me that none of us have the answer, and that's okay. We should all just live life the way we see fit, I saw it fit to bring a different perspective into the discussion and I see fit not to produce more people carrying inherent mental illness genetics. The rest is just a game of finding the joy where you can and one day it will eventually all be over. Thanks for the talk, hope you stay safe in these crazy times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's unscientific to ask for evidence? So do you have any scientific studies that positively determine that the higher marriage rates and lower fertility rates are because of anti-natalisim and not because of high cost of living in congruence with lower wages and increased debt makes it harder to start a family at the same age as boomers? The average living conditions in US today could push someone to have anti-natalist views, however there is no scientific data to back that claim, and many people who are unable to have children because of their current financial state may still want them in the future.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You made the statement: anti-natalisim seems to be the majority view I asked for evidence of such. You claimed there may be a correlation based off higher age of marriage and lower fertility. I brought up the much more established correlation being that high cost of living/lower wages/higher debt has caused young people to put off marriage and children. You can find plenty of articles supporting this correlation with a quick Google. You still made the initial claim that anti-natalisim is a majority view with nothing but a feeling that there may be a correlation, and when asked for evidence you were unable to do so. And have continued to try and to belittle me by questioning my reading comprehension and classifying my thoughts as "loserthink". I have evidence to back my claims. I will ask again, do you?</TEXT>

Our company has an online store but we are not even close to being a medical supplier. He feels it's okay because he's barely selling above cost(i.e. he's "not selling for profit") and wants to provide masks for our clientele because it's hard to travel without masks. My co-worker and I drafted a joint letter that stuck to the facts and expressed our feeling uncomfortable about this considering hospitals are asking for donations of exactly this type of supplies. He thanked us for the input but seems set in his ways about this. Both my coworker and I feel lost for words, does anyone here think we did the wrong thing?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gotta love this "denying them their right to live naturally" argument because vegans and vegetarians aren't above this shit either. Mono-cropping agriculture destroys acres of natural habitat for not only the cute and fuzzy native animals but also the essential microbes that allows soil to remain fertile. So does living in any kind developed area, as there were plenty of native species that had to be displaced or eradicated for urban sprawling to happen. If you care about animals being able to live "naturally" you'd stop buying your food from grocery stores that supply through mono-cropping, pick up a gardening style that implements polyculture, and support your local hunters whose licenses go directly to wildlife conservation and whose practices don't destroy acres of natural habitat. Death is a natural part of life. Death fuels life. If you aren't one of those people who want their body embalmed and put in a box, your body will feed the soil to allow herbivores to thrive and therefore allows omnivores and carnivores to thrive as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Avon and Amway are some of the biggest MLMs in the US and they test on animals (Avon has only JUST stopped testing on animals *this year*). Animal cruelty is still very common in the US and has only recently started to subside with newer brands promoting cruelty free. My point is that MLMs don't rely on proven science to test or sell their products, so it is very easy to see people calling for "bear bile gives shiny healthy hair" and buy into it the same way they buy face serums, detox teas, and all the other products pushed by MLMs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What sort of suggestions have you given her? I know for myself, my pulling is most in control either right after I get my hair professionally done (obviously not an option right now) or if I have a hobby that keeps my hands busy (I really like knitting for this reason). I'm not sure where you're located and if you and your friend are being affected by any lock down, but maybe you can try to find a hobby that you can work on together? Sometimes the hardest part about taking suggestions is that we feel we have to act on them alone. Maybe you can try to schedule video or phone calls where you can work on some sort of project together (knitting, gardening, anything you both might be interested in that requires using your hands). I feel it's important to mention that my pulling is always at it's worse if I'm given nothing but time to sit and pull. Like the nail biting scenerio, I'll often reflect on what I've done and feel terrible about it, which only leads to more stress which causes more pulling. But on good days where I use my time more constructively, I'm much more likely to continue feeling positively about myself and if I do catch myself pulling, I'm more likely to adjust my actions instead of wallowing in my own mess. If that makes sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's also a matter of safety. Even ballerinas who dance in demi pointe (or flat) never carry their weight in their heels. Proper technique has your weight sitting in the balls of your feet and squared on the floor, when you're en pointe, that weight gets shifted to be carried over your metatarsals (the tiny bones in your feet/toes). Proper technique isn't just about looking aesthetically pleasing, it's also about performing these feats in the safest way possible. Shifting the bulk of the weight back to the heel could result in ankle, knee, and foot injuries because our bodies don't physically align to carry weight in our heels in ballet positions.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I'm considering using this time in quarantine to finally take the plunge and transition to raw. Worried about providing variety to my dog with minor food sensitivity.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-09 18:04:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I've been slowly dipping my toes into research and scouting local places to source a raw diet for my two dogs and cats. I figured with all the free time I have, now is the best opportunity for me to fully monitor their transition from kibble. The thing I'm most concerned about is my one dog has minor food sensitivity to chicken and lamb. We give freeze dried chicken and lamb lung occasionally that she loves, but she'll start to develop "rhino skin" and refuse to eat if she's on a chicken or lamb kibble after about a month of being on it. We've been feeding a whitefish and rice kibble that she seems happy with for now. Obviously I wouldn't be feeding the same raw protein for a solid month, but I was wondering if there is a potential issue with sticking to feeding primarily "cool" protiens(rabbit, whitefish, duck). Would that provide enough variety with the occasional chicken/beef/pork? Does organ meat fall under the same grouping? Or is the concept of hot/warm/neutral/cool proteins a bunch of hullabaloo?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-12 02:26:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>This community has been a great escape from the mysticism that you tend to find in other Psychonaut subreddits. I feel more confident in posting and commenting on this sub with the expectation that I will receive rational advice or discussion inducing content here, rather than pursuing such discussions on other drug based subs. With that in mind, are there existing forums where people of psychonautic mindsets are able to share and discuss books that feed into Psychnautic views? I personally enjoy books that question the status quo of life and implement research based facts to prove their point. But I often worry that I am just fulfilling validation. With the internet being the way it is, it's almost daunting to dive into researching a topic when you know there may be other research out there that disproves your point and you aren't scientifically literate enough to fully comprehend either side's points. If there's an online community that embraces non-biased discussion of literature subjects like psychadelics/nutrition/lifestyle, I would greatly appreciate a step in the right direction. Otherwise, I would like to express my interest in such a "bookclub" that stems from communities such as this. I was wondering if anyone else here had similar feelings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you to everyone who replied! I love the suggestions, and while I may not be the best person to start a new sub or discord server, I'm not afraid to look into it! Idk of it's just me, but I would love the opportunity to discuss books that cover more than just the human psyche or drugs (though I am interested in both of those topics). A couple of books I have read, or am currently reading, include Civilized to Death, The Vegetarian Myth, and Blueberry Muffins are Up a Buck a Pair. The first two I would categorize as "lifestyle" books, but only because they have lended advice to the types of questions I started asking myself after experimenting with psychadelics. The last is a work of fiction, but is such an enjoyable read that caters to the psychadelic mind that I love recommending it to anyone who might be interested. I can look into the logistics of moderating a sub or discord server this week. If anyone has any advice or experience they'd like to share, it would be greatly appreciated. :) I'm so happy there are others who like the idea of discussing literature pertaining to psychadelics viewpoints, I love book clubs :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Without trying to sound rude, this meetup never should have happened. For one, our state of Washington is in a "Stay Home, Stay Safe" order, meaning unnecessary visits from friends are UNNECESSARY. Second, you just moved that same day? As someone else who just moved, moving is an extremely stressful event for a dog to go through. My two dogs only just started to eat regularly again after taking a couple *weeks* to adjust to our new house. Neither dog is in the wrong here, they were just put into an extremely stupid situation by their owners. Give your dog time to adjust to his new environment before throwing in exciting new stimuli to experience, and wait for the shelter in place orders to be relaxed before having anymore unnecessary meetups. You can look into muzzle training your dog to appease your friend as well, but if your dog has played well with puppies in an outdoor setting, then you should probably reintroduce them in an outdoor setting instead of a brand new indoor space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get the being friends with co-workers and already sharing close proximity for 40 hours a week, IMO that totally negates the worry about social distancing since you two aren't necessarily going out of your way to interact with people you don't already interact with on the daily. The whole moving situation seems more like it was just a learning experience for everyone. Your yard probably would have made a good enough neutral territory, but with energy running high in an enclosed, new environment it was all probably a little too stimulating for your pup to handle in a polite way. I think the muzzle might be a nice gesture twords your friend, but considering your dog didn't bite or break flesh he would probably be okay meeting in a nice, neutral environment when the time is right. But like others have said, if you do go with a muzzle, make sure to train it properly so that the experience will be all the more smooth.</TEXT>

Deer antlers are great and can last a while, frozen Kong's of peanut butter or Kong's with the right size kibble/treats are good too. Raw bones will do wonders to their coat and teeth, but if you're giving weght bearing bones make sure you supervise their chewing- my girl will grind her teeth to the gums if she's left alone with a raw beef bone for too long.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gotta disagree there as OP doesn't seem to be asking about how to approach drug use in general, they want to share in the psychadelic experience with their kid. And age totally matters with psychadelics, you need to allow your brain and consciousness to fully develop before you start picking it apart if you want to go about using in a safe way. Also have to disagree that psychadelics fall into the hard drug category, I definitely wouldn't lump them in with cocaine or heroin. And that being said, the psychadelic world, while filled with weirdos, is overall a pretty positive and friendly space.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As others have said, it totally depends on multiple variables like your parenting style and the type of person your son is. But if you both are comfortable with the idea, I would wait until he's at least in his early twenties to allow his brain to mature more fully. I was always interested in psychadelics but was worried about the possibility of a bad trip. After doing my own research and coming to terms with wanting to do it of my own volition, I was ready to take the dive and I was 22. And I was so glad I had waited until I had experienced adulthood and had taken the time to come into my own personality. I think tripping together can be a very powerful experience, I know I would love to trip with my mom but she wouldn't be down. But tripping with someone who loves you, and loves you unconditionally, is a truly magical experience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can agree that psychadelics are more intense than other "hard drugs" but I think there's just a difference in the words we are using. Sure, psychadelics are bound to be more impactful and have lasting effects (be that good or bad) than coke or meth. But you are more likely to ruin you body and life due to the *addiction* that comes with using cocaine, heroin or meth. Psychadelics aren't chemically addictive in the same way, and while I agree they need to be regarded as something more serious than a fun party drug, I still don't think the word "hard drug" is necessarily the best word to categorize them in. They feel more like a "tool", because you can use them constructively or you can harm yourself by "dropping the hammer on your foot" so to say. They can also make you act like a tool if used incorrectly haha.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not necessarily against veganism, but I get real tired of the disassociation from the circle of life that some vegans have. Don't get me wrong, ending unnecessary suffering is a noble effort, but the way you hear some vegans go off on it, it's like they don't realize that their plant based diet needs death to fuel it's life just like any other living thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even with dogs, you will hear vegans argue that "because they are omnivores, they can be fed a veggie/vegan diet" but it is entirely ill-informed. Dogs are facultative carnivores, which is very similar to being an omnivore. Basically, dogs can survive, but not thrive, on a meatless diet. And honestly, if you don't want to do everything in your power to make your pet thrive in life, why even have a pet in the first place?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>And what happens if everyone switches to a plant based diet? Sure, there won't be as many factory farmed plots of corn and wheat, but what do you think those farms would do after a global change in diet? They'd start providing food for humans in a more direct way and still cause devastation to native ecosystems. Colony collapse in bees wasn't observed until we started using them to mass pollinate crops like avocados and almonds and those avocado and almond farms still needed to destroy acres of natural habitat for native animals and micrbiomes alike to provide food for humans. I'm not saying that makes it okay to support factory farming of animals, I'm just saying vegans who think that not eating meat solves the problem aren't looking at the bigger picture.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Modern agriculture is eating *any* of the food you buy at a supermarket, and that includes the fruits and veggies you eat. Modern agriculture is responsible for destroying topsoil and making it impossible for native life to flourish- which in turn would help the environment flourish. Say demand for factory farming ends tomorrow and everyone switches to a vegan diet. The farmers who grew soy, wheat, and corn for livestock aren't just going to go away, they'll start farming crops to be delivered directly to humans instead. Their practices are still devastating to the environment. I think we can all agree that bees are pretty important to the overall health of the planet. It wasn't until we started using them to mass pollinate crops like avocados and almonds that we observed the phenomenon of colony collapse. Just because current practices favor feeding livestock a plant based diet over humans doesn't mean that cutting out the middle man (livestock) inherently does wonders to modern day farming practices.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think we're saying the same thing here? I'm saying if demand for vegan foods increases, farmers who used to grow livestock feed will switch to growing food for humans to meet demand. But their modern day practices of agriculture are still causing natural habitats to be destroyed. The problem is modern day agriculture. Animal suffering doesn't stop with the abolition of factory farming animals. Mono-cropping leads to the destruction of natural habitat for native animals and forces us to exploit our pollinators which leads to colony collapse. If you wish to reduce animal suffering as much as humanly possible, you would switch to maintaining an organic garden (which relies on the remains of animals to flourish).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm aware most of our modern practices aren't sustainable, which is why I'm advocacting for an end to modern day agriculture. I was a vegetarian/vegan for five years, and my health suffered tremendously because of it, even after putting in the effort to balance nutritional intake. I made the switch to a plant based diet because I didn't want to contribute to animal suffering. I was big on learning about organic farming because of my want to preserve the environment. And it was these two vegan-minded shifts in lifestyle that I came to the understanding that our plants rely on the nutrients of decomposing bodies to keep the soil healthy, and that if we want to do right by the environment, we will provide it with the nutrients it needs, just like if we want to do right by animals, we will stop exploiting their natural habitats and resources in the name of mono-cropping. I also realised I wanted to do right by my health, which meant switching back to a diet that my body was more naturally able to absorb nutrients from.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The statistics you use are in reference to meat raised in factory farms, but I'm not advocating for rasing meat in factory farm settings. When allowed to graze on a biologically appropriate diet, cows, goats, and chickens all work symbiotically with their grasslands to provide an environment where both the land and the animals benefit from it. Your statistics also don't affect sourcing meat through hunting. Crop demand for corn, wheat and soy will go down, but demand for foods like almonds(which needs 1900 gallons per pound), avocados(which needs 84 gallons per avocado) and other nuts and fruits will increase. And while the increase in demand for these new foods may not equate to the exact same land usage as animal feed, with it comes the increased demand to exploit our pollinators, and using pollinators in mass settings of mono-cropped farms leads to colony collapse. All the while, mono-cropping destroys the land it is grown on, it washes away topsoil and obliterates the thousands of life forms that live within it. It doesn't allow the earth to sustain itself, and therefore doesn't allow the earth to help us sustain ourselves.</TEXT>

I do think, however, that our current food demands and practices in general are out of touch with nature and simply cutting out meat or animal products isn't the best path towards finding sustainable balance. I believe in implementing practices of closed loop agriculture to obtain sustainability. But I don't know if closed loop agriculture can hold up to meat demands of modern humans. Although, I think modern humans demand too much in general.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Using dead animals is the most optimal way to go about growing food and maintaining healthy soil in a *sustainable* way. If the goal is to prevent animal suffering, then the goal is to create an environment that lets animals flourish in the long term. Soil is filled with thousands of life-forms, many of which thrive best on biodiversity. You can provide that biodiversity naturally in a closed loop system, or you can provide for it synthetically but doing so synthetically is only keeping your eye on the short term goal and doesn't leave much room for future animals to thrive in life.</TEXT>

Looking for some high quality Plague Doctor Costumes (that are as breathable as possible) to either purchase, or ideas on how to make them myself.

They aren't the most sanitary place to begin with, but this Faire is the one consistent thing I look forward to annually. I would love to attend, under the one condition that I dress appropriately and protect myself (hence the Plague Doctor costume). I've looked online and it's hard to discern between quality and crap with this kind of genre. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it :) I'm also not affraid of trying to make my own if there are suggestions for that :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It kind of looks like you're focusing more on winding up and twisting into the turn instead of lifting up and letting your core rotate you. I'd recommend cross posting this to /r/BALLET, there are lots of dancers over there who give great advice. Start with a basic repetition of pas de bourr #233;, relev #233; and hold in passe, then land in fourth position. Repeat a few times and then move on to doing the same thing but completing a single pirouette and landing in fourth for a few repetitions before moving on to doubles and triples. As you're doing this, think about how the force of the ball of your foot pushing into the ground is what is allowing you to rise up, and focus on how all the muscles in your feet, leg, and butt, connect with your core (and also how keeping your ribcage closed helps engage your core). Remember, turning isn't just spinning your body around in circles, it's an act that uses your calves, thighs, glutes, core, and even upper body muscles. Learning to engage all of these simultaneously is what leads to a perfect pirouette.</TEXT>

I'd reckon most of the celebrity deaths today don't get as much recognition because there are just SO MANY. We've reached that point in time where a lot of the greats are starting to die off, it's hard to stay on top of one celebrity death before another gets announced (especially now with covid). Yeah, it's kinda weird that people will ask where you were on the day Princess Diana died, but it's such a tragic story that its hard not to remember the details of where you were when you heard about it. Hell, I remember where I was when Michael Jackson died simply because the details were so wacky I couldn't believe it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I've been buying pre-mixed raw from my local butcher. Thoughts?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-11 04:16:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I have a local butcher that I absolutely love. They sell pet food in their freezer section and the label only lists its contents as "pork, beef, and chicken". It's also extremely convenient and affordable (like less than $3/lb). I've emailed them asking for more info about what all goes into it and it seems like it's *mostly* nutritionally balanced, but is seemingly made up of whatever leftover scraps they have. The rep I talked to said the last batch had about 8% bone dust and they "put some organs in like heart, kidney, and sometimes liver". The "sometimes liver" is what has me most concerned as liver is not something my dogs are interested in on it's own and I know I should be feeding at least 5% liver for their health. I've been able to supplement things like chicken necks in the past, but organs like liver and heart (and yes, I know heart is technically categorized as "meat" but they pick around any type of organ) simply aren't palatable to them. They were fed kibble for most their life so far but love the pre mixed raw from the butcher and gobble up freeze dried without issue. I was wondering if anyone here had any thoughts or insights on my situation? I would prefer to stick to my butcher's pre-mix pet food as it makes it loads easier for me to prep and my dogs will eat all of it as opposed to me making it all myself only to have them pick around any organ meat. I just want to make sure I cover all my bases with any deficiencies in the pre-mix, the butcher sells all kinds of parts,(chicken, pork, beef, lamb, and usually wild game when we aren't in covid season) that I can try supplementing with. I'm just concerned about providing a proper nutritionally balanced diet for them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, I was planning on using their pre-mix as my "meat base" going forward and adding in my own chicken necks/feet/backs as a reliable source of bone content, and hopefully I can figure out a work around getting them to eat liver (which seems more like a texture issue for them than anything else). I definitely want to make sure I'm adding in anything that I think might be lacking in the pre-mix, but I especially want to continue adding other forms of bone so they can still chew and chomp to get that great teeth cleaning benefit. I guess that brings up the concern of providing TOO MUCH nutritional content with the added bones and organs, or is that even something I should be worrying about?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the input! I'm definitely open to adding in more bone and organ content on top of the pre-mix. I'm just wondering if there are any dangers to adding "too much" additional bone and organ content. My dogs weight make it pretty easy on me, as one chicken neck is typically the perfect weight for their day's worth of bone content. The blending the liver is a good idea I'll have to try, in addition to doing that for other organs (including heart though I know that falls under the meat category here). It really seems like it's a texture issue for them, I've noticed that they will lick at the liver and heart in their bowl but they can't figure out how to pick up a big chunk and go for it, and they've had liver treats and liver flavored chewable tablets in the past so I know they've enjoyed the taste of it previously. Making a puree to mix in with the ground meat seems like a good starting point, thanks for the tip!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The evolution, or regression, of religious imagery in my trips. Is this a known phenomenon?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-14 20:23:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, as a bit of background on myself: I was raised Christian, entered an angsty-athiest phase in high school, and now sit somewhere in the realm of agnostic/ignostic as a 20-something year old. I've experimented with LSD, mushrooms, and DMT all well after dismissing traditional religion. I've experienced religious/sacred imagery in most (probably all) of my acid trips. But I've noticed that these images have "evolved" from standard Christianity imagery to something more polytheistic. Or, to put it another way, it seems that this imagery keeps regressing back through religious history with each trip. To give a few examples, the first time I did acid with my boyfriend (now husband) we both "saw God" in the clouds. We didn't actually take him to be God(we were just a couple athiests looking at clouds), but it was a shared hallucination where all the other clouds were doing their typical swirling patterns (I was seeing a turtle, boyfriend was seeing a rabbit type of thing) when this massive cloud formed in the distance and took the appearance of a Marble Statue for both of us, like something out of Da Vinci's studio. We both laughed and made jokes about God stopping by to thank us for doing acid, but that first trip definitely made me more susceptible to agnostic view points as opposed to staunch athiest views. The second time, I saw an image of Jesus in his crown of thorns embedded into a high res image of the Pillars of Creation (btw, highly recommend spending some time with high res pics of nebulae while tripping), but this was a hallucination that only I experienced. After that, I stopped experiencing typical Christian imagery in my trips, but started to pick up on Aztec patterns when staring at the ceiling or at a brick walkway, and would see hieroglyphic type patterns embedded into paper when I would use watercolors (also highly recommend painting while tripping). My last trip was almost a year ago, and it was both the largest dose I had taken (3 blue gel tabs), as well as the only trip that I dedicated solely to personal growth (all previous trips were always a combination of personal growth and a fun journey). In the wee hours of the morning, having been tripping for probably 8-10 hours at that point, the pink light of my lava lamp reflecting off my ceiling combined with a decorative bottle of Clase Azul tequila gave me intense Devine Femanine vibes (which, if you haven't seen a bottle of Clase Azul, Google it, it has some basic vagina vibes especially to a tripping mind). From a rational standpoint, I view these experiences as my subconscious slowly breaking down the barriers of what I have been raised in along with what I have been interested in. The God and Jesus imagery made sense to me because I spent my early years involved in the Church, so it stands to reason that these motifs were still embedded not too far below my subconscious. The same sort of goes for the hieroglyphs and Aztec imagery, as I spent a good amount of my teenage years reading up on these cultures, and I still find both the cultures and their art to be beautiful and intriguing. But it was when I encountered that intrinsic feeling of Devine Femanine that it sort of clicked for me, all of these experiences seem to have been slowly breaking down my preconceived notions of religion and spirituality. Each experience has made me more open to others religious and spiritual beliefs in the sense that I no longer shut any of them down, but embrace them as simply a different way of viewing reality. I don't subscribe to one strict notion of religion or spirituality but instead refer to them as "different hats", where some occasions call for a Buddhist/Christian/Polythiestic/etc. hat while others call for no hat at all. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced a regression/progression (I feel like either word works here depending on how you look at it) in spiritual imagery as they continue to trip, or if there is a known school of thought for this phenomenon. Also, sorry for the wall of text and sorry of any of my wording comes off too colloquially, please let me know if anyone would like more clarification on anything I've said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not it at all. Aang's main conflict throughout the entire series is that he doesn't want to kill or destroy (he's even a vegetarian!) and that he truly believed there HAS to be another way. They show Kyosji murdering (and admitting to murdering) Emperor Chin and they show all the destruction the Fire Nation does, so it's not like the show was shying away from death and murder in the name of their target audience. Aang finding a way to defeat the Fire Lord without killing him was the show's way of proving how powerful Aang is as well as using the conflict as a way to say that death isn't always the answer, you can take power away from someone without killing them. The lion turtles aren't a cop out. They are hinted at in Wan Shi-Tong's library, and their chanting is first heard at the Fire Nation temple in season one, there are also more subtle background references to them throughout the series. What more, the creators dive into the origins of bending and the Avatar in Korra and confirm that it is canon that it's the Lion Turtles originally gave the power of bending to humans. It is so much more another factor of a complete, and fleshed out world than it is a cop out.</TEXT>

Luckily, people don't need to rely on random "hip and joint chews" or other kinds of treats that claim to have x amount of CBD, they can instead supplement from the source with CBD oils/pills.

    <TEXT>Peaceful protests HAVE been done in the name of police brutality, but they fall on deaf ears or are mocked as being "anti-American". Look at the backlash Kaepernick got for peacefully protesting police brutality. Look at the way Occupy Wall Street protesters were treated. Look at how Natives were treated during the pipeline protests. Now compare that to how white people have been treated in their useless protests that advocate for death, be it in Charlottesville back in 2016 or today with their want to reopen the economy. When did mass peaceful protest effectively end racist acts of hate and discrimination? MLK may have never advocated for riots but he understood that riots are a result of people's voices not being heard. That's why we're here today. POC have protested countless issues in a peaceful manner only to be met with violence and ignorance. The only time black communities ever experienced a moticom of safety and respect was when the Black Panthers would patrol neighborhoods with rifles to ensure safety. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gtfngk/cop_replaced_for_having_a_heart/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share) is an example of how current peaceful protests fall on deaf ears and are ignored. And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gtc78z/possible_evidence_of_covert_incitement_who_leaves/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gsnkdt/heres_video_of_an_undercover_cop_in_minneapolis/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share) are examples of how the current violence happening isn't coming solely from protesters. Riots aren't black and white, there is a lot of grey and there are people on both sides taking advantage of the opportunity. If cops wanted to avoid riots and revolution then they should have stepped the fuck up and charged the murderous cops for the racist pieces of shit they are. You may have learned that what the other person said is "stupid" in school, but it has been obvious for decades that the US educational system is a failure, as is apparent by your terribly irrelevant analogy. The issue at hand is more akin to having a disruptive child in class and instead of the teacher meeting that child with compassion and care and working with that child to find an resolution, the teacher instead turns to discipline and harmful punishment. The hate and anger on display here is the result of decades of systematic racism that has traumatized an entire group of people to the point that they cannot calmly express themselves anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's the thing, though. These places do have something to do with it. This entire country was built off of free labor, on the backs of black slaves. No successful capitalist box store would be here today if it wasn't for slave culture paving the road of "American Rights" back when this country was being founded. Our founding fathers declared "all men are created equal" while owning their own black slaves ffs. There was a point in time where a black man was only considered 3/5ths of a person, *by law*. Now, these modern day businesses pay taxes that fund the very cops' salaries that are murdering innocent people for no reason other than the color of their skin. If you want to be truly disgusted by humanity, read up on American History. These people aren't turning to violence after asking nicely once. These people have been pushed to the edge of a cliff and fighting back is their only option.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't say that they couldn't, just that *people* who aren't mentally equipped to handle psychadelics probably shouldn't be given machines of death with the authority and immunity to kill as they see fit. I brought it up because "not everyone can handle psychadelics" is typically the leading argument for "psychadelics aren't the cure for everything". Someone in a place of authority should be open to experiencing the earth shattering realities that psychadelics bring. Studies have shown that they can increase empathy and connection to the Earth. I don't think it's ridiculous to say that anyone who wants to have authority over a body of people should be subjected to an experience that has the potential to boost their empathy to the very people they wish to have authority over. But you can keep being negative if you want.</TEXT>

When I offered a level headed rubuttle to your original comment you shot back with more anger, calling me part of the problem. You have denied acts of racism, which in turn promotes racism. I'm willing to learn from my mistakes. Are you?</TEXT>

It seems that incorporating some sort of psychadelic aspect to police training programs (paired with a follow up psyche eval) could be a useful way to weed out any potential officers with a tendancy for racial bias or abuse of power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It sounds like she probably yelped more out of surprise than from an actual injury, but I'd still keep an eye on her, it could very well be an injury that she doesn't start to feel until tomorrow. Other than continuing to keep an eye out for obvious signs of injury (limping, soreness, sensitivity), also be wary of things like reduced appetite or less water intake. Regardless, it's probably a good idea to set up a vet appointment just to be safe. I know some people don't like the Freedom Harness (or other similar designs), as the straps are still considerably thin which can make it easier for an injury or slipping out to happen. Some people prefer the Ruffwear harness, it's a bit more heavy-duty and it's thick straps allow for the dogs weight to be distributed more evenly when high impacts happen (like reaching the end of a leash at full speed). But if you like the overall structure of the Freedom Harness, I use the Wonder Walker. It's design is super similar to the Freedom Harness, but it has a simple ring at the back instead of a martingale. It has the same ring at the front of the chest for easy attachment as well.</TEXT>

I don't work in assisted living (though, honestly bless your heart in the least demeaning way possible), I work in the cannabis production industry. The only way we could switch to four 6hr shifts is if we hired on more staff to fill in the gaps. Otherwise production would fall considerably and we wouldn't be able to fill orders in a reasonable amount of time. But opening shifts up to a wider variety effects the bottom line. Not to imply that I care about the bottom line, but the people who make scheduling decisions definitely do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's because the seasons weren't all green lit in one complete go. Season one was originally supposed to be a standalone, which is why it feels sort of "complete" on it's own. Then they got the go ahead to do season two, but that also didn't leave any guarantees that they would get more air time afterwards. Season three and four were greenlit together, which is why you see much more consistent story telling and foreshadowing between the final two seasons, and where a natural relationship between Korra and Asami starts to grow in a tangible way (and yeah, there are obvious signs of a romantic interest in season three). But it was still a Nickelodeon show, so the creators still had to remain on the subtle side.</TEXT>

Just to continue on the topic of what makes the most sense in terms of the environment, I think the other poster brought up a very good point that having more land consisting of native grasses would be more beneficial in terms of the health of top soil than using that same land to grow non-native crops. When it comes to discussing what is best environmentally, I think it's important to remember that water usage and land mass needed, while important, aren't the only factors needed to promote an environment that is meant to thrive on biodiversity. But then again, this is a very complicated issue that will require more than one solution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It didn't come out of nowhere. You said so yourself, if Assami was a man, all these little details would come off as the start of a budding relationship. But because she's a woman they don't? The producers had to work with Nickelodeon and remain on the subtle side because it was 2014 and still a kids show. But the fact that many of these small acts would be instantly taken as romantic if it was a hetero relationship speaks not to a failure on the creators part to try and form a natural relationship, it speaks to the viewers who are so used to viewing media through a hetero-normative lense that even a few obvious hints at their relationship are written off as just a couple gals being pals and their eventual romantic relationship "coming out of nowhere". There are plenty of us who watched the show as it aired and were not all that surprised that the relationship happened. For me personally, the surprise was that the creators were able to get it done at all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband and I were talking about how cool it would be to have another spin-off/ mini-series that occurs in the generation after Korra, but instead of following around the Avatar per say we would get a glimpse into the cultural impacts as a whole. Like, we got to see how Su Yin had a dance/aerobics crew and her son did sculpture art. But it would be pretty cool to see y2k era breakdancing earth benders or a water bending version of ice shaving contests, and all kinds of sports that aren't just various styles of boxing/fighting matches (like rugby with benders or something).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Stop spreading misinformation. He's brutusthabully on Instagram. His owner's bought him from a breeder (their first ever post on insta is his puppy pic), thus they not only support the breeding of a type of dog that currently occupies a bunch of shelter space, they also gave money to some asshat who cut this poor dog's ears off. What more, they refuse to nueter him with potential plans to breed him, which, again, is a major dick move considering there are SO MANY bully breeds stuck in shelters that are deserving of homes, we don't need to be pumping more into the system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Zaheer was able to meditate into the spirit world (which only he and Jinorah can do IIRC, everyone else enters through spirit portals) and reach a point of enlightenment only one other Airbender was able to reach (which took loosing P'Li, but I wouldn't say continuing to pursue his goal and gaining the ability to fly translates to having nothing to live for), he was definitely a spiritual person. Just because he was more anarchistic in his views than a traditional monk or shaman doesn't mean he wasn't spiritual. If anything, LoK did a great job representing the groups of people who may not be the most spiritually connected in a traditional sense, and showed that there are plenty of non-traditional ways to tap into your own spirituality.</TEXT>

They not only helped me navigate through my adolescence, but were my main support in coping with living in a domestically abusive household. My dad is a schizoaffective bipolar alcoholic and the process of getting him removed from our home via domestic abuse calls to police that escalated to restraining orders was the craziest roller coaster I've ever been on. Almost every night of my middle school and high school life was spent sleepless and crying with a Bright Eyes playlist keeping me company. IWAIM will always have a special place in my heart, but there are songs on every single album that spoke to me and gave me the confidence to keep truckin along. I had a very profound acid trip last summer that helped me come to terms with a lot of my issues with my dad, and I ended listening to all of LIFTED which was surprisingly on point.</TEXT>

The issue isn't just "follow the law and comply with officers" the issue is systemic racism being so deeply engrained into the police force that they'll shoot an unarmed black man in the back seven times but watch a white kid threaten peaceful protesters with a loaded gun and let him walk up to them *with said loaded gun* completely unscathed. Police respond to peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, police are the ones escalating otherwise peaceful protests.

    <TEXT>Cops are not judge jury and executioner. George Floyd was pinned to the ground with an officer's knee on his neck for nine minutes, at that point in the arrest he was compliant and voiced his inability to breath multiple times. His death was completely unjustified and avoidable. You're right, I couldn't name one non black person killed by cops because although more white people are killed by cops, the number of black people killed by cops is disproportionate in comparison to population sizes. And that's not to say that white lives unjustly taken by police are inadmissible, but the reason you see people rallying behind black lives is because theirs are the ones being affected the most by abuse of police force. https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/ "the #160;rate of fatal police shootings #160;among Black Americans was much higher than that for any other ethnicity, standing at 31 fatal shootings per million of the population as of July 2020." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/ "Victims were majority white (52%) but disproportionately black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among blacks than whites. . . black victims were more likely to be unarmed (14.8%) than white (9.4%) or Hispanic (5.8%) victims."</TEXT>

She wasn't perfect, and the few things I listed above made me facepalm watching it the first time and continues to make me facepalm on my rewatches even though I know she eventually grows and matures to a powerful and honorable avatar. While LOK as a whole does a fantastic job at showing her growth and that she was a strong avatar all along, when you only had season one Korra to go off of, there were plenty of annoying and unlikable qualities about her. Aang has his annoying tenancies too, but viewers came in to watching LOK having seen Aang's entire arc and only had one season of Korra to go off of. Add in the fact that network meddling made fluid story telling practically impossible and it's understandable why people found some of Korra's qualities unlikable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Forcing gender norms on people just perpetuates a cycle of "fit this stereotype, don't be yourself". There's a difference between sex and gender, sex denotes the sexual reproductive organs you're born with, gender is part of how you personally identify. Having a penis doesn't necessarily mean that you identify as male and like the color blue and are into sports and are strong just like having a vagina doesn't necessarily mean that you identify as female and like the color pink and want to be a mother and are vulnerable. Using blue or pink smoke bombs to "reveal" that your baby is a boy or girl feeds into gender norms that are proving to be more harmful than good, especially when your child hasn't even been born yet and hasn't had the chance to discover who they are as a *person*, not as a pre-labelled gendered stereotype. For whatever reason you say you want boys over girls, I would argue it isn't because you want penises over vaginas, but because of the types of personality traits that typically come with having boys over girls- and a lot of those personality traits are learned by having gender norms forced on us through our upbringing. Perhaps it would be better to say you prefer to have children that you are able to share hobbies and interests with, which again speaks to their personality and not their sex organs. If you wish to read up on it, here's some articles that are much better at talking about it than I am, with the help of some actual research to back it up: https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/health/geas-gender-stereotypes-study/index.html https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/21/gender-stereotypes-destroying-girls-and-theyre-killing-boys/688317001/</TEXT>

For example, I'm a spitting image of my father despite me having a vagina.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure how well I'll be able to articulate it, but I'll give it a go. If you haven't had a chance to read the articles I posted above, I highly recommend giving at least one of them a quick skim through as they point out what is "wrong" with genders with actual research to back it up. From what you've written, it honselty sounds like you do get the general idea, the hard part is unlearning the deeply ingrained notion of gender. This is actually a school of thought that is fairly new to me as well, but after thinking about it and reading about it, I'm slowly starting to understand it a bit better. It's the idea of taking gender out of things like the chromosomes you have or what's between your legs. Someone who identifies as male can have a vagina, someone who identifies as female can have a penis, and someone can feel it is unnecessary to put themselves in a male or female category and still have sexual reproductive organs that result from having either XX or an XY chromosomes. It shifts the focus away from an individual's gender and refocuses simply on the individual. We as a society may feel like deciding our son should be referred to as a boy isn't inherently harmful because we still allow them to explore the things they like regardless of what gender those things are targeted towards, yet continuing to feed into the simple concept of gender perpetuates gender norms that have plagued us as a society for centuries. After all, we are only capable of controlling so much of our children's interaction with the world, at a certain point their label of "boy" still lumps them in with a group that has existed in society for forever and has perpetuated such negative connotations as always being strong, not being able to show emotions, having to be the bread winner, and having ownership over other people (this isn't meant to ignore the negative connotations that come with gendering someone as female right off the bat, I just don't feel like writing a whole novel). I know you say you'd like a son as a means to carry on your family name, but think for a minute about how that very tradition is rooted in patriarchal reign that relies on ownership over another person. Why is it always expected that the woman take the man's name, why do women have to differentiate between being a Miss, Ms., and Mrs. when men only need to be referred to as Mr.? The very tradition is rooted in the fact that marriage used to be a pact that resulted in a man having power over his woman. The notion of wanting to pass on your name is a well known feeling, but it ignores that fact that you are bringing a new individual into the world who is free to live their life as they see fit. They could very well decide that they don't like their family name and legally change it, they could take their future wife's or husband's name instead, they could end up being asexual and therefore have the family name end with them anyway. In taking gender out of how we refer to children, we give them a truly blank slate that allows them to explore who they are as people based on their likes and interests. It doesn't reflect roles we place on them before they're even old enough to comprehend who they are as individuals. Ultimately, it's their life and their identity, and they should be provided the conditions to understand themselves with as little preconceived notions/roles as possible. Sorry for the wall of semi-rambling text, I hope I explained it well enough.</TEXT>

The fluid movement he does reminds me distinctly of Iroh's lightning redirection technique, but Iroh said he picked that up from watching water benders. I guess Roku could have also picked it up from water benders since he's also a water bender? But the finger point does seem distinctly rooted in fire bending, so I guess I'm now more lost lol</TEXT>

Waste happens just by merely existing, so I'm not sure why you're trying to argue that recycling plants are some how bad here. Yes, the process of creating recycling plants generates waste but the goal of those plants is to create a way to repurpose items so they don't go to a landfill. Using a paper sleeve that can be recycled or composted is still leagues better than packaging that pasta in a single use plastic container that will go to a landfill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just to give a bit more perspective on vet costs (holy moly you really do live in an expensive area), my annual visits per dog run around $100-$130 just for check up and vaccinations and that isn't including flea medication costs in the summer months (which is about $240 for both dogs for 3 months worth of medication). That's just for basic routine care. Now that my dogs are getting older, we're having to factor in dental cleaning for them. My girl had a chipped tooth that needed to be extracted and ended up costing $1100. And that doesn't even bring into factor the countless scenerios where an accident can happen and we end up having to foot an ER bill. I hate to say it OP, but your income is absolutely the rescue's business. Their job is to find a home that can provide care to the dogs they adopt out, and providing adequate care costs money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh I thought that was the sub for examples of erasure, not for making sweeping assumptions about two women posing for a photo together.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Someone mentioned /r/playingcards further down, but there's also /r/tarot of you're interested in cool card deck art in general, and considering the modern playing card decks are based off the original minor arcana of the tarot, you can find a lot of similarities between the two.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's the four suits. In tarot it's Wands, Swords, Cups, and Pentacles as opposed to playing cards which have Clubs, Spades, Hearts, and Diamonds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wish I did this. I got mine off Amazon and the card stock is actually decent quality (it holds up much better than my Oliver Hilbert Deck), but there was something so off about purchasing tarot cards off Amazon. . .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh no I totally get that, I've begrudgingly bought from Amazon when all my local options were 3-4x the price. I just wish I had thought about checking the publisher's website before getting my Rider Waite. Getting tarot cards delivered in the same instant-gratification-mass-consumerist manner as my Chromecast just felt very odd.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I went through the US public education system and I never learned about him from a history perspective. I think his work was lightly touched upon in my AP Psych class but that's not a required curriculum and what we did learn about him had nothing to do with the injustice he faced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that definitely all makes sense. I agree, it's kind of ridiculous that the only focus of history lessons for wartime is just weapons/transport/strategy tactics. I think it's really important for the scientists/inventors/activists etc. of the era get the recognition they deserve for their contributions regardless of if they fit in a minority or not. It emphasizes the importance of so many different career paths that don't exist for the sole purpose of destruction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think posts need to consist of two designated partners to fit this sub, just that their homosexuality is avoided or erased, someone else posted here in the comments that they had a professor who wrote a whole dissertation on Turing but refused to believe he was chemically castrated so there are people out there denying aspects of his homosexual life. Idk, I saw the post on instagram and it made me realize that all I ever learned about him in school was a short paragraph about his contributions to pyschology in my AP Psych class. I found that weird considering his contributions to WWII and how much time my history classes spent teaching about WWII. You'd think he would've at least been mentioned, but considering how his life unfolded it's kind of easy to see why history books would want to keep all that on the DL. That's why I thought it fit the sub under academic erasure. Here you have a genius of a man who contributed greatly not only to our modern world but to saving millions of lives, yet he gets no mention in school textbooks (as late as 2012, afaik)? Seems odd to not include such an important man when talking about such a major part of history.</TEXT>
