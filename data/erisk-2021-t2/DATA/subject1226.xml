    <TEXT>Do they charge you extra for the early start program? I know it would cost you when you are able to do it in person but this year it seems it #8217;s gonna be online. So will they charge you extra other than the actual tuition fee. In addition, do you take any CS courses or just gen ed/English courses in early start?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for this! I have few more doubts: 1) In the given link, the list of complete courses for each major is provided. However, there is no mention of general education requirement for CS/DS students. How can I find that? 2) is there a possibility to test out of gen ed courses?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Information about VStar Program</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 17:49:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have few doubts regarding VStar program and advisor meeting: 1) Since this year, every incoming student will be attending VStar program instead of the usual Star program, I would want to know how many hours in general does it take to complete this program? As intl students have taken VStar before, it would be helpful if you could help me out with this. 2) Moreover, in the very first meeting with the advisor, do international students interact through email or phone with the advisor? 3. Since you have to plan out courses for fall in the first meeting with the advisor, I would like any data science/CS student to answer this. I have enrolled in Data Science and would like to know what is the general course plan taken by DS/CS students in their first semester? Also, is there anything else advisor would plan out with you in the first meeting other than the course schedule?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have just completed the VStar program and will be having the academic advisor meeting pretty soon. I am a data science major and would try out for CS CODO process after first semester. My question is should I inform the advisor about this plan and what consequences could I face? I don #8217;t really know if you could tell the advisor about having plans such as double major or CODO process.</TEXT>
