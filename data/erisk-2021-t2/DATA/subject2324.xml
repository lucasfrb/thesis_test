    <TEXT>Between the shades of grey. It is a World War 2 novel and when I finished it, it left me with a hollow feeling inside. But I guess any war novel can do that to you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Salt to the sea - I have read it a couple of times till now. The tattooist of Auschwitz- ( not exactly a spoiler, but if you are reading this book or wish to read this book, don't read ahead) The ending was a little unsettling. And by *little* I mean a lot . Don't get me wrong, I am not a sadist. It is just that in the most books that I have read about world wars, the ending is always predictable. The ending of this particular book made me dwell on the concept of * happy endings* for a little while. Okay, wait the ending wasn't happy exactly, but the ending gave us hope that maybe if you stay strong for a little while longer, you might be able to get out of the bad situation after all. Can anyone else relate? The diary of a young girl- This was my first novel that I read on world War 2. Haven't been able to keep any book on world War 2 down. The book intrigued me to read more on world War 2, to read about other survivors and victims. Holocaust was one of the worst spine shivering incidents in history to take place.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-17 09:58:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Heyy.. I don't exactly have a hair care routine. (Ik) Lately I have been thinking about getting on board on the *hair care routine train*. I have dry, frizzy hair. My hair gets oily faster on the scalp as compared to my lengths. Hair loss is genetic in my family. I have lost almost half of my hair in the last 4years. I am thinking about start oiling my hair. But I can't decide between castor oil and olive oil. Can you guys help me, please? I need a hair oil which will reduce hairfall and promote hair growth making my hair thicker. Thank you so much:) Edit: I don't use any conditioner just any good old shampoo. I use any shampoo that I find in the bathroom..</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Dyed my hair, I need product recommendations:)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 08:34:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, I got my hair dyed recently. My undyed hair were frizzy from the start and now they have just gotten more out of control. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a color safe shampoo, conditioner and a leave in conditioner(paraben and sulfate free). My hair tends to get oily faster at the roots than my ends.. Thank you so much. :) Edit:I have been using matrix biolage anti breakage shampoo and conditioner but it is not sulfate or paraben free.</TEXT>
