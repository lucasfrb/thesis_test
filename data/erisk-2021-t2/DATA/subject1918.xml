    <TITLE>Anaesthesia and drugs</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-07 10:06:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Looking for advice please, I'm undergoing surgery in three weeks and as a part of it I'll have general anaesthetic. Today I had a pre admission appointment and panicked when he asked if I did recreational drugs and instinctively just said no. The truth is two weeks ago I had a couple MDMA bombs and a quarter tab of LSD. Over the last year I have also had a couple lines of cocaine. Beyond these though I'm not a big user and have comparatively low encounters. Now I'm paranoid as I've heard this can have a big impact on the affects of anaesthetic. Is anyone here a medical professional with any suggestions as to whether I should get in contact and come clean, or am I ok not saying it as I'm not a big user and I don't think it'll have much impact if any? TL;dr - I lied about having done drugs to my doctor and have to have general anaesthetic, should I come clean or not?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by shattering my shoulder socket</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-05 10:43:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Disclaimer this didn't happen today, but is rather a longer drawn out story I'm now reflecting on. Four years ago, I was whitewater kayaking over a Welsh waterfall (The Gamelan if anyone is familiar) and really messed up the landing, at the time I dislocated my shoulder and rolled it back in all in the space of about 10 seconds. I then went to the doctor for it, had the physio and thought it was fine (however it would later become apparant that something had been seriously missed). I went about a year and half with not much fuss from it, just a little stiffness in the mornings and I thought "great, this is fine". Following this I got on with daily life, and maybe once every two or three months if have a relapse and dislocate my shoulder whilst doing extensive things like trying to build shoulder muscle in the gym. Thinking it was fine and just a question of building strength I did a tough mudder, full 10 miles and 30 obstacles, and amazingly had no issues. Two years ago I went whitewater kayaking in the French Alps, hitting the biggest water and rapids that I'd done in a while and subsequently over extended my arm and suddenly I felt a *pop* as my arm popped out the socket whilst kayaking down a big River. I swam out my boat, got dragged to shore and this began almost twice weekly dislocations of my shoulder for a year and a half. Fast forward a year and a half I recorded almost 200 dislocations, and am now in recovery from a bone reconstruction surgery as it turns out I did all of the above with a shattered shoulder socket, brought on from a bad waterfall attempt 4 years ago. TL;DR - I shattered my shoulder socket kayaking off a waterfall 4 years ago, and subsequently dislocated my shoulder almost 200 times before getting it fixed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A friend and I are running two individual campaigns at the moment, but both games are having issues in keeping enough players to keep playing on a regular basis. To solve this we want to merge our games into one, merge our stories (with obvious compromise - but largely from an initial discussion they seem to be 60-70% compatible). However, we both are new DMs running our first campaigns, and both really enjoy it. As such we both want to DM and switch between DMing and sharing a PC. Does anyone have any experience in doing this, or any tips that would help it work well?</TEXT>
