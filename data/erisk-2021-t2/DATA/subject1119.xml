    <TITLE>If Someone Says Don't Touch My Dog They Mean It.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-04-25 11:31:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a rescue dog that has problems with anxiety and while he is so so much better than he used to be , he still doesn't like be to be approach by certain kinds of people or in certain kinds of places so I have a vest that says "Ask Before you Touch, I'm Anxious" most people do but today on a walk today group of very loud (trigger) teenage boys (trigger) and girls (there were 5) came up to us, he would have been fine if they had come up to me calmly and asked me if they could pet him but no, they did not read his bright red vest,nor when they asked if they could pet him did they wait for me to answer, in fact they did so while reaching for him and then seemly didn't pick up on his body language that clearly said I scared don't touch me as he cowered behind me.  #8203; This is not ok and the fact that these people were obviously not taught how to behave around dogs is down right dangerous. After I said "he's scared don't touch him" they still wanted to pet him, to them my dog should have gotten over itself and want to be their friend because they been nice to him so far. I was getting angry and upset at this point and that's when my dear terrified dog went from scared into "Imma look after my human" mode a let of one of his gaint barks now he is tiny but he barks like a doberman and one of the girl started squealing, at that point I pick up my dog and walked away. He usually has great interaction with people because they take the 3 or 4 minutes to earn his trust, people ask question and I really don't mind answering them, often I get asked if he will bite and I'm honest only if you try to hurt me, he's very protective, sometimes people stare and cross the street but this is the first time something like this has happened and I'm pissed.  #8203; Am I being unreasonable to think that their behavior was stupid and that my dog's subsequent response was a best case scenario? Edit: Thank you for all the support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My Dog Loves his walks so much, when I get his harness out he runs to the front dog with his tail doing the full butt circle wag and a happy dog smile. Today there was dog with poor manners walking around off lead, he hates his space being invaded and tends to get extremely scared if approach out of the blue, plus this dog had been in a couple of fights so I told him "out the back fence to today" he knows what that means and he ran to the back door with some happy leaps in between. After a 40 minute walk around the neighborhood including a brief sniff with a very nice fluffy dog, I didn't catch the breed we returned home. He has a ritual to say thank you, run around and jump on to me once or twice then get a big drink, then into the lounge room and a few kisses, then a minute or two of resting, then lots and lots of kisses for about 3 minutes. This happens every time I take him for a walk, without fail.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I Feed My Worms Aquatic Plants</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-07 13:36:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm doing this on mobile so please forgive the format. I have a worm farm that's around 3 months old and doing wonderfully. I also have a 52 litre (13 gallon) planted aquarium and was wondering if I would be able to feed to the overgrowth of plants to the worms? The kind of plant is very fast growing (I can't recall the species) and overtakes the tank every few weeks, I don't have anyone to give it to and I don't like just throwing it away but can't find any information online that it's safe to give to the worms. If it's of any use the plant is quite feathery without being fragile. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you. Edit: It's freshwater and has never had a major disease.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a 52 litre (13.7 gallon) heavily planted tank and a worm farm. I often have a overgrowth of plants that I have no one to give to and nothing to do with. I dislike waste but couldn't find any information about being about to feed aquatic plants to worms online, so after a post on r/vermiculture, I fed about 1/2 tablespoon of finely diced fern like plants (can't recall species) to my worm my Sunday afternoon. They seemed to enjoy the plants and have eaten most of it. If this is something you are going to do I would suggest freezing the plant matter before hand or blending it as the worms are taking a lot of time with the thicker and/or woody bits.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am seriously considering owning triops but I would like to know as much as I can before buy products as I very much enjoy spoiling my pets. I live in Australia, can I use triops king and if not where can I get eggs from, I want Triops Australiensis. I have a plan, I'm going to use a 10 litre (2.6) gallon, is this large enough? I am going to follow this method for hatching [https://www.reddit.com/r/triops/comments/cqfc4h/my\_hatching\_method/](https://www.reddit.com/r/triops/comments/cqfc4h/my_hatching_method/) as it seems the most simple to follow. I will be using a sponge filter and a heater, do I need an air stone? I will be adding plants as well, what plants are recommended? I have a freshwater aquarium, is the care of the water the same and can I use bacteria for the aquarium for the triops? Should I put things in my aquarium like rocks to act as "seeds" for when I start? With a filter running how often will I have to change the water? Can I remove the eggs and dry them as they come or should I dry out the whole tank when all the triops die? Any information would be deeply appreciated, I am very excited.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[FLUFF] My Dog Just Kept My Cat Safe, I'm So Proud</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-17 13:03:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm doing this on mobile so please forgive the format. My Dog and my cat are the best of friends, they groom each other, share food and toys and sleep together. Both are rescues and have very similar emotional needs. Before anyone tells me off, they are never left alone in the house together, not I because I don't trust my dog but because the dog tends to tear apart the house due to separation anxiety (under treatment), so he needs to be in a place free of dangers when no one is there. The cat is an inside only cat and has been his entire life, he often tries to get out only to get into trouble so the dog has often seen him being told to go in after he has wandered out when the clothes are being hung or I'm feeding the worm. The weather in the last day or two means that my back door is a little loose, tonight the cat opened the back dog and ran out, the dog wasn't having any of that and chased him back in and barked at him very loudly. The cat knows he isn't allowed outside and for good reason, we have lots of feral cats in the area and have had a few out breaks of FIV not to mention I don't want him killing any native animals or getting hit by a car or killed by a dog, so he did it when I was upstairs. The cat has never spent a night away from me and I'm very proud or my dog for making sure his big brother stayed safe. Side note: I don't think the cats ego will ever recover.</TEXT>

A lot of the game was in black and white. Estimated year of release: Early to mid 2000s 2005-2009 Graphics/art style: Cartoonish but smooth and clean. Notable characters: I think I remember there only being two, the player and the person who gave the quest. Notable gameplay mechanics: Arrow keys. Other details: Some details may be off but this is what I can remember best, it was a game accessible via the internet and a lot of kids played it at school.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Using RO Waste Water?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-12 09:34:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just got a portable RO unit that allows me to collect both the filtered and waste water, I was wondering if anyone had any experience using the waste water on their plants. I live South Sydney, Australia and have found that normal tap water kills the plants after a time so I have been using the waste water from my fish tank. I am using the RO unit for a small fish tank and only need 8 filtered liters a week so I will have around 24 liters of waste. I don't have that many plants right now but I plan on expanding as I have a wide variety of seeds for different sources. I have the ability to test for pH and TDS. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Having Massive Problems With The Children Living In My Townhouse Complex, Things Are Getting Worse. Need Help With What To Do Next?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-25 07:14:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I live with one other person in a townhouse complex of 8 houses, last year some new people moved in and things have taken a rapid down turn. The children of the new family and the children of one the the residing families have been creating problems and I have no idea how to move forward. * There has been around $2000 worth of damage to the common property, this means that everyone has to pay for it. * They play in my front garden, at my front door and in my garage without asking. In doing so they have damaged plants and made mess that I have to clean up because no one else will, this happen at least twice a week. The garage door can't be close through the day since the other person in the house has dexterity issue and can't open and close it too many times. * They scream, and play ball games from 6am to 8pm on common property despite having backyards. * When I have asked them nicely to play quietly they have intentionally kick the ball at my front and garage door. * I have had to start taking my dog out the back gate since if I take him out the front door they will not leave me alone no matter what I say to them (he is a recuse and doesn't like to be mobbed by people) * Most of the properties have two entrances (a front door and a back gate) but the way the complex is built means that everyone has access and I have had things disappear and reappear out of my backyard. A bucket went missing, this bucket is used for one thing only, kept in the one spot and the other person in the house did not touch it, the next day it showed up at the back door. * My front garden has river stones in it and they break them up into shards regularly and leave them out where people walk and drive. * They play at my back fence and have thrown food over it into my backyard to feed the birds despite me asking them not to. While I do feed our native birds they get proper food and I don't want certain birds coming, also I have a dog so I feed the birds a certain times so the food is gone when he goes outside for the toilet. * They have thrown the stones from my front yard into my backyard, this is a hazard, if one gets hit the the lawn mower it can become a projectile. I have a dog, the lawn has to be mowed regularly for the health of his skin. I always tried my best to tell the children not to do things a nice way, I say please and gave them the reason why in the same way I would do an adult, if that doesn't work I try putting it a different way e.g. please be careful with the rocks if the lawn mower hits one it could really hurt someone, you can play with them but please put them back. I said that to them word for word and it did nothing. Playing on common property is against body corporate law but it's not enforce because this has never been a problem before. More then one person living the complex has ask the parents to deal with this behavior but it has always been met with hostility, in fact when one of the fathers saw a neighbor talking to the other person living in my home, he bashed on my door and practicality walked in demanding to know what the conversation was about, he only backed off when my dog started baking at him. I am only asking for help now because I caught them about to steal a package outside my door and I have no idea what to do, before this everyone just had to put up with their behavior but I don't want things to go start to go missing especially this close to Christmas. I have chronic migraines and the constant screaming and being woken up at 6am by a bouncing ball is not fun, there are times where the noise they make makes my pain worse and I can't do anything about it, it's gotten to the point where I am concerned that if I say anything they will try to poison my dog or set the house on fire because I have seen the child who encourages a lot of the bad behavior in the rest of the children do some really scary things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In high school I was friends with a N who for no reason that I could pin point would use the silent treatment for sometimes weeks at a time then suddenly become my friend again, this also came with her going out of her way to get personal information out of me and/or spreading things that I had told her in coincidence, never admitting anything she was wrong then finding a way to make what she did my fault, going out of her way to point out the way I was hurting our mutual friends (always over Facebook) even if they didn't think I had done anything wrong then not letting me respond. Only when I tried to cut off the friendship did she come and say sorry and go out of her way to show me she was trying, she would always blame being depressed, I always took her back because I was lonely. I finally cut off the friendship for good when she told me that the fact that my grandfather was dying and I had a brain tumor was nothing compared to her depression and I was a bad friend. I now a 3 close friends but anytime there is lack of contact for a period of time (more then 4 days if we talk everyday) I start to freak out. I can't help but think I have done something to upset them but again I can't think of what I have done. I'm not sure what to do since every time there has been a lack of contact on the surface I can reason and I know that nothing is wrong and they have a good reason but there is always a horrible anxiety in the back of my mind. It's only hit me today because a close friend who I talk to everyday has not talked to me in a few days and I knew nothing was wrong and they were very busy (where they live is at high bush fire risk) but I couldn't help going over every conversation we had had to figure out what I had done wrong. I don't want to worry my friends with this because they are wonderful people and it would upset them if I thought that were capable of that. Any help is appreciated, thank you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-12-06 12:08:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm on mobile please forgive format. I live in group of townhouses, I own while most others rent. There has been an on going problem of children being extremely loud, commiting vandalism and playing ball games on common property, this is all breaking the housing laws that we have for our complex. I live with chronic migraines and another person in the complex also has health issues despite all the EPs involved knowing this they allow their kids start screaming at 6:00am. It has gotten to the point where multiple homes have complained and the housing laws are going to be enforced, before this I feel like I should rattle off all the issues that have lead to this point.  #8226;Children Playing at the top of their lungs in front of my window and in my front garden starting at 6:30am and ending and 8:00pm.  #8226;Children breaking up the rocks in my front garden into shards and leaving them where they can harm people and animals.  #8226;The same rocks and shards being thrown into my backyard, this is especially dangerous because my dog health dictates that my lawn is mowed regularly. Rocks can turn into projectiles when they meet mower blades.  #8226;Things going missing from my backyard them turning up a day or two later at my back door.  #8226;One ten year old urinating in my front garden.  #8226;Damage to the front of the property and surrounding trees.  #8226;The children turning up and down the water pressure in my house(the tap is located in my front garden) dispite tapping it up to stop that. I would like to say that if the children had been respectful no one would have complained but they did and a letter went around dictating what laws were being broken and what ones are going to be enforced in the future. One EP approaches the other person living in my home today and says "I'm not keep my EK inside all holidays, we all need to figure out a time when they can bounce the ball and run around" they have a backyard and don't need to play on common property. They have all been told over and over again how hard it's been living with the constant noise. The other EP blames depression and his sick partner not being able to handle the EKs inside, the EKs are old enough to know that sick people need peace and quiet. This is crazy, it's not my job to deal with someone else's kids and I feel like they are being pushed on me. I want silence in my own home for more then the time the kids are at school. The temptation to fill my migraine diary with RUDE KIDS as a trigger is unbearable. I will give an update when the other person in my home is contacted by housing law agent. EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In Australia we are in the middle of a terrible drought and bush fire season, as such we have in place level one water restrictions amongst other things that means you can only clean buildings and cars with hoses that have attachments. Most Australians will tell you that a dirty car is a thing of pride in the middle of a terrible drought, saving water in every way is something a lot if people are trying to do dispite what the water restrictions allow. Not my next door neighbor, they have been hosing their white house for the last 20 minutes. Yes it's with a hose with an attachment but that's not the point. We are in the middle of bush fire season there is ash everywhere, hosing your house is a useless waste of precious water come Tuesday it will be dirty again and there is nothing I can do to stop it because they are allowed to legally do it. I'm enraged, everyone I know has been doing their best to conserve every valuable drop. Our farmers are struggling and someone is wasting water to keep the house nice and white.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My cat often smells amazing dispite the fact he doesn't get bathed regularly. Most of the time it's some kind of cakey smell and tonight he smelt like blueberries. I don't use laundry liquid that smells anything like that so it's not that. Am I the only one who has a cat that always smells amazing? I know there is a parasite called toxoplasmosis that can cause neurological symptoms that can come from cat fecal matter. He just smells good all the time and it's wonderful.</TEXT>

I wandered over here after this sub was mentioned on r/australia there was a mixed response on both side. I want to first say that a lot of people are very angry, sad and sacred and the saying "hurt people hurt people" rings true. Next, despite my own issues with organised religion, the people I spend my time with (they are a very diverse bunch) and I are so grateful for the donations that are coming for this community. If you wish to help in a materiel way but can't donate money WHICH IS PERFECTLY FINE!!!!!! then we do need thing like bottled water, non perishable foods, bed clothes and hygiene products. If you can knit, sew or crochet our injured and abandoned animals need things things to keep them warm [https://www.wires.org.au/wildlife-info/wildlife-factsheets/making-possum-pouches](https://www.wires.org.au/wildlife-info/wildlife-factsheets/making-possum-pouches) [https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADNkT8qNKIv7sCA amp;cid=345614CF0E8F6DE5 amp;id=345614CF0E8F6DE5%216206 amp;parId=root amp;o=OneUp](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADNkT8qNKIv7sCA amp;cid=345614CF0E8F6DE5 amp;id=345614CF0E8F6DE5%216206 amp;parId=root amp;o=OneUp) Again, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nail Clipper Recommendations?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 06:34:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a one year old rescue dog and due to joint issues and past foot injuries he hates having his paws touched and will only let me clip his nails or touch his feet (which after some time I can now do all 4 paws in around 10 minutes) The scissor clippers I have now do the job but are large and not very strong with has been slowing me down quite a lot (for reference I am a female with a fairly average hand size) they also don't allow me to change the way I cut that much so it's very difficult to take small slivers off with each cut. Is there a clipper you would recommend that is small but strong? I live in Australia and have Amazon Prime. Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated. Dog tax: https://imgur.com/a/4PnWZE2</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update: EP Says That Their Child Should Be Allowed to Break Housing Law.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-15 07:03:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been a month since my original post [EP Says That Their Child Should Be Allowed to Break Housing Law.](https://reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/e6xy55/ep_says_that_their_child_should_be_allowed_to/) and there has been a lot of changes. Things have gotten much better and the children are trespassing in my front garden a lot less, but other problems have arisen that are going to be more of an issue to deal with, they are all stemming from one home. * The father is intent on intimidating our home into dropping the complaint(we are the only female only household and has hasn't tried intimidation tactics with anyone else) * The teenage boys are leaving their dirty underwear to dry on top of our shared bin. * There are cigarette butts being thrown over our shared fence( I have a small-medium dog 14kgs with a very sensitive stomach so nicotine poisoning is a risk) I don't want to be cleaning up someone else's smoked cigarette. * The teenage boys and their friends make it a point to come out into thier backyard when I am in mine (taking the dog to the toilet, watering the plants) and discussing their often violent sex lives at the top of their lungs while hanging over my back fence. * The teenage boys and their friends like to torment my dog, he is a severely abused rescue who in the pass very much struggled with interacting with young men but with almost a year of intense training, anti-anxiety medication, socialization and love he as manged to over to this, still I don't want him to take a step back as I have work extremely hard to make sure every young man he has met has been kind to him, I also don't want him seeing his own backyard as a hostile place. * They have started to fill up our shared bin within one day of it being emptied, this means we have no where to put our rubbish and have resorted to throwing it out at work, when the issue was brought up politely the father say "we have 6 people in our house and you only have 2 what do you expect us to do" * Despite our home being very clean we now have a cockroach problem because their backyard is filthy and the teenage boys who live in the garage (which back onto the backyard) aren't the cleanest people e.g. one of them drinks so much he regularly vomits in the backyard. Fortunately with the use of a lot of surface spray and some companion gardening techniques this issues has been resolved some what. The housing manager is back for holidays but doesn't want to help anymore then he already has and has said we have to wait another month for a proper meeting to resolve all the issues. While it has gotten much better for my home it's gotten far worse the people on the other side of the complex and one household is considering a move due to the effect it's having on thier mental health. I realize that the behavior of the teenagers is just them trying to be cool and the stories that they tell are most likely fictitious (I hope) but I am a little scared of them and I don't go outside alone. There is also small girl living in that home and some of the things they say and they way they act makes me fear for her safety. Please don't ok boomer me, for one I'm 21 so not a Baby Boomer, two this has been going on for a year and I just want it to end, the fact is I'm now scared to answer my door because the father might decided today is the day he wants to yell at me for making his depression worse or forcing his kids to play in their own backyard, three, it seems the person who is meant to be helping doesn't care and is making the residents do all the work, I'm frustrated, I'm tried and I want it to end.

I adore my neurologist, she is honest and blunt and that's very refreshing when you have been dealing with a shitty health care system for 12 years. Now a days I have no problem dropping a doctor after the first visit when they don't turn out. If a doctor doesn't belive you or tries to minimize your experience they don't need your money.</TEXT>

I'm in Australia, my rescue dog came from a town where dog fighting and animal abuse are a massive problem, one of the main reasons is that a large percentage of the perpetrators are teenagers who get a slap on the wrist no matter what they do. Some cases have been very similar to this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pay attention to a person's body language, if their arms are crossed over their chest they could be doing a self hug which is an unconscious way to self sooth so is excessive fiddling and inability to make eye contact. Boundaries differ from person to person so you need to learn how to read someone rather then what not to say. But there are some standard rules, if you don't know someone well don't get all touchy feely, don't talk about personal issues, do try to show interest in what they are saying.</TEXT>

Apparently dealing with these kinds of issues is very difficult especially if there are people involved that don't care, the person on the other end said the best way to get ressult is if the people the cops talk to don't have any excusesto their behaviour like being unaware of the by-laws. As far as camera's, it's on my property and I have a good reason( my backyard backs onto the steet) as long as I'm not going put of my way to film the their backyard it will be ok.</TEXT>

I had a very sweet Cavoodle before I got my rescue who passed because of a heart issue, the cat would leave one biscuit out for him every night after he finished eating, this continued for years after his death and only stopped a few months before I got my current dog. Three days after my current dog got home the one biscuit reappeared despite the fact the the cat was still acting like he didn't really like him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is above Reddit's pay grade, you need to get your dog to a vet then to a force free trainer who has experience working with very aggressive dogs. Dominance theory is terrible, has been debunked multiple times and leads to more problems then it solves, the relationship between humans and dogs and dogs and dogs is very different. Your dog is exhibiting very dangerous behavior that will likely need medication and intense training to fix. There could be a thousand issues causing the aggression and it's escalating so it's a sign you need to do something right now before someone is badly injured, then it becomes a legal matter.</TEXT>

It's called third hand smoke and it's one of the leading causes of SIDS and childhood hearing issues(due to glue ear) The onus is on you because she can't help having asthma but you can help the fact that you are basically sucking down cancer. Now a days there are hundreds of intervention options to stop smoking and a lot of them are highly effective. As someone who is sick through no fault of my own and does everything I possible can to care for my health, it makes me so angry that there are people out there that are throwing away the absolute blessing that is being healthy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Most efficient way to catch pot worms?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-24 02:21:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday all my worm fled to the bottom tray in the heat, I fixed it once I found them and they recovered in about 30 minutes and they were/are going fine. But as a result I was able to grab a ton of pot worms to feed to my psychotic fish Q, turns out he loves them and it seems they are his favourite live food. What is the best, most efficient was to catch as many pot worms as possible? From looking online the bread method seems to get mixed results. Thank you, any help is much appreciated Fish tax: http://imgur.com/a/dHUqKur ( please excuse the dirty glass, the tank is due for it's weekly clean)</TEXT>

Most u social insects have 2 stomachs with bees the honey stomach is what's used to hold the nectar that will be pass on to other bees. This is how hone is made, the nectar is digested more and more as it passes through each bee till it ends up in the hive where the water is evaporated.</TEXT>

If the owner wants to pursue it anyway and/or there is a very good chance for survival he refers them onto a cancer specialist. Treatments for cancer are nasty for anything, most of it's basically hoping to poison the cancer into stopping before it poisons the patient to death. And brain surgery is difficult on people, can you imagine what it would be life an an elderly dog.

    <TEXT>It's not hard at all, I love baking and find the best way to make good lamingtons is just to take your favourite cake recipe and use that. For fluffyness look at angel or chiffon cake recipes, find one that you know you can do and that you like the look of and just adapt it to fit in a flat pan. There is not really any point in me giving you a recipe for a few reasons, you might not get the way I dictate it (we all understand things differently and I have gone over some recipes over and over again not being able to get what the person is saying) and you might hate my recipe and the way I do it. Good luck, lamingtons are very forgiving, just add more coating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are things you can do that will really help make it as fluffy as possible. Sift all you dry ingredients together 2-3 times, whip your egg whites to stiff peaks, make sure that once you have added everything you only mix enough to get it combined, then get it into the oven as fast as you can. This will optimise the effect of you chemical leaveners such as baking powder and ensure that the cake keeps the air you added by sifting and whiping as the tiny bubbles that keep the cake light pop over time, this may be less true but I do it, avoid slamimg and/or opening the oven door as it also causes bubble loss.</TEXT>

I never said that words were a hate crime in fact free speech is a human right and deeply important to democracy, let me put what I said in a different way.

Method * Pre heat oven to 180C (350F) * Mash mango well to sightly chunky consistency. * Add egg and mix well. * Add oat flour till a thick batter is reached. * Line an appropriately size baking dish and bake until a skewer in the middle comes out clean or with only a few crumbs (45-60 minutes). * Cool and serve, serves around 3-4 depending on dog size.

And make it for him from scratch, noddles and everything, it will be a tone of work especially if you make tonkotsu but if you shop in the right places it won't be that expensive, try an Asian market an other place with cheap, fresh but ethnically specific food needs because more often then not cultures that use the whole animal in their cuisine will have the stuff you need for cheap as the high end places see no needs for it. I get all the stuff for my broths from the shopping center in my local Chinese community, the fresh vegetables are very fresh and cheap and the meat is very responsibly priced. If he really likes ramen he will understand how much trouble you went to.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>100% I take Zofram when I know a bad one's coming but no matter what you take (in a home setting) if you're going to throw up it's going to happen no matter how hard your try to stop it. I feel better because it relieves the nausea for a while and let's me handle the pain in a more effective way beascue I'm not stewing in that "I'm about 2 seconds from ejecting all my digestive organs" feeling. I don't know if it's also because the nausea is a symptom of the neurological event, because when my head has been unbearable but I have had a little nausea taking Zofram helps.

    <TEXT>I love my Neuro, if she wants a kidney or part of my liver or one lung it's her's. She calls me in and looks at my headache diary then ask if I want the Botox, we talk about new medications and trials and then we talk about if it will work for me then we talk about if I want to come off any profolactixs, then Botox and then she writes her notes and my scripts and we talk about our pets, she wishes me luck for the next 12 weeks and always says I can call her if something goes wrong and we part ways. She has always believed me, never made me feel like a drug addict for my responsible use of opiates, she listens to me, never makes me feel like the pain is in my head, in fact she said that horrible GP that sent me to therapy was wrong( I know, doctors talking badly about other doctors!!!) She trusts me to know what's best for my body and has never gotten funny about me saying no to one of her suggestions, she treats me like I know best about my migraines and she is just helping me deal with them with the help of science, most of all I enjoy going to see her because she makes me feel NORMAL.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Covert incest, also known as emotional incest, is a type of abuse in which a parent looks to their child for the emotional support that would be normally provided by another adult. It took me a few reads to figure out that she wasn't a single mum. Start to try to do things for yourself and mention that you are her child and have no place caring for her emotions or mental health. Your father needs to do better and your mother needs to stop blaming you for everything that is going on in your home. Unfortunately the only way things might improve is if you start carying your own weight. Talk to your doctor about getting on more effective meds and get out of that house as soon as you can.

    <TEXT>Woman here but I feel I should jump in because it's important because it could save you pain. Make sure you are using the right muscles for each exercise. Our body likes to cheat to make things easier for us but in the end it can cause lots of problems e.g. if you are doing an arm exercise and the muscles of your neck are doing the work you could end up with a migraine, similarly if you use your back muscles while doing core work your back could tighten in a bad way, then pull the rest of you out of alignment. It's a lot of mental work to Que or "turn on" The right muscle groups so your have to find a way that works for you, I like to imagine the right muscles moving under my skin and to ignore the wrong ones but some people like to imagine the wrong muscles moving like melted chocolate or fish hook pulling and letting go. https://www.self.com/story/get-more-out-of-every-workout-mind-muscle-connection this gives a good overview of the idea. If you are having problems and noticing strange things like your legs being uneven, feeling or noticing you aren't standing straight(due to the tighten thus rotation of muscles) or being sore in places your didn't work out you should try Pilates, it might seem strange but it's very good for learning muscle awareness and no matter how fit and strong you are it will always be hard.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm Australian, I love all animals and I hope to own an Australian native (legally in Australia you can only own native reptiles and amphibians) non-venomous snake one day, our wild life is truly amazing and venom is such a wonder of evolution. The things about Australian snakes, even the most deadly one in regards to LD-50 (the lethal dose to kill 50 percent of test subjects) the Inland taipan is that they don't really care about people and are fairly chilled out, with some hot(venomous) snakes you have to really bother them to get them to bite. People are told this to avoid "The only good snake is a dead snake" sentiment. He got bit because he messed up, you can own hot snakes with the right permits and that's a good thing because it allows for education. Common saying "the most venomous snake is the one that just but you" Snakes are very important to the ecosystem, they are also helping us make massive advances in medicine, there is a analgesic in development made from the venom of black mambas that is far more effective then morphine with far less side effects. Snakes are great and we should do our best to respect and love them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>YES!!!!!!!!! I'M NOT ALONE my prebotox summers (since hot weather is a trigger) were filled with taro yogoberry with strawberry bursting balls. I was recently at Ikea with a migraine and after enjoying a soft serve with a brain freeze my pain went from a 6 to a 4 if only for around 30 minutes. This is because brain freeze is a kind of headache and our brains can only feel one headache at once. Migraine researchers will actually induce brain freezes because it's the only headache that can be studied reliably. My Neuro said that it's not the first time she has heard brain freezes helping a headache but resorting to cold food to ease pain is a mark of someone in a lot of pain and I shouldn't have to do that.</TEXT>

I get chronic migraines, another illness that is very common and also disregarded all the time so I empathize and understand how bad it feels when there is clearly something wrong but people can't or won't see it. What has always helped me is I say "you are more them welcome to come to my next appointment" or if it's really bad I give them my doctors number and say that I will give the doctor permission to share information about my case. I'm sorry she didn't believe you, but I can safely say that once you find people that do and care dealing with a chronic illness gets much better.</TEXT>

Tell a trusted adult or the police, she is in a lot of danger, her mental health will get a lot worse if he actually gets his hands in her. You can't stay silent, she is at risk of being assaulted. In the meantime be very honest with her e.g. "I care about you and am concerned that this man is a Ephebophilia ( a sexual attraction to people aged 15-19) it's not normal for a 25 year old be want to meet up with a 15 year old and am worried he is taken advantage of you"</TEXT>

He would have convinced her that everything that's going on in normal small step by small step. She needs a lot of help but like a lot of people with mental illness she will struggle to get it. As she is in emanate danger something has done soon. You can walk into any police station and say "my friend is about to meet up with a 25 year old, she is very depressed and I am very concerned for her safety" go with an adult you trust. As much as people like to shit on the cops they deal with this a lot and have to help you. She may hate you but by doing this you will have saved her so much pain.</TEXT>

I can't stress this enough, she needs help far above what someone her own age can give her, you can sit a listen to her all you can and take this to the authorities but she needs professional help. It's also not your job to keep her safe because it puts you at risk as well, the best thing you can do for both of you is tell an adult as soon as you can and if that adult won't listen keep going until you find one that will. You have done amazing so far and she is very lucky to have someone like you.</TEXT>

Brutal honesty is best, just tell them you have something very important to tell them, get them to sit down and just come out with it e.g. " I'm very worried about my friend, she told me she is meeting up with a 25 year old and she has also told me she is dealing with self harm and I'm concerned she might be suicidal" Giving them the time to sit down lets them know that it's serious, don't beat around the bush and be clear when you say you feel she is a great risk. If you are very worried about how they will react tell them it's bad before you tell them the whole story and that you really need their help and support, I would add that it's not about you but a friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog was severely abused as a puppy, he was found emaciated and terrified of his own shadow. I adore his foster mother, she is the reason he came through it all and ended up with me. Adoption is hard, especially with an abused animal but the moment I locked eyes with him I knew I was never going to give him back and it was mutual. I was the only person he would come near for weeks, he was terrified of people no matter how they approached him but I was his person for the first second. After so much training, effort, expensive vet visits and love he is much better, he does his best to make friends with everyone. The term forever home is special because it's not just about keeping a dog, the "minimum decency" it's about loving the dog. A forever home is so much more then a roof over the dog's head.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Australia here, my first instinct is to be mad but I feel it would be better to educate you. We have a rich and deeply interesting culture/history. Our indigenous people often referred to as ATSI (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders) are thought be be the oldest culture and people on the planet, each nation has a it's own language and customs. You don't know about it because you haven't look hard enough. Education costs as little as $200 a year for state schooling and that's if you choose to pay school fees, in theory and for low income people it's free, in fact the government helps families that are struggling to pay for school. I agree that the cost of living is high but not for most people. Our minimum wage is much better then most of the world and we do have a social security program that helps people keep their heads above water. The spider thing is a stereotype, they won't hurt you, most of them will run from you and research into their venom could cure cancer. Shake out your shoes and don't wander around outside in the dark. The weather is fine, you've just come here at the wrong time and aren't adjusted to the conditions. The next 3 are solved by getting a VPN and not crying over small things. Austraila is as racist as everywhere else, I'm brown, I have all kinds of friends and from my experience most people in this country are ok. I also hate sports and so do a lot of people. Like in most countries sport is filled with entitled idiots. This point is so incorrect it's funny. I have only seen crocodiles in a zoo and only run into snakes out on bush walks. We have one good thing going for us, since April 1996 we have only had 3 mass shootings.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's time to see a doctor, the worsening of systems while not uncommon it's always good to get checked out just incase. You have my sympathy, while I don't get abdominal migraines the chronic pain does mess with how much I eat. One of the reason at (least for me) that cramps get bad is because when you fill up with waste it pushes against the uterus. Try eating small bit of fruit or veggies through the day to help make sure there is a little pressure on your insides as possible. Try drinking some more water as well(not saying this in the way the one person we all know does) it helps keep your tissues hydrated and flushes out pharmaceuticals which can upset your stomach.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That sounds absolutely horrible! Some times doctors on kick their asses into gear when you end up in hospital. The question "has your condition ever caused an ER admittance?" is very common is specialist clinics. To some degree I know how you feel, I have had migraines since 8 and I'm now 22, I got a good doctor at 17. My best advice is to do you best not to get upset when talking about how your medication isn't working anymore because you look drug seeking, instead the best thing you could say is "I hate taking medication, are there any non-narcotic options you can give me" or talk about what you are open to trying, e.i. acupuncture. Good luck, I hope you find relief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I drummed my hands on the cool countertop towards the basketball sized geode in the middle. My thoughts focused on how best to crack the thing open, one hard thwack to the middle? No this one was special. It was somewhat lacking in character like it hadn't seen the wages of time but formed like clay in the hands if a crafty child I grabbed my favorite chisel and a hammer. "Tap, tap, tap" the sounds reverberated through my hand and into my arm until I had tapped all the way around the rock. Then I palmed the rubber mallet and hit home. "CRACK" It fell apart. The first thing that hit me was the smell, not unpleasant but not all together enjoyable, very much like the smell of petrichor and moss. However there wasn't the usual texture I was used to, instead it was like the inside of an egg. As I leaned down for a closer look I saw movement. As this thing unraveled itself and took shape I saw that it was soft looking with a coat fine blue fur and a sweet face. "Chirp chirp" This creature was small, about the size of a mango and looked like something between a kitten and a honey badger. I was at a loss, I had brought the thing home and from what it seems brought it into the world so I couldn't just get rid of it. "MUNCH" What ever it was just took a huge bite out of my granite countertop. Oh no! It was reaching it's small fluffy arms out at me, does it want affection? It began to wiggle, then as if part flea leaped directly into arms. It's going to be a long night. Be nice this is my first one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A very similar thing happened to my dog, I was taking in the shopping and one of the dogs in the complex pushed itself under my garage door, it run into my home and began to corner my dog. The cat is a very good big brother and puffed up as big as he could and scared the dog off, her ass owner wasn't even there and had the gall to go off at me because my cat could have hurt his dog. I was shocked and my dog who was rescued for dog fighting took about 5 huge steps back in his training. The best advice I can give you is to first make a dangerous dog report, then give your dog some time, I found acting like nothing was wrong helped because my dog didn't feed of my fear. Once he has calmed down a little if he has a dog friend meet up and enforce his enjoyment. Get the dead dogs owner to help make the report. I'm sorry this has happened, some people shouldn't have pets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For one that's slavery and two you can't put a value on human life or suffering. If you want to be brutal about if a homeless person with no net worth ends up being worth less then a person with a 9-5. What about sexual assault, does the violence of the act make the price, what about the age of the victim. Stealing isn't cut are dry either, some things are priceless, a WWII medal may be worth less then a tv but for the person it's worth far more. These crimes you mentioned are all against people, animal abuse shows that a person lacks empathy and statically, are more likely to commit violent crimes against people but animals aren't worth much and is a beloved pet worth more then a stray. For crimes with victims it's also about getting justice, it's about not letting people who are dangerous out into the world and it's about peace of mind for the public. In the end with a system like this one the rich will have to even easier because corruption is everywhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Civil ligation and crimal punshiment are two very different things, as I understand you are referring to people who have been convicted and are to be sentenced. You have missed my point, in the end with the way the world works someone is going to end up having to pay less for the murder of someone who "doesn't matter" Money does not undo suffering and trauma can't be measured, rape is rape, a beating is a beating, are some people more physical damaged? yes but some people deal with trauma better then others. There is also the point that paying a fine doesn't make some a better person, there are people out there who should never see the light of day again. Rehabilitation is possible for most people but some people need a swift bullet to the head. Goggle Anita Cobby, by your reasoning if her killers paid what they owe they can leave prison. I have a rescue dog that was severely abused, no amount of money could fix him, nor could it make up for the amount of stress I go through to make sure he doesn't go on a back slide. I agree that reparation need to take place but it's only a part of it, I disagree with you on punishment, some people don't deserve the oxygen they breath and working a minimum wage job for a decade or two won't change that.</TEXT>

I know how much they each need to be fed to stay healthy and how much extra I can give them as a treat without over doing it. I also know that feeding the right food and the right amount of it is part of my responsibilities as a loving pet guardian. * If I overfeed my worms the environment they live in turns against them and they will all die, that doesn't mean that I don't give them a little treat of their favorite foods every now and then but I know how much they need and don't over indulge because in the end it will hurt them. * If I overfeed my fish the water fouls, they have digestive problems and they will die, that doesn't mean they don't get a treat, it means that I know what they need and do my best to ensure their best interests. * If I over feed my cat he will develop lifestyle diseases that will shorten his life and lead to a reduce in the quality of his day to day, he still gets treats but I know that giving them to him in excess is cruel. * If I overfeed my dog due to his poor breeding the arthritis will kill him before he turns 10, he also has serious intestinal issues so he is on a very strict diet, that means no treats and no extras. Do I want to give him those thing? yes but I know he can't have them so I listen to the experts and don't give in. Food is one way to show love, but it shouldn't be the only way and if it is you end up using food as compensation for things you can't do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The house had character, it wasn't like the new house on the street all blocky and white, it was a weather worn, double brick structure made of hard work and soild door frames. The inside was very much the same, nothing fancy but it had soul. I was excited, the backyard was big enough for a small chicken coop and a nice veggie garden. My neighbours were being odd, I had taken over some cookies, cooked in my not so new kitchen when I was asked if "anything weird had happened" I thought "not really it's was a little cold but so was my childhood home and I like it that way" "No one has stayed there long, people say it's haunted" ok? These people have perfect lawns dispite the fact I can hear a dog and they think my home has a ghost, if the lawn wasn't enough of a reason, I dislike these people. The few nights were lovely, my cat and dog enjoyed the large bed I was able to fit into the master bedroom, I still have no space to sleep on but anyway. I woke up this morning to the smell of male cologne, which is strange but what I found in the bathroom was very strange. On the mirror in what looked like blood was a message. "Those wretched cats were bothering your hens last night" This was alarming but when I went outside to check them they were all huddled in the nest box and I didn't get my normal morning hello. As I walked back into the bathroom I realized I had to. say something. "Umm thank you, I will have to buy some soild screen to slide in at night" This continued for weeks, little massages here and there. Always accompanied by the gentle smell of a mildly earthy cologne. "You forgot to turn the kitchen light off again" "The water company is screwing you over, call someone to check the meter" My dog, a mess of separation anxiety stopped caring when I left the house, the cat stopped bothering my fish, and no matter what everything always flourished in the garden. I know the house is haunted but I never thought to ask by whom because they were always helpful. One night before bed I decided to find out. "I'm very greatful for all your help, I feel you know so much about me but I know nothing about you, if you want to please tell me?" The next morning I again woke to the smell of cologne, there was a very long message on my bedroom fall to ceiling mirror. "I was the person who built this house, I worked had all my life to provide a good life for my wife and I, after she died I couldn't continue to live without her so I followed her soon after. Every person who has moved in since wanted to change the place I worked so hard to build so they had to go. But you didn't, you loved the worn garden beds and scraped hardwood, you are deserving. I won't be here for much longer now I know you aren't going to leave, please remeber to turn all the light off when you go to bed"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fine red dust got into everything, my team and I (that's 6 other people) had begun to traverse the wide rocky landscape when we landed 2 weeks ago and it was becoming a real hassle, we would have to send a message to earth for them to get us some more nanobot repellent. We had found a large flat area to set up our instant houses, which were a handy invention by a 25 year old origami artist that came in a box the size of a small IKEA cabinet and unfolded to the size of one of those tiny houses that were trending in the late 2010s. The enclosed plant boxes and terraforming fans went up next and we took a day to build the small scooters that would take us across the planet. We had just moved though a small mountain pass when we reach the spot we though was suitable to set up an experimental pond when we found it. Buried under the sand about a foot was what looked like a a piece of wood, it had been painted a rich brown and had fairly large nails embedded in it. We stopped everything immediately and made our way back to base camp. After 3 hours of tests we came to the results that it was in fact wood and the methods used to make the nails were from Ancient Rome. We went back the the sight as fast as we could manage and dug until our hands bled, this hard work yielded more wood, some crockery and a stone tablet covered in writing, each piece was carefully taken back to camp and analyzed. All the results came back the same, carbon dating told us it was from Ancient Rome and the stone table was written in a mix of Greek and Latin. Once it was translated we began to make our plans to go back home, this place was a godless hellscape and there was nothing the people back on earth could do to stop us from telling the truth. *10th year of the exploration of new Rome.* *The last us are scumming to the conditions, the water systems we worked so hard to cultivate have dried up for the 5th time and the livestock keeps dying, the humans that were infected by the great disease that came in the 3rd year have killed 9 soldiers this week and I can hear them coming closer to the camp.* *I am writing this in the hope that rescue comes, if the madness of the heat and the red dirt takes me before I reach earth please take heed. Do not continue this, this land is cursed, death comes to no man, there is no release from this place.* *Appuis Flavuis Maxima* We could hear noise now, it wasn't wind or a storm, it sounded vaguely human.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know about you but I'm very happy the western world went to war with Hitler and Nazi Germany, I wouldn't he here if he won neither would any my friends. Just because you have don't understand it doesn't mean you shouldn't respect it. I worked in a nursing home for about 2 years and met a lot of vets. Lots of stuff stuck with me but the thing I think about the most during this time is a Korean war vet who for the first time in his life couldn't stand for the anthem and the last post. He started to cry when he needed someone to hold him and so did I, it's a very painful memory. When you are in a room full of people, both men and women who were willing to lay down their lives for the freedom of their fellow county men it's very moving. ANZAC day means something to a lot of Australians, you are exercising your free speech, you should be thanking the ANZACs for that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for taking the time to write. It was a great story, the only criticism I can give is that I would have loved if the Tinker character was move developed.

    <TEXT>As a woman I find some of the ideas are so far from what I think, feel and act that it makes me think the amount of women that actually interact with with tiny. They say "AWALT" but that can be extended to so many things that are arguable just as wrong but even more hurtful. I don't go into it because I have no desire to sprout racist or sexist lies. We are all unique and are shaped by the lives we have lived and the choices we make instead of what's in between our legs. I would not leave a partner for someone better unless the relationship was unhealthy. I want to be loved honestly, I don't care about money and if I found someone who loved me unconditionally then I wouldn't care how much they spent on the ring or how the wedding went. But going by the red pill because I'm a woman I'm a liar so what I say to you has no worth to you or anyone else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can you not see that she is terrified of him, I'm not going to insult you dispite my desire to. Please take the time to educate yourself about how abuse starts and the cycles of abuse. It seems you need to learn how to empathise with others, to me it's clear when I watch her that she is trying to keep calm while being very distressed and she is clearly thinking about her baby. Yes she chose him but with abusers she most likely chose a very different him to the one you are seeing and it's likely that after this he will be an amazing person to her so she stays. It's called the cycle of abuse. Build up then abuse then the honeymoon phase where the abuser is kind and give a gifts and apologises then it goes back to build up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, most papers state that water has the ability to act as both an acid or a base depending on what it is interacting with. Taking into account the pH of pure water is also important, the standard water pH 7 which is neutral so not an acid. https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Book%3A_The_Basics_of_GOB_Chemistry_(Ball_et_al.)/10%3A_Acids_and_Bases/10.3%3A_Water_-_Both_an_Acid_and_a_Base https://www.healthline.com/health/ph-of-drinking-water It's on a case by case basis, my tap water ranges for a pH of 7-8 therefore it can't be an acid, if you can provide sources to the contrary please do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand you, it's so aggravating when you are doing everything you can and other people just don't care. I got my rescue dog just over a year ago, he came to me as a puppy having been bred in a dog fighting ring and left to stave when he didn't make the cut. Knowing this I was very careful to make sure he had good interactions with other dogs so he didn't become fear aggressive. Despite all my best efforts he can become fear aggressive because he has been attacked or bothered by other dogs, either when the owner wasn't paying attention or simply didn't care. Now he has to wear a muzzle when we go out on walks because despite that fact that it is illegal to have our dog off leash in public areas where I live most dogs we come across are off leash and have no recall. It isn't all bad, he has two dogs that he loves and plays with all the time, these dogs are very different but come from the same family and I can't even say their names out loud because he gets excited. You can't control other people and sadly not everyone is going to be as responsible as you.</TEXT>

Here in Australia Cannabis is illegal so the only thing I can take to kill my migraines are opiates and being on Botox I have to limit it. A lot of days are very unpleasant but I'm still holding in to hope that Cannabis will be legal soon. It's only a matter if time for it to be made legal at least for medical use so I'm very glad to here that it's given you relief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are 4 human responses to a threat, fight, flight, freeze (human tonic immobility) or fawn(submitting or pleasing the person). Freeze and fawn usually happen when a person knows they can't do the first two. This is what's often the case with male on female abuse because most men are bigger and stronger and fighting won't work and running is not possible. Both men and women are guilty of not understanding how strong men are, you can't fight back if your attacker is far stronger then you and fighting will get your head bashed in. Please take the time to learn about the physiology of abuse and how it starts. You don't want your ignorance to be a reason for someone to not disclose to you or worse, for you to walk by when you could have helped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The human response to a traumatic event isn't always to fight, there are four: Fight, flight, freeze(human tonic immobility) and fawn(submission) the one that happens is the one the brain deems will keep the person alive. Abuse happens slowly, people don't leave because they have been beating down mentally and emotionally before the first hit is thrown. Abusers are amazing at picking people, they chose victims who don't love themselves, have little to no support, who have been through previous trauma(called revictimization), who are overly kind or trusting and thousands of other reasons. Abuse happens in a cycle, this is: The building of tension, the incident or abuse, make up or honeymoon where the abuser builds up the victim, gives them gifts, apologises profusely and promises to be better, calm where everything is ok then it starts again. Abusers are great at making the honeymoon wonderful and using gaslighting and manipulation to make everything feel less horrible. Victims blame themselves and abuser strive to cut them off from the support they do have so they can't leave and have no one to tell them what's going on is not right. It starts small and gets worse and worse because the abuser has convinced the victim that no one loves them, what's going on is their fault and it's not as bad as is feels. There are lots of video and articals you can read that go more in-depth about this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn't life threatening and most vets will offer payment plans especially during this time. From my experience vets will also charge less to owners who aren't in a situation that was their fault e.g. flea infestation vs epilepsy. These things happen and it's not like you've left it. If it is an impacted gland then what you need to know is that they are far more common in dogs who have loose stools as solid ones express the glands. Signs of glands becoming an issue are things like when a dog scoots it's butt across the fall. Some groomers will do it if as standard practice but that's only when everything is ok, if you are honest with your vet about your financial situation then they may be able to figure something out, most vets charge about $20 for regualr expresstion which if your dog is elderly they may need for the rest of their lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cats are wonderful and affectionate creatures. There are may things that will impact the behavior of the cat and most of them can be helped or fixed by changing our behavior as owners. * Never let your cat outside unless it's in cat run ( an enclosure that you put outside) Outside cats are at risk of being killed by dogs, cars and other animals, they get in fights with other cats and that puts them at risk for infection and they kill native animals. (For people who live in cities) * Don't force your cat to love you, once you get them give them time to get to know you and wait to earn their trust. * Spay or neuter your cat, they will react less to to other animals in the house and other cats walking around the neighborhood, it will also reduce their urge to wonder and leave. * Make sure you keep on top of their health, a sick animal will act strange. * When you get them make sure you spend time with them (the first 2 weeks are important) even if they don't want to be around you encouraging them to play with you or just to in around you will help them grow used to you and other people. Just be there near them. * Have enough litter trays, start with 2 then an extra for each cat and put them in important places in the home. This helps them know that it's their house. * If you get a rescue and they specify that it's a multi animal cat (a cat that has to live in a house with another cat or a dog) after the 2 week isolation period in which you should be slowly inducing them through doors and via smell, you must let them spend time together, a relationship is important if the cat can't be alone and you need to let them get to know each other and establish boundaries. Don't leave them unsupervised for a few weeks. Please consider getting a rescue, both adult cats and kitten are in desperate need of a home and shelters are often full of unwanted cats. Neonates 0-8 weeks are at the great risk of being put down so if you have the time and money fostering is an amazing option. Edited for clarity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't give my dog cooked or raw bones, he housed a large raw lamb bones once and the vet said that he doesn't recommend bones at all but especially not for dogs that eat them crazy fast as they can create obstructions and puncture the gut, it's also a waste of calories because they can only absorb so much nutrients at a time. Bones(my dog) loves bones but it's just not safe for him.</TEXT>

You have not listened or understood anything I have said in this post and you seem unable to absorb my point. This person chose to make 2 sexual comments which I did not want and made I that clear, why should I make space for people who can't respect boundaries and can't apologize when they have been told as such. Now I feel as if I'm a being made to justifie my emotions because you can't understand where I am coming from, I felt uncomfortable, angry and as silly as it seems a little gross.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-06-01 04:42:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Giving a genuine apology is important and is a part of a healthy relationship. There are 4 basic steps to apologizing in a way that makes the other person feel understood and allows for the people involved to move past the incident. 1. Acknowledge that you have done something wrong e.g. "I'm sorry I was hurtful" not "I'm sorry you feel hurt" put the onus on yourself and not the other person. State what you did wrong so the person feels understood e.g. "I shouldn't have yelled at you, it was wrong to lose my temper" 2. Show remorse and take responsibility without justifying the behaviour e.g. "It was wrong of me to do/say that and I'm sorry" not " I'm sorry but I was tried" 3. Take immediate steps to change the behaviour and state how you will do so e.g. "I will try to do better in the future, how can I make amendes, is there anything I can do to make it up to you" 4. Don't repeat the behaviour. Edited for grammar.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Help! Mealworm farm for friends birthday is failing.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-04 13:13:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>My best friend has chickens and is always meaning to get around to making a mealworm farm but never has so I have made one for her birthday. I got the Pisces brand as when I emailed them they assured me they don't use hormones. The mealworm are in a standard 3 layer step up with organic oatbran as bedding and I have been feeding them carrots and apples. Everything was going great but the mealworms have started to die. They are sheding and eating huge amounts so maybe I'm just being anxious. Is there a normal amount of die off? If not what are steps to fix the problem? Thank you, any help is very much appreciated.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Go through the proper channels and if it's illegal where you live then don't do anything, endangering your country's biosecurity is not just illegal, it's immoral. Wild caught birds do not thrive and often have diseases that can be passed on to native populations, buying a bird or eggs from a smuggler furthers the destruction of the ecosystem and of endangered animals. If you can't afford the few thousand dollars to buy a bird then you won't be able to afford the vet fees that result from a sick wild caught bird. Cheap in regards to animals usually means poorly bred and sick. They live for 40-60 years and if you can't fork out the money to begin with then you can't afford more the half a century of care. Breaking the law is fine if you are the only one to feel the conscience but in this case the thing that will suffer the most is the bird.</TEXT>

In the meantime if you are taking him on walks start using a muzzle. r/reactivedogs will have more advice on how to stop him from barking at others dogs, getting him neutered may help but not as much as proper training will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A very expensive and high end free from sulfates, milk based, natural, human shampoo called MooGoo milk shampoo. I have tried lots of products and most either caused huge hair fall or skin irritation, I also use the cream conditioner from the same line. Every time I have tried to switch to something else his skin goes down hill. There is very little smell and only a small amount of foam but it's very gentle and there aren't many ingredients. He is a bully mix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have given up where I live, local council forbids dogs off leash unless in a off leash dog park or beach and yet I see it everywhere, and most of the time the owners are on thier phones not paying any attention. The dogs have zero recall and it got to the point where my already nervous dog was being approach out of the blue so often that he began to get fear aggressive, so I got him a muzzle and still tried to take him for a walk but that didn't keep other people away and only solved my anxiety at him biting another dog that got too close, which as I found out one day was never a problem in the first place because he never started anything and if a dog stayed away or the interaction was controlled he was fine. (In hindsight it was my anxiety that lead to me believing he was going to be aggressive no matter what in the first place). COVID only made things worse, there was no time I could go out to avoid other dogs and it was more common to see a dog off leash then on. Now I take him on bush walks with my friend and her two dogs(whom he adores) and exercise him the house and backyard. It's not him I'm worried about, I can control him, it's other dogs and their absent minded owners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My dog had a shocking past, love and care are very important but so is training. Make sure your vet knows everything and if things are going horribly there is no shame in using medication to make things easier for everyone. My dog was also emicatied, that fear of starving doesn't really ever go away so a slow feeder will help if he is prone to inhaling his food. Things do go wrong, my dog would get so scared if we were carrying anything in our hands he would cower and urinate, when it happened it was cleaned up and there was no fuss made. He has been with me just over a year and has gotten much better but there are still bad days. There may be long term medical complications, poor nutrition can take a while to recover from but there are lots of solutions. Despite everything I love my dog very much and he could never be replaced, it's truly worth all the time and effort.

    <TEXT>My dog currently has him face buried in the kitty fluff we are all sitting together watching foodtube, the first time they got close enough to touch the cat warped his paws around the dogs neck and went to town. As long as it's not happening all the time and they aren't really going at each other it's fairly normal. Supervise them together and give treats and food when they are in the same room so they learn to associate the other with good things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been doing my best to cut out candy and chocolate both for health and to save money, this has been a wonderful way to still get a fix of chocolate and sweet without all the sugar. Serves 2 Equipment * Small pot * Spoon or Spatula * 1/2 cup measure Ingredients * 1/2 quick oats * 1/4 cup water * 3/4 milk of your choice * Pinch of salt * 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. * 1-3 tablespoons of sweetener of your choice(I use maple syrup) * 1 tablespoon chia seeds(optional) Method Add all ingredients into a pot and cook on medium high for 5-7 minutes or until it gets thick. Pour oats into a heat-proof container and let sit for 20 minutes or until warm but not too hot. It should be thick, if it's thin add less liquid next time or cook for longer.</TEXT>

This is not a problem with Muslim or even Islam, this is a problem with the leaders in Saudi Arabia who follow a literal interpretation of the Qur'an, they reside in Islam's most holly place and it's where a lot of important people go to learn about the dogma. There are plenty of Muslim who want reformation to a more modern understanding but it's hard work when the people who run the most important country in Islam jail people for insulting the prophet.</TEXT>

These are not community cats, they don't interact with people and are aggressive when dealt with. Australia is running a huge eradication program because of how damaging feral cats are to the native environment.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Make sure they are humane traps, if you are in Australia you can rent them at Kennard Hire, my Mum and I had to rent some to deal with some stray kittens and from memory they aren't more then $100 (I think they are about $60). Just put some fish or something else smelly at the closed end and once the cat is caught cover it with a towel and leave it in a quite place till you can take it to the pound. Your local council pound will deal with the rest. If it's not chipped and/or registered it will be humanely euthanized.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-02 04:36:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>These patties are easy to put together and there are only a few steps so aside from the cooking time they are fairly quick. Serves 2-3 (makes 8 7cm (3 inch) patties) Equipment * Oven tray * Box grater, use the size you would for making shredded cheese (you can use a food processor) * Sharp knife * Cutting board * Large bowl Ingredients * 2 medium beetroots * 2 medium onions * 2 eggs * Spices of your choice (I used paprika, coriander seed, cumin and pepper) * Pinch of salt * Wholemeal flour of your choice(I used spelt) * Thumb sized piece Ginger * 3 cloves Garlic * Oil of your choice (I used olive) Method Cut onions fine and grate beetroot, add to the bowl with spices, salt, ginger, garlic and eggs. Mix together by using your very clean hands to squash and rub vegetables(it should start to get a little moist) add handfuls of flour until the batter gets to a thick consistency that holds its shape (1/2 - 2/3 cup) Line the oven tray and spread 1/2 tablespoon of oil on to it, take a handful of batter and push out till till the patties are 2cm (1/2 inch) thick , add some oil on top of the patties so they crisp up and cook in a 180c (350f) for 1 hour or untill the top feels dry and a little crispy. (preheating the oven isn't important) If you don't use all the batter that day add a small amount of flour when you do as there will be some water that comes off the veggies. I had it with some salt but I think it would also be nice with some hot sauce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just make the batter a little thicker and start on a low heat, the beetroot is raw so you want to give it time to cook hense why it doesn't matter if the oven in preheated. I would also use a bit more oil just in case they are liable to fall apart.</TEXT>

They should be asking lots of questions and asking for references. Backyard breeders are a huge problem here and the mark of a responsible breeder is that they are thorough.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me with the first tank I set up it took about a week to notice a positive change, 3 days is fine. When the bacteria starts to work the water may get very cloudy but that clears up in a day or two. The second tank took 3 days but that's because I used water and filter media from my established tank, if you have a friend with a tank try that. Your LSF may give you some used media but just make sure they have healthy fish or you could transfer disease.</TEXT>

Most of the stuff he puts out is laughable e.g. the face veil is obligatory, woman can't be uncovered around anyone who they aren't closely related to which means brothers in law and second cousins, music is the voice of Shay #7789; #257;n (the devil) and listening to it will make you an unbeliever and my favorites, it is better to die in a war torn Muslim country then to live among the non-believers, the only reason he is in the UK is for Dawah (to convert people) and it is wrong to rise up againt a despotic Muslim leader.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree completely, I have two rescue animals, both have cost me money other then what it costs to keep an animal healthy. My cat has had feline acne that turns into abscess every few months, he doesn't go outside and has glass or metal food and water dishes, it's just something he has had from his time in the shelter. My dog came to me as a puppy from an environment of shocking abuse, the training, anti-anxiety medication and expensive food he needs is very costly, not to mention the work the people around me and I do to keep him a healthy weight and the amount of time it took him to recover emotionally. I love them both very much and would happily go without to make them happy. All my friends and family have rescues, not one has been cheap and some have cost tens of thousands. You can't claim to love animals then suggest a kill shelter because they you didn't do your research. I feel your anger and the attitude of these people doesn't help the problems of shelter animals. On a side note, feeding obligate carnivores (cats) and omnivores (dogs, fish and birds) vegan is cruel and it shortens their life and it's quality, certain ingredients in grain free dog food have been linked to heart failure.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-25 08:46:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Making a child eat everything on their plate will in one way or another damage someone's view on food. I have seen this outcome often and it's usually expressed in a few ways: 1. People don't stop eating when they are full. I don't want to offend anyone but a lot of the people I know who struggle with their weight been brought up in homes where they weren't allowed to leave the table until they had cleaned their plates. 2. Meal time becomes a chore or downright unpleasant. When I went to stay with my father and his partner she would make me eat everything on my plate, I didn't portion the food out myself and it was often food that she wouldn't eat and that I hated. Meal time became me taking an hour to eat something because I was gagging between bites. I know people who are very picky eaters because they were forced as children to eat food that made them feel sick. 3. People who have small appetites will portions out less for themselves because being hungry is better than feeling sick. 4. It creates fear of going without "if you don't finish you won't get anything else" can sound like "I'm going to punish you for not finishing by leave you out" 5. It makes someone a picky eater, you're going to stick to what you like if you're going to be made to eat all of it. 6. Food becomes a reward "if you eat everything you'll get dessert" this creates two problems, for some people it's "I've been good I can have this" and for some people it's "I haven't been good enough so I can't have this" 7. It can cause a dislike for certain foods, sometimes to the point of a phobia. In the same household I was often fed soggy, fatty bacon that was cooked in a microwave, if I even smell bacon cooking it makes me feel sick and this is more than a decade later. I have encountered this with many people I know who can't stand different dishes or ingredients. Instead a child should be encouraged to try everything more than once without the pressure to eat all of it and if they genuinely don't like it then that's ok, also if a child doesn't manage to finish then they can eat it another day.

    <TEXT>I very much agree that children need to be made aware of food waste and the importance of how the food got in their plates. From my experience and what I have read a child is just as likely to develop an eating disorder if they are made to eat when they don't want to. Children who are given a range of foods won't want to eat junk, I should have said that I don't believe junk should be available to children all the time. As I stated above children should be encouraged to try things at least twice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, they did a whole heap of crazy stuff. They bled people (leaches are still used in some applications), they rubbed a manner of things on the buboes (the masses that formed on the lymph nodes) and they didn't bathe because being too clean can make you sick. It's all about the 4 humours, if one of those of off you got sick. Plus the black death was so bad because they killed the cats and dogs that ate the rats infected with plauge fleas.</TEXT>

All you can do is offer support, have a code word to mean "get me help right now" and make it something you can fit into a conversation with ease. Gather evidence yourself, by keeping texts and recording what you see in a notebook, it may be helpful down the line. Part of abuse is isolation so don't be surprised if things get bad between you, again all you can do is be there for her. https://www.dawnhouse.org.au/safety-planning-booklet here is a safety plan, you may find it helpful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are your cats fixed? This could be one reason. Another is that they don't have enough litter trays, for 4 cats you should have 4-6 trays and they need to be kept very clean. If you haven't clean the crate enough to get rid the the smell that's could also be it, you need to use an enzymatic cleaner. I would say that your cats tolerate the dog. My cat and cat are the best of friends, they groom each other, they sleep together in fact the cat will go out of his way to snuggle with the dog at night and the dog is very overprotective of the cat. This has happened because they have learnt to stay away for each other when it's needed. If you want their relationship to improve you need to teach your dog how to give that cats space and not play rough with them.</TEXT>

He goes out wearing a muzzle because even though it's illegal people in my area don't leash their dogs and I don't want to get in a fight when he's approached by a poorly trained dog and a irresponsible owner. I have come to terms with the fact that he will only ever have two dog friends, who he loves to play and spend time with. He isn't good with strange dogs owned by strange people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Most fried rice needs old rice but I have found that this dish is fine with fresh rice as long as it's correctly cooked. Fresh or jarred for the garlic and ginger is fine(I use fresh) Serves 1-2 Equipment * Fry pan * Chopsticks or wok spoon or plastic spatula * Sharp knife * Cutting board Ingredients * 1 cup cooked brown rice. * 1 large red onion. * 1 medium bunch coriander (silantro) if you don't like coriander try using half as much thai basil. * 1 teaspoon garlic. * 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger. * 2 teaspoons shaoxing rice wine. * 1/2 tablespoon Sesame oil. * 1 tablespoon lemon juice (I use fresh, not sure how bottled would turn out). * Salt to taste. Method Cut red onion into thin half moon slices, mince garlic and ginger and medium dice coriander. Add sesame oil to fry pan and heat over medium heat, once the pan is hot add onion and stir fry until it takes on color. Toss in shaoxing rice wine and cook until it has evaporated (around 4 minutes) add garlic and ginger and fry until fragrant, add coriander and cook until it takes a dark green color (1-2 minutes) add rice and stir or toss continuously for 4 minutes, take off the head and add lemon juice.

    <TEXT>The fact that you want to adopt is perfect, you may have to wait or try a few times but shelters do check and will have dogs and cats that can live together. In my case my dog (Bones) had to go to a home with one or more cats. My cat (McCoy) had grown up around a very sweet dog (Wellington) who passed about a year before I got Bones. I got Bones when he was around 5 months old and the cats in his foster home were adults so I don't think the age matters. What I will say is that Bones is very overprotective of McCoy, he knows McCoy isn't allowed outside and all I have to say to him is " the kitten is outside" and Bones will find him wherever he is in the backyard and herd him in. I can ask Bones where the cat is and he will find him and if McCoy is misbehaving Bones knows and will stop it. The vet and trainer has said it's because he is part cattle dog and that as long as it isn't making him anxious the behaviour is nothing to worry about. McCoy is a very sweet cat that I got as a kitten but he was fostered with dogs. When my previous dog passed McCoy got sick and stayed very depressed up until a few months before I got Bones. McCoy used to leave 2 kibbles out for Wellington and did it for almost a year after he passed, 2 days after Bones arrived the 2 kibbles was back. They sleep together, they groom each other and I can truly say that they love each other. I got lucky and if you do too(fingers crossed) be aware that it's far harder on them when their best friends passes than on you.</TEXT>

I also know that killing or torturing them won't make them any less likely to offend but it will make them more likely to kill their victims so they don't get caught. I suggest to everyone that they learn about the pathology of a sex offenders and how to recognise the signs of child abuse. Paedophile doesn't equal sex offender, if you know the difference you may be able to intervine before it gets to that point. It's really unpleasant learning but you could save a child a lifetime of trauma.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Child free people are just that, child free. An antinatalist for one reason or another doesn't believe having children isn't the moral good thing. In my home county (Australia) adoptions are very difficult, at my age of 22 I could only adopt a child between 0-4 when older children are in the most need and they have to be "open and honest", in other words you have to tell your child as soon as they understand where they come from no matter how bad that situation was. Fostering is worse, I knew a foster family that took in babies from all kinds of people, and they would end up devastated because they had to hand a baby back to dreadful parents as the courts had deemed them as "fit". If the laws allowed it I would have a home full of children but I can't go through what I've seen other people go through. I would spend my time angry, hateful and sad.</TEXT>

Watch some Kitten Lady and Jaxson Galaxy, there is no guarantee that a breeder kitten will be healthly or your aren't buying from a very clever Backyard breeder. A shelter kitten will already be spayed or nurtured, vaccinated and microchiped which will save your around $400.</TEXT>

It will take around 3 months before your iron levels get better. I had some hair loss from anemia and from medication. I make masks with ingredients that are also in commercial hair growth products like peppermint oil and nettle extract. If you want to make a hair mask you will need to do some research on what carrier oil is best for your hair type but never put anything on your scalp without doing a patch test first and you must add essential oils like rosemary into a carrier oil like coconut.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I clicked other because I have 3ish years of vocational training. In Australia it's called TAFE and is considered tertiary education. It's mostly for people who want to go into a work force that needs some kind of qualification but can't afford or don't want to go to Uni. My genetic disorder stopped me from finishing high school, while my old school mates where doing the HSC (end of school tests for a grade to get in Uni) I had already received one certificate and was working in aged care. Both my qualifications are in community and mental health, I have been told over again over again that TAFE students are preferable to Uni ones. You don't need a high level of education to make a difference in society nor does having a degree make you a better person or more inclined to be an antinatalist.</TEXT>

The Gap is known for suicides, Donald has since past away but he did save a lot of people. As an Austrailan is was very upset to hear about his death. He was said to have saved 160 people but his family said it was closer to 500 which makes more sense considering it was over a 45 year period. This man is a hero.

I think it's a combination of everything, the ash makes the air filthy and the smell of fire is everywhere no matter what you do. Having gone through this for months it does help to keep your doors and windows closed and dry your clothes inside. If you have an air purifier run that but I'm not sure how much it will help.</TEXT>

NOPE, in fact they called my Neuro and abused her for giving them to me. It's all been fixed now but it fucking sucks. This is going to sound terrible but if you're female get a man to come with you and be your advocate if you can.

    <TEXT>I disagree, as someone who lives with chronic migraines I would love access to cannabis but it's illegal where I live and getting cleared for medical use is difficult for people with terminal illness let alone a other wise healthly person. My migraines have nothing to do with lifestyle, they are genetic. I drink 2 liters of water a day, I eat healthy, I exercise and I get decent sleep. When I get a bad attack opioids are my last resort, I don't get high and I hate the side effects. When I hear over and over again that using cannabis has given people their lives back it makes me happy for the person and sad for myself because I don't have that. If I was ever given cannabis I would never take it to get high, I would take it as a form of pain relief and if it didn't work (in some cases it doesn't) or it didn't allow me to cope with the pain e.g. being able to fall asleep during an attack I would stop taking it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have a look at r/migraine there's some info there. I have lived with this condition since I was nine( now 22) the migraine community is international and we support each other. We also give suggestions, talk about the effectiveness of medication and vent about the condition and all that comes with it. I have discussed cannabis use with multiple doctors I have had over the years and the majority have told me that it may be very helpful but as I said before I can't get my hands on it. Migraines aren't just intense headaches, they are a neurological condition with a whole host of symptoms. For me it's sensitivity to light and sound, nause, vomiting and lack of appetite, massive aggravation caused my movement and brain fog (I can barely put a sentence together) I would do anything for relief.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>All the people to know have been told by vets (7+ years of study) to keep their cats inside. My cat has had a problem with abscess since he was little, the vet I see regularly knows he is indoor only. He told me a story that he had an outdoor cat show up no less than 10 times for life threatening infections from fights, the owners wouldn't keep the cat inside and it eventually was killed by a dog when it wondered into a someone's backyard. Domestic cats don't belong on the streets, they kill native animals and are constantly at risk, they don't stay away from streets and road or cats wouldn't end up at the vet for emergency surgery after being run over. Outdoor cats spread communicable diseases like FIV and Feline panleukopenia not to mention thing like ring worm which they can give to people. Your assertion that indoor cats have behavioural problems is wrong, in fact it is suggested by Animal Behaviorist that if a cat is overly aggressive to not let it outside because indoor cats are friendlier. All the nasty (and unhealthy) cats I've met have been outdoor cats. Rescues will often refuse cats to people who think like you and in some places it's now against local law to let your cat outside unsupervised. Cats can be walked on a leash and there are large outdoor enclosures you can buy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not true at all, my indoor only cat is a very healthy weight and has plenty of stimulation. Jaxson Galaxy calls it catification, in which you transform your home into a cat friendly place. Also I'm not American, as an Australian I take pride in the fact that I'm doing my best to protect our unique and important wildlife buy not letting my cat outside. My sibling has 2 cats, both are rescues and both would perish if allowed outside. One has no teeth due to neglect from a previous owner and the other has serious neurological issues. They are the most happy, well care for cats I have had the pleasure to spend time with. My own cat is loving, docile and healthy, he likes the warmth of the indoors and the company that people provide. He was outside once when the door came unlatched due to wet weather, the reason I knew he out was because he was yowling at the door to be let in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first thing you need to do is to go get tested, you can contract STI from lots of sex acts so oral sex won't prevent anything. Do you have the HPV vaccine? because if not you should get it. Sex is public isn't ok because the people around you haven't consented to be involved. There are lots of sex educations channels on YouTube that can help you and since you are religious is recommend God is Grey https://www.youtube.com/c/GodisGrey sexplanations is a great resource as well https://www.youtube.com/user/sexplanations</TEXT>

Most STIs are asymptomatic so you won't know if you have one. If you're using Latex condoms stop, latex allergies are very common and there are other types that some people say feel much better. Again sexplantions is a great source for all this infomation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As a vegetarian I concer 100% vegans are nasty and arrogant. Apparently my best friend's back yard eggs are cruel and exploitative. Those chickens live better than some people and have their every whim indulged. I love milk and eggs so I support my local farmers by buying from farmer owned brands and since they are locally sourced it's easy to hold the company accountable for animal welfare, I can safely say that my food comes from happy animals. Vegans can't say the same thing about the farms that produce their food.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a new level of crazy, I have a thriving worm farm and they eat like royalty. They love avocados and when I get ones that are rotten I throw them in whole, when the conditions are right I get a sprout a few weeks later and to day I have 2 healthy, hardy plants. I have very little vegetable waste because of the farm and I have to plan when I feed them because it takes a few steps to make the food as consumable as possblie (freezing then defrosting then blending). I use their leachate in my compost which handles my paper waste and the organic waste the worm farm doesn't get. In turn the casting (what the worms produce or worm poo) go to my garden which is set up to be native bee friendly and is an orgainc fruit and vegetable garden. What I don't use goes to friends. Without the worms none of this would be possblie as the climate I live in often kills plants in an afternoon. Being vegan is not the best way to look after the planet or your body, I would much rather food waste get broken down in the worm farm than rotting in land fill.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If they're a dog you can train them to do it outside. My dog had massive stomach problems due to malnutrition as a very young puppy and would vomit often, everytime he started gagging I would in a very happy voice tell him to go outside and when he was done throwing up I would tell him he was a good boy and wasn't in any trouble. After a while he learnt that when he was feeling sick he should go to the back door just like when he needs to go to the toilet. If I didn't get there in time it happened in the laundry or on the plastic mat in front of the laundry door so it was easy to clean, I never got upset at him if it happened on the carpet. You should also invest in a slow feeding bowl regardless if you have a cat or a dog which helps a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cashews before processing are covered in urushiol a toxin that can cause very painful chemical burns, a lot of cashews are harvested by slaves and prisoners leading to the name blood cashews. You can get ethical cashews but good luck finding and affording them, where I live (Australia) there's one brand I know of and they only come in snack size. Synthetic leather and wool don't break down because they're made from plastic. Short version, America gets avocados from Mexico and sends back sugar filled obesity fuel. On the mental health side of things many people who love animals are deeply impacted by the false message and misinformation vegans spread. If like me you rely on pharmaceuticals to function, animal testing (for the time being) is necessary, seeing animals being tested on in labs won't change that fact but it does make me feel like shit. Living 100% ethically is impossible and the constant pressure that vegans put on people is unreasonable and cruel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you love animals the best way to care for them is to educate people on how to buy ethically, dairy from farmer owned businesses, free range or barn laid eggs, meat from animals that are raised in good condition e.g. sow stall free pork, using all the animal, buying sustainably sourced and wild caught fish (farmed fish may be bad for both environmental and personal health). Hunting when possible and done to deal with problematic animals is a good thing as long as the animal doesn't suffer when it's killed. If someone can't afford to buy in this manner don't treat them like shit, they're probably trying their best.</TEXT>

I don't get to have a mentally bad day because if I do my migraines are no longer a physical condition and I don't get the pain killers in need to eat and sleep. I get to hear the usual bullshit on the regular "have you drunk water?" "try lavender oil" "is it caffeine?" And my favourite "I get migaines too" they then proceed to get drunk that night or go do some kind of sport. God I want to slap her!</TEXT>

I need pharmaceutical to function and I know at some point they have been tested on animals. It's taken me a lot not to feel guilty about that. The saying is "you catch more fly with honey than with vinegar" but vegans don't seem to get that. I'm not harming animals or the planet by drinking small farm milk and free range eggs.

    <TEXT>There are steps you can take before turning to pharmaceuticals. Jamaican black castor oil, caffeinated coffee hair masks and rinses, using essential oils like rosemary and anything from the mint family, nettle tea masks and rinses and various hair masks using egg, yogurt and honey. Swap to shampoo and conditioner that is free of silicones, sulfates and parabens. Try not to dye your hair unless it's a henna or a other natural the that won't damage the hair shaft, wash your hair with cool or warm water or finish your shower with cool or warm water. This works for me because I have very curly hair that has certain requirements, so if you do try anything keep in mind that it might be too much for straight or wavy hair. Note: Some hair does need silicones and sulfates to not to horrible, always patch test oils before using them and never put essential oils directly on the skin, don't use coffee after 6pm (it might wake you up). These things are not a substitute for going to the doctor if hair loss is major and has a rapid onset, hair is one of the indicators of health, if you're losing is all of a sudden get a blood test.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have super curly hair that was coming out in clumps after Topamax, it went away when I stopped taking it and got my iron levels up. Look into jamaican black castor oil, if caffeine is not a trigger use coffee hair masks and stimulating essential oils. It would also be a good idea to swap to shampoos and conditioners that are free from harsh chemicals. Try to drink 2 liters of water a day, use a wide tooth comb and sleep on a silk pillowcase. It's taken me 22 years to look after my hair to the point where I can sleep with it down and not have to worry about knots and frizz. If you have the money lush has heaps of good stuff just be careful the smell of the store doesn't set you off. I also like Hask hair masks and shea moisture coconut and hibiscus and the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen and Restore Treatment Masque. The benefit to all these brands is that they are cruelty free. You should also get a thyroid test, if you need any help with recipes for hair treatments feel free to DM me, I don't want to comment an essay. Keep in mind you will need to work your hair care routine around your migraines, so it may take some getting used to. The curly girl method is not foolproof and didn't help me on bit, I've found it's best to come up with your own care plan.</TEXT>
