    <TITLE>Funny happenings from my Frey playthrough.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-30 22:19:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>started in AFFC. I am King Stephen Frey right now, married to a Baratheon queen. began by getting all the marriages i possibly could. Seated a Frey girl in the Vale by marrying her normally to Harold. but i married into Edric Storm. married a Frey to Brienne and she stayed at my court for a long time training my armies and children. I threw a bag of gold at Brynden Tully's feet and for some reason he came to my court....in a bookmark after the Red Wedding. Idk maybe I threatened Sansa or something. At one time I had Brienne, Blackfish, Lyn Corbray and a dragon rider in my court. Daenerys stayed in Essos and at one point executed Lynesse Hightower which I thought was funny. i matrineally married her to a Frey. then all of her sons died off meaning the Frey I married her daughter to (who has a dragon) is now seated as High King of Ghiscar. swore fealty during a war and pushed Edric's claim on the Iron Throne. he turned my Frey into a Baratheon magically, so i tried it again with Edric's son, eventually seating a Frey as king, ruling from Riverrun. got Frey LPs in the Trident, and Reach. pushed Walder the Red for the West but he keeps getting instantly overthrown so now that I am king, i could fabricate on Casterly Rock and seat the half lannister half Frey line there. the Baratheon-Frey line is more or less secure and i have Frey seed all over the Trident as well as some places in Westeros. the LP of the Trident rules from the Blue Fork. everyone i could i sent off to the Wall so you have a good crop of badasses guarding the realms. gave away Twins to another Frey line. i hope to eventually replace all the LPs with Freys now that im finally King.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The perfect timeline</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-02 14:36:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>started as Robert, moved the timer back so it is like a month before Aerys burns Rickard and Brandon. walked my 20k Stormlord armies up to KL and demanded I be king (consoled myself claims because I should have a claim anyways but it wasn't registering), and literally every LP except Dorne jumped in for me. Sent Aerys to the Wall after I dueled Rhaegar in the trial by combat and spared him. Married Lyanna, who is still alive and she's already pumping out trueborn Baratheon kids. Arthur Dayne and Ned never fight so they're both safe and alive. Married Stannis to Lynesse Hightower as Cersei already got married to Gerion. Long live the Crowned Stag and Wolf! on a side note, Jaime got blinded and kicked out of the KG by Aerys so he is now back as heir to the Rock. Was planning on marrying him to my bastard daughter Cassana.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[SPOILERS] What if the White Walkers never woke up?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-04 05:14:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>i'm talking about showverse only. anyway here is my theories. first, the Watch would stay an army of thieving boys and play not much role in anything. Jon swore a vow and he was gonna keep it come what may. Only time i think he would be truly tested is if he would ride south to fight Joffrey or not. Renly would have won and become king. This is because it seems Mel's purpose always was fighting the NK and if he's not around, there's little motive to try crowning a Prince Who was Promised. she would have simply held off on that until they did wake up. so Stannis would not have had the men or the support to challenge his little brother. Though I doubt he would have the same plans. I think if he wanted to fight Renly he'd try to do it defensively. Hole up in Dragonstone and try to bait Renly into a siege while Robb destroys the Lannisters. Hopefully he could make Robb and Renly fight each other. but I dont think Robb would as all he would have wanted is Sansa returned back safe and Arya. Arya would be but I think Ilyn Payne kills Sansa as Baratheon-Tyrell troops take the city. Robb would be disappointed an obvious usurper is king but now he would have been free to simply bend the knee and go home. Or if he insists on pressing the issue, retreat north and dare Renly to come. if so, Robb would have been able to get back north in time to maybe save Winterfell from being crisped and locate Rickon. pretty much all the Starks are back in Winterfell by this point, and Theon is beheaded by Robb. You might eb saying "Well Dany" but i think since Tyrion died fighting Renly, he won't bring Jorah back to Dany which means she dies in the arena before Drogon can save her. but if she did invade she would have been facing a more or less peaceful united Baratheon kingdom as well as the North who won't be so hot on her either. the only houses i can see rising up for her is Martells and Darrys. with Dragons obviously it's only a matter of time before Renly is charbroiled and given Tyrion is not there to advise her not to be queen of the ashes, i dont think Daenerys other advisors would have been able to stop her ordering a siege of the Red Keep. Tyrion seemed to think Cersei was so unpopular, that all other houses will join Dany against her. wont happen against charismatic popular King Renly. a full on all out attack right away is her only chance. so let's say that goes well and long live the queen. Renly is killed and Shireen bends the knee and is named Lady Paramount of the Stormlands. she does not have an heir. her heir is technically Shireen. so when Daenerys dies it would either pass right back to Baratheons or there would be a Great Council in which they may crown Gendry king if anyone can find him and if he didn't die in the firestorm. thus the winner of the Game would have been Petyr Baelish because since he would have aided Renly in taking the throne, he likely keeps his head and is able to continue plotting and scheming behind the scenes. as Lord of Harrenhal hes kind of a big deal and knows which way the tide will turn. i can see him having Dany offed and seating Shireen in there instead as she is more easy to control.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>personally i think he has alot of potential, depending on where you start in the timeline. you could go before the Rebellion and be Storm King. you could go after it and fix him so he is a good king and is raising Joffrey to be awesome too or you could play a day before his death and just see how long you can last drinking and whoring your way through Westeros. or never care about the Iron Throne and leave it all to the Targs while you sit pretty in the Stormlands married to Lyanna.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-04-09 14:11:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I moved the timer back so I could make Aerys awesome. ended up with a Great Council that backed Aerys as heir after Jaehaerys died and Aerys won of course because this timeline's Aerys is a kind honorable skilled warrior and leader of my kingdom's legions. I moved the timer back to just after Aegon IV died so i could be young Daeron and stop the Blackfyre Rebellion. ended up naming Daemon to my kingsguard. I mentioned this one before but I managed to avert the entire problems of the latter portion of the bookmarks by rebelling as Robert a few months before the actual RR bookmark. this time, every single house joined me except Martells and I married Lyanna beforehand. Jaime got blinded and kicked out of the KG and I married my bastard daughter to him. As Renly i avoided the entire shadowbaby business by moving the date to when Ned is in Joffrey's jail cell. and after a failed Targaryen invasion, I had both my brother and the two Targs in my court marching in my army as we went to deal with Joffrey once and for all. Let me know your fun custom games. Try to avoid the cliche "starting as Ned in prison".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As Gregor? Try to kill as many major characters in personal combat as you can. however the sad fact is you're probably going to be assassinated within a year as what usually happens when i play Gregor. Sandor should marry for a decent alliance somewhere near your high lordship so you can grab up one of the high lordships. you won't get very far as Sandor as hes not much of an intrigue guy but as his son/daughter you can start slow and build up. Fang Tower is literally one of the weakest counties in the West so it will be satisfying when you build beyond it a few gens in and place House Clegane on the Iron Throne. you coudl even do something a bit different and become King of the Rock. or do a Lannister loyalist campaign where you never betray them unless they lose the Rock. goals: you should become as powerful as possible and crown a Clegane king. raise alot of martial sons to live up to Gregor's footsteps stay loyal to the Lannisters as Gregor and Sandor. but if their heir is more intrigue based, maybe they will betray them</TEXT>

Joffrey Jaime and Tywin are on the Wall and Cersei's at Silent Sisters, after I demanded Tywin's lands and deposed him after he crowned himself King of the Rock. decided to stay Old Gods and slowly convert the South back. i say its the perfect timeline because I married all my kids for love. Arya is betrothed to Gendry. Bran is betrothed to Meera Jon is legitimized and married to Dany Robb is married to Talisa Sansa is married to Willas eating lemoncakes in Highgarden. I couldn't think of anyone for Rickon so i married him to Myrcella after I beat Joff threw Theon a bone and married him to an Umber (does he look like a FUCKING umber to me?)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well Aegon tends to be too easy. The character I think with the most unique events is Jon Snow but holy hell is his scenario hard without cheats. Robb Stark has a ton of unique events including one where as long as you cheat in ambitious you can either take the Iron Throne or stay being King in the North. as well as either leave the throne for a rando or give it right to Stannis. Daenerys has a lot of unique story events but is too similar to Aegon the Conqueror once you get powerful enough. In my game as Dany, I agreed to marry Victarion and together we took the kingdoms. Taking the Iron Throne as Aegon VI also has a few unique beats including being legitimized as a Targaryen, recieving the sword Blackfyre, and marrying Dany the most fun I had regarding unique decisions was probably Robb and Dany.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The go to thing you should do is pick your favourite character and play as them. i think the hardest challenges can also be the most rewarding when you finally do win. such as Jon Snow and Edmure in AFFC and Maelys Blackfyre. the one i recommend alot is pick one of the Seven kings during Aegon's conquest and try to fight him off without bending the knee. if you do lose, rise up from within and destroy the Valyrians</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it can take a while to start making money. my best advice is take the business focus, invite to court people with really high stewardship and only spend on your eldest child's education, making him also high in stewardship. the rest comes later. also can depend on who you are playing as. you could have only one county but also be Driftmark, which is a strong county only a few wars away from forming the High Lordship of Dragonstone or Cracklaw Point. even if it takes 200 years to get really powerful, its all the more rewarding. i tend to play as the king right away, but only because i don't like vassals having internal wars, and having little to do besides collecting alliances. you could try playing as someone in the Crownlands so you can get direct access to the king and be on his council so you can collect favors and become more powerful that way. also the alternate history aspect is probably what appeals most strongly to me. starting right before a major bookmark civil war and preventing it with clever diplomacy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For me its the funny little happenings regarding the characters we know, and the funny/cute alternate history scenarios it can create. my favourite thing is going to right before a major civil war and either ending it in five seconds with a landslide win, or preventing it altogether by knocking off the tyrant king or making him into a good king. also marrying Lyanna Stark. always a fun thing to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No. i don't have it either but i make do. another aspect to getting money is making everyone like you. this is done by always trying to play as a good ruler, and not torturing prisoners/plotting to murder people. not only does that mean more good stewards will come to your court/marry your kids but it also means nobody wants to fuck you up and kill you, sending your county into the control of your newborn son. if you're being drained by dowries, then maybe marry your daughters matrineally to lowborns who have good stewardship so they won't ask you for a dowry. also get a good diplomat in your court so you cna fabricate claims and get the de jure high lordship.</TEXT>

Edmure in AFFC is a bitch as you start in prison and minus 50%, its basically just you vs the entire might of the Iron Throne and you have no money. you could console kill yourself and become Blackfish however. if you play as Hoster in say, crowned stag or Greyjoy Rebellion, its much easier to get more powerful, if you're careful with your marriages. and Hoster in Robert's Rebellion could be interesting.</TEXT>

Fifth in line to the Iron Throne due to the Second Blackfyre Rebellion succeeding early on in my game, and my machinations early on to marry Freys to Blackfyres. currently a Frey is second in line to the Iron Throne. anyway back to Tywin. For most of his life he got educated by Bittersteel so thats partly why he's so epic. and my actual heir is my 3 year old son Stevron. Original goal of the campaign was to make Walder Frey badass. he is ok except for craven which dragged down his stats. but in this timeline they live in a world in which Walder in his heyday is a skilled warrior. and on another note, his sis has very high stats in just about every category, married to the Crown Prince and is my spymaster. she's basically female Varys</TEXT>

    <TEXT>started as a minor Lannister of Lannisport. Queen Fiona, the granddaughter of Arya Stark and the Lord of Lannisport, is Queen of the North, Vale and Rock. She is married matrineally to the LP of the Reach so our children will inherit that too. My father is on the Wall voluntarily and he was the one who really made all of this a possibility. he married my uncle Rickard Lannister to the queen so they will ontinue the Iron Throne line of Lannisters via both the son of Arya and the daughter of Tommen. Arya's the only Stark left and she went completely cruel and crazy during her time as QITN. the Trident is controlled by some random house after every Tully died off. Martells still have Dorne. I attempted to get a marriage with them but they're stubborn. my sister is married to the Lord of the Stormlands who is a Lannister as well and the grandson of Myrcella. so my line is intermingling with Jaime and Cersei's line there too. i have no interest in the Iron Throne. so I will leave that to my uncle's line. other than Dorne and the Trident, House Lannister controls all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>started as Lancel in AFFC. ended as one of the greatest queens to sit the throne. Greater than her mother, Myrcella. and named after her grandmother who died miserable. Lancel died almost instantly, then Kevan died, then Myrcella was married to Martyn. he hung out in Darry for a while but a faction installed him as Lord of the West over Cersei who rebelled again later on but died while fighting me. King Martyn was sent to the Wall, so i became Cersei II, though she had a little brother who was ahead of her but died too. then Myrcella dies and Im queen. everyone loves me so i was able to convince the lords to attack the Stepstones. Lannisters rule in the Reach, West, iron Islands and Stepstones with designs on installing them elsewhere.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>alternate timeline Aerys turns out to be a total badass. I'm about to launch the final conquests of the Summer Islands but before that, had to tame my grandfather's dragon (after Aegon successfully hatched his egg and didn't blow up Summerhall). Edit: I am now Emperor of Summer Sea. I also worship Lord of Light, married my granddad's widow, am lovers with my sister and skilled warrior/commander. Basically Rhaegar a generation early.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my main advice for you is pick who you like from the TV Show/Books and play as them. either to make them even stronger, or to change their canon fates into something better. the most unique playthrough and events is probably Robb Stark, Jon Snow and Dany from Clash of Kings and Feast For Crows respectively. so if you enjoy playing them, then i advise doing that. dragons make things a little OP and easy after a while however. my favorite was Dany simply because it was so rich with story detail, different decisions and paths. all you have to do to make it challenging is turn off dragons before you start her game. but my second favorite is probably my rise to power as the Freys. it was interesting to say the least of using my huge amount of children to parley into alliances, push Edric's claim and eventually become king. not too hard but not too easy either. so it depends on your taste. start as a strong ruler and try to maintain it. or rise up to power from being a minor house. a very interesting start date for regular rulers is Crowned Stag. Robert has just been named king so its a time of peace. you have moe time to set things up, parley marriages and rise up without having a massive continent wide civil war happening. though one might still break out. Robert likes to arrest people</TEXT>

Aerys will die soon enough, then you're King with your beautiful wolf by your side. I would suggest going back one year before the Greyjoy Rebellion, and playing as smart Balon where you only make your move when you know you can win. bonus points if you successfully make half of Westeros independent from the Baratheons If you like a challenge, maintaining power as Boltons in Feast for Crows, Edmure in Feast for Crows and Maelys Blackfyre</TEXT>

I agreed to back a plot to murder Tommen. and when i got kicked out of the KG for my betrayal, i still had the title of White Sword Tower and got hte option to marry Myrcella. So I did. then when i became Barristan the murder plot suceeded, and Myrcella is queen, making Loras King of Westeros. and their daughter together will inherit.

    <TEXT>you can but you need to do the Expand by conquest ambition, then give him the title. and yes some of my funnest times were as Robb. i have taken the Iron Throne as him, stayed in the North, married Margaery, married Dany etc. a good plan as Robb would be to start a day after Ned's death. that way you would be able to amass more power and wealth, marry into the Reach, and already have all your siblings in your court to also parley for alliances. if you seize the Iron Throne (by consoling in ambitious before you unpause), you immediately will be thrown into action and chaos. once you defeat Stannis and Balon however, then you're more or less free to create the LPs you want.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>was playing as someone else in Westeros. then saw Dany die in battle, and Barristan won the ensuing council, her titles passing to him. so i switched to him and eventually fabricated claims on New Ghis, which i won, and founded the empire while replacing all the local lords with my Westerosi generals. a Selmy stands as King Consort of the iron Throne, Barristan's still Emperor at 84, and his eldest son Prince Rhaegar Selmy is King of both Astapor and Dorne, married to the LP of the Vale. which means Barristan's grandson will be King of Ghiscar, Dorne and the Vale Margaery's still going strong as Queen of the iron Throne, and is known as the Noble. nobody has ever really threatened her besides the Whitehills who got independence and became their own kings. but then Whitehills lost it again and it became King Rickard Ryswell who crowned himself rather than have a council. A Selmy is married to his daughter. for some reason, the titular title of Aegon's host stuck around after his death so Varys is just randomly a king with no men in the south corner of Westeros.</TEXT>

Umbers you can roleplay as always willing to fight people, especially wildlings and fight personally in trials. if your Boltons then make all your kids intrigue, plot to kill all the Starks and usurp the North. House Hightower is a pretty good one where you can roleplay as scholars who still want to go up the ladder of political power. great for a long game as you can first get the reach then plot to sit on the Iron Throne</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bookmark: Crowned Stag. You are Doran Martell, and your sister and her children, your niece and nephew were brutally killed by Ser Gregor Clegane on the command of Tywin Lannister and the approval of the so called King Robert Baratheon, the Usurper. Your plan is to take revenge and reinstall the rightful monarchs, House Targaryen to the seat of the Iron Throne. Goals: kill Ser Gregor, kill Ser Armory Lorch, and destroy the power of Tywin and Robert, by placing House Martell and House Targaryen on the throne. secondary goals: kill every last Lannister and Clegane. Destroy their power and Tywin's entire legacy, then install a Martell in Casterly Rock. If possible, get your new Targaryen overlord to grant you independence, as a Prince ruling from Sunspear. conditions: To start off with, console yourself a war chest of 500 gold. Invite Willem Darry back to your court to discuss war plans. You cannot marry into any of the families that support the Usurper or Usurper's dogs. Sorry Stark fans. Reach is acceptable but keep in mind the long standing rivalry between the Reachmen and the Dornishmen. Keep Sunspear as the capital. I care not for these Northern fools. If Aegon invades, believe him to be real and help seat him on the throne. If all the Targaryen children die out, you must raise your flag of independence, for it is now truly clear the sons of Dorne should no longer bend their knees before that iron chair.</TEXT>

In response to this, and to Robert being about to win, he blew up King's Landing, and killed all Targaryens off. in the ensuing chaos, a rando took over the throne until a council was held. basically the choices were Mace or the Otherys line in Braavos. Needless to say, Mace got elected king. but two of the kingdoms have left and the capital is obliterated. i don't know if he'll keep highgarden as capital or move to Dragonstone however. in any case might be interesting to see if he can keep power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my advice is pick a character you like, or family you like, and try to seat them on the throne. whichever one you think best fits, whether it be Kings landing, King in the North or Iron King. sounds as if you might enjoy being Mance the King Beyond the Wall. it tends to be nearly impossible when you include Walkers and Dragons so turn them off before the game starts. then off you go. bonus points if you completely kick the greenlanders off the throne and put your wildling commanders in every seat of Westeros. if not him then maybe a more minor Northern house such as Mormonts or Forresters. they both have a very good lineup of characters that you might recognize from the books or show. i am also pretty partial to Petyr Baelish, whatever bookmark you like. if you begin as Baelish in Crowned Stag, you have no power or money, just one shitty county. but you have good intrigue and you have to use that to climb the ladder. or you can choose Feast for Crows in which you're already a powerful lord and once you marry Sansa and take the Riverlands, the world is your oyster</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started as Hoster when Edmure was 1 years old, with the mission of making my children more badass than in the original timeline. for the most part i succeeded. Lysa is a good commander and skilled fighter, temperate, brave and honest. she married Jaime Lannister and they seem very happy. pumping out sons like nobodys business. Edmure is a fantastic warrior and a true heir to the kingdom, authoritative, skilled commander, formidable fighter. however hes greedy...so theres that. Married him to Robert baratheon's young sister. Blackfish married Lyanna Stark with one son between them. Catelyn had some trueborn kids with Ser Elbert Arryn but then out of nowhere had a bastard with...Euron Greyjoy. Victarion married Cersei. just fuckin batshit pairing there. Arthur Dayne, since i started when he was a young teen, turned out shit. complete shit. same for Rhaegar. Rhaegar was hopeless at fighting but decent enough in diplomacy and stewardship that he found his way to Lord Commander on the Wall. I kept an eye on Baelish and noticed he had been married off to Rhaella Targaryen after Aerys got himself killed as he always does. I was a loyal vassal at first to the Targaryens but eventually, once i became Edmure, i plotted independence and eventually became DA KING IN THE TRIDENT. it wasn't really that crazy in terms of gameplay. just usual marriages but damn those marriages were sometimes friggin hilarious. and the idea of Lysa Tully being a kind badass is funny to me.</TEXT>

Aegon the Conqueror if you go forward manually to after he's already taken down the kingdoms is good as you have only one enemy left (Dorne), three dragons and two sexy wives. and his bitchin stats means everyone is pretty loyal. Jon Arryn any time before his death. extremely high diplomacy means a gigantic Crown Loyalist faction, you're almost always on tthe King's council and only problem thatt might arise is after your death and the heir crisis begins</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the latest bookmark, with Darkstar and Edric Dayne. mostly because its where you have everyone we know and love. so you can choose where you end up and marry into who you want. some good choices would be Brienne and the She Bear as they can help train Daynes to be awesome. if you want to get Ser Arthur Dayne, then manually go back to before he joined the Kingsguard. that way you also get to play with Ashara and marry her to someone awesome.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are Petyr Baelish. Once you were a lord of a few bird stained rocks on the Fingers. Now you rule Harrenhal, a once powerful fortress that was granted by the Lannisters as your seat. In your care is Sansa Stark, whom you spirited out of the capital. Now you sit poised to wed her yourself and claim the North for House Baelish and Stark. Yet a greater goal waits in the shadows. A greater crown. Preamble: Basically we want to do what Show Petyr wanted which was seating him on the throne of Westeros with Sansa by his side, as by the time of this bookmark, Catelyn's no longer an option. Bookmark: A Feast For Crows. Goal: Become king with Sansa as your queen, preferably the Iron Throne but King of the Trident is acceptable, as is being Lord Magister. I will consider being Lord Magister of Westeros as completing the challenge. Secondary goals: Rebuild Harrenhal. Join a Society, such as Cult of the Stranger and become a master of the shadows. Get a Valyrian sword for House Baelish rule: If all else fails, and you die, play as Petyr's son and get a crown on his head instead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my favorite so far was probably Robert during Crowned Stag. your this burly big badass, everyone is loyal (more or less), and your already king so the hard work is done. now you can focus on duels, parties, making friends, starting a war vs the Stepstones, making 20 bastards, colonize Oldstones and get a cool sword out of it, swing a hammer into the face of that fool Viserys (or marry him to your daughter), and raise your son to be a tall bearded lustful badass like yourself. cuck your brother Stannis, raise Renly to be a badass etc. and my favorite individual character to play is probably Ser Gregor and Robert because who WOULDN'T want to be the biggest toughest strongest guy around, winning every single trial by combat personally and swinging a hammer into people's faces? it's how i died the first time as Robert, as i had won every trial but my last one, then finally let Joffrey (who i had been moulding and training into being a good king) take over. his father, Jaime, even became Lord Commander of the NW so yeah that was a really fun campaign. Ned during the Crowned Stag bookmark is good. It's not particularly hard or inventive. but you have so many different options. thats what makes it good to me. you could stay loyal to the Baratheons which is probably what Ned would do. you can claim the Iron Throne for Jon. you could marry into the baratheons until you've seated a Stark on the Iron Throne. you could crown yourself King in the North then try to maintain that independence as long as you possibly can. you could make it hard for yourself and just go on a mad dash for glory, turning the North into a slaver state racking up gold. or convert the south back to the Old Gods. in terms of specific scenarios, i feel that Dany had the most work put into it. there are so many different events flying at you, from Quentyn Martell and Tyrion's arrivals, to Victarion sailing into Slaver's Bay with a deal for you. and unlike Aegon's conquest your surrounded by all these characters you know and love. once you're done with those events, you're probably so strong nobody can stop you but that can be fun too, trying to rule a vast empire where half of them want to knife you. another one i had alot of fun with is Baelish in AFFC. you start off landed with a good castle unlike his previous starting points, so you arent stuck in a quagmire of trying to get off the Fingers. you already have. then you can get a good marriage, pretty much anyone you like, win most of your wars with intrigue and kidnapping if you push it high enough, and then once you attain power, face the problem of people hating you and how you took power. but also having so high diplomacy that you cna placate them all with your smooth talking gregarious personality. all Baelish needs is for you to push him up to skilled fighter, and he might actually be one of the best kings Westeros has ever seen. terrifyingly effective, vast network of spies and high as hell diplomacy and stewardship which makes things like colonizing summerhall much easier. he's bloodraven if he wasn't a Targaryen, in alot of ways. and speaking of Bloodraven if you land him, he can be entertaining too in his own right. one of the things i find most boring about this game is the constant management of your children and their marriages so i tend to pick baelish and other characters with just one guy in their dynasty because now you need to save your line from almost complete collapse. rebuild it from almost nothing. Ned in the Rebellion/Crowned Stag is pretty much down to just him and his brother. so good marriages is key.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are Torrhen Stark, King in the North. You have just recieved word that a dragonlord from the old days of Valyria has landed in Westeros and proclaimed themselves king of all Westeros. Many feel we cannot fight such beasts but no....we are Starks and we shall fight these Valyrian invaders to the very end, win or lose. Goal: Keep your crown as king, and should you fail to, steal Aegon's crown and name yourself King of the Iron Throne. if you end your challenge still a king/Lord Magister, i will consider that a completion. Kill the dragonlords or otherwise force them back to those shitstained rocks they called home. Secondary goals: Colonize Skane and Oldstones. Wipe out House Bolton and Whitehill once and for all and put in loyalists there, or one of your sons. Show the Ironborn who can truly call themselves King of the First Men Rebuild the Stark fleet, lost long ago. Conditions: give yourself a war chest of 600 gold. Give yourself a claim on Dragonstone to force the war if it glitches out or if Aegon goes east.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I want to be THE queen! The Margaery Tyrell challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-16 00:51:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>You are Margaery Tyrell, only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Lord of Highgarden. Ever since you were a little girl, you have dreamed of a crown, to sit yourself upon the throne of Westeros. In days past you believed the only way was marrying the King but your ambition knows no bounds. Only ruling Westeros yourself shall suffice. With your brothers at your side and under the leadership of a strong woman, House Tyrell will rise to prominence and power. Bookmark: Clash of Kings. Then you, as Mace Tyrell, pick the option to side with neither Joffrey or Stannis as that won't help our plans. if you don't get that option, move the timer back to the day after Robert dies Setup: Ok normally you can't play as Margaery. And I want her to be around without killing off her brothers as they will be very useful to our plans. So what you need to do is add_trait disinherited to her three brothers Willas Galan and Loras. then type "die" in the console so you go from Mace to Margaery (or allow the abdicate option in the rules). Okay. Now you're Margaery, Lady Paramount. Goal: To see Margaery with a crown on her head dominating most of Westeros. How you do this is up to you. Whether it be Queen of the Reach, or Lady Magister, i will consider both completing the challenge. Secondary goals: Get your son on the throne if you fail and die. Find a Valyrian sword for your son to wield. Colonize Summerhall. Keep Highgarden as the capital to rule Westeros from. It is a mighty castle and it is fit for a queen. This challenge requires some cheating so if that turns you off, sorry. That's the only cheating you need to do to have this work.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Blood and Fire: Return of House Blackfyre Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-17 05:21:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>Your name is Daemon IV Blackfyre, last scion of a nearly extinct dynasty of dragonlords. Your family has raised you in secret to be a great warrior, and future king. You know what it is to suffer, to hunt for food, to train until your hands bleed. Westeros believes the last Blackfyre died with your ancestor Maelys. But you will show them that you do not steal from the Black Dragon. Rumors abound Daeron the Good was Aemon the Dragonknight's bastard which means the throne passes to you. The Iron throne is yours by right, and you will claim it. Setup: You're a custom Blackfyre in the Stepstones. Give him control over Bloodstone. Give him 1500 gold. This is to buy sellswords, particularly the Golden Company, the army of exiles your ancestors used. Give him the traits, Formidable Fighter, Dutiful Commander, Duelist, Brave, Just, Proud, Authoritative and Strong. Give him a claim on the Kingdom of the Stepstones. Give him strong claims on the Seven Kingdoms and Dragonstone. Once you have united the Stepstones, it's time to marshal your forces against the Baratheon pretenders. Their armies are weakened, and at war with one another. There is no better time to strike. Bookmark: A Clash of Kings. Puts you right in the action. Secondary Goals: Find a Valyrian sword. Blackfyre is all but lost to us but we can start anew. Find and tame a dragon. It is your birthright to be a dragonlord and conquer all who stand in your way. Kill all Baratheon pretenders including this boy king Joffrey. Kill the false dragonlords if any remain, those bastard Targaryens who call themselves the true kings. Pah. We shall destroy them and take their dragons for our own. Raise up and support the houses of Westeros who initially supported your ancestor Daemon I Blackfyre, and any houses who declare for you when you make your move. We reward our friends and they stood with your ancestor when he needed them. Rebuild House Blackfyre. It's almost dead and only you remain. Console Lustful if you need to, but you must create more Blackfyres. Alternatively, say to hell with Westeros, and form your own enormous powerful kingdom of New Valyria. Rules: If you fail the challenge or die, give yourself 2500 gold for sellswords. For the sake of roleplay, let's say its the hidden war chest your family gathered in secret for the day they make their return. Keep your blood pure as much as possible. Ours is the blood of the dragon and it must remain pristine. You cannot marry into any Targaryen loyalist houses such as Martells and Darrys.</TEXT>

Stormlands to House Trant Riverlands to Lothar Frey (and I am married to a Frey) North to Roose Bolton Reach to House Tarly Dorne to Darkstar Iron Islands to who else? You knew he was coming. Euron Starks were systematically exterminated along with the Tullys. and Joffreys next plans involve conquest of the Stepstones. Who am I going to put in there? probably Harlaws or Drumms.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well if you dont care about dragons, being in the North is always good. My advice is play the characters you like. if they befell horrible fates in the TV Show, try to change it and make them come out on top. im currently in a playthrough where i moved the timer back to a year before Robert's Rebellion. my plan being seat House Stark on the Iron Throne, keep my family alive and other than the war to place me on the throne, create the most blessed timeline one of the most fun playthroughs that arent part of the main ones is House Stark in the Crowned Stag start. its Ned, Benjen, and Baby Robb/Baby Jon. so your first plan should be good marriages and then keeping the Starks all safe. one day maybe you cna put Jon on the Iron Throne. move the timer back a year before the War of Five Kings and try to keep House Forrester safe and alive while also getting your revenge on the Whitehills</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Setup: Select Crowned Stag and load up as Lord Hoster. Give Lothar Frey lordship of Blue Fork and Highlordship of the Trident. Give Lothar a claim on the Kingdom of the Trident, the Twins, Lordship of Riverrun and High Lordship of Riverrun. Then use the console to switch over to Lothar. Roleplay: for your service to Lord Walder and Lord Hoster, you curried favor enough to be made a lord. But this was a terrible mistake on the part of Hoster, for your ambition knows no bounds. You will be king! Goal: Kill the Tullys, take the Trident and see yourself rise higher than any in your family could have dreamed. Nothing less than king will satisfy Lothar. Secondary goals: get a Valyrian sword. Secure House Frey's hold on the Iron Throne with marriages Take, then keep the Twins as the new capital of Westeros. Roleplay as a scheming ruthless master of cloak and dagger who will assassinate and kidnap whoever is necessary to obtain what you want</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Dark Wolf: Revenge of House Stark challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-20 03:21:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>Your name is Rodrick Stark, a custom legitimized bastard, and the only son of the late Benjen Stark. A man of 30, you have lived an exciting secret life in Essos and while there, acquired a great many useful skills. The black sheep of your family, those who know of you take to calling you the Dark Wolf. Yet when you returned to Westeros at last with a chest of gold, and a greatsword clasped at your side, a terrible dread fell over you. News came of the death of your uncles, the ruin of your house, the slaughter of your true home. Winterfell has fallen to the Boltons. However, due to your years in Essos as a sellsword you have acquired great skill in combat and great wealth. They stole from the Dark Wolf but they should have stayed in the shit-stained rocks they call home! Winter is coming for House Bolton! Rules/Setup: You are landed with Breakstone Hill and High Lordship of the North Clans. Give yourself the traits strong, giant, brilliant commander, formidable fighter, honorable, brave, kind, just and wroth. Give yourself a war chest of 1000 gold. Give yourself a strong claim on the Kingdom of the North and Winterfell. You know "Arya" is Jeyne Pool but you dont know Alayne Baelish is Sansa. If Rickon is revealed or Jon says yes to Stannis, you MUST join his war and be absolutely loyal to your family. Bookmark: AFFC Goal: avenge your family and take back the North. You do not steal from the Dark Wolf. Kill Roose Bolton Kill Ramsay Bolton Kill Walder Frey Kill Ilyn Payne Reclaim and reforge Ice Become independent King in the North (if its you who takes it) Bonus Objectives: Spread Old Gods back to the South Seize the Iron Throne for House Stark. These Lannister pretenders are weak and we shall destroy them. If you want a roleplay aspect, let's say your mom was from a bastard branch of Blackfyres. Rebuild the Stark fleet, once lost to us. Give The Manderlys the Reach if you take the throne Take revenge on the Krakens and show them what it means to be a First Man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are Asher Forrester, son of Gregor the Good. Exiled at a young age for loving the wrong woman, you have since grown up in Essos, collecting both skills and gold in your time there. Yet still, you dream of the day you sail home. However news reaches you. Westeros, including your family is at war. Your father marches with Robb Stark, the King in the North. But you are about your business. Through various dealings, you became a lord of your own, with a cadre of loyal men serving you. Use this and the gold you have collected, to bring glory for your family. Setup/Rules: Give yourself a county in Yunkai and 1000 gold to get a sellsword company. Stay Old Gods and Northman as you are a proud man. Give yourself the ambitious trait, and Formidable Fighter. Goals: If Robb wins, become King of Yunkai and forge your own destiny. if Robb loses, sail home and avenge him as well as any losses your family suffers, once you are powerful enough. as King of Yunkai, find a Valyrian sword as you want your brother to keep the Forrester sword. If Dany comes, fight her. Our family fought against her mad father and your grandfather fell on the trident. We do not trust these mad dragons, nor shall we ever! If you become King of Yunkai, return home to Westeros once you feel powerful enough and take it for the glory of House Forrester. These southerners are scum and we shall never kneel to them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you need to start with someone whos ruling a peaceful realm with loyal vassals so you can get used to the game and how it works. My advice is' 1. Ned Stark in Crowned Stag. your vassals love you, you have two heirs in your son and brother, and its a time of peace 2. Hoster Tully in Crowned Stag for the same reason 3. House Stark during the Blackfyre Rebellion. Blacksword is in the middle of a rebellion but its easily crushed and you can side with the Crown, resulting in Daemon easily losing. 4. Tywin can be really easy in Crowned Stag as well. he isnt particularly loved but still has amazing stats and a huge army. you also have tons of options like demanding to be King of the Rock, seizing the throne for yourself or chilling out and being loyal to Robert.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Intro: You are Varys Blackfyre, secret brother of Seara Blackfyre and brother in law of Illyrio. you have cajoled into being granted Duskendale by the king (and regrew your dick). but rather than wait for another boy king, you have decided that since Daeron the Good was a bastard, you are the rightful heir. The Iron Throne is your birthright and although you are a spider, you were born a king! Setup: start as Aerys one year before Robert's Rebellion, and give Varys Duskendale with console commands. Console command away his Eunuch trait (it will work, I tried it), and use house Customizer to name him a member of House Blackfyre. Give Varys a war chest of 700 gold. Give Varys strong claims on the Seven Kingdoms and Dragonstone. Goals: become king, naturally. You are enemies with the red dragons though they don't yet know it. Kill them and seize your birthright. You are allowed to spare Rhaenys and marry her to your son however. Find and hatch a dragon egg. Dragons are a Blackfyre's birthright and you shall claim the world with one. Reward the families loyal to your ancestors Find a Valyrian sword for your house.</TEXT>

I myself can fly out there and burn everybody using myself-conquest. By virtue of me existing, i can tell the entire world to bend the motherflippin knee. - I plan on naming my brothers as Lords of Dragonstone and Driftmark. they might try to conquest me...or maybe forge their own empires</TEXT>

    <TEXT>unfortunately through my testing its impossible to really play as him without removing the "giant" modifier in the console. you can still be tall, formidable fighter and strong like some Gregor Clegane monster. you just can't be a LITERAL giant and be able to marry or continue your house. Once I did though....i selected the option to marry Dany (as this is in Crowned Stag) and Braavos said yes. the bastards i tried to have with Cersei and Maege Mormont look like literal giants but are technically not, and im not registered as their father. couldnt even get an option to legitimize. so you need to get rid of the giant modifier and you're good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your name is Lord Lyman Darry of the Bay of Claws. You have received a raven from both your liege lord and your king, asking you to provide armies after Robert called his banners against King Aerys...but you have decided loyalty means everything to you. You will support Prince Rhaegar and House Targaryen to the very end. House Darry will be your men, my prince...Targaryen men for better or worse. Goals: Be a loyal vassal of the Targaryens as much as is reasonable. Obviously if Aerys goes insane and demands your title for no valid reason, destroy him. To better support your king, you should take the Trident. Give Lyman a claim on the Trident. If Robert wins, take your Darry revenge on the damned usurper by any means necessary. Bonus Objectives: get a Darry on the Iron Throne either as Viserys queen or Dany's king. Get a sword for House Darry. Rules: If Targaryens lose, restore Aegon or Viserys as king. If all targaryens die off, crown yourself King of the Trident</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Honorable Wolf: The Ned Stark Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-27 03:04:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bookmark: Robert's Rebellion Intro: You are Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell. The crimes of House Targaryen cannot go unanswered. Your friend Robert has risen up in Rebellion against the Crown alongside the full power of the Trident and Vale, after the Mad King savagely burned your father and brother. Now you stand as leader of the North in a desperate war against tyranny. You must secure the North's safety, seat Robert on the Iron Throne and save your beloved sister from the Tower of Joy Goals: Save Lyanna. Support Robert as king Support your adopted father Jon Arryn We are playing a game so you should still try to make the North as powerful as possible while still staying loyal to the Crowned Stags. Rules: You must roleplay as Ned Stark and don't do anything you think he would not do. So that means no plotting to murder people or kidnap people. You are a wolf and you will stand and fight like a man. If you have an eldest daughter and Robert has a son, you must wed them together like in the books. If you suspect Robert is having nothing but blonde sons, you are allowed to plot to find out their legitimacy and seat the rightful king on the Iron Throne. If all Baratheons die off, call the banners and seat Lyanna's son on the Iron Throne if one exists. If none exist, crown yourself King in the North if there is a Baratheon Civil War, for example Renly vs Robert's son, you must support the true heir even if they seem completely outnumbered. if you lose and they revoke your titles, i will allow you to reload and force a White Peace. You must act as if you are Ned in the show, meaning you don't know yet not to trust littlefinger, Roose and Walder. If you get tyranny or a stupidly bad trait arbitrarily, i will allow you to console remove it. Fight in trial by combats yourself. Ned would not let anyone do his killing for him. Don't fabricate claims as again that's not something Ned would do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my first game in this mod which was as House Frey. I watched as many people on youtube fucked up and made stupid marriage decisions. so I tried spreading Freys all across Westeros. eventually, i managed to broker a matrineal marriage to Edric and pressed his claim on the Iron Throne, resulting, eventually in Freys inheriting the Iron Throne. Because i threw a bag of gold at his feet i convinced Blackfish to come to my court despite it being after the Red Wedding and got Brienne to marry a Frey. together they were my main commanders of the Frey legions and guards of Lord Frey. i engaged in a massive war against the Riverrun branch of the family but eventually did take it for myself as my seat and eventually, the seat of the Frey King. Through a matrineal marriage of Dany and a frey, they produced a son and daughter. the daughter rode a dragon but i still convinced her to come to my court and i married her to a frey normally. this resulted in a Frey becoming King of Ghiscar, alongside his kinsman the King of Westeros. through the expand conquest ambition, i enveloped my Ghsicar branch of Freys back into the main line, resulting in a united Frey-Baratheon Empire. For most of the game i feared Dany would turn her eye to Westeros but she never did. she even killed Lynesse Hightower in a bit of irony. Freys also rule in every throne of Westeros except Vale and the North. i tried giving Casterly Rock to Emmon Frey's line but they kept on losing it. i havent really played as them again since I dont believe i could do any better than i did then. next favorite playthrough of mine was as Robert at first, a month after the end of Greyjoy Rebellion. Joffrey was a baby and my main goal was to make him into a decent ruler. but not only did i do so, but King Joffrey the Amazing, wed to Dany, became one of the greatest and most noble kings in all of Westeros history, ruling well until his death in his 50s. his son and grandson were decent but not at all as good as Joff or Robert. Robert himself cut off Jaime's dick and sent him to the Wall. He killed some people but sent others to the Wall. Cersei was sent to the Silent Sisters so Robert remarried to Margaery. the true and rightful line of Baratheons continued through the first son of Robert and Margaery (which by all the laws of Westeros would be ahead of his elder brother Edric Baratheon who Robert legitimized early on). they ended up lords of Summerhall. maybe one day ill go back to the save and try to seat the true line back on their throne. Joffrey was beloved by most, and under him the Wall was saved from several wildling invasions and even invaded Braavos. under his grandson Renly, the iron Throne took over Pentos. thats where i left off. Targaryens are dead, bred into the fake Baratheon blonde branch of the family. the true kings are descended from Orys Baratheon, Prince of Westeros whos line ended up at Summerhal and ruled there ever since. IIRC i also got a Valyrian sword from Oldstones. By the end, House Baratheon numbered almost 100 members, and i set about seating them on every throne of Westeros. under King Renly the Conqueror, Joffrey's grandson, this finally happened.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bookmark: AFFC Difficulty: Fairly easy as the North hates the Boltons Intro: Your name is Howland Reed, last surviving member of the band who tried to save Lyanna Stark. Ned, your friend is gone and all that remains of his legacy is burning and in ruins, due to the savagery of the Red Wedding. But you are a Northman and you shall not give in just yet. You must honor him by restoring House Stark to its true throne, no matter the cost. Yet one final secret still weighs heavily upon your mind...the secret of Jon Snow's mother. Goals: Restore your Stark liege lords to the North. If all Starks die off or remain missing for several years, take the North for House Reed instead. increase the power of House Reed. Find your missing children. Rules: Roleplay as an honorable warrior, so no plotting to murder people. You MUST believe Arya is real and wage war for her. If Jon says yes to Stannis or Stannis reveals Rickon, declare him your true liege lord and join in. If Bran comes back you MUST wed him to Meera. Exact justice for the Red Wedding and the murder of your king. If Jon has left the Wall, do all that you can to win him his birthright as King of Westeros.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Mad Lion: Cersei Lannister challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 03:22:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Intro: Your name is Cersei Lannister, only daughter of Tywin Lannister. Your father and son were brutally murdered by that...damn...dwarf, and you have retaken your rightful place as Lady of Casterly Rock. You must protect your baby boy who is king but surrounded by enemies and threats beyond count. You must see house Lannister rise higher than it has ever been and take revenge on all those who wronged you and your children. Goals: Kill Margaery Tyrell, the smirking bitch. Kill Sansa Stark, the murdering harlot. Kill your brother Tyrion. Kill High Sparrow Kill Littlefinger if he reveals Sansa. Kill any Starks that pop back up alive and help the Boltons maintain power. Kill Stannis Baratheon. Kill Lord Commander Jon Snow. half stark, could be a threat. Kill the rest of the Tyrells, smirking schemers that they are. Pah! Secure Tommen's throne and help him reconquer the other kingdoms back into your control. If you feel powerful enough and Tommen and Myrcella die, seize the iron Throne for yourself as in the TV Show. I will allow you to console a claim as that seems like something Cersei would do. Rules: Roleplay as Cersei. be a spiteful, mean piece of work with endless ambition and narcissism. I will allow you to console away widowed so you can remarry as I don't think, roleplay wise, Cersei mourned Robert. You must support Tommen at all costs, even if hes losing and vastly outnumbered. Only if both him and Myrcella die can you start grabbing up land and becoming your own queen. You must not marry into any of the families Cersei wouldn't marry into. You win the challenge if Tommen or Myrcella reign unopposed with House Lannister dominating in peace. Or if you have sat Cersei on the throne unopposed with all her enemies defeated or dead. If Cersei dies and you become Tommen or another child of hers, continue the goal of Lannister dominance but in a roleplay way. so if her son isn't cruel or ruthless, you wouldn't plot to murder people. Bonus objective: convert to Rhllor and get a dragon/dragon egg. I don't think Cersei is particularly zealous for the Faith of the Seven especially after what happened. Console yourself claims on all the other kingdoms and install Lannisters on every throne of Westeros. The Lion shall rule it all.</TEXT>

If he dies and some weak pissant is on the Rock throne, you can betray him if it helps your house. You must not marry into Starks Tullys or Baratheons as they are traitorous usurpers in your eyes.

    <TEXT>i have started before Tyrion's birth. for example i started as Tywin when he turned 16 just before War of Ninepenny kings. and my plan there was to prevent the reyne rebellion. in any case yeah i could make sure no future child of mine has dwarf trait through the magic of console but the series might be so radically different it wouldnt be about that. what you'd need to do is go to the day after Joanna dies and console away dwarf from infant Tyrion. it could be interesting as you could then raise him to be a warrior like his brother without that modifier making him useless at personal combat. its a video game so i dont think you playing as Tywin can really replicate your hate for your son anyways? i mean hes your heir and if you're caught plotting to murder him you get dishonorable kinslayer and it takes foreer to fix that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>just play as who you like and enjoy from the tv show who's not a Lord Paramount. some good examples would be Bronn, lord of Stokeworth. Greatjon Umber Howland Reed House Mormont House Dayne my main guideline would be to manually move the timer to before there's any huge wars going on like WOFK. or choose the Crowned Stag Bookmark. this is because as a minor house you need peacetime and some skullduggery to move forward and become more powerful. unlike when you are a major Lord Paramount and you cna throw your weight around</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As long as you make sure to get Jaime married off the moment he turns 14, he shouldn't be asked to the Kingsguard i don't think. but you could always "add_trait disinherited" to jaime if you really want to play as good ol Tyrion, Lord of Casterly Rock. as for goals, pretty much anything you like. you could even leave Jaime as heir and strike out on your own, landing yourself in Essos and working your way up until you crown yourself King of Meereen.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>okay. then your Blackfyre idea makes a bit more sense. though it would be cool if he had a cadet house and it was called Caesafyre or something. and it would be cool if Valarr formed his own third side in the war. as Sansa's son, maybe Caesarion wants Northern independence while Valarr wants Nymerion's throne as he views himself as more blood of the dragon than his brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Story time: I started as Petyr baelish in the Crowned Stag, and roleplayed that somewhere in his backstory he had a Blackfyre female ancestor and is a secret Blackfyre. so i made it happen with House Customizer. wasn't long before my bitchin stats got me with the chance to kidnap the king after a megawar system allowed me to quickly swear fealty and go directly under Robert. I kidnapped him and bam, King Petyr Blackfyre. i then reasoned he would finally reveal his true ancestry and i consoled him a new nickname "The Black Dragon". Managed to find a dragon egg so I hatched it. it worked and I tamed it. I now ride Darkfyre, the greatest of the current dragons in the world. I converted to Rhllor and eventually got zealous, Chosen by Rhllor and Lightbringer. My eldest and greatest daughter, Crown Princess Visenya Blackfyre the Axe of Hayford, heir to the Dragon Sea Empire, was wed to Viserys while I married Dany. Visenya Blackfyre however is my first bastard by Lysa Tully before me and Dany got married. so she doesn't care and is completely in love with me. Viserys died of poor health after many years of conquests in Essos and fighting in my armies. though most of the time its myself and my dragon riding children. ive got three sons, and the greatest of which, Caesarion, is a genius and is shaping up to be the greatest Blackfyre since his father, greater even than the Crown Princess Visenya. she has two sons of her own, Rhaegar and Aurion. though i want to cheat so that Caesarion inherits. let me know of a good fast way to do that thats not going through everybody ahead of him and add_trait disinheriting. Petyr the Black Dragon is pretty much the greatest dragon rider since the Conqueror, as one would expect if you added a friggin dragon onto his already impressive resume. I got myself up to being a pretty great fighter so i fight in most/all trial by combats personally. theres really not much anyone can do against a Lightbringer swinging Chosen by Rhllor Emperor Petyr. After Viserys death, i tried marrying Visenya to a Connington (who hold the Stormlands) but she refused and i couldnt make her. damn it woman! I am the Emperor! So....i fucked her myself in true Blackfyre fashion. I do try to marry my children to Valeryons or high valyrians but avoid close kin incest. Caesarion, my intended heir is betrothed to Shireen. almost all of the original families still hold their spots with the exception of the Westerlands and Stormlands. I am about to kill off the main branch of House Baratheon and the main branch of Lannisters entirely died off, besides Jaime whos still in the Kingsguard so Cleos Frey is LP of the West. There was a long stretch in which Freys were LPs of the Trident but Edmure fought and got it back. Robert and Cersei never had a kid. Robert just withered away stuck in his sole county. Barristan is somehow still alive and still LC of the Kingsguard. the rest of my Kingsguard are Blackfish, Jaime, Lyn Corbray, Ser Robert Jast, Andrik the Unsmiling and Drogo "The Hammer of Rosby." yes that Drogo. Got to Dany first, didnt i? When Victarion was alive he was also a member of my KG. its pretty much the greatest set since Aerys. Through some brief cheating, i got a claim on the King Beyond the Wall so now the wildlings fight under the dragon banner in addition to the Basilisk Isles and Stepstones. I gave Stepstones to Harlaws. What I have declared right now is basically the final all out war to take the world, starting with forming New Valyria. I formed the Summer Sea pretty much so i could be an Emperor of the Dragon Sea instead of king. rest assured i plan to take New Valyria and colonize North Valyria.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am the King: Stannis Baratheon challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-01 05:37:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Intro/Setup: Move the timer back to literally one day after King Robert's death. Then select Stannis. You have just learned of your brother's death and the truth about his "sons" which means the throne now passes to you. Claim your birthright or die in the attempt. Any traitors in your way, you will punish them. Unite Westeros against the true threat that now approaches. Goals: become king. Even harder now than in the regular bookmarks as you start off with hardly any men and no allies of any sort, and the royal armies haven't marched off to war against the Northerners yet. Once you claim your kingship, heads, spikes, walls. Kill Petyr Baelish Kill Cersei Kill Joffrey Kill Tywin for supporting the false king. Kill any other pretenders with prejudice. Added goals/optional challenges: Stay with Rhllor and start converting Westeros to the true god name davos Hand Defeat the White Walkers and save the world Ensure you have a strong heir as in my testing Stannis tends to die pretty early on. I will allow you to reload from your last save if he dies prematurely. You need not continue on as Shireen. You must not kidnap or assassinate unless given no other choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>the two most important things you need to do is first, be a virtuous good king who nobody would want to overthrow in the first place (think Daeron the good or Aegon the Conqueror), and second, keep giving out gifts and honorary titles. usually if you're virtuous enough, that in itself is enough but if you're middling or cruel, titles and gifts help. if they rebel and you win, replace the vassals with people of your faith and culture. i tend to go usefulness over faith and culture though, if i have a dragon as i am supremely confident my dragon is enough against any foe. plus the "loyalist" modifier is always great to have. medium realm authority is needed to stop inter vassal wars like that, but i tend to stop almost all vassal wars anyway on principle. my only exceptions being de jure wars as if its de jure it shoud probably be theirs anyways, and rescue prisoner wars.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Mockingbird's Master Plan: the Petyr Baelish challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-06 04:07:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Start: Crowned Stag. Intro: Your name is Petyr Baelish. You suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of a thug named Brandon Stark for your beloved Cat's hand in marriage, but when he got himself killed, she was married off to his even more impressive little brother. You swore that day to take your revenge on a nobility and kingdom that spat on you and if you could not do it by the sword, you would do it with cunning. Rise high in Westeros and eventually take it over for House Baelish..or crash it with no survivors! Objectives: Marry Cat, the woman you love. Rule Westeros as its king or Lord Magister and Catelyn as your queen. Exact your revenge on House Stark. Obliterate them to nothing. Bonus objectives: Crash the realm with no survivors by plotting to convince a few Lord Paramounts to rebel against their king. Create as much chaos as possible for your ascension. Rules: If Catelyn dies, marry either her daughter by Ned if one exists, or Daenerys. If you fail to become king or Lord Magister, at least end your campaign being the puppet master running the kingdom in truth by being either Regent, Hand or both. Due to your high stewardship, console yourself a starting war chest of 600 gold. Added challenge if its too easy: Convert to Rhllor and still try to beat my scenario.</TEXT>

Take your revenge on the Boltons for your brother's murder and the Freys for your father's murder.

    <DATE>2020-08-06 07:14:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Setup: Start as Robb Stark during the Clash of Kings Bookmark. Intro: Your name is Robb Stark. Your bannermen have just crowned you their king after the murder of your father. You are just figuring out how to proceed when a strange priest comes to your door, promising fire powers to avenge your father, destroy your enemies and in return, spread the word of the one true god. Spurred on by this, you vow to seize the Iron Throne for the one true god. Before you unpause, console command Robb to become Rhllor. Console command Robb to have a new nickname, something to do with his new faith. Console Command Robb to have the "ambitious" trait and choose the option "i claim the throne by right of conquest" should you defeat Joffrey's armies. Goals: Take the Iron Throne Kill Joffrey Kill Ilyn Payne Kill Cersei Kill Littlefinger. Using your red god powers, you discovered his role in Ned's death. Try your best to marry Daenerys, which will make it easier to tame a dragon according to my testing. Optional goals: Seduce and bed Roslin, Jeyne and Talisa. Heal Bran's legs using your Rhllor powers. Keep Winterfell as the capital of the Seven Kingdoms. If you decide not to, ensure Starks still rule there, such as one of your brothers. Using your word as king of Westeros, get Jon out of the Nigh's Watch and give him some land to rule over. Colonize Summerhall and become dragon riding Red Wolves. Once you do, form New Valyria, ruled from Winterfell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Bookmark: Feast for Crows Intro: Your name is Edric Storm, eldest son of the late King Robert. Your father acknowledged you and paid you heed, which means in your mind, you are his heir more than your uncle ever was. The Iron Throne is thus your birthright and you shall claim it. You shall exact revenge on all the families that ever spat upon House Baratheon. But first...you must deal with your uncle. Setup: Stannis has seen fit to land Edric as High Lord of Storm's End. You will gain a bastard house but when you become Empire Tier, you can legit yourself as a full Baratheon anyways so don't worry too much. Make sure you have strong claims on Dragonstone, Stormlands, Kings Landing and the Seven kingdoms. Give yourself a warchest of 1500 gold. use this money on sellswords if its prudent Ensure Edric has Strong, Attractive, Gregarious, Proud and Brave. Goals: Exact revenge on everyone who wronged your father. Kill Cersei Lannister Kill Lancel Lannister Kil Tommen and Myrcella, your falseborn supposed "siblings". Kill Littlefinger (let's suppose Edric knows what he did) Kill the Targaryens wherever they may be as they are the only ones who can truly challenge your throne. Deal with your uncle and cousin however you wish, but ensure you take their lands for your own to use in the true war. Take back the Stormlands and the Iron Throne for your own. It's clear to you your father wanted you to rule. Bring the rebellious King Euron back under heel. Locate your siblings Mya Stone and Gendry Waters. Give them sizeable land to serve the realm. Optional Goal: Become Storm King instead and rule as your own king</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Intro: You are Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers. Your mother was a Blackwood but your father was blood of the dragon! Your king and half brother Daeron The Good has seen fit to make you a lord as well as your father declaring you no longer a bastard, but a true and rightful son of the dragon. Your half brothers Daemon Blackfyre and Aegor Bittersteel conspire against the throne. But your eldest brother Daeron knows not how to stop them in the right way, as during a strange vision, you saw how his rule would eventually lead to the ruin of the Targaryens. You decide that for the good of the realm, Brynden Bloodraven shall wear the crown. You will be king! Setup: Go to Blackfyre Rebellion and give Bloodraven High Lordship of Harrenhal as well as the castle itself. Grant him a claim on the Trident. Goals: Honor the gods of your ancestors of House Blackwood and remain faithful to them. You care not for the Seven! Become King of Westeros. Kill Aegor Bittersteel. That punk has seen his last sunrise and we must do what is best for our kingdom. Seduce or marry your lovely Shiera Seastar. Find and hatch a dragon egg. The Blood of Old Valyria flows within you, making dragons your birthright. Keep Harrenhal as your seat. Take out House Bracken and House Tully, and raise up House Blackwood as your Lords Paramount of the Trident. Optional Goals: Forgo the throne and instead rule as your own King of the Trident.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Eldest Child of the Stag: The Mya Stone Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 03:16:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bookmark: Clash of Kings Setup: Find Mya Stone and land her as High Lady of the Fingers in the Vale. You will get a random bastard name but you can legitimize yourself as Baratheon once you are Empire Tier. I have tested it. Give yourself a war chest of 1500 gold and a claim on the Vale. intro: Your name is Mya Stone, eldest child and only real daughter of your late father King Robert. You received word that your father has died, but before he did, he issued a last royal decree landing you as a High Lady, perhaps spurred on by one last burst of fatherly love. Father....I will avenge you, Mya swore that day. As Westeros marched off to war, including her uncle and cousin, Mya decides that she has the best claim to the throne due to being the eldest acknowledged child of the king. A few ambitious lords agree, and pledge funds with which she would mean to hire sellswords to take her true throne. Take your true throne, ensure you destroy your falseborn "siblings" and restore House Baratheon to glory Goals: Take the throne as queen. Defeat Joffrey Tommen and Myrcella and reveal them as bastards. Deal with your uncle Stannis, possibly by sending him to the Wall. Keep the Eyrie as the capital of the Seven Kingdoms as Mya identifies more with the Vale than the rat's nest of King's Landing. Give the Stormlands to your brother Edric. Kill Cersei Lannister and Lancel Lannister in revenge for your father.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Setup: go back three years from Clash of Kings Bookmark. Play as Robert and use console to land Viserys as King of Pentos. Bring Dany there too. Give yourself 40 000 event spawn troops and 2000 gold to symbolize both Dothraki armies and Pentos financial support. Intro: Your name is Viserys Targaryen. Illyrio, pledging his full support has given you his armies and crowned you King of Pentos. But being king of one region will not satisfy you. The Usurper and his dogs await. The Iron Throne is your birthright and you shall claim it. Goals: Take back your father's throne from the Usurper and his dogs. Kill Robert Baratheon Kill Ned Stark Kill Jon Arryn Kill Hoster Tully Kill Jaime Lannister Kill Tywin Lannister Tame a dragon. Dragons are your birthright. If it takes too long to obtain an egg, activate Dany's dragon egg event, thus making you Father of Dragons. Wed Arianne and use console if you have to, to force Dorne to join your invasion when you make your move, if they are bitches and refuse to ally. Then you and your lovely queen will set about making sure the Westerosi are populated with dragon loyalists. Optional Goals: for added challenge, make Viserys Rh'llor and start converting Westeros. Go completely fire-mad like your father.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>your other plan, and i have done this, is to pull back North and beat Balon first, or white peace him. then, move south and hold your Riverland holdings until the clock runs out or Stannis takes over the throne. he will have a lot less men and support than joff will. always marry off Bran and Rickon and call your alliances in. i usually go with Vale houses like Strongsong and Royces. you could also just ignore the bookmark altogether and start as Robb one day after Ned's death. Benefits: more time to plan your war for independence. better marriage options for you and your siblings. Ironborn (probably) wont ever attack you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>well the most fun ive had as a more minor lord was House Frey. i was determined to see them as kings so i didnt quit the campaign until i was king. advantages are you have a shit ton of family members for alliances and thus alot of dowry money. somehow i was able to get Brienne and Blackfish to my court so they were my main generals leading the Frey army, and even a dragon rider since i married a Frey boy matrineally to Dany. probably one of the biggest challenges in the whole game is Baelish during Crowned Stag as you start out with great stats but a single shitty keep in the Fingers. becoming a powerful lord from there is hard but rewarding and satisfying</TEXT>

For 300 years your family has been living in exile in Essos after Orys Baratheon took power. You bided your time, collecting riches until you felt the time was right to finally invade Westeros again. Through a palace coup, you and a band of sellswords have stormed into Storm's End and seized it for yourself, from the Estermont castellan that Stannis had left there. Using this as your launching pad, you shall first reclaim your homeland, and then don your birthright, the Durrandon family's ancient crown as Storm King. Setup: Custom Durrandon landed with the High Lordship of Shipbreaker Bay. Ensure he has Formidable Fighter, Brave, Wroth, Brilliant Commander, Authoritative and Strong. Give him a strong claim on the Stormlands and Dorne. Console command him to have 1500 Gold. you will use this to buy sellswords. Upon your victory in the independence war, use console to transfer the Storm Crown to you. Goals: First kill Stannis and Shireen, and take over the Stormlands. Then declare an independence war if you feel ready, reclaiming the Storm Crown. Secondary goals: The Durrandons have always rivalled the Martells and battled one another over the Dornish Marches. Take your revenge and conquer the Dornish as your family always dreamed. Because of that bastard of the Targaryens your family lost its seat. Destroy any remaining Targaryens. Place a Durrandon on the Iron Throne. Do not marry into the Martells, Reach, or Targaryens. seek common cause with the Starks or Greyjoys.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The Faceless Wolf: Arya Stark's Revenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-24 11:43:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>Setup: play as Illyrio in AFFC, teleport real Arya to your court (you'll know her when you see her) and land her as Queen of Braavos. Roleplay wise, let's say she's wearing the Sealord's face or something. Once you switch to her, the event revealing her as a Stark should fire. Then give Arya Formidable Fighter, Duelist, Elusive Shadow, Deceitful and Valyrian Dagger. Give Arya strong claims on the North and Trident. if you don't want to sit through a regency, age Arya to 16. Intro: You are Arya Stark. Using your newfound Faceless skills and ruthlessness, you have seized control over Braavos by taking the face of the Sealord and crowned yourself King. You have begun your revenge by eliminating some Lannister soldiers accompying an envoy to the Iron Bank. But your true destiny awaits. Using your new armies, you will sail back to Westeros and destroy all who have wronged House Stark. Leave one wolf alive...and the sheep are never safe. Goals: Kill Walder Frey, Lothar Frey and Black Walder. Kill Roose and Ramsay Bolton Kill Cersei Lannister Kill Ser Meryn Kill Illyn Payne Kill Robert Strong Kill Jaime Keep a very watchful eye on Lord Baelish and if he does anything at all to you, kill him too. Destroy the power of the Lannisters once and for all, and restore either yourself or one of your siblings to the throne of the North and Trident. Locate your siblings and keep them safe. Optional Goal: The lions have proven themselves unworthy. Seize the iron Throne for yourself and rule all of Westeros the right way.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sunset Wolves: House Stark Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-25 03:13:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>Setup: Custom Stark named Rickard. give him Sea Dragon Point and event spawn 40 000 men. Also give him 500 gold. Give him the Cadet house name of Sunstark. Ensure that Rickard Sunstark has Formidable Fighter, Skilled Commander, Brave and Wroth due to his many years at sea fighting dangerous pirates. Also Green Dreams. Lore: Thousands of years ago, King Brandon the Shipwright took the Stark fleet across the Sunset Sea and didn't return. What nobody knew is that they stumbled upon the eastern edge of a set of large islands and settled them. King Brandon had confidence his son would manage the North in his absence and died before he could tell his son he had made landfall. Or so the story went. Many theorize that the messenger ship sank at sea. Thousands of years passed and the SunStarks had long since formed a Kingdom of Summer in their new home. But Rickard, the newest King of Summer began to feel uneasy. He had a dream that the Winter branch of his family had disaster befall them and they needed help. So he called his banners and fleet, and made ready to come home at last. But once he landed....dread fell over Rickard. News reached him of the Bolton takeover, King Robb's death and the Red Wedding. He steeled himself. With his armies and fleet, he would take revenge for his distant cousins once and for all. Summer had come for House Bolton. Goals: Destroy Roose Bolton and crush his power. Seat either yourself or one of your winter cousins in Winterfell. March south and destroy the Lannisters and their power in revenge for the Red Weddng. Kill Walder Frey Kill Ramsay Bolton Marry into your cousins if you can, by locating Real Arya or Sansa. This will solidify the North. optional Goal: Place a Stark or Sunstark on the Iron Throne, ensuring that the North will be safe.</TEXT>

The Usurper holds the throne. News has reached you of the defeat of the Dornish armies, the death of your king, the death of Prince Rhaegar, and even the death of your brother Arthur, and sister Ashara. Holding her body, you swore this would not go unanswered. No, for Starfall, for House Dayne, you shall have your justice. Choices: You care not for these northern fools. Take over Dorne and crown yourself independent, ruling from Starfall. or Support the Black Dragon. Ensure House Blackfyre survives and rises to rule. The Red Dragons are gone but a dragon is still a dragon whether they are black or red. or Support the Red Dragon. Find Viserys and Dany and seat them on the Iron Throne. perhaps you can convince them to let you have your independence.... Rules: you may not marry into any of the Usurper supporter families. You must want to kill Ned Stark and Howland Reed as you heard all about how they slew your brother. If you choose to back the Targaryens, support them no matter what. Join all their invasions. If you choose to back a Valyrian, if Aegon VI resurfaces, join his war for the throne.</TEXT>

I hope i can keep the North title but its gonna get interesting when Dany dies and my son gets Empire of Ghiscar.</TEXT>

Rumors persistt Daeron the Good was a bastard which means the throne is yours by right. You shall claim it...by any means necessary. goals: Create chaos and clear your path to the throne. Find and tame a dragon/dragon egg. it is your birthright. Marry either Cat or one of Cat's daughters. if theyre not available or look impossible, marry Dany. bonus options: raise your flag as an independent King of Mountain and Vale or rule the realm in all but name by becoming regent and Hand for your son by Dany/Catelyn.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What is your favorite custom start date?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-13 05:32:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not one of the bookmarks. but a date you get by moving the timer around. personally i enjoy playing on the day right before the deaths of Rickard Stark and Brandon Stark. in of themselves they are pretty interesting and badass but it also means everyone we know is now alive (with the possible exception i guess, of Aerys father). This is also kind of similar to the bookmark the False Spring, but it gives me alot of freedom to basically plan and strategize how i like, rather than the Rebellion forcing me to, say, have to locate and fight for Lyanna. if you're Robert on this date, you can simply marry her yourself, declare war and be king no problem. First time i tried this, literally every kingdom but Dorne jumped in for me. Also i like three years before Clash of Kings. Again everyone's alive and you get Benjen! (though you need to cheat to remove him from the Wall).its right before shit hits the fan so if your plan is to reveal the bastards and seat Stannis as heir, you have time to do that. if your plan is as Tywin, getting rid of Robert and supporting Joff as king with little else in your way, you can. and its great too for Balon Greyjoy as you can essentially play him as smart balon, waiting and biding your time until you're legitimately powerful enough to strike</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You are Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper. A legendary warrior, you were never supposed to rule. But now that you do, now it falls to you to do what is best for Dorne. Take revenge for your sister, destroy the enemies of Dorne and show Westeros the pleasures as well as fury of the Dornish people. Bookmark: A Clash of Kings Setup: Normally impossible to play but with cheats, we can do it. On your startup screen, you will be Doran. Abdicate or kill him, and "add_trait disinherited" the three children of Doran. Then you should become Oberyn, Lord of Sunspear. Goals: duel or assassinate Ser Gregor and Amory Lorch. Then find a way to get rid of Tywin too. Crown yourself independent Prince of Dorne once your revenge is done. Secondary Goals: Seduce the waa-men. Have as many bastards as you can. Help Aegon if he invades, due to him being your sister's alleged son. Get a special blade or dagger for House Martell Find good marriages for your daughters and continue the line of House Martell. DLCs: None especially required but Conclave is useful for our plans, and Way of Life allows dueling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>when you unrestrict disinheritance, you can disinherit your children for any reason you want...as long as they haven't been betrothed or married yet. but if they have, all you have to do is add_trait disinherited . as for sending someone to the Wall, add_trait nightswatch and kick em out of your court. its all about adding traits lol. and it will work. ive used it myself. in my latest playthrough, my youngest son was a genius who was Hand, Captain of the Household Guard and defender of my empire. but he was youngest so..i needed to add_trait disinherited all his older brothers and my grandsons. was a bit of a pain but it works. to make Meera inherit the Neck, either add_trait disinherited (jojen's char ID), murder Jojen or unrestrict disinheritance which means you can instantly send him to the wall for no reason, though theres a chance he will be pissed off about it. if you can only disinherit under certain circumstances, its limited to an event where your son has to ask you to go to the Wall. and quite funnily enough, it will come up with a messgae of you potentially saying "ridiculous, you're heir to the throne" if your a king. and if it wont pop up, you need to wait for Jojen to elope with a random woman and you can say "for this you are disinherited". if you really really have to, you can just kill (jojen's ID)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no. not unless you set it to unrestricted. the game doesn't want you, i guess, to just send all your sons to the Wall except your youngest genius one. otherwise you need to wait until Sam asks you to go, or if he elopes with a random girl, violating the marriage pact you already set up. the requirement for the event for the son to ask to go to the Wall is he needs to be unmarried, and relatively content/humble. though in my games it has usually been pretty random. there is another way, i think and that's to get just cause to send him to the Wall by him being a traitor. but he will only be a traitor if you land him, plot to incite to revolt, he revolts and you win.</TEXT>

I have long since lost interest in my Blackfyre playthrough but again i usually set goals for myself and stop when i achieve them. also i tend to lose all interest in my campaigns when all the characters i know and love age out and die. when my kingsguard is randos ive never even heard of, then yeah...because the randos are never as good. ill never see another Tywin or Varys unless its one of my sons i trained myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i found it much easier and streamlined. so if thats your thing then do it. basically what happens is there's no big split ups, your lords can't become temporarily independent and choose not to fight for you, and there's no Du jure Wars. your levies are always what they say they are, 200 000 men if you're King of the Iron Throne, and for any conquest wars, they all must fight for you if you raise them. a neat trick you can do is find a LP you don't like, declare a war on an Essosi nation, and use only his levies to fight them. theyll bleed away and then when you plan to fabricate this lord's treason, you can defeat him easily as all his men are gone but yours are fine. the other advantage is every time your LPs split off in a big civil war, they lose their council positions and get all mad about it. no megawar, this wont happen. youll always have access to them. this is important because it means if you have a really badass commander LP he can legit lead your armies, and not split off to lead his own. for example, Tywin or Ned if you're King Robert.</TEXT>

Play to the Redwyne's strengths. their money, men and sea power.

    <TITLE>Run from Us: House Deathfyre Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-22 07:07:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>this is my completely original custom house and character. Bookmark Start: AFFC Intro/History 400 years ago, several Valyrian houses fled what they knew to be the Freehold's Doom. House Deathfyre came before anyone else, landed in what is now the Crownlands, and founded a keep there. Following them was House Celtigar, Valeryon and Targaryen...but the Deathfyres were angry for they had claimed this land first, yet the others believed it theirs and claimed their laurels. House Deathfyre swore revenge. A Westeros spanning empire was their birthright, dragons their birthright. But as centuries went by, Westeros forgot, focused more on the Targaryens. So....bitter and ambitious, the Deathfyres kept to themselves. When Aegon came with his dragons, Rodryre Deathfyre bent the knee begrudgingly. From that day forward, Deathfyres only supported the king when they knew he would win, guarding their family secrets for the right time to finally strike. But when they did get involved, it was with deadly precision and poisons, earning their words "Run from Us". If you fought a Deathfyre you better hope you died quickly. Their penchant for mixing intrigue with brutal combat became fairly widely feared and even the admirals of House Valeryon wanted Deathfyre knights on their flagship, despite both houses' ancient rivalry. Centuries passed. Magnus Deathfyre was born not long after Robert's Rebellion. His eldest and most loved brother, Daemon, was slain on the Walls during the Siege of Pyke in the Greyjoy Rebellion. His other two brothers died at the hands of House Umber in the War of the Five Kings. Magnus recieved word of this from a terrified courtier for he was certainly a wroth man. When he learned of the ruin of his brothers, his own ascension as lord of the family, it was said to be a very dark night. His armor was emblazoned with blue and black, the colors of his house. He gripped his family's greatsword (returned to him by his brother's knights) Fyrewind and set off to war. Once he entered the service of Lord Tywin, he quickly gained fame as a quick and deadly version of Ser Gregor Clgane. Strong and tall, yet ruthless and cunning. Fyrewind cut swaths through the ranks of the Northman infantry, until finally...he came upon a soldier emblazoned with the Umber sigil. Screaming in fury, he threw himself forward. On that day, that furious duel shook the entire battlefield. Two true warriors dueled in a bloody showdown to the death. Greatjon escaped, but only due to the timely arrival of Robb's cavalry. Magnus' duel against Greatjon Umber earned him the nickname "Hammer of the Gods", for it was said he embodied the Warrior himself that day, and the duel was called The Hammer vs the Giant. Magnus continued his service to the Lannisters yet it was with a certain bitter cynical edge. He threw himself into battle after battle, almost hoping this latest one would be his last. Perhaps, if he ever met the Greatjon again, it would be. Setup: House Deathfyre's main colors are black and blue so take this into account. The sigil as I envision it is a hand holding a scythe. Magnus is a massive man of 18 years old, with long hair and Westerosi Valyrian ethnicity. Give him Faith of the Seven but he's not particularly zealous for it. He is a mix of martial and intrigue. Give him Knight, Hunter, Ruthless, Deceitful, Cynical, Strong, Giant, Formidable Fighter, Skilled Commander, Rude, Brave and Wroth. Give him a war chest of 500 Gold. Give him a claim on Driftmark Give him a claim on Harrenhal as his mother was a Whent Land him by giving him Lordship of Bywater and rename it Deathfyre Keep. Goals: Tame a dragon Kill Greatjon Umber to get revenge for your brothers Kill the Greyjoys. Oust the Targaryens in order to claim what you feel is your birthright, Westeros, and in time, perhaps New Valyria. (Rule: You don't need to have the Iron Throne. You can have for example, the Trident and conquer the other kingdoms with that as your primary title) Bonus Objectives: Take your revenge on Valeryons, Celtigars and Targaryens, leaving them landless. Rebuild your house by having alot of children. Obtain conversion to the old Valyrian gods your ancestors worshipped Name your firstborn son Daemon to honor your eldest brother You fight for the Crown in WOFK and stayed out of Robert's Rebellion before joining Robert at the very end. keep this in mind when choosing a wife</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in terms of roleplay, this game almost forces you to at least be somewhat underhanded or dastardly. so strict roleplay as a Stark would be challenging but fun. especially if you are a custom Stark with a single county. Or play as House Forrester. That way if you still climb the ladder to become king, it feels earned. not because you kidnapped some fools and bought off others. if only in the pure interest of survival and not getting overthrown, i tend to play all my characters as honorable as possible, and only attempt evil shit if im sure i can get away with it and my spymaster's completely onboard. Another fun one would be Robert Baratheon pre rebellion (roll back to one year before the Rebellion bookmark). you can still get Lyanna but play as if you're not expecting to ever be the king, just drink and hunt with your buddy Ned and sex up your wife Lyanna.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Robb couldn't have declared war on Joff as Joffrey has hostages. Defiance of Duskendale would have resulted in a Darklyn faction and instantly enforcing his faction. He could execute Aerys but the new King Rhaegar would be pissed off. Robert's Rebellion wouldnt have made Robert king. theyd be deposing boy King Viserys for Dany by the end of it. or to be regent for King Viserys. im sure later on that Robert would have been able ot press his claim though. Littlefinger cant be Master of Coin. ever. as his lands dont answer directly to the king. my guess is itd be shunted off to some Crownlander lord or other, or Mace Tyrell. Robb wouldnt have had to bargain with Freys to get through. he'd just march straight past him as Freys should be under Hoster.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my reasoning was that it wasn't actually Robert's war at first. Jon Arryn refused to hand over his wards to be executed so he declared a war to depose Aerys. i doubt he went into it expecting to be crowning Robert the new king.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well I started as Robb and chose to console myself ambitious so i could seize the Iron Throne by right of conquest. Softened Dany up until she agreed to marry me and she gave me a dragon. Got red Priest event and eventually leveled up to Chosen by Rhllor and tamed my dragon. using this, i conquered summer Isles and formed Empire of the Summer Sea. Robb died though so i became his daughter by Dany, Queen Caesaria. Caesaria is pretty badass, living up to her dad. Skilled fighter, skilled commander, just, tamed her father's dragon. Aegon's invasion failed but he ended up the king anyway by marrying Caesaria.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-05 03:37:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Setup: fairly simple. Go to one day after the death of Rickard and Brandon Stark, your brother, and press "die" in the console. You will go from Ned to Benjen. Intro: Your name is Benjen Stark of Winterfell, last surviving son of Rickard Stark. After the news that both your brothers have been savagely killed by the Mad King, you rise as Lord of Winterfell...and plot your revenge against the Targaryens. At your side is your sister, Lyanna, returned to you by Rhaegar after what happened to her brothers. House Targaryen has inflicted a great insult and the kings of Winter do not forgive...or forget. We shall drive Ice through their necks once and for all. Goals: Rebuild House Stark as it is on the brink of collapse. find a good marriage for Lyanna. Raise your banners and become King in Da Norf, donning the ancient crown of your ancestors. Destroy the Mad King and take justice for your father and brothers. Rules: you may not marry into the houses that historically declared for Targs, such as Tyrells and Martells. You may not support a Targaryen for the throne, not even Rhaenys.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>it will if you have allowed dragons to be on in the game rules before you started. if you have, and you start before Clash of Kings, the two ways you can get a dragon egg is finding one in a colonized Summerhall, or, and this is much rarer but it has happened for me, finding an ancient dragon egg in the crypt of Winterfell. if you're already high Valyrian, it should be trivial to hatch it, but just in case, you will want to visit the areas of dragonlore and convert to the Valyrian religion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Hammer of the Red Stag: the Rhllor Robert Baratheon Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-06 06:00:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Setup: Load up as Robert during the Rebellion bookmark and fire the red priest event that enables him to turn into a Rhllor worshipper. Click "embrace the true faith". Lore: Robert has been forced to call his banners against the Mad King. He fears he may lose when a strange Red Priest named Thoros of Myr appears at his court. Thoros promises Robert great powers if he seizes the Iron Throne and brings the true faith to Westeros. Robert, not really thinking about anything except power to destroy Rhaegar and his ilk, agrees. Basically what if Thoros successfully converted Robert. Goals: Bring the true faith to your kingdom and begin converting through healing and proselytizing. Hammer the Targaryens, driving them off the shores of Westeros at last to the blasted wastes from whence they came, and kill Prince Rhaegar Save your lovely Lyanna and make her your queen. Find and tame a dragon. Your grandmother was blood of the dragon, which means dragons are your birthright. The dragonspawn squandered their chance and got all their dragons killed. The Stag won't make such a mistake. Rules: even if you're neck deep in rebellion, you may not convert back to the Seven. If Lyanna dies you must marry Cersei.</TEXT>

I walked up my armies to Winterfell and fairly easly crushed him and slew him and Bran. Yes i married Edmure to his own niece lol. sue me. but there was literally no other good options that i could see for him. Rickon dies not long after that (i was going to take the North eventually but not so quickly. and i married real Arya to Blackfish who had one son together). so Sansa became queen in the North married to my son. I died and became Edmure not long after my successful invasion of the iron Isles. Our son together will rule the Kingdom of Rivers, Snow and Isles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was playing as pretty much the shittiest start you can imagine. a single county as a pretty average lord wih bad stats (though good traits i guess. he's no craven cruel torturer or anything). Initially i married Allyria Dayne but she cheated on me so i divorced her. Somehow the war in Meereen went SO badly that Dany was left landless and enabled her to agree to go back to Westeros to be my wife. to be fair that might be because i turned off dragons.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Overthrow the Monarchy seems to work best for me. during the Defiance of Duskendale you start with the king already in your dungeon. so simply demand aboliton of the monarchy. you will instantly be in charge. now all you need to do is be well liked and rule for 15 years. As House Payne, I was able to meteorically rise to the heights of power from a single county, using the "overthrow the monarchy" faction and kidnapping, to the ruler of Westeros. I have also been able to conquer the Iron Throne witthout a claim by first being my own independent king, then using the once a lifetime invasion casus beli to invade the rest of the Iron throne.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I began by being a lowly single county Lord Taubert Payne. I died, and became Martyn who married Dany because through a stroke of luck and me turning off the dragons, she became a landless courtier in Claw Isle, apparently getting demolished in Meereen by the slavers. we have a son and daughter together. though she cheated on me twice with a Summer Islander. I initially planned to somehow get my wife on the Iron Throne but i needed to rise up the ranks. i couldn't get any good marriages but Taubert did marry Allyria Dayne. so i decided to overthrow the monarchy of the Gold Road. fortunately, the lady of the Gold Road was apparently hated enough that i got her spymaster on my side to kidnap her. and i instantly won once she was in my dungeon. now I'm a High Lord. because i was under Cersei and she died i answered directly to King Tommen so i petitioned him for the Westerlands and he happily gave it to me. at this point i was like "omfg. how much more lucky could i possibly be?" So I betrayed the king who gave me all this power and kidnapped him, while planning to overthrow the monarchy again (and I gave my ancestral homeland to my uncle Ilyn Payne). and as you can see, that worked too. In fact Tommen just up and handed it to me, without even saying "no, buddy. i wont give in". now I just need to rule for 15 years alongside my lovely wife Dany and I can crown myself King Martyn Payne. This playthrough really did show me the power of intrigue. one after another, i was able to successfully kidnap or kill everyone in my way. All except Dany's summer islander lover as he's too far away and people like him too much. Tommen after the overthrow ended up being murdered in his dungeon cell as he just hated me too much and was a threat to my reign. I sent my firstborn son to the Wall to ensure that my son by Dany, Prince Daeron, will take the crown. Podrick turned out fairly alright, and married Cersei's secondborn daughter i think. i will give him some land in the Crownlands if i can get some. TDLR: House Payne rose from a lowly count with 1000 men to the ruler of Westeros in a little under 10 years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>its a faction you can make if you've got the Republic DLC which allows you to play as Meereen, Braavos, Volantis etc. If it works, youre basically the king but it becomes elective meaning if you have a shit son, he won't take over. You need to rule 15 years and have everyone adore you to change it back to a monarchy. but its worth it if you want to quickly have your family rise through the ranks and become really strong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be fair i can imagine a observer playthrough with a future Dream of Spring bookmark being just as chaotic. we don't know how it will end but my guess is that a ton of Westeros is burning and most families decimated. if the war vs the dead was disappointingly weak in the show, im expecting Dream of Spring having most of the main cast die saving the world, leaving a burned husk behind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>my advice is pretty simple. play as some of your favorites from the books and help them succeed and become king/queen. my favorite so far was turning Littlefinger into a secret Blackfyre and trying to become King of Westeros starting from Crowned Stag. My second favorite playthrough was as House Frey. massive family means a ton of alliances you can make. i engaged in a huge war against the Riverrun branch of the family before winning and making it my capital, which it stayed foe the rest of the time. i was able to put Edric Storm in as king with his Frey wife, thus taking the Iron throne. due to a marriage to Dany's daughter, i also had Freys as Kings of Ghiscar.</TEXT>

It's hilariously cruel to marry Dany to her own father's killer but i suppose you're giving her Daddy's throne so she gotta feel a bit better about this. How did he leave the KG? was it the Tywin event where as Hand, he can dismiss Jaime? Or did he get kicked out in a rebellion?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i turned off megawars. This means nobody becomes randomly independent every time you declare war. you always have access to all your levies and ships. so once you just get a foothold in say, Tyrosh or Braavos, you can call up their armies instead rather than using your Westeros ones. thats whats worked for me anyway. i understand why you wouldnt want to use ships or play an island faction. I almost never do either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its very easy. Ned is alive in three bookmarks. the earliest you can play as him is right after his father an brother's deaths, which is like a few months prior to the Rebellion. if you click on him in Robert's Rebellion you can play as him. or you can pick Ned in Crowned Stag and Greyjoy Rebellion, both of which are pretty peaceful Stark starts. the latest you can play as Ned is when he's imprisoned by Joffrey which is a custom date the day after Robert dies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some reason whenever i reform Old Gods or Valyrian, the powers do nothing. it allows for polygamy but you get that anyway with valyrian. the Seven is good for having knights and stability. meaning nobody will want to kill or overthrow you unless you're particularly awful and tyrannical. Drowned God gives you salt wives, some unique executions, is reformable and your men won't hate you for having levies raised. Rhllor has magical healing, unique executions, protection from plots, resurrection, and added chance to tame dragons. If you're going east, most of the Free Cities are Rhllor. Valyrian is basically a tamer Rhllor. better chance to tame a dragon, and polygamy. most of the time i go Rhllor if im doing a world conquest. if im doing a regular playthrough, i stay Seven.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Debts in Blood: The Varys Blackfyre Challenge</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-18 05:09:26</DATE>
    <TEXT>Roleplay: You and Serra, Blackfyres through your mother's line after the male line died out, were born royals in exile, after their ancestor Daemon Blackfyre was defeated and slain by Bloodraven. Because of your royal kingsblood, you nearly suffered a grievous mutilation but you were able to escape and slay the sorcerer. Your dear sister Serra later died after marrying Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos, but not before birthing a secret child named Aegon whom his supporters pass off as the secretly alive son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Only you, Serra and the mighty Golden Company however, know the truth. But no, we do not bow to the Targaryens. Varys Blackfyre will show them all you do not steal from the Black Dragon. Your sister may be dead...but your nephew still lives! The Iron Throne is controlled by Baratheons, a bastard cadet branch of the Targaryens. You will reclaim it back for the Blackfyres...or die trying. Through a coup, you were able to secretly gain control over the Trident, and Hoster Tully rots in a cell. The king cannot stop you as the king is but a bastard boy born of incest! The Black dragons will rise again. You will make sure of it... Setup: roll the timer back to one day after the death of King Robert. A boy named Joffrey "Baratheon" has taken the throne for himself. Start as Lord Tywin Lannister, and teleport Varys to your court using the console. Land Varys as the Lord Paramount of the Trident via give_title c_riverrun and give_title k_riverlands. Then switch back to a now-landed Varys. To represent the support of the Golden Company, console event spawn 10k Soldiers at Riverrun. Console away his Eunuch trait. Roleplay wise, let's just say it never happened in this timeline. This is just so House Blackfyre can have heirs if you fail and die. Use add_trait house_customizer to officially naturalize yourself as a Blackfyre but roleplay that nobody actually knows about this yet. Console Aegon to your court. He should have no house at all yet but if you seat him onto the Iron Throne, he will legitimize himself as a Targaryen. Console him a claim on the Seven Kingdoms before that, so that you may press that claim if you so wish. Goals: Bring House Blackfyre back to glory using Varys. You have three choices/paths you may make. First path: Kill Daenerys Targaryen and raise yourself instead as the independent King of the Trident. The Iron Throne brought you nothing but pain so you will instead rule as your own king. Once you do, exterminate the Tullys to secure your reign. Second path: Honor the wishes of your dead sister and seat your secret nephew Aegon Blackfyre as the king of the Iron Throne. You will become his most loyal vassal and one of his most powerful supporters. Many will try to stop him but you will destroy the enemies of House Blackfyre. Third Path: Declare that no man is better suited for that throne than you, and raise your armies to claim it from the evil bastard boy who stole it. Seize the Iron Throne with Blood and Fire, and the whole world will know the name of "King Varys Blackfyre". Secondary options and goals: Find Blackfyre. If you cannot find Blackfyre, find your house a new Valyrian blade. Kill the Baratheons. They will always be a threat to you, no matter what you do, also the Baratheons supported Daeron The Falseborn over your ancestor the true king. Place into power the houses that supported Daemon Blackfyre, and depose those who did not. Find and tame a dragon. As a Blackfyre, it is your birthright. With a dragon, none can stand before you.</TEXT>
