    <TEXT>I was walking around the kitchen with chopsticks in my mouth, reached up to take them out, misjudged how long they were, punched the ends, and violently jabbed two holes in the roof of my mouth right in the soft, fleshy area near the back. I can still feel one of the holes fifteen years later... At the time I was positive I had almost accidentally killed myself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would open and maintain an all-ages music venue with inexpensive/free food options. Portland used to be full of all-ages venues and houses where people had shows, but between skyrocketing rent gentrifying what used to be punk houses and the OLCC (liquor licensing for Oregon) making it nearly impossible to have minors in venues where alcohol is being sold, there are virtually no all-ages venues left. Liquor sales are often the only thing keeping small venues afloat, so of course they will prioritize staying open over catering to the kids (and I don't blame them, if I had a bottom line to worry about, I would, too). BUT, if I won the lottery and had money to throw at something unprofitable, I would open up a venue where everyone, of any age, can come hang out, see good local music, grab a cheap meal and rip it up. I'd pay some local punks a ton to manage everything and do service and make sure that any band that plays gets at least $100 for their band fund for playing. Cover will be ultra cheap or free and all money will go to the bands. The ultimate dream is to build an adjacent recording studio to record local artists on the cheap or free so they can get their music out there, and a small dorm-style area with kitchens and bathrooms and a secure locking closet for gear to cater to broke touring bands so they can sleep for free on beds instead of the floor in a random house or in a van protecting their gear for a night of their tour.</TEXT>

Several years ago I made my friends watch it on a beach weekend, and no one else was amused. The smash cut from Reid talking about how eye snatchers eat the eyes to our unsub squishing a hard boiled egg with a fork makes me scream laugh every time. Ridiculous and amazing!</TEXT>

He sleeps curled up next to me every night and has to be touching you or else he rearranges himself 50 times until he is pressed on you! It's the best!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I read Elliot Rodger's manifesto, too - I read the whole thing in one sitting. I couldn't pry my eyes away, it was like reading a transcript of an entitled child's internal tantrum but with DEEPLY upsetting sexual overtones. I was experiencing such an distressing mixture of horror and revoltion that this guy not only thought this shit but that OTHER PEOPLE ENCOURAGED IT, TOO. Like that guy found his community. He was so entrenched in the idea that if he wasn't sexually validated by women that he reserved the right to literally end their lives. It's bananas. Sometimes I stop and think about the magnitude of the whole red pill thing and I genuinely can't fathom it. That manifesto was beyond fucked.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My partner and I have been together for twelve years and we have found lots of stupid ways to entertain ourselves in that time. One of our classics was that we'd both make digeridoo sounds really loudly and try to get overtones. One of us would start with a quiet, nasally "nyuurrrrwoooooonggnneeeeeeuruuuuuoooong" and the other person would join in and you just keep getting louder and doing that for a long time, changing your mouth shape. It's very entertaining. One night we were hanging out in my room, which was on the main floor next to the living room, and we heard the front door close and thought we were alone in the house that I shared with four other roommates. We talked and laughed for a while and then we started doing our digeridoo sounds. We entertained ourselves for probably twenty minutes when I heard a quiet knock on my bedroom door. I flung it open to find that my roommate hadn't actually left, but had invited a study group of about 12 people from the library to our living room and they were quietly studying when us two idiots started what probably sounded like a bizarre Australian mating ritual and then went on with it for a fucking age. So, so embarrassing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today at work, our electrician was fixing one of my pieces of equipment and talking me through the repairs he was making. He's a super hard dude, and burly - you could definitely guess by looking at him that he does skilled labor and is tough as nails. While we're talking, his phone rings, and he looks at it, then at me, and says, "I'm sorry, I have to take this, it's very important." He answers and has the cutest conversation I've ever heard in my life - it's his five year old son, and his face absolutely lights up he asks him about his day, what he's learned, what the nearest thing he saw was, if he made anything cool or thought of any good stories, and then his son requested his Cookie Monster voice, and he unabashedly told his son he loved him about a dozen times in his Cookie Monster voice and that he'll be home soon, so get ready for hugs and kisses. As he finished fixing my machine, he was so excited to tell me about his son and about how he comes up with fun and creative stories and is in his "running really fast" phase and likes helping in the kitchen and he's just beaming. It melts my heart that he's so brazenly gentle and kind to his kid, and that it's more important to take three minutes to answer his call and give his son his undivided attention than to ignore the call to finish something at work that can definitely wait three minutes. I hope I can be as good a parent as he is if I'm ever fortunate enough to have kids!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When one person in a large group uses manipulation, aggression, and whining to get the entire group to do what they want to do instead of what everyone else wants to do. I always want to take those people by the shoulders, shake them, and ask if they're an adult or a toddler and how they could possibly be so selfish. Usually this kind of behavior results in the group disbanding and the selfish asshole has ruined everyone else's good time, but they don't care because they got what they wanted and nothing else matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When a woman says that they don't like other women, can't be friends with other women, etc. Mostly I feel badly that they've been conditioned this way because society pits us against each other, but I also know to listen and believe them because they're straight up telling me, "This will not end in friendship, it will end in competition." Similarly, if a man refers to women as "females". Red fucking flag! He's literally telling you that he doesn't see you as a human (we already have a word for a human female, it's "woman"), he sees you as a feminine object. Along the same vein, when people refer to grown -ass women as "girls". Yuck.</TEXT>

I know to any educated person with two brain cells to rub together, purity culture is obviously extremely toxic, sexist, and manipulative, but growing up in the church it seemed very innocent and "pious". "Our little angel is going to stay pure for her husband! She's going to be pure for Jesus. She's proving how pure she is by not being a slut!" My friends and I still compare the mental scars that purity culture inflicted upon us. When I was raped by someone in the church, I genuinely believed that my worth was gone. I genuinely believed that my parents wouldn't love me anymore if they knew. Fuck purity culture.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice Needed: I found blood splattered on my front door. What next?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-21 18:25:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>This morning when I was getting ready to leave for work, I noticed red drips and splatters on my front door. I guessed that my dark colored wreath had gotten wet and was dripping dye or something, but it definitely looked like blood. I was standing there with my keys in my hand, just staring and trying to evaluate when my next door neighbor asked me in a frightened tone if I had blood splattered on my door, too. [screenshot of my photo gallery with blood splatter pictures (hopefully this one works)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLtqF-OQfWIV5OwGB8uwJyUy1ZrWZyE9/view?usp=drivesdk) I went over to look - Her door is white, and it was very obviously blood. Several other houses on our street had been similarly splattered. I have been thinking all morning, trying to decipher a pattern, but can't seem to find a link between the houses or residents. It's not as if someone injured had gone door to door knocking, or that they only went to homes with porch lights, or houses with single residents... It truly does seem random. Today is recycling pickup day in my neighborhood, so usually on Wednesday nights we see a lot of unfamiliar faces in the neighborhood gathering cans and bottles to collect the deposits. Unfortunately, this is a really underserved community with pretty rampant substance abuse and mental health issues. My best guess is that someone who is unwell approached each of our doors for reasons that only they knew and placed their blood there. What is causing me a bit of anxiety is that I tried to open my consciousness and get an intention reading on the blood, but my fear was clouding my perception. I cannot tell with what intent this person put blood on my door. Blood is powerful, whether or not it's being used specifically for magick, and I believe that if a person has a very clear intent for ill-will and is symbolically using their blood to manifest that intention (in the same vein as chaos magick), I could have a serious situation on my hands. My home is an extremely positive place with excellent energy; I'm very careful to clear my space before I practice, especially when I'm scrying. My question to this wonderful community: what should I do to cleanse my home and my door? Should I do something specific when removing the blood? How can I make sure there are no lasting effects from this incident? Thank you very much!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That was my first thought, too, but it was random doors in the neighborhood. I'm a very light sleeper and had my window open, so I'm pretty sure I would have heard knocking or cries for help. Good idea about the doorbell cameras- I'll ask around and see if anyone has one. I've not noticed them around, but I haven't been looking, either.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I advocated for myself to abate my germophobia and I'm really proud!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-22 18:33:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have obsessive compulsive disorder, which over time has developed into acute germophobia, and I've been in therapy for years to manage the anxiety that comes with the condition. I've made a ton of progress and am constantly evaluating what is an appropriate concern for my hygiene and what is my phobia going to the extreme. One of my worst sensitivities is when it comes to prepared food. When I can't see the kitchen, it's no problem, but when it's an open kitchen and I can see the food being prepared, my anxiety goes into overdrive. I worked in food service for years and know proper food handling and storage procedures, always made sure my kitchens were sparkling, and instantly recognize when hygienic rules are being broken. This has severely limited my ability to go out and enjoy my life, especially in the company of friends and loved ones, and my therapist has encouraged me to trust food service professionals and use techniques we've been working on in therapy to accept things outside of my control. Conversely, she said I need to give myself permission to speak up when it's reasonable and appropriate in order to subdue my fears instead of just letting them spiral out of control, and last night I did that for myself for the first time. I was testing my boundaries and ordered a fresh roll from a food cart. I waited in line, ordered, and was waiting for my food. Unfortunately, I watched the server handle cash, credit cards, and his phone in the same pair of gloves before directly handling raw food that would not be cooked. I felt my anxiety start to spike as he took my order and headed to the food prep counter, again without changing his gloves. As politely as I could, I asked if he could please change his gloves before making my food, since I had seen him handle cash and cards without changing his gloves. He said, "Of course! Sorry about that!" changed his gloves, made my food, and wished me a good night. It didn't seem to upset him at all, he was very gracious about it! For that guy, it was literally no big deal, but for me, it was a huge moment of self advocacy and I'm super proud of myself. I feel really empowered because I had a calm and reasonable request, was able to ask it without panicking or blowing it out of proportion, and was able to enjoy the food he made me. I feel really good. This feels like a huge step forward in my mental health!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Can confirm, as that is exactly what happened to me. We heard all the allusions: chewed gum, apple with a bite out, milk with backwash, a used napkin, etc., and when I was sexually assaulted (by someone in the church, of course) I knew, like really knew deep in my heart that I was now worthless and no one would want me because I was "used" and "dirty". I told my mom and I remember being terrified as I asked her if she still loved me. I was so brainwashed that I genuinely believed that my own mother wouldn't love me anymore because I was raped. Leaving the church is the best thing I have ever done and I would encourage anyone even vaguely thinking about leaving to DO IT. Leave and never look back. Formulate your own opinions, find your own morality, follow your own leadership, and love yourself. The church doesn't love you, they love your money and they love power, and they love controlling women through toxic as fuck indoctrination and by demonizing their sexuality.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>TIFU by pressing my eyeball against a spider</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-27 14:35:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>This actually happened this morning, and boy did I fuck up. I'm legally blind, and often I totter around comfortably in my own home unable to see, and this morning was no different - I fed my dog, got a drink of water, and used the bathroom blind before my brain caught up with what my body was doing. I wear contacts every day to correct my vision, but when I don't have them on, I have a clear visual range of 2-3 inches from the surface of my eye. To see things clearly or read my phone, I close one eye and either hold up an object or put my other eye 2-3 inches from whatever I'm looking at. I also have the physical coordination of a toddler. I am also a dog trainer with a lovely but overenthusiastic dog. This is a really bad combination. I have been working with my dog on hitting wall targets (with the eventual goal that he will push doors open and shut, ring bells, and turn off the lights). He loves this exercise, especially ringing bells, and has started the phase in training where he tests his newfound skills on everything all the time to see if I "capture" and reward any of those behaviors. We're in the middle of the rainy season here in Oregon, so I definitely picked the wrong time to be teaching a behavior where he puts his filthy feet all over my clean walls. There are little doggy toe-shaped mud streaks everywhere. This morning, in my state of blindness, I noticed what looked like a big mud splotch on the door to the bathroom, and I immediately assumed this meant my pup had been trying to push the bathroom door open, a big step in our training progress! I was thrilled, closed my right eye and zoomed in toward the mud splotch with my left eye to confirm my findings. But it wasn't a mud splotch at all. The blackish spot on my door that I thought was a small chunk of mud was actually a huge, quarter-sized spider that I just threw my open eyeball toward. Once I realized that it was a spider (which took several seconds for my brain to process), I let out an unearthly shriek that sent my dog barreling toward me doing a full on attack-mode bark, obviously coming to my aid against the intruder. He slammed into my legs from behind, which pushed my open eyeball onto this big fucking spider. The partially open door crashed into the bathroom wall and towel rack from the force of my face, I did a weird flying leap backward on top of my very freaked out dog, and I cannot stop screaming for several minutes. I felt that fucking spider touch my eye, y'all. I will never fully recover. Also, I have traumatized my poor dog, who is now avoiding this whole region of the house. My bathroom door now has a nice new hole in it from where the force of my face punched it into the towel rack. I can already feel a bruise developing on my big dumb face on my brow ridge and my upper cheek below my eye. An innocent spider lost it's life today. Life will never be the same. TL;DR: I tried to identify a spot on the bathroom door without vision correction by putting my eye 2 inches away from what turned out to be a spider and ended up smooshing it with my eyeball, traumatizing my dog, and breaking my door. EDIT TO ADD: Some people are questioning the physics and timeline, so I will do my best to clarify: I was crouched down to inspect the smudge in a sort of quasi-chair sit and when I realized it was not mud, but a spider, I experienced that fight/flight/freeze instinct and I guess my brain chose "freeze" with an added "screech" option. My dog was only two feet away (my house is tiny). It all happened in about three seconds. I guess saying he hit my "legs" isn't quite the right thing - he skidded on the hardwood into my calves because of my half-Slavic-squat, and then I bonked forward, pressed my eye directly upon the aforementioned spider, and then bounced back. My dog was right under my butt when I fell backward, so I had to straighten out my legs really quick so I wouldn't crush his spine and I sort of did a back dive away from the door. Physics are difficult, I'm not sure how to describe it any better. Also, YES! I rinsed with saline like no one has ever rinsed before, but I may never be clean again. ALSO also, thank you for the gold and silver! I'm so grateful!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! He is the best boy and I love him. I would argue that I also was not biologically prepared to deal with that situation... Haha! And yes, it's a good question - I have looked into corrective surgery, and unfortunately, the structure of my eye is degraded to the point where reductive surgeries (like Lasik or the surgery where they shave the cornea) aren't possible because there essentially isn't enough material to reduce to actually correct my vision. There is an exciting new style of surgery that's an additive surgery where they essentially insert a second cornea like an internal contact. The best part about it is if my eyes continue to degrade, they can remove and replace the lens (almost like surgery for cataracts). But it's not widespread in the US yet, and since it's not technically "necessary", it is considered an elective surgery and I can't go to a specialist and have it covered by my insurance and I can't afford it on my own. I'm still young, and eye surgery methods improve and are evolving so quickly these days that I'm really holding out hope!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh God I relate to this so hard. I've been really struggling because I'm queer and marrying my cis male partner (we are monogamous) and I feel like I'm putting the last nail in the coffin of being accepted in the gay community. Somehow by knowingly committing my life to a man and having a hetero-appearing marriage, I know I won't be welcome, but now in a really permanent way. To put your identity out there and have it slapped back in your face as not good enough to be accepted is so devastating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Toward the end of my granddad's life, when he was in his late eighties, he started developing dementia. He was the sweetest, most caring man when he was lucid, and nothing changed when he started getting confused more often. I was really fortunate to live only a couple of minutes away from my grandparents and saw them almost every day. Toward the end of his life, my granddad wouldn't always recognize me. Sometimes he thought I was my mom (we look really alike) and sometimes he just thought I was a friendly stranger, but he was always happy to see me and spend time with me whether he recognized me or not. His whole life, any time he met someone new, he made them feel special and welcome, and with the dementia, nearly everyone was a stranger that he made feel special and welcome. One day I popped by around lunch time and we are sitting at the table together. I could tell he didn't know who I was, but he was very happy that I was spending time with him and delighted to hear about my day and to talk about his morning walk and special memories and other general chit-chat. My Nana came to in, handed him his lunch plate, and headed back to the kitchen for her own. Granddad's whole face lit up, and he said, "That's my wife Marge, isn't she beautiful?" I'll never forget how much he loved her, and how thrilled he was to tell a nice young stranger about his lovely wife. He was the sweetest man I've ever known right up to his dying breath. I miss him terribly, and I'll never stop trying to love my family the way he did. He was an incredibly special man.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Congratulations!! That ring is gorgeous! My advice would be, sit down and talk to your partner about what's most important: having everyone you know there to celebrate vs only your closest and most intimate friends and family, ceremony vs reception, frugality vs pulling out all the stops, is the most important element food, a live band, the photographer, the cinematographer, or something else? Will it be causal or black tie? Will you have a low-key buffet vs 4-course sit down service? etc. Once you talk about and compromise on the very basics you can start the actual planning, but it gets much harder if you don't realize you're not on the same page until one of you has invested a lot of time and energy into planning something that the other one is unhappy with or you have to adjust the whole budget to accommodate an element that you're both *guessing* the other person is highly invested in and neither of you really is. Also, make up your guest list and sit on it for a couple of weeks. Are there more people than you thought? Did you forget anyone important? Would you be crushed if you didn't invite all your cousins? Will you have children at the ceremony or reception? Your guest list will help you determine the rest of every element, so setting it early and sticking to it helps tremendously. Best of luck to you! I'm wishing you a joyful engagement and happy marriage!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Rollerblades for fat calves?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-08 17:32:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>TL,DR: Rollerblade recommendations for 18 in/46 cm calves? Hi all! On February 29th, right before the lockdown, one of my friends had a leapyear "9th Birthday Party" where we went to a roller rink and ate pizza and watched TMNT. Getting on rollerblades was the most fun I've had in YEARS, and my face hurt for days because I was smiling so widely the whole time. It was the best and most enjoyable exercise I've done in decades. Many, many happy hours of my childhood were spent rollerblading around my neighborhood, and since all the pools have closed and my dog passed away in the last couple of months, I haven't been lap swimming or doing twice daily walks, so I figured I would start up rollerblading again just to keep active. Well, I bought some Rollerblade brand rollerblades, talked about them for weeks before they arrived, and had my friends over for a social-distance skate session when they finally did. Horrifyingly, they were a huge struggle to get on because the wratcheting straps were too narrow for my calves. I did eventually get them strapped, but it was agonizingly painful and it left bruises on my shins after only skating for about 15 minutes. I ended up getting really teary and embarrassed because I feel like I've hit another brick wall in accessible sports for fat people. I'm really dedicated to the idea of getting back into some rollerblades. Is it even possible? Can anyone recommended a pair of inline skates that can accommodate a large calf? Measuring right where my bruises are, my calf is 18 inches / 46 centimeters. Is there hope for me? Thank you in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for responding! I'm not sure how tall my skates are, since I'm at work (I'm "essential") and my skates are at home... I just measured my calf at 8 inches and it's only 12 inches around, so you may be exactly right and I may need to go with a shorter boot. Maybe I should check out k2s?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>HELP! My partner used my hydroflasks for coffee. When I'm done burying the body, how do I get the coffee flavor out?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-20 17:28:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Y'all HydroHomies are my only hope. I have been BETRAYED. I went to fill up my second favorite hydroflask with water and the first taste, instead of sweet, clear, pure hydration came back musty and stale like old coffee. I spit it all over the living room. I screeched, "DID YOU USE MY WATER BOTTLE FOR COFFEE?!" and I kid you not, my partner came into the room with my first favorite hydroflask. It was filled. With *c o f f e e*. So when I'm done breaking off the engagement and getting rid of the murder evidence, how on earth do I get rid of the residual musty coffee flavor?! Please, I'm begging you all, end this misery.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My best friend's little sister married a real winner. They had a gorgeous and intensely expensive wedding that none of the bridal party ended up remembering... He and his entire party of groomsmen got extremely wasted and his best man's rambling, barely-coherent speech was all about how many other hot women he could have been with had he not chosen my friend's sister. He said "fuck" about 12 times and all the older family members (especially the grandparents) were horrified, but the groom was clapping and laughing very hard. Eventually one of the bridesmaids cut him off to do another toast. After speeches they did the first dance and it was weirdly hyper-sexual with lots of grinding and groping. Everyone got really quiet and uncomfortable the entire length of a super long song. Much, much worse than that, was after the first bride and groom dance, and after the father/daughter dance, they had a mother/son dance. His mom had picked a very weird country song about "making love" and the wasted groom totally had his hands sliding over his mom's hips and then butt and grinding his hips into her hips. It was horrific. There was lots of upset murmuring and at some point one of his uncles stepped in and relieved the groom of dancing duties and there was an audible sigh of relief from guests. This was about four years ago and we still talk about it all the time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got ripped off by a Kickstarter project (BauBax travel shoes) and I'm so pissed that I was dumb enough to have to learn a $150 lesson... **Edit**: here's what the "backer" update from the CEO said on June 18, six months past their "guaranteed" product ship date: "I am sad because Baubax is insolvent and cash strapped and won #8217;t be able to pay all its creditors. In fact, Baubax is in a situation where it does not have enough money to ship all the pending orders to its backers and early adopters, who over the years have helped us bring our unique products and ideas to life. But I am excited to share that the new owner of the Baubax brand, Mr. Jason Akatiff... Jason has only purchased the assets of Baubax, not the liabilities."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately, the company hit their goal on Kickstarter and then kept "delaying" release. Now they've sold the company to a new owner who changed the name to "BauxBax Luxury" or something and in the terms of sale the new owner is not responsible for the old company's unfulfilled orders. I took it up with my credit card and tried a charge back, and I ran into two issues: Kickstarter took my money back in September of 2019, and when I requested a charge back I was waaaay past the normal charge back parameters, and then when we did try, Kickstarter rejected the charge back request. So frustrating. Never, ever use Kickstarter unless it's someone you know or a small local charitable cause. And even then, you should donate directly to them if possible so they get the whole amount and don't lose 6% off the top. Kickstarter was a sort of good idea, but it's just too easy to take advantage of people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately, it did reach the goal and then the company owners took the money and ran and never actually delivered the product. They sold the whole company after it was funded with the caveat that the new owner doesn't have to fulfil old orders. So I'm SOL.</TEXT>
