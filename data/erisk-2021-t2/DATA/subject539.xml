Not trying to be sneaky, I literally don't actually know where we'll be.

    <TEXT>I disagree. Clean shave feeling lasts about 6 hours before the "velcro" stage commences. I clean shave once a year, at the start of Movember. Other than that, it's a trimmer for me all year round. This way, I trim twice a week if I'm feeling respectable; once a week most of the time; or, as is the case at the moment, not for 2-3 weeks. Majority of people can't ever really tell.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, Aware it may not be the perfect thread in which to post, but figured I'd give it a go anyway. I've been doing a bit of climbing with mates lately, predominantly at Kangaroo Point, and have been really enjoying it. They've got all the gear, but I'm thinking about grabbing a bit for myself to make everything a bit easier/quicker and so I'm not so reliant on them. To start with, was just thinking a harness and shoes... perhaps a chalk bag. Can anyone give me a ball park figure on what I'm looking at cost-wise here. Obviously, I'm aware that there's probably a huge spectrum of quality (therefore cost) and I'll be doing some research and shopping around, but just want to have an indicative idea before going in. Also, anything else that's a must for the initial kit purchase?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for the detailed response, much appreciated. K2 was going to be my first brick and mortar stop, but thanks for flagging the other options. I'll certainly check these out. Is Anaconda an option? I'm frequenting the Gold Coast at the moment, so wouldn't be a hassle to stop in, but not if they're just crap. As for the 'self-expressive' chalk bags, I might pass on that one for now... I don't need to create any more excuses for people to stop and stare my pure-grunt/sans-technique climbing style. Perhaps once I get a bit silkier. Thanks again for the feedback.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't necessarily have an issue with the quality of the food at the places that use Menulog, more just the overall experience. From what I've seen, it appears to be the most-used third party online/app service. I would have thought that the whole premise for it's existence would be to make ordering food simple and efficient. In each of my experiences, this has not been the case. * 1st time using it, there was the hassle of signing up - whatever, this is the case for most things when used the first time. * 2nd time - order food at 7pm. Receive confirmation email at 7.15pm. Food delivery arrives at 8.25pm! How could it possibly take so long? The shop was literally blocks from my door. * 3rd time. Order food at 7pm. Receive confirmation email at 7.10pm (improvement!). Receive phone call from shop 15 mins later, advising that because it's a public holiday, there'll be a 15% surcharge. I advise that I've already paid on CC via Menulog, but they simply advise that its a store policy that can't be worked into Menulog's structure. I end up having to pay the delivery dude an extra few bucks on receipt of food to cover the difference.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tech (laptop) advice for a relative novice</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-01-04 05:20:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm turning to Reddit for advice here, not because I'm lazy (well, I'm not *overly-lazy*, just a bit), but because I'd like to get advice without having to venture into all possible options and absolutely confusing myself in the process. I'll keep it short: I need a new laptop. * Currently using a Chromebook. * Love it because it's simple, it meets the majority of my **current** needs (browsing internet stuff, streaming episodes, etc), it links well with my phone (Nexus 5x) and Chromecast, and has great battery life. * Currently don't mind the lack of storage as I have plenty through Google Drive (which again, links seamlessly). * Only real downside is the fact that I can't run true programs. Have previously not really worried about this as I had access to my work computer, however new security protocols have limited this recently. * Going forward, I'm looking to a bit more with my photos and videos, so now need the ability and power to run various programs (rather than just apps). Also need to be able to access various ATO services to the AusKey software. A bit more HD storage probably wouldn't go astray either... * Won't be gaming or doing anything anything super heavyduty - at most simple photo/video editing (eg using GoPro software and/or simple photo editing). * Doesn't have to be super-portable, as I'll just hold onto the Chromebook for travelling and edit photos upon return. * I have no idea about what I'll need in terms of processing power, screen quality, memory, etc - it's these tech specs that I'm seeking an assistance on. I'd like to have a bit of an idea before subjecting myself to any sales tactics. Hell, if you can point out a good deal at a particular retailer, that'd be great! * Buget-wise, if it could be  lt;$800 that would be good, but not a must. Any advice re increasing budget in order to get better package also appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help. I'm aware I'm taking a shortcut here seeking advice, but figured that there's plenty of other BNE Redditors out there who live and breathe this stuff and wouldn't mind offering a hand. If any further info is required, just ask!</TEXT>

Even if these parameters cannot be met, submit your suggestions and I'll try and check it out. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, that's usual cruise - well, the Teneriffe Ferry to New Farm Park component anyway. Typically we'll turn around at that point and head back. The only downside is the varying surfaces. The older 'cobblestone-like' sections are pretty average, and the wooden boardwalk sections are quite slippery when wet. The super smooth concrete section just prior to the Powerhouse is sweet, but they've recently installed those yellow strips (the ones that look like lego), so they disrupt the ride a bit too. I'll give the floating walkway a go next time - not too worried about losing my board in the drink, but might wait to introduce my gf to this section though, as she's not quite that confident yet... Was also going to consider the Storey Bridge paths, but thought that they might be a bit congested.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>GF and I opened a joint account with ING Direct when we moved in together. Their 'Orange Everyday' account works great for us as a transaction account from which groceries, rent and joint outings are paid (meals, movies, etc). We have each set up automatic monthly transactions from our individual accounts into this joint account, so we don't have to worry about it. Three great bonuses with this account: 1. FREE access to ANY ATM - great if we're at a gig/festival/etc and it's cash only bars. Any fees applied by ATMs are automatically and instantly refunded into the account. 2. No fees - it's a free account with no monthly fees. 3. 2% cash back on purchases  lt;$100 where PayWave is used - again, refunded back into the account. Since opening the account 6 months ago, we average about $40 cash back per month. When setting it up, you also are given a 'Savings Maximiser' account (again, free). It's got a very competitive interest rate and we've recently each started throwing a set amount each month into this as we're going to buy a house. They've also got a promo happening at the moment where new customers being referred by existing customers result in $75 cash being given to both parties, so if you'd like my referral code, PM me. As many others have said already, I wouldn't be throwing everything into the joint account - but if you can both agree to amounts contributed and the purposes of use for this cash, it certainly makes shared living expenses very easy. Good luck!</TEXT>

Thought that this was another fad that surely couldn't take off... but then again, Oxygen Bars were around for a while there, so I guess anything's possible.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Deposit for Auction - Queensland, Australia</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-09 06:54:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Having not purchased real estate before, I've been researching a lot over the past few months. Have found a suitable property which will be sold at Auction this weekend. I have completed the necessary checks and valuations and have finance pre-approved. The agent phoned me today to provide an update on the contract. The property will be sold unconditionally, settlement will be 30 days, and the deposit required for the successful bidder had been set at $60K, and needs to be paid within 48hrs. Note that I'm anticipating this property to be sold somewhere around the $600K mark, so the deposit is ~10%. My finance has been pre-approved, but I'm borrowing 95%. If I'm the successful bidder, where am I meant to get the deposit money from? If I've omitted any necessary info, please let me know!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Bought a house - now what? HELP!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-16 04:35:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>First of all, apologies if I'm asking the same question that's been asked a thousand time before, but my searches of this thread only seemed to expose partial and/or out-dated responses. So, I bought a house on the weekend. Settlement is currently scheduled for approximately 4 weeks time. The property was purchased at auction, so it's immediately unconditional. I'm aware that I've got a heap to do between now and then, but the scale of the tasks that await me seem to be muddying the waters. While I have moved residences in the past, I've never been in this position before - i.e. being a home-owner. As such, I'm hoping the fine people of /r/brisbane who have can help me out. Here's what I've done thus far: **Pre-auction** * Undertaken building and pest inspection - no major issues * Received finance pre-approval * Engaged a solicitor **Post-auction** * Provided copies of contract of sale to mortgage broker and solicitor * Paid my deposit to the real estate agent * Finance application continuing (FYI - going through a broker, who is managing this process) * Taken out a temporary (30 days) insurance policy on the property That's about it to date. Obviously, there's bulk tasks that remain, but I'd like try and lay them all out logically in front of me so that I can (attempt to) approach them in a calm and orderly manner. So, /r/brisbane, what else do I need to do? I'd also love to hear any tips/lessons learnt/warnings you may have so that I can try and avoid finding myself in similar situations. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I currently have a PO box in the CBD that's close to the office - a result of getting sick of having to redirect mail while renting in various locations throughout Brisbane over the past 10 years - so I think I'll just keep that running for a few more months until I'm able to get a range of other matters under control. But good call - I'll keep track of all incoming post to the box in the meantime. Changing locks? It's not a 'dodgy' area and I've met the previous owner, and he doesn't present as an axe murderer... I'm thinking that I may skip this one? Thoughts? Professional cleaner - yes, was thinking about this today. I'll definitely get a full 'bond clean' after I leave my rental, but may just put my mum to work on the new place... cleaners never seem to be as thorough (or as cheap) as mums, and the parents are super keen to be involved ;) BTW, any tips for a good professional cleaner? Organising services - this was the primary reason for my post. I'm in no way technologically minded, and just checked the process I need to undergo in order to relocate my internet... They want between 5 and 20 business days!? At my current rental (apartment in Newstead) I'm currently with TPG, getting ADSL 2+ and a home phone line rental for $60/month. It was ok, nothing special, but I've always put that down to condensed apartment living. I've checked NBN availability for the new place, and it's not yet available. Any tips on who I should go to? Currently use Netflix pretty solidly, but other than that, I guess it could be deemed an 'average user'? Electricity, gas, etc... what's the process here? Do I need to find out who currently services the property, or can I simply select my own from the start? Bottle of grog - already have it on ice!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see. This is a conundrum I'm currently tossing up... We were planning on painting a few internal walls *at some stage* and perhaps installing a few more/better lighting, but figured we'd move in first and get a better feel for the place. Pros of doing the minor works first up: Ability to do it in a vacant space. Cons of doing the minor works first up: Delaying move-in (i.e. having to continue renting); Inability to get access to the new property to plan accordingly prior to settlement (and current move-in date planned for day immediately after settlement); Not providing sufficient time to 'get a feel' for the new place... Thoughts...?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is absolutely no chance that they'll strike. I do the odd bit of driving for Uber here and there, and the competitive nature that already exists between drivers is right up there. The talk of some drivers striking has plenty of others already licking their lips for more productive shifts. This will mean that just as many drivers as normal (if not more) will be on the roads during the 'strike', resulting in no difference in service to riders, thus disheartening those who did strike and getting them back on the road to get their piece of the pie. I'm a rider far more often than a driver (I'd guess by a factor of 10), and I agree - the current prices and resulting levels of service are pretty much on the mark. I personally think it's Uber QLD getting a little bit greedy after seeing this kind of promotion generating increases in rides (therefore profits) in other regions around the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree with the general sentiment here so far - being that it is quite possible to live car-free in the inner city. I've lived in Fortitude Valley, Newstead and Teneriffe for the past 3 years and while I had a car, I didn't really need it the majority of the time. The only exceptions were trips to the beach, trips to regular sporting fixtures (volleyball/cricket matches - held in suburbs) and errands to stores where I needed to load up on supplies or transport bulky items. Other than that, I commuted everywhere by bicycle or PT, and/or used Uber if I was planning on having beers or the weather was crap. Sadly, my inner-city lifestyle has ceased for now, having purchased a property in the burbs, but I'm still trying to rely on my bike/PT wherever I can. So, while it's entirely possible to go car-free say 90% of the time, there's still that 10% where you really need access to a vehicle. And it's these times that'll really get to you if you don't. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to own the vehicle, but have a plan in place to ensure you have access to one - borrow, rent, share, etc. My colleague has spent the past 4 years living between his 2 apartments - one in Brisbane CBD, the other on the Gold Coast. Sunday through Thursday evenings are spent in the CBD pad, with no vehicle. Friday arvo rolls around, he ducks downstairs to the car rental office, picks up a hire car and drives to the coast. Friday and Saturday evenings down there. Sunday arvo rolls around, he drives back up from the coast to the CBD pad and returns the hire car.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Water takes forever to run from the taps</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-04-07 08:53:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>Have just purchased our first home and we're very happy with it. However, there is a minor plumbing issue with the taps that run over the laundry tub. Specifically, when either and/or both the the taps are turned on, it takes approximately 1 minute for water to exit the faucet. There's no spluttering, loud noises, etc... it just takes forever for the water to run. There are no other plumbing issues in that room, or throughout the remainder of the house. I'd like to have a go at fixing this myself, but I have no plumbing experience. My guess is that perhaps the washers are "sticking" when the taps are turned on, and eventually release to allow water to flow. Does this sound likely? If so, I'll find a YouTube tutorial and attempt to change the washers. If not, would love to hear your theories. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For those wondering: There were no shut-off valves under the tub... taps plumbed straight into the walls. As such, had to shut off all water to the house. Turned out to be a fairly simply fix... my guess was correct - i.e. the valves were stuck in their seats, even when taps were turned on. Simply removed the taps, pulled out the old valves, and cleaned up the seat with a re-seating tool. Put new stronger valves in (metal stems, not plastic), and took the opportunity to also swap out the O rings and washers. Everything back to normal :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. I actually love a bit of GYG, but I guess I can somewhat agree to them being a tad bland at times. I've found this depends on which particular store I visit - which is kinda wrong given its a chain. I spent a fair bit of time in Mexico last year and, sadly, found that I don't particularly like authentic Mexican food. The meats/fillings are typically pretty good, and certainly not bland when it comes to flavour, but the big let down for me was the tortillas. I love my bread and bread-related foods, and I thought that I'd be in heaven due to there being a fresh tortilleria on pretty much every corner, but quite frankly, what they produced sucked. These tortillas were waaaaay too thick and chunky, and often quite grainy. Often they'd snap in two when folded. Also, way too filling - you're full after 2 or 3 small soft tacos! I understand that pretty much the point of them - cheap carbs that fill a hole, but I love my stretchy, pack-em-tight, American-style tortillas. Also, I concur with your statement on Nandos. And while we're at it, let's add Opporto to the shit-list.</TEXT>

Pros: * New entertainment precinct. * Should complement other infrastructure projects * Overhaul of existing transit centre and surrounding buildings. * Huge draw-card once complete. * Much better location that milk factory. * Will fill the "dead spot" between CBD and Suncorp Stadium. * Design/Construction/etc jobs created. Cons: * Noise for local residents * Potential for encroaching on Roma St Parklands * No doubt there'll be a fight to see who funds it in the end.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This really depends on: * How much time do you have, and how much of it you want to spend driving? It's much further between places than most international visitors think. * How much money do you have, and how much do you want to spend on purchasing and repairing the vehicle? * To a lesser extent, when are you coming? The season, combined with how much time you have, may influence your decision as to where you go. There are some pretty awesome surf spots in some pretty remote locations... On the east coast, Noosa is as far north as you want to go. Heading south/clockwise, you can pretty much surf the entire coastline until you find yourself on the north-west coast of Western Australia. I'd probably recommend the Queensland/New South Wales coast component of this however, as it's not remote and you'll still find plenty of places to surf.</TEXT>

I don't typically recommend that people treat it as a premature Friday if they haven't had much previous experience in fobbing of responsibilities, but if you're confident in this field, it's a good option. For those less experienced, I recommend the "rolling in" approach - in the working hours before midday on a Thursday, work an hour, break for half an hour. Repeat until midday. In the post-midday work hours, reverse this approach - work half an hour, break for an hour. Follow this procedure for a 2-4 weeks and you'll be fobbing off responsibilities like a pro in no time!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-07-25 04:23:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right off the bat... a few apologies. Apology #1 - I know this is /r/Brisbane, but it's the thread I'm most familiar with and the one I've found to be the most approachable. I'm not expecting to solve my issue here, but rather be pointed in the right direction... a more appropriate thread? A helpful website?... I'm open to suggestion. Apology #2 - I'm in no way technically-minded. I like to think that I can have a go at most stuff, but when it comes to in-depth technology, and specifically computers, I know that I'm well out of my depth. The issue - I've got a fairly new laptop (purchased in January) that I use infrequently. But when I do use it, it's super slow. This means using it is quite frustrating. I'm not sure if it's slow due to me using it so infrequently (so when I do use it is spends all its time updating, etc) or if it's because it's full of stuff (programs, anti virus, etc) that I don't use and was installed because I hastily set it up without really thinking about it. Specs - Again, I'm not tech-oriented, but I did a bit of research prior to purchasing which I will attempt to recall: Asus X555UJ i7-6500 8GB 1TB Windows 10 Use - I sit in an office all day, so I don't like spending much time outside of work sitting behind a computer, but when I do, I wanted to make sure that I had a machine that could handle what I was after. Essentially, the hardest it needs to work is dealing with me uploading and editing GoPro footage/images. Outside of that, all it need to do is general computing. I don't play games. Ultimate goal - to have a machine that copes easily with what I use it for, but is otherwise very streamlined/minimal. Question - where do I go for advice on this? What sort of additional information do I need to provide? Should I "study up" on more technical matters? Should I strip the whole thing down and take the time to set it up properly from the start? Is there someone out there who'll get a kick out of doing this on my behalf? For those of you out there who are proficient in this field, I understand if you're sitting there reading this and banging your head on the desk. Please resist the temptation to publicly ridicule my lack of knowledge on this topic and know that any assistance/guidance will be greatly appreciated. **EDIT: TL/DR - I've got a computer that should run quite smoothly doing what I'm doing, but because I'm a tech-noob, it doesn't. Please help.**</TEXT>

It'll take a good 15-20 mins sometimes to get going from a hard shut-down. This generally improves as use-time increases, but I often throw in the towel before it finally ramps up to what I presume is full speed.  gt; How slow is slow? I don't know how to answer this... other than as per my response above re 15-20 start up... Hope this gives you an idea. And it's not all the time either... sometimes it's better (say, 5 mins) but it's never straight up and running. Oh, and the pop-up messaging from antivirus software, etc... that really grinds my gears!  gt; Also, you can swap out your 1TB drive for an SSD for $200 or so and add A LOT of performance to your computer. As mentioned in responding to /u/DoctorDbx, I had originally intended on getting a SSD as part of the build, but it wasn't cost-effective at the time. For $200 however, it certainly may be worth revisiting. Would switching this out be something that is easily doable with no experience, or would I be better off recruiting someone who knows their shiz?  gt; You can always re-install windows but it's generally a solution reserved for cases where you have exhausted the easier troubleshooting options.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2016-09-04 23:52:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Every year, I have a golf weekend away with mates. Every year, I show up with ridiculous golfing clothes. [This](http://loudmouth.my/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/6a00d8341caaef53ef017ee9c8e1a5970d.jpg) and [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3b/a9/39/3ba939874f5a6d3aefd8e39abc7ebbe6.jpg) is what I'm talking about from previous years... Sadly, this year, I haven't had a chance to source my over-the-top outfit, and I need something by Friday! My usual fail-safe is Victoria Park Pro Shop, but they've stopped stocking the really loud gear and only have options that are far too conservative. My other option is online, but I'm struggling to find somewhere that can get the goods to me in time. Does anyone happen to know anywhere in Brisbane that would stock something suitable? Alternatively, does anyone have anything that I could borrow/purchase? I'm looking for size 32 pants. **Edit** Crisis averted! I found an eBay seller "loudgolfpants' who offered next day click and collect. Sorted.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Advice sought for new home brewer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-10 03:14:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a beer lover, but new to home brewing, and live in Brisbane, Australia. I'm seeking some advice from those more experienced in the field as to how best to "ramp up" my brewing. Essentially, this request is seeking advice on two main fronts: 1. What and how should I look to be brewing to build up my knowledge/skill base? 2. What equipment should I look to be buying, and when? Don't want to heavily invest in everything straight up, but if it's important, I'm generally prepared to acquire it... within reason of course. To help you understand where I'm coming from: * Current equipment: 19L 'Cornelius' keg, incl. beer/gas lines and picnic dispenser; 2.6kg CO2 cylinder and regulator; primary and secondary fermenters; a dedicated beer fridge (approx 540L) that fits the keg and dispenser during consumption; and other ancillary equipment. * Brewing experience: currently brewing my second batch to keg. I did bottles years ago, but I'm done with that. First batch kegged was a simple extract kit ([Morgan's Blue Mountain Lager](http://morgansbrewing.com.au/products/beer-kits/)). Deliberately selected a simple canned brew just so I could get used to how all the keg and gas equipment worked... particularly when it came to forced carbonation. Turned out really nice and was perfect for our current hot weather, but lagers aren't typically my thing and I'm assuming these kits are pretty hard to screw up. I'm currently in the process of brewing my second batch, this time using grain and hops, but with a purchased fresh wort and a decent yeast. It's been fermenting for the past 4 days, and I plan on dry-hopping shortly, before cold crashing and force carbonating. * Location: I live in Brisbane - the capital of Queensland, Australia. It's getting quite hot here (current temp is 36 deg celsius/97 deg fahrenheit) and will continue to be hot until March/April next year. * Brewing goal: to eventually build a keezer and have 3 beers on tap :) So, knowing this, hit me with your advice! Should I look at getting a 2nd keg soon? Is controlling temperature during fermentation my primary objective right now? Should I brew a few more extract kits before getting involved with fresh worts? Should I jump straight in with the keezer build? If I've left out any important info, or you have any questions, just ask. I'd love to hear your advice on not only what to do next and down the line, but also what not to do :) Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Local printing/framing vs online service</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-11-22 11:41:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'd like to get my girlfriend a series of photos printed and framed... say, up to 4 prints. Having never had anything framed before, I've got no idea what I'll likely be up for. Have done a quick search of the thread and have found some local recommendations for framing from Redditors during years gone by. Apart from people advising that the price is "reasonable", "well priced" or "expensive", no details of cost are supplied. If I could deviate slightly from the standard request... can anyone offer any insight into how these local services compare with online options? For example, on frameshop.com.au, I can get a 23cm x 17cm photo print on metallic high gloss paper, framed with a 3cm deep raw timber frame, and delivered (from Sydney) for about $80. Thanks!</TEXT>

Just wondering if these manifolds can be easily reversed? Mine currently has the "gas in" from the left, and a plug on the right after the 4 valves. Can these be switched? It would work better for my set-up if i could get gas-in from the right hand side. I've sorta tried undoing them with a shifter, but they wont budge, and I don't want to break it. Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Places to work - Southside?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-05-12 01:40:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've just started a new gig, and the company is yet to set up an office space. We're a fairly mobile bunch, as about 50% of the time we'll be working in the clients' offices, and 50% is done remotely. To date, for the remote components I've primarily been working from home. While it's certainly not the worst working environment, I'd prefer to keep my workplace and home separate where possible. As such, have been trialing working from a few coffee shops, but have had limited success. I'm certainly not against buying a few coffees while I work, but the increased caffeine intake has been quite a shock to the digestive system. Also, I kinda feel guilty taking a table for hours at a time. Has anyone got any other suggestions for public work spaces that they particularly like? I did check to see what has been suggested previously, so am aware of Council libraries, State library, etc. Ideally, anyone got a spot in/around the Tarragindi/ Annerley/ Moorooka/ Yeronga/ Greenslopes area? The ideal spot would tick as many of the following requirements as possible: * reliable wifi * not super busy * access to power points * located south side If I've omitted any details, let me know!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Lost package - fight it or write it off</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-28 23:32:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's the situation: * International student living with me * Has ordered goods online to be delivered from China - basic electrical accessories with a combined value of ~$50. * Toll left an 'attempted delivery' card as signature was required * We arranged for re-delivery next day, with authority to leave granted, and signed card left in mailbox for collection by Toll. * Next day, card was collected from mailbox, but no package left. The student attempted to contact Toll to report the issue, but due to his pretty basic grasp of English, I've had to step in on his behalf when dealing with Toll Customer Support. Toll claim to have "launched an investigation" which involves them contacting the driver to get a confirmation as to where specifically the package was left. After multiple unfulfilled promises that I'd be called back that day/next day, I've finally just had them advise that they spoke to the driver and he claims to have left the package at the front door. Therefore, as I see it, either: * The package was left at the front door, but someone has stolen it; or * The package wasn't delivered, but the card was taken from the mailbox (unlikely). Here are my questions: 1. Any other possibilities? 2. Now what? Tough luck, or insist that this is Toll's issue to solve?</TEXT>

BUT, I once had a driver call me (as my mobile number was visible in the delivery info) as he was at my front door. He said I could text him through the words "authority to leave" to the number he was calling from and he'd use that as evidence to leave the package. He said he was running a little ahead of schedule and figured he'd call to save me having to pick up from the depot or arrange a re-delivery. Nice guy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AUSTRALIA: Automatic garage door maintenance</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-29 08:09:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I purchased a house about 18 months ago. It has two separate single car garages, and each has an automatic, single-panel, tilt-lift style door running on a B amp;D branded motor. When the doors are opened, a 'courtesy light' turns on, illuminating the garage for approx. 5 mins. This week, the courtesy light on one of the doors began flashing on and off about 10 times each time the door was opened. After a bit of googling, I think this may suggest that it's reached a certain number of openings (3,000 perhaps?) and is apparently due for a service. Does anyone know anything about this? Having owned the property for the past 18 months, I've got no idea when the doors were installed or when, if ever, they were last serviced. After some further googling, I've read some stories of people getting a maintenance person over to do the service and getting charged upwards of $100 for what was apparently only a few minutes work. Is the maintenance of these things even that crucial?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone know of any good computer sales currently going, post-EOFY?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-04 01:20:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>I need a new laptop for work, and it needed to be purchased this financial year, so couldn't get amongst any of the EOFY sales from the past few weeks. Ultimately, I'm pretty sure I'm chasing an 'ultrabook'. Not too fussed about the brand in particular, but it needs to be Windows OS (i.e. not a Macbook). The following are my top 3 factors when selecting a machine: * Battery life - as long as possible. I'll be taking this thing from meeting to meeting, and I also work remotely as well. Don't always have the luxury of plugging in, so need to be able to get at least 7 or 8 hours use in between charges. * Light-weight - as per above, this thing needs to come with me everywhere, so the lighter the better. But, because its primarily a work machine, I'd like a decent keyboard (as opposed to a clip on thing that turns a tablet into a laptop). On the topic - a back-lit keyboard would be nice, but not essential. * Solid state drive - 128GB minimum. Budget max is ~$1700, and I should be fine sticking to an i5 processor. I'm not super-literate when it comes to computers, so if I've omitted any key info, let me know. Also, I'm not expecting anyone to do the hunting for me (but more than happy if you'd like to) - I'm just hoping to be pointed in the right direction for good value. Ideally, I'd like to get something in the next week or so, but if you feel it's worth holding out for something - say an upcoming sale or a new model release, let me hear about it! Cheers!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who are the hiking/bushwalking experts on here? I recall plenty of you being quite helpful when it's come to providing recommendations/advice about local trails in the past, but I just can't remember who in particular? My GF wants us to do an overnight hike this Friday/Saturday along a particular component of 'The Great Walk', but isn't sure on the particulars. I think she had O'Reillys to perhaps Binna Burra in mind? Essentially after something that will be over 2 days, involve camping, and at least 5hrs walk each day? Also struggling logistically - do we return to the same point, or go from A to B (and then work out a way to travel back to the parked vehicle at A)? Any advice greatly appreciated!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I completely agree with everything you and u\Blunt1nstrument say regarding the Mac's physical form, battery excellence and longevity of life, but I can't seem to get around these 2 sticking points: 1. I'm pretty anti-Apple. Have been for a long time. I don't have anything else that fits into the Apple ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, etc). For what it's worth, my boss has a Macbook Air (along with everything else Apple) and he easily gets through the day doing everything I need to be able to do. In my search, I've even resorted to searching things like "best alternatives to Macbook Air", etc... 2. I'm not super into computers - I just need one that will work when I want it too and to the standard I want it too. Having to dual-boot Windows onto a Mac sounds like it will take a bit of know-how and ongoing tech management... right?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks again for such a detailed response. Have read through what you've provided (multiple times) and think that we might try and stick to the Gold Coast Hinterland Great Walk this time - but will keep your advice above handy for future trips. Here's where we are currently at: - Have Friday and Saturday free, but need to be back in Brisbane by 8:30am Sunday morning. Therefore, we realistically can only do a 2 day walk, and this doesn't take into account travel on Friday. - We're both pretty fit, and have done a decent amount of hiking in the past, but certainly not something we do frequently. - Similar to you, not super keen on camping in established "car-camps"... defeats the point of carrying your stuff! - Given the above, probably can't make use of any shuttle, so will need to do a loop/out-and-back... unless we could Uber or something??? What do you think it would be like if we did the Woonoongoora section (24km) and potentially the Waringa Pool section (9km) of the GCH Great Walk? That is, start at Binna Burra (easily accessible and can leave the car there) and walk through to the Woonoogoora Walkers' Camp. Depending on when we get there and how we feel, we could either: (a) keep walking all the way through the next section and stay the Friday night at The Settlement Camp; (b) set up camp at Woonoogoora Walkers' Camp, but make a short out-and-back walk somewhere (e.g. Little Nerang Creek); or (c) just call it a day and crack open a flask of wine at Woonoogoora Walkers' Camp after setting up. Obviously, Saturday would involve retracing the same path from wherever we camped, which isn't ideal but necessary in the absence of an appropriately sized loop. As for accommodation on Saturday evening, I guess we'd have to pick between staying in the Binna Burra private camp ground or just jumping in the car and heading back to Brisbane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Took your advice and hiked the Border Track from Binna Burra to O'Reillys. Set out in the wet from BB on Friday, and walked all day through the cloud and fog. Got into BB about 6.5hrs later and set up in the walker's camp. Nice spot. Given the cloud/fog, we didn't see squat along the entire length of the Border Track, so when we woke to a lovely clear day on Saturday, we decided to retrace our steps and get everything we missed out on. Some great lookouts! Overall, much tougher than we were anticipating, but we are putting some of that down to the very wet weather. Still, very enjoyable, and look forward to returning and doing a few more of the other trails. Thanks again for all your help!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-08-13 07:00:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've been using an old hand-me-down Briggs  amp; Stratton mower from my dad for the past few years. He'd bought it new, 30 years ago. Whipped it out this afternoon, refueled, checked the oil, and fired her up. Just like always, she starts on the 2nd pull. Sadly, within 90 seconds, something went bang and oil started pissing out everywhere. I'm not mechanically-minded, but it looked like a piston/rod issue. Regardless, she's toast, and certainly wasn't worth trying to fix. I've just returned from the dump where she was unceremoniously handed over the the recycling station. As such, I'm chasing a new one. Don't mind dropping a bit of coin, particularly if it'll last 30 years like this one did. Have heard good things about the Honda 4 stroke options. Don't really want anything from Bunnings either as would prefer to get it from a mower centre who does servicing etc. FWIW, I'm located in Moorooka, but don't mind driving across town if it means dealing with a good operator and/or getting a good deal.</TEXT>

According to the catalogue that I received in the letterbox today, Coles have [this one](https://shop.coles.com.au/a/a-national/product/telstra--prepaid-mf910v-4gx-wifi) at 50% off, making it $30. Comes with 3GB to be used in 30 days. So that'll sort him out for the first month - I presume he could just recharge with prepaid data for the remaining 3 months? We have unlimited wifi at home, and he will have access to the same while at uni (UQ). So really, data will only be needed for when he's on the bus our out in the city, etc. He reckons 5GB/month would be heaps. Does this seem like a decent option. Any better ones you'd care to throw our way?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys. I've got a birthday coming up and my girlfriend has offered to get me a new board. Looking for your recommendations... Info: * I surf mainly on the Gold Coast, Australia. * I'm 182cm (6'0") and 82kg (181lbs). * Looking for something to ride in the smaller sloppy waves typically experienced in Spring and Summer here. * Would like to fill the gap between my Primitive MVP and my Chilli Peri Peri. * Primitive MVP - 6'6" x 21 3/8 x 2 7/8 (not sure of litres, but a lot!) - I can ride this easily in smaller surf, but think that I've progressed beyond it. I'm struggling to improve my turns on this, mainly due to it's bulk I think. * Chilli Peri Peri - 6'1" x 19 3/8 x 2 1/2 (30 litres) - This is a touch light for me. It needs to be perfect surf for me to ride properly, but I love how much better it is to turn and duck dive. * Overall, I'm probably an advanced kook... not quite intermediate yet. Have been surfing for about 6 years. Hit me with your recommendations!</TEXT>

It's basically a big bush-doof held out in the sticks. Really great spot actually. Punters camp out, and it's all BYO! THAT"S RIGHT, A BYO MUSIC FESTIVAL!!! There's multiple stages set up, as well as weird little "artistic areas". There's also a river running right through the middle of the place, so you can just chill in the river and listen to bands/nurse your hangover. Prepare yourself for bulk nudity though. The spray-painted bikes are actually provided for free use over the festival. You simply pick up a bike, ride it to the stage/your tent/anywhere on the grounds, and then leave it for the next person to use.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best cycling shops in Brisbane</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-30 12:14:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So, with a new job back in the CBD this year, I'm back to commuting daily by bicycle after being car-bound for about 18 months. Despite the fact I ride a single speed, I really enjoy the challenge of keeping up with everyone, so my ~8.5km ride each morning and evening is quite a workout. Prior to my recent car communting stint, for 6 years of commuting by bicycle, the only cycle-specific gear I wore were a pair of [Fox mountain bike shorts](https://www.foxracing.com/store/product/_/A-product-18453..catalog10001.en__US.plist20002__plist20001.001) with a detachable padded liner and a pair of [Chrome](https://www.chromeindustries.com/product/truk-pro-bike-shoe/FW-124.html?dwvar_FW-124_color=WRGM amp;cgid=bike_shoes) clip in shoes. I literally wore these 5 days a week. I've been reading up lately and, because my current shorts and shoes are on their last legs, and I've since learnt the proper washing procedures for the shorts, I'm actually considering converting to full cycling kit. Yep - lycra tops and bottoms, proper shoes, the full she-bang. Normally, I'd just buy this sort of stuff online, but I think I want to head into a store, chat to someone knowledgeable about it, try a few things on, make sure I don't completely regret the look/feel of turning full [MAMIL](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mamil amp;oq=mamil amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.928j0j4 amp;sourceid=chrome amp;ie=UTF-8), etc. Happy to spend the money if the quality is good. Will likely purchase subsequent gear online if and when required. So, who's got the inside scoop on the best cycling store in Brisbane? Looking for quality gear, quality advice, decent range to choose from, and if possible, inner-south (but not a must).</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-02-06 03:55:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>Putting the call out to other wearers of RM Williams boots. In Brisbane, I find it too hot to wear them through the middle of summer, so for the past 6 or 7 years, they've been shelved between November and March. Today however, I thought I'd give them a go... While it's not *overly* hot today, it's warm enough. And coupled with the fact I haven't worn them for a few months, they're not super comfortable right now. I run pretty hot generally speaking, and sweat far more than the average Brisbarian (?). As such, I can't wear a thinner sock with them, because when the leather and boot combines with my clammy foot, squeaking results on every step. I typically combat this by pairing them with a thicker "Explorer" style sock, or football sock. This returns me to the original predicament... too hot for summer. So, my question to fellow Brisbarian RM Williams wearing folk... what socks do you wear with them and/or are these boots climatically discriminated against?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yep, shoes are currently off. Side story: About 9 years ago at a previous employer, I was pulled up by the Health  amp; Safety Officer for wearing shorts and thongs on casual Fridays. It was an office environment and I only wore these if I didn't have any client meetings. He tried to tell me that thongs were a H amp;S issue, but I pointed out a number of female colleagues wearing thin, strappy sandals. He and I had got along well, so he called me into his office, closed the door and said "honestly, you just look like a massive bogan".</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Travel insurance recommendations for Bali</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-20 01:06:47</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm on holidays next week! Cashing in on the run of Easter public holidays and knicking off to Bali for the first time. Just looking for recommended travel insurance companies that specifically cover Bali-specific shenanigans typically experienced - I'm thinking inclusions for motorbike riding, and any issues related to travel delays resulting from volcano/cyclones/etc. Only heading to Seminyak and Ubud (i.e. NOT going to Kuta for the bleach cocktails) and will be back in a week. I've done a heap of travel before, but this'll be my first time to Bali. My usual go-to is 1-Cover, but their quote came back a little steeper than I was anticipating and figured I'd ask if anyone here has had any first hand experience in using another insurer.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Seeking advice - Roasted Ginger Amber Ale</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-03 07:58:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's getting cooler here in Australia, so it's "winter beer" time. Currently have the Smoked Chocolate Porter finishing up in the fermenter, and looking to brew a Roasted Ginger Amber Ale next. Haven't done this myself before, but have helped out a mate doing one previously... only his was using full set-up (3 vessel) whereas I'm BIAB. From previous experience helping him out, I know how to add the ginger - oven roast whole ginger root (low and slow); add some wort to a bucket; blitz the root into the wort using a stick mixer; re-introduce into rest of wort. I'm seeking advice as to when would be best to re-introduce the ginger... kinda in a similar vein as when to add hops. End goal is to have an amber ale with ginger flavour, as opposed to a ginger beer. Thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-05-16 06:36:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>Work team building activities have been a little dry lately. I'm not passionate enough to join the organising committee, but hoping to casually drop a couple of suggestions to a work friend who is. Looking for suggestions that are potentially a little "left-of-centre" - e.g not looking for the usual Strike Bowling, escape rooms, treasure hunt themes. Apparently they were looking into clay pigeon shooting, but it was rejected given we'd be using "real guns" at a shooting range. Will need to cater for approx 30 people. Budget is not set, but perhaps use $50-100 per person as a guide. Activities could take place for up to half a day, and/or push into the evening. Let me know if you've got any ideas, previous experiences or suggestions!</TEXT>

Given the keys and earbuds were tangled, it's pretty evident that they've simply dropped out of someone's bag/pocket. Key ring contains one car key, one motorcycle key (I think) and an automatic garage door opener. There's also a small metal tag with a 5 digit number stamped on it, but no other identifying elements. Firstly, if they're yours, more than happy to return them to you if you can adequately describe (identify the make of the car, bike, opener, earbuds, etc). Secondly, failing the above, what should I do with them? Post this up somewhere else and hold onto them for a certain amount of time? Hand them in to BCC? Police Station? If so, does it matter which station?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Have done a search of the website, but haven't found any details confirming or denying this... The night noodle markets are sponsored by Citibank, and have been for a number of years. In previous years, I used to be able to simply flash my Citibank credit card to gain access to the reserved seating area. According to the website, this year's edition is totally cashless and all major cards are accepted. I've heard rumors, however, that the prices are different - depending on whether you use a Citi card or a different card. Has anyone been and can confirm or deny? Is this even legal? Not that I really care, I'm just interested. FWIW, I no longer have active Citibank accounts, but have just help on to the card for the markets :)</TEXT>

Last time I was there (about 10 years ago) I used a pretty high percentage deet product that came in a stick - like a glue stick - and it was bright green. I also used this in the jungle in South America and found it brilliantly effective against both mosquitoes and ticks. Now that the Camping/Army Disposal store has closed down in the CBD, does anyone know of anywhere else I could go to pick some up? I'll try Kathmandu store, but hoping there will be other options.</TEXT>

The only two downsides I really experienced were (1) availability of on-street parking, and (2) how easy it was to unnecessarily spend money eating out. Both are easily managed: (1) Ensure that wherever you end up renting has sufficient reserved parking spaces for you and your girlfriend. Keep in mind that there may appear to be a heap of on-street parking, but you'll soon find that these are highly sought after by tradies working at nearby (or even not-so-nearby) construction sites. They're more than happy to show up from 4am every morning and sleep for an hour or so in their utes before starting work just to ensure they nab the space. (2) Just have a bit of discipline. Turns out I've got a bit of a rubber elbow.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-01-07 21:04:09</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've noticed that we seem to have a heap of bakers on here. A quick question to you all ... My partner and I make 48 savoury muffins a week - 3 each for breakfast each morning. These are baked twice a week using 2 x "non-stick" muffin tins. We're on our second set of these, as each time after about 6-8 months of use, they lose their non-stick qualities and cleaning becomes a real bich. So the question... With ease of cleaning in mind, what's the best type of tins/trays to use? Anyone had experience with the silicone ones? Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure. It's basically a quasi-scrambled eggs... in muffin form for convenience. * Grease a 12-cup tray. * Dice up whatever you want/have available and throw in the cups. I typically add some ham/bacon, onion, mushroom, capsicum and feta cheese. Just make sure nothing's bigger than say, a cubic cm? * In a bowl, scramble 12 eggs. If you're using the XXL eggs, may only need about 10. * Pour into trays until each cup is full. Can be messy to begin with, but you get the hang of it once you work out how fast to pour and how much of the other contents you've already added. * Sprinkle with some grated tasty cheese. * Whack in the oven until cheese is lovely and golden brown. Generally about 20-25 mins. I just chuck them all in a big tupperware container in the fridge and whip 3 out for breakfast in the morning. About 1:20 mins in the microwave seems to work well when reheating for me. I started eating these each morning as a way of limiting carbs in my diet while still eating something tasty and filling. Honestly thought I'd get sick of them everyday, but 12 months in I'm still loving them each morning.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Planning a wedding - how to calculate drinks?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-23 00:40:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm getting married in a couple of months. Reception venue has BYO licence, so I'm providing all the drinks. I'm not worried about *what* to serve (I'm a bit of a beer fiend and love the fact that I can have literally whatever I want ), but rather *how much* I'll need. I'm aware that if I buy from a Dan Murphy's/First Choice/etc, I'll be able to return unopened cartons so happy to over-cater rather than fall short, but I'd still like to get a decent idea so that I'm somewhere in the ballpark for budgeting purposes (i.e. how high in terms of quality, and therefore costs, I can go). Have tried three different online "event drink calculators" and have got three very different results. For example, using the parameters of: Event length - 6hrs No. of guests - 100 Beverages to be served - beer, wine, sparkling. Have received the following results: * Beer (cartons) - 13; Wine (bottles) - 60 red and 60 white; Sparkling (bottles) - 60. * Beer (cartons) - 15; Wine (bottles) - 25 red and 25 white; Sparkling (bottles) - 30. * Beer (cartons) - 30; Wine (bottles) - 20 red and 20 white; Sparkling (bottles) - 20. So I turn to you guys... has anyone recently done this themselves and have a particular calculator that they used which worked well. Any other methods I can use to calculate this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's pretty clear that you guys love animals. It's also pretty clear that between many of you, there's a literal shit-ton of knowledge. My fiance and I are finally getting our puppy this weekend :) It'll be the first pet that either of us have had since childhood (i.e. over 15 years). While some things remain constant, and others are just common sense, there are no doubt many things that have changed since we were last responsible for another living creature. And there's possibly a couple of things that we've forgotten about... So, to all you pet veterans out there, hit me up with your best tips /tricks /warnings /advice. The way I see it, the more we know, the better. Anything from recommended puppy schools, vets to avoid, best places to purchase food, tips on toilet training. If you think it's worth us knowing, I'll gladly accept the advice. By way of background, he's a Bordoodle (border collie x poodle) and will be 8 weeks old. Yet to be named :)</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Recommendations for cakes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-21 06:04:56</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey all, I'm getting married in a couple of weeks. While we're not having a "wedding cake", we will be having multiple cakes being served to guests for desert. We had planned on getting 3 large cakes from Pearl Cafe in Woolloongabba, as we'd previously bought delicious cakes from them in the past. We approached them a few months ago, and they advised it wouldn't be a problem. They did, however, ask us to contact them a week or so prior to the event as this will dictate what options they have. My partner has been trying to get hold of them over the past few days, and has today been advised that they won't be able to do anything for us as their pastry chef will be away on holidays. Does anyone have any recommendations for alternatives that will be suitable for a wedding (keeping in mind, we're not after a traditional "wedding cake", but rather multiple high-quality cakes). Thanks!</TEXT>

Back in the day, I'd just bag it with a plastic bag so if it leaked, who cares... dump the bag and use a new one tomorrow.

    <TEXT>I think that a backpack would be too rigid, subsequently limiting what you can squeeze in. I'd be going for more of a "sack" option - some sort of large plastic/mesh bag. Maybe something like a big mesh laundry bag with a drawstring that you could throw over your shoulder. Or, if you're a little handy, could always stitch a single strap to it and carry it like a duffel bag (or two and make your own backpack)?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>CBD lunchtime running groups?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-12 04:37:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was walking down along the riverside below Eagle St today an noticed a lot of runners all heading in the same direction - from Story Bridge toward Botanical Gardens. Figured they may have been a corporate group or something similar, but they weren't wearing the same shirts or anything like that. Perhaps it was a training group for an upcoming event. They may well have all been randoms, but this is unlikely given the sheer number of them ( gt;50) and the fact that there were so many all running in the same direction (at least 10x as many as those running in the other direction). It got me thinking that I may like to join a lunch-time running group. I got back to the office and have had a bit of a google, but the only groups I found were those that run in the evenings. Is anyone aware of a social running group in Brisbane CBD that run at lunchtimes?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Seeking a new family GP, inner south.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-11 20:03:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>TLDR: Seeking a kid-friendly GP in and around Moorooka. Morning all, seeking any recommendations on a new GP for my newly expanded family. My wife and I had our first child last week - all went went and she's settling in with us nicely so far. Prior to pregnancy, we rarely visited the GP. We've had the same "ok" GP for about a decade, who we originally saw out of pure locational convenience when we were living in Fortitude Valley. Given the infrequent reliance on GO services over the past 10 years, we've such with him. We now live in Moorooka, with a newborn. With two GP visits under our belt thus far (and plenty more to come), we've realised that it's a real ball-ache traipsing in and out of the CBD all the time, and also that he's not really that good a GP, particularly with kids. With this in mind, would love to know if you've got a particularly good, family friendly GP, located within a suitable distance from Moorooka. We've got an excellent vet for our dog within walking distance from home, so we really should extend this opportunity to our daughter ;) Not fussed whether male or female. Must be good with kids. Thanks legends, and happy Thursday to all!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've got the Gen 1 Xiaomi (sans mop). Love it. It does my entire 3 bed hardwood floor postwar house twice a week, and fills the reservoir every time. I run it on max, and it covers about 85sqm each time on a single charge. The only complaint is that about 3 months ago it lost the ability to connect with the app, thus losing quite a bit of functionality. It then subsequently also reverted back to the Mandarin voice pack. To be fair, I haven't invested a lot of time to troubleshooting the issue, as I can simply press a single button and it'll vac the whole house before returning to the dock to charge. Over had it about three years and it's still going strong. Further, three relative's households have purchased one since.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sequencing of works/renovations</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-05 04:51:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>Bought our place in Brisbane 4 years ago: a 3-bed, 2-bath, 2-car post-war (1951 built) house. Would have loved to have access to this sub right from the start, but better late than never. Having lived in the place 4 years and with the "vital" works now out of the way (new colourbond roof, full interior paint job, and new electrical throughout) we're now looking ahead and pulling together ideas on the future works we'd like to get stuck into over the next 5ish years. These include (in no particular order): * Solar panel install * New hot water system (current electric unit is 20+ years old and unreliable) * Kitchen renovation (quite small and dated with poor layout) * Laundry renovation (requires a fit-out as currently just a bare room with a shower, toilet, sink and washing machine... no benches or storage). * Extension (most likely build up) to add another couple of bedrooms and another bathroom * Backyard landscaping (predominantly level and turf). Seeking advice from those in the know... is it important to sequence the above in a certain order, or should they all be treated independently? For example, have received multiple quotes and selected my solar system and provider/installer. I can sign the contract tomorrow and get it underway, but should I be considering the fact that we may be adding a second storey at some time in the next 5 years, so any work undertaken for the solar install will need to be re-done? Or should I get my hot water system replaced before looking at solar? Any advice or discussion is welcomed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was my thoughts. But assuming that there will be 5 years (or more) until the level up occurs, just wondering if it's still potentially viable to get the solar system installed prior? Acknowledging that there will be some additional labour necessary for the second and final install on the solar once level 2 is up, is it even possible to uninstall and then reinstall the rooftop components of an existing system?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Why did you replace the roof if you're getting a second storey put on? The roof was replaced under the previous owner's insurance following a localised storm a couple of months before I purchased the property. So effectively a brand new roof when I purchased.  #8203;  gt; Anyway, as far as solar goes, I wouldn't touch it until the second storey is on. You can move the panels if you get it done beforehand, but one of the biggest expenses for solar is oddly labour, so it'll probably come out pretty costly either way. Certainly more expensive than the money you'd save from solar power. Perfect - this was the clarification I was looking for.  #8203;  gt; Personally, I'd probably put in the hot water first, as it won't change from having a second storey and inconsistent or poor access to hot water when having a shower is such a blow to your quality of life. Noted, and I think I agree with you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If you plan on adding a second story, dont put in solar for a while. The return on investment for solar is 10+ years, so having to remove and re-install (even the same panels) will eat into that ROI. Thanks for the input. Interestingly, the numbers I ran based on quotes I received and my typical energy use suggested that the ROI for me would be closer to 5 years, but I'll go back and re-evaluate this.  gt;I would consider doing kitchen and laundry together, that way you can match the styles and cabinetmaking can all be done at once, ect. Yep, that's the way I was thinking, but glad to get some aligned feedback.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In the product description, it says: "... disassembles into a slim, flat package #160;taking up minimal space, while #160;providing the safest and most practical way to achieve elevated work." How easily is it packed down. Something that needs to be significantly disassembled between uses for storage or is it pretty straightforward?</TEXT>
