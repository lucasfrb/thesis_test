    <TEXT>I just went through some of my darkest days in life last year. I got seperated from my friends, got so many backlogs, and boom... every little problems came to my visions as an unsolvable one. I managed going through it smoking weed. Last month, I went to my parents.. didn't smoke there, ofcourse. Coming back after a month of tolerance break, I smoked weed and started feeling as low as I was feeling last year. I even rented a flat with my homies. But there is always that one asshole in your group, well I have one in mine too.. always takes my clothes to wear, whenever we go out, he dosent have money.. so I have to pay for everything he eats with me . I can't directly say this to his face .... What should I do? How can I handle the situation?!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Writing with tears in my eyes.</TITLE>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone. I am 20 rn and in my final year of college. I have quit and its been more than a month now. I am really proud of myself that I took this decision despite all of my friends still smoke daily. But the problem here is that ,in the last whole sober month, I barely smiled or had been myself. I am just too scared to face my relatives, my friends, everyone. I am never in a good mood. It's like I don't even remember when did I crack my last joke or said something funny in front of my friends. I can't even make normal conversations with my friends anymore . And most of the time I sit silent and I don't know what to say. And the biggest problem( it's more of a shock) is that, as I started studying for my Mid semester exams, I am slowly realising that I can't remember shit not can I form sentences properly. It is like I have lost my learning skills. And my vocab to.( I am writing this message since a 10 mins as I have to think overwhelmingly what to write). My past: I was excellent in studies( topped whole district in my 12th grade). social skills - not bad. My grades in freshman year were also above 8(out of 10) .Coming in 2nd year college, all my friends started smoking weed and met these two "so called" stoner guys. We enjoyed smoking with them and gradually in a month or two, We all started smoking daily. I was a chronic smoker for 2 years,(except for vacations which were a month in between every sem) I smoked everyday. And didn't realise that my grades became very low. I even failed in 5 subjects last year(so I did quit weed for 3 month then, I fell in depression) . After somehow clearing the subjects with "JUST PASSING MARKS" I started smoking again as I was like I deserve this after so much hard work. And my depression vanished. I became the funniest guy in last six month. I was not living the life as I had wanted to live, but I was always happy, cracking jokes, in full power. Even hooked up with some out of my range girls( imagine my confidence) . And again I failed 7 subjects. But after the last vacation, before a month, I have finally quit for good. (Cold turkey) and I am in a major depression now as I think, I will never get my learning abilities back, and will never become as smart and confident as before. Nor will get the social skills which I had just 2 months ago. Plus, I have 7 backs to clear while I can't fucking study. I remain seated reading and trying to remember the theories but I don't remember what to write just 1 hr after in exams. Please someone tell me, Is this damage to brain permanent?! I don't know this version of me! Did I really become this dumb moron ?!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why is the head in linked list , a pointer?!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-14 07:42:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I mean, i tried creating a linked list with head variable as a normal struct node. It runs as well. The problem is , in this case, if i add another node (after i have defined head in the code) , it does not show in output. But is works fine if head is a pointer And why use pointer for head at all. I understand that using a pointer for "next" is necessary or the structure size will not be defined. But why is head a pointer. Help. (Both codes are in the file attached)[codes for ref.](https://we.tl/t-cWNMkuxl0A)</TEXT>
