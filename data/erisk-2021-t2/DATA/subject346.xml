That's the kind of character you would build for a male, but notice how she's not the best of the best of the best. Not a Mary Sue, just an enthusiast who's pretty good at her job. She doesn't have to be a super genius who graduated at the top of her class. Probably not the Federation flagship, more like DS9 or Voyager. Why not make her 40+ and a very nice person that everybody likes, but a little introverted so she's been shrugging off promotions for years to stay out of command in engineering? Maybe she has to take command once in a while like Scotty, but she hates it. Contrast to Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. She's not super powerful or super angry, bent on revenge against all the dirty MEN who told her she wasn't good enough or tried to flirt with her. Nobody held her back. She went into engineering because she liked it. I had female engineering classmates over thirty years ago. Nobody was holding them back or telling them they weren't good enough because they were girls.</TEXT>

I'm a simple living FIRE early retiree, without doubt in the best time of my life. I was more bagging on the status-materialistic consumption habits of my former coworkers. They wanted big houses and furniture etc. to match. All I wanted was my freedom. So I mostly saved instead of spending. Nowadays I mountain bike and XC ski constantly. If I'm home, like today, it's probably because my muscles are fried and I need a rest day. A couple of days ago I was working on one of my bikes and snapped off a Torx wrench. It kind of bothered me because I've had that wrench for a long time and kept it in good condition. Then I remembered I've had it since the 1980s, so I've had my use from it and it's easily replaced. I admit I'm probably too attached to the material possessions I already have, although I don't care about impressing others and I'm not that motivated to be always upgrading everything. Nobody's perfect. We're all just figuring it out as we go. What to care about? What to ignore because the benefit isn't worth the cost, even though lots of people kneel before those altars?</TEXT>

Is she really into technology or does she just want to be captain someday; Lower Decks-style trying really hard to be the best of the best of the best? Does Michael Burnham care about technology or is she just better than everyone at everything? How about Jet Reno? I couldn't stay with STD to the end of season two, but isn't she smarter and better than everyone, and very angry that anyone could doubt that? Spock is definitely a Marty Stu, but what about Scotty and McCoy? Both good at their jobs, but are they the best of the best of the best, and with a huge chip on their shoulders that anyone could doubt that? No, they just get on with their jobs the best they can. Actually B'Elanna Torres is an example of a competent female engineer without a chip on her shoulder, way back in the 1990s. She's an angry Klingon generally, but she's not angry about gender issues in the 24th century. Maybe that's why STD seems so *off* in its politics. Decades ago we had women doing anything and everything on starships, being role models for little girls, and nobody thought it was big deal. I didn't care too much at all that Janeway, Torres, and Seven were constantly saving the day twenty years ago. I didn't think much about their gender or race, or think they were Mary Sues. They were just good interesting characters. What's changed? Why everybody so angry now?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just re-tired (get it?) the last of my tubeless wheels and went back to tubes + Slime on all my bikes because I was tired of fooling with it. Not "Slime tubes", you get [presta tubes with removable cores](https://www.amazon.com/Continental-Presta-Valve-Inner-Tubes/dp/B07892S41N) and just squirt it in like with tubeless. I kept having to pump up the last tubeless tire (others converted back to tubes last season) every time I rode even if it was just 24 hours later. Pretty sure it was the rim tape that failed, because I could see sealant leaking out of the rim seam. I was using 1" Gorilla Tape and the adhesive eventually failed after swimming in Stans for several months. Anyway, that's all in the past now. Tubes + Slime have been very very reliable for me for decades, and I don't have to carry an extra tube for sidewall rips because the tube will hold pressure long enough to get me back to the car. It happened twice last season: Tube + Slime I rode out. Tubeless I didn't have a spare tube with me so had to push it out a mile. It would have been a huge mess and hassle putting a tube into a tire full of sealant on the trail anyway. By the way last season I also had to patch a leak on one of my tubeless wheels with a bacon strip. Believe or not, I've never had to stop and patch a leak on a tubes + Slime wheel. Also I only have to add sealant in the tubes about once a year, and Slime is less than half the cost of Stans. /u/ponds666 check out this comment</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I would say get some Stans and ride those on trails for a while, then when it's time to replace your tires go from your own experience with tubeless. If you've had a lot of fiddling and failures like me, go back to tubes + Slime, or continue tubeless if it's been foolproof for you. Just wanted to throw the tubes + Slime option out there because everywhere on the internet people are like, "Bruh, you gotta go tubeless. The sealant makes it more reliable!", like there's no other way to have sealant in your tires. I even asked a bike shop mechanic last season when I having troubles, "Why is everyone going tubeless? Why not just put Slime in your tubes?" He thought about it for a moment and said, "Because if you get a puncture in your tube, some Slime will leak out and make a mess inside your tire."

I think she snapped at somebody for admiring how she figured out how to treat patients as an engineer, so I put her in the same category as [Brie Larson's](https://i.imgflip.com/49ibax.jpg) angry Captain Marvel. Remember this was right after they violently murdered the ["mansplainer" character](https://i.imgur.com/yfVUM4G.gif) for mildly annoying Michael Burnham. *As if* anyone could ever be 1% as smart as her!</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; As far as nobody thinking it was a big deal, when Voyager launches there were endless full page spreads in TV Guide and the like. And endless complaints online as well. I remember the complaints of her being a bad captain because she was a woman. Kurtzman says that too, to support his assertion that all his critics are manchild alt right sexists and racists. But I was around back then watching new Voyager episodes as they came out and I don't remember any great uproar of woman hating when Janeway was going to be a woman. Jonathan Frakes also says that, but (coincidence, really!) he's also earning money working on the current shows. Frakes also said TNG was good but then DS9 and VOY and ENT wore out the franchise. Sorry Mr. Frakes, those are some people's favorite shows. There was barely any internet back then, and I didn't subscribe to any fan magazines at that time so not sure. Maybe there was some backlash on [Usenet newsgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) but I never saw it. Maybe I'm just not instinctively a sexist or racist (I also thought Paul Fieg's all female Ghostbusters sounded interesting). I'm tired of all the political axe grinding to cover up for bad storytelling by people who don't understand why Trek has been popular for half a century and want to make it Fast and the Furious *in Space!*. I saw somebody describe it as Trek for wine moms and footballers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; proper tubeless ready rims My rims were tubeless ready. The rim tape on that last rim failed after several months, but I think last season the tubeless tires were also losing pressure through small pinholes in the sidewalls.  gt; with very thin XC tyres you have to put a bit more sealant in the first time(or use thicker sealant) to prevent the air slowly escaping through the tyre wall. Yes! I forgot about the sealant leaking out through the sidewalls. I was trying it on some first generation WTB Trailblazers and a Maxxis Igniter XC tire, all of which had very thin walls. My sidewall rips were on two of the Trailblazers and one Igniter. The last tubeless tire I just retired was a WTB "tough" casing tire, which fixed the [sidewall weeping](https://www.mtbnj.com/forum/attachments/mvimg_20180319_103312-jpg.65680/) issue, but it was much heavier. I actually weighed that 27.5 wheel before and after conversion: 2.8 WTB Vigilante tough, fast rolling, tubeless w/ Stans: 6 lb 3.8 oz 2.5 Maxxis DHF EXO casing, tubes + Slime: 5 lb 14.2 oz So going with WTB Tough or Maxxis Double Down to stop the weeping is not a good solution. I realize comparing a 2.8 to a 2.5 is apples and oranges, but I kept the old 2.8s in case I need them for something. 2.8 WTB Trailblazer, light casing: 1 lb 15.1 oz 2.8 WTB Vigilante, tough casing: 2 lb 12.1 oz New plus size tube with no sealant: 12.7 oz So weight-wise, it was slightly lighter to go with tube + Slime in a light casing tire, than tubeless in a thick casing tire to get roughly the same sidewall reliability.  gt; you can't really run tubes+slime at really low pressures because they will still pinch flat On my 2.5s with tubes + Slime I'm currently running 25 in the back, 22 in the front. Seems to be working OK. I've mostly run tubes + Slime my whole adult cycling career and never had a pinch flat, but I don't do big freeride-style jumps and drops, just big sharp rocks on natural trails. Also I just remembered, last season during my tubeless experiments I had a tread puncture on one of the tubeless tires that held just fine on the trail. Then I bought it home and parked the bike in my living room and at some point the seal failed and the pressure pushed out a five inch puddle of Stans on my living room carpet. I scrubbed it and scrubbed it, but you can still see the stain. Of course I never had any failures like that with tubes + Slime, because everything is contained in the tire.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Tuvok being a black Vulcan made no sense. Funny, I even remember my reaction to Tuvok being a black guy *25 years ago*: "Huh, he must be from equatorial Vulcan. Makes sense!" For the record, Tuvok is my favorite Vulcan character so far. He's an inner, barely controlled rageaholic. He started in Starfleet as a science officer, then came back 80 years later as a security officer when he knew himself better. That's a fascinating well written backstory for a Vulcan character. He was only our second regular Vulcan cast member after Spock. Remember when he meets the disturbed full Betazoid ensign Suder, then stupidly tries to mindmeld with him, which messes him up and makes his rage much harder to control? Great stuff. Well anyway, I think Kurtzman and Frakes and Chabon et al are wrong that 100% of their critics are sexists and racists. I like so many of the diverse characters of the past. If Kurtzman, Chabon, et al would stop clapping back and *change their writing* they might have something. They're too insecure and defensive to listen to criticism though when insulting everybody is easier. If they even admit we exist, they dismiss us non-bigot fans as nostalgia weirdos who won't let go of "TNG" like we're hugging a fucking teddy bear or something. Correction: There were many seasons of good Trek after Next Generation, with good legit Trek storytelling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; DSC have us an amazing portrayal of Pike - a Captain I would gladly serve under. I keep hearing that, but I couldn't wade through enough Burnham-Trek to get to it. Maybe I'll give the new series a try (if they ever scrape together enough money and find anybody who wants to show it), but really I'm fed up with Kurtzman and co., and just wish Shari Redstone would farm it out to other production companies for a split on the view revenue. Actors and crew can't go in to film scenes now anyway, why not let another production company do a serious adult oriented 24th century *animated* real science fiction series. Supposed to be cheaper, everybody can work from home, and if they brought back somebody like Ronald D. Moore or even (gasp!) Brannon Braga for a miniseries they could probably get them back on course.

Then I screw one of [these adapters](https://www.amazon.com/INNOLIFE-Aluminum-Schrader-Converter-Compressor/dp/B00VVH36DO) onto the valve stem. [Slime sealer](https://www.amazon.com/Slime-10004-Repair-Sealant-Bicycles/dp/B07X3XYYZ5) (tube sealer not tire sealer) comes with a short length of clear tubing that fits over that adapter tightly. I put in 2-4 ounces of sealer, depending on the width of the tire. They make a [special syringe](https://www.amazon.com/KOM-Cycling-Tubeless-Injector-Designed/dp/B07D3CLYGS) for sealer, but I just use an empty two ounce bottle of Stans. Careful checking your pressure. I killed two very nice gauges that jammed up when sealer squirted into them. Now I just use the gauge on my floor pump so I can put in a stroke to make sure to flush any sealer out of it so it doesn't jam with sealer.</TEXT>

Also not sure about Laramie, but Cheyenne and further east is hail country. If you have a nice vehicle, boat, motorcycle, RV, etc. get them under at least a carport before spring.

    <TEXT>The answer is yes, but Kurtzman and company are not up to it. Like asking an anti-vaxxer/Apollo hoaxer/flat Earther to learn the math and become a real scientist. They can't change their thinking that much. It's simply beyond them. The only way we could ever get what you describe is if Shari Redstone could pull some lawyer magic and license out Trek to somebody like [Charlie Brooker](https://i.imgur.com/i3SbYz5.png). I think the key would be to license out the Star Trek universe and canon, but not the characters. Then you get an all new cast with a new ship and new stories, maybe about a post-24th century era. I would be very happy to have either The Orville or The Callister drop into 24th century Star Trek universe with the same sets and cast (and creative team), and go from there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was driving a girl I was briefly dating to the airport in Albuquerque as it was breaking up over multiple states including NM, though we didn't know that at the time. Some droplets of unknown liquid hit us both in the face, and we both looked up at the clear blue sky to see if it was raining. She said, "Is it..?" I said, "Nope I don't think so." because neither of us wanted to consider if it was bird pee or something.  gt; birds, unlike mammals, don't produce urine. Instead they excrete nitrogenous wastes in the form of uric acid, which emerges as a white paste. And uric acid doesn't dissolve in water easily.</TEXT>
