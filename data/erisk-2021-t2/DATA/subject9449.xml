    <TITLE>The Purina Diet</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-28 20:28:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>A friend of mine has a big Labrador Retriever. While I was buying a large bag of Purina at Walmart for him, a woman behind me in the checkout line asked if it was for a dog. (duh) On impulse, I told her no. I explained that I was starting the Purina diet again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time. I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in intensive Care Ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet. The way that it works is you load all your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a tall guy who was behind her. Horrified, she asked if I ended up in the hospital last time because I'd been poisoned. I told her no I was sitting in the street licking my balls when a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have to have help as he laughed so hard he fell to the floor.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Eleven Years Today!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-02-10 20:35:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>A drinking and drugging career that lasted thirty-five years. I was arrested and charged with DWI or DUI fourteen times (only covicted of eight). Many other arrests for related shit. I knew I should stop drinking but had no clue how. So I always just tried to moderate or take a taxi or whatever. At age fourty-five I was given an opportunity to go to rehab for ninety days and did. It was there that I learned I needed to change everything. H O W = Honest, Open minded and Willing to do whatever was suggested. And for me that's get to AA, get a sponsor and work the program. It's difficult to put into words the good vibes I get from being useful and helping others. I've had a banker, a panhandler and a pastor as sponsees as well as many others. I have four siblings and somehow I'm the one who ended up caring for my eighty-nine year old Mother. I am so greatful for sobriety. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, that's why it's called the present. IWNDWYT</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best description of Spiritual Principles</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-13 20:08:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>Today is March 13th and in the book daily reflections on this day is my favorite reading. Its title is a "world of the spirit". We have entered into the world of the spirit. Our next function is to grow in understanding and effectiveness. This is not an overnight matter. It should continue for our lifetime. The word entered and the phrase entered into the world of the spirit are very significant. They imply action, a beginning, getting into, a prerequisite to maintaining my spiritual growth, the spirit being the immaterial part of me. Barriers to our spiritual growth are self-centeredness and a materialistic focus on worldly things. Spirituality means Devotion to spiritual instead of worldly things, it means obedience to God's will for me. I understand spiritual things to be, unconditional love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self-control and humility. Anytime I allow selfishness dishonesty resentment and fear to be a part of me I block out spiritual things. As I maintain my sobriety growing spiritually becomes a lifelong process. My goal is spiritual growth, accepting that I will never have spiritual perfection. This provides a perfect summary of what AA has taught me about spirituality.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Until it #8217;s proven otherwise, we #8217;ll accept that Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado #8217;s uniformed appearance in a television ad for U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe is legal. When Tulsa World reporter Randy Krehbiel responded to reader questions about the ad with inquiries to state and federal officials, they said that they couldn #8217;t find any legal violation in Regalado #8217;s actions. But we expect more than the bare legal minimum from our sheriff. An ad that was meant to emphasize Inhofe #8217;s strong law-and-order principles is, instead, telling us that Regalado doesn #8217;t have a proper understanding of what should and should not be part of the political sphere. In this case, motive is critical. Why was it important for Regalado to be in his khaki uniform when he endorsed Inhofe? We can #8217;t know what is in anyone #8217;s heart, but the answer seems at least partially obvious. Regalado is a more compelling political proponent in the uniform than in street clothes. When he #8217;s in the uniform, he is emblematic of much more. That difference  #8212; the distinction between Vic Regalado the man and Vic Regalado in his sheriff #8217;s uniform  #8212; is something that neither he nor the senator owns, and something that shouldn #8217;t be use for partisan political purposes. It takes the credibility of all Oklahoma law enforcement officers  #8212; Republicans, Democrats and independents  #8212; and uses it for something that isn #8217;t, at its heart, about law enforcement. It makes anyone whose car has a bumper sticker for Inhofe #8217;s Democratic opponent, Abby Broyles, wonder about why they were pulled over by a Tulsa County deputy. How should that voter feel, remembering Regalado #8217;s promise that law enforcement would always have Jim Inhofe #8217;s back? Always. In short, the ad undercuts public trust in the sheriff #8217;s office, which is why it is wrong. As an American citizen, Regalado enjoys the same First Amendment rights as the rest of us, including the free speech right to make a political endorsement. No one should begrudge him that, and we don #8217;t. But as the sheriff of Tulsa County, he should consider how he exercises those rights so that he doesn #8217;t inappropriately use public authority and the law as means to a political end. As abuses of power go, it #8217;s not the most egregious sin we #8217;ve ever seen, but it does undercut our respect for Regalado a bit. We wish he had the fiber to say to Inhofe #8217;s people,  #8220;I #8217;m glad to speak out for the senator because I believe in what he stands for, because I think his thinking matches my thinking, but I #8217;ll be doing it in a business suit. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by Paul Monies October 2, 2020 A color-coded map of active COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma. See the interactive map below to find the data for your zip code. (Paul Monies/Oklahoma Watch) Outbreaks of coronavirus at two state prisons and community outbreaks in Guthrie, Lawton and Yukon led the weekly hotspots in Oklahoma. Infections of inmates at Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy and North Fork Correctional Center in Sayre put those two facilities on the Department of Corrections #8217; latest hotspot list for prisons. More than 250 inmates at Dick Conner and more than 150 inmates at North Fork had active coronavirus cases on Friday, the department said in its testing update. DOC on Wednesday suspended visitation at all state prisons in an effort to quell infections throughout its system. More than 580 inmates had active infections as of Friday, while more than 3,700 inmates have tested positive since the pandemic started. Meanwhile, ZIP codes in Guthrie, Lawton and Yukon were among other places this week with large increases in active coronavirus cases, according to an Oklahoma Watch analysis of state data. Declines came in places that had large outbreaks of now-recovered inmates in prison, like Fort Supply and McAlester. The state #8217;s death toll from the virus surpassed 1,000 last weekend and stood at 1,044 on Friday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. more in the article *Support our publication Every day we strive to produce journalism that matters  #8212; stories that strengthen accountability and transparency, provide value and resonate with readers like you.* *This work is essential to a better-informed community and a healthy democracy.

    <TEXT>By Terry Pluto, The Plain Dealer CLEVELAND, Ohio  #8211;  #8220;I can #8217;t believe my friend is voting for THAT GUY! I #8217;m not sure I can even talk to him ever again. #8221; Some version of that sentence has come up for years around elections. And this year, the issues are hotter and more divisive than usual. But is that worth cutting off a person? Weren #8217;t there good reasons that person was a friend in the first place? I know of families who are barely speaking because of their views of the election. Others have slapped up a ROAD CLOSED sign. Now that they disagree with the person about the election, they are finding other faults and deciding to completely shut down the relationship. Is it worth reducing an entire person to their voting record? Is that a reason to forget about all the good things over all the years that built the relationship? Another thought: Why bring up politics with someone we know has a strong opposite view? Is it done to prove we are  #8220;right #8221; and they are  #8220;wrong #8221;? Or is it because we want to provoke someone, stir up conflict? Those are questions worth asking. Between COVID-19, the economic setbacks, the social unrest and a media that loves to scream during an election, our friendships and family ties are being attacked on several fronts. Don #8217;t allow the election to make it worse. WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE? Wonder if anyone on their death bed will say,  #8220;One thing I #8217;m glad about, I stopped talking to that person because she voted for Biden/Trump. #8221; In the last few weeks, I #8217;ve lost two good friends to cancer: Former Plain Dealer Sports Editor Roy Hewitt and Arlington Church of God Pastor Dr. Diana Swoope. Two other friends are in a major life-and-death duel with disease. Does our voting record count in these relationships? I have friends with much differing views on politics, but we find many other things to talk about. Important things. Dealing with aging parents or sick friends. Or how to handle kids who are struggling. I #8217;ve sat in many hospital waiting rooms while friends and family members have had surgeries. Does anyone #8217;s voting preferences matter in those settings? Instead, I #8217;ve been part of groups of strangers and we prayed for our loved ones. Then we may have ended up talking about sports or something to keep the anxiety under control as we awaited word from the operating room. POLITICS IS NOT GOD It #8217;s important to vote. Political debates can be revealing. Respectful discussions about politics can be useful. But when there is a family or personal crisis, it doesn #8217;t take long to see the triviality of most of the political pie fights. I #8217;ve never heard even part of a sermon suggesting people refuse to allow politics to tear apart their relationship. That #8217;s a topic worship leaders should consider. If you read the gospels, Jesus is often challenged to talk about politics. It doesn #8217;t especially interest him.  #8220;My kingdom is not of this world, #8221; is how he answered one ruler. When talking to religious leader Nicodemus, Jesus didn #8217;t debate complicated doctrine or the Roman occupation of Jerusalem. He talked about heart issues, the need to be  #8220;born again in the spirit. #8221; You can read about it in John Chapter 3. He knew behind the intellect and respected position held by Nicodemus was a man in some inner turmoil. That #8217;s much of what we see today: Hurting people lashing out about politics. But in reality, their pain is about something deeper. And often times, helping each other through the challenges and pain of everyday life reminds us how we need each other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By Hoyt Hilsman- Whatever his ultimate fate, President Donald Trump will go down as one of the most extraordinary figures of the 21st century. As a playwright and theater critic, I marvel at the theatrical dimensions of his Shakespearean character. While hardly a self-made man  #8211; his path to success was gilded by his wealthy and politically connected father  #8211; Trump is self-invented, creating a persona built upon deceit and betrayal that matches some of the greatest tragic figures in literature. Centuries ago, Aristotle laid out the elements of the tragic character. The central element is a tragic flaw that leads to his great success and power, but ultimately to his downfall. In dramatic terms, the character #8217;s tragic flaw is constant, while circumstances are always changing. Macbeth and his wife, in Shakespeare #8217;s great tragedy, murdered the king and successfully gained power, but when they embarked on a tyrannical and murderous reign themselves, they were doomed. In the movie  #8220;Citizen Kane, #8221; which Donald Trump has said was his favorite film, Charles Foster Kane #8217;s meteoric rise to power and fame is shattered by his own narcissism and rage, which destroys his marriage and reputation, leaving him bitter and isolated in his Xanadu mansion. It is not hard to see Trump suffering a similar fate, alone, isolated, watching reruns of  #8220;The Apprentice #8221; in his three-story penthouse, or possibly from a jail cell. Whether Trump is reelected or not, whether he fades from public view or not, his tragic flaw  #8211; and his personal tragedy  #8211; will endure. What may seem puzzling  #8211; and disheartening  #8211; is why so many Americans are attracted to the Trump persona, the embodiment of his tragic flaw. Aside from the views of psychologists and neuroscientists, who have discussed the mass appeal of narcissist leaders and the tendency of our brains to be attracted to larger-than-life (e.g. Shakespearean) characters, there is another explanation from the study of dramatic literature. Aristotle #8217;s theory of drama is that audiences are aroused by pity and fear. In the case of Trump, the fear aspect is obvious, as he daily whips up fears of immigrants, minorities, socialists and a host of other scapegoats. However, Aristotle #8217;s notion of  #8220;pity #8221; is more complex and profound. By  #8220;pity, #8221; Aristotle really meant empathy or identification. More than anything else, Trump supporters seem to deeply identify  #8211; even empathize  #8211; with Trump, as if his sufferings are akin to their own. These voters apparently see in Trump a fellow traveler in their perceived victimization, just as an audience can identify with the tragic struggles of a character on stage. This is a powerful connection that, once established, is very difficult to sever. In the theater, it is called  #8220;suspension of disbelief, #8221; which means that the audience, once they identify with a character or his story, will go along unquestioningly for the ride. Our emotions take control, overriding our weaker rational nature which questions or doubts. It is not only Trump supporters who fall into this pattern. Anti-Trump voters may also become prisoners of their emotions in the face of the powerful  #8220;fear and pity #8221; effect. While Trump may be God to some, he becomes the devil to others. This is the power of narcissism driven by an unyielding tragic flaw. In perhaps Shakespeare #8217;s greatest play,  #8220;The Tempest, #8221; the universe is turned upside down by unconscious, supernatural and magical forces. Much like our world today, when the unconscious, tragic flaw of a single leader has turned us upside down, propelled by the deepest, most powerful forces of human nature described centuries ago by Shakespeare, Aristotle and other titans of dramatic literature.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON  #8211; Two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising questions about the timing of Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and whether additional senators may have been exposed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the confirmation process was going  #8220;full steam ahead. #8221; North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both said Friday that they had tested positive for the virus. Both had attended a ceremony for Barrett at the White House on Sept. 25 with President Donald Trump, who announced Friday that he had tested positive and was later hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Lee, who did not wear a mask at the White House event, said he had  #8220;symptoms consistent with longtime allergies." Tillis, who did wear a mask during the public portion of the event, said he had  #8220;mild symptoms. #8221; Both said they would quarantine for 10 days  #8212; ending just before Barrett's confirmation hearings begin on Oct. 12. The positive tests come as Senate Republicans are pushing to quickly confirm Barrett in the few weeks they have before the Nov. 3 election. There is little cushion in the schedule set out by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and McConnell, who want to put a third Trump nominee on the court immediately in case they lose any of their power in the election. Democrats, many of whom have been critical of Barrett, seized on the virus announcements to call for a delay in the hearings. "We now have two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who have tested positive for COVID, and there may be more," tweeted Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.  #8220;I wish my colleagues well. It is irresponsible and dangerous to move forward with a hearing, and there is absolutely no good reason to do so. #8221; Several other members of the Judiciary panel attended the White House ceremony, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. Blackburn said she tested negative after the event. Crapo said he  #8220;recently #8221; had a negative test and a spokeswoman said he would be getting another one as soon as it could be arranged. A spokeswoman for Hawley said he was being tested Saturday, and the senator tweeted later that his coronavirus test came back negative. Sasse tested negative, but said in a statement that he would work remotely from his home state and undergo further testing due to his "close interaction with multiple infected individuals," his office said. He said he planned to to return to Washington in time for the confirmation hearing. Graham was not at the White House on Saturday but sees Trump frequently. He said Friday that he had taken a test after interacting with Lee and it was negative. A spokeswoman for another GOP member of the committee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said Saturday that he had also interacted with Lee and had also tested negative. Still, Cruz's office said he is remaining at home until the hearings out of an abundance of caution. Confirmation hearings for Barrett, who would replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, are scheduled to last for four days. McConnell on Saturday announced that he would seek to delay floor action for the next two weeks but that the hearings would proceed. At an event in Kentucky on Friday, he said he thought remote hearings could work if some senators couldn #8217;t attend. Graham also suggested the possibility of remote hearings, saying on Twitter that  #8220;any senator who wants to participate virtually will be allowed to do so. #8221; In a statement Saturday, Graham said there would be  #8220;no change #8221; in the hearings even if Senate floor votes were delayed. It is not unusual for committees to meet when there is no action on the floor. Senators cannot vote virtually, however, so Republicans would need a full slate of committee members to approve the nomination shortly after the hearings and all of their senators on the floor for a final confirmation vote, which they hope will happen the last week of October. After interacting with Sen. Lee, in consultation with the attending physician, Sen. Cruz is remaining at home out of an abundance of caution. He feels healthy, hasn #8217;t exhibited any COVID-19 symptoms, and has tested negative. In accordance with medical advice he will return to the Senate for the Supreme Court nomination hearings. #8221; Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., also announced Saturday that he tested positive for the virus and would not return until he was cleared by his doctor. He is not on the Judiciary panel, but his presence would likely be needed for a floor vote. Tillis is in a competitive reelection race against Democrat Cal Cunningham, and the two debated Thursday evening. On Twitter, Cunningham said he wished Tillis a quick recovery and said he would also get tested. Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and met with Lee, Tillis and other members of the Judiciary panel this week, tested negative, the White House said Friday. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered. Trump, who has consistently downplayed the virus and often discouraged the use of masks, was flown to Walter Reed on Friday evening after experiencing symptoms. The president tweeted Saturday that he was  #8220;feeling well," though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the next 48 hours would be critical in terms of his care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON  #8211; Masks were rarely spotted in the West Wing. Crowds of people gathered shoulder to shoulder on the White House South Lawn. And Air Force One streaked across the sky from one massive campaign rally to another. With ready access to testing and the best public health minds at his disposal, President Donald Trump should have been the American safest from COVID-19. Instead, he flouted his own government #8217;s guidelines and helped create a false sense of invulnerability in the White House, an approach that has now failed him as it did a nation where more than 200,000 people have died. Marine One, the presidential helicopter, lifted off Friday to take Trump to a military hospital from the same White House lawn that less than a week earlier had been the site of his celebratory nomination of a new Supreme Court justice as he charged toward the November election. Several people at the event, including a U.S. senator, have since tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump is now ensconsed at Walter Reed Medical Center after running a fever and feeling fatigued following his early-morning revelation that he had tested positive for the virus.  #8220;He let the country down by disregarding the CDC, ignoring federal guidelines and acting like he was Superman, #8221; said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley.  #8220;He did not just downplay the virus, he paraded around like a peacock, making fun of those who took it seriously. #8221; From the pandemic #8217;s early days, Trump, by his own admission, played down the severity of the virus. He repeatedly suggested it would  #8220;disappear #8221; and for a while was pushing for the American economy to fully reopen by Easter, just a month after the pandemic fully engulfed the nation. And he soon began resisting the advice of public health experts on his own coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. He publicly clashed with the heads of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over everything from the risks associated with opening schools to the timetable for a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Those on the White House staff dared not break with the president, who wanted to embody a nation on the way back, not one fixated with health guidelines that would remind a nervous public about the virus rather than an economic resurgence. Experts urged the widespread use of masks, including CDC Director Robert Redfield, who testified before Congress last month that face coverings could be a more effective safeguard than a vaccine. Trump has eschewed their use, telling aides that he didn #8217;t like how he looked in them and that it sent a message to the public that he was worried about his health. He has worn masks only sporadically and politicized their use, saying he didn #8217;t need them because he was tested and most people he saw were kept six feet away. He mocked Democrat Joe Biden for consistently wearing a face covering, while many of the president #8217;s supporters followed his example and skipped them, even at crowded events. And their use, while technically required, wasn #8217;t enforced in the White House either. Most senior aides rarely wore masks, even in tight quarters in the West Wing or on Air Force One. A belief took hold that because those who came in contact with president received a rapid COVID-19 test every day, they were safe in their bubble. But the rapid tests were far from foolproof and were sometimes foiled by the virus #8217; lengthy incubation period. Staff members, including the national security adviser and the president #8217;s personal valet, contracted the virus while one of the president #8217;s closest aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive just hours before Trump and first lady Melania Trump did.  #8220;He mocked the medical experts and their advice. He mocked it all right up until the presidential debate when he stood on that stage, #8221; said Michael Steele, former head of the Republican Party.  #8220;He had the best information possible and didn #8217;t take it. #8221; The White House, for its part, has brushed off criticism of spotty mask-wearing by Trump and his staff by citing the frequent testing regimen. Trump styles his large campaign gatherings as  #8220;peaceful protests #8221; exempt from limits on crowd size. And as for Trump's undercutting of public health officials, officials are quick to point to contrary medical opinions. Journalist Bob Woodward recorded Trump early in the year admitting to downplaying the threat of the virus. The president always pushed forward, insisting the nation was nearly over the pandemic even as cases surged throughout the country. Even in the hours after the president #8217;s diagnosis, senior White House staff, including chief of staff Mark Meadows and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, walked around the White House complex without wearing masks. The White House, even now, says the face coverings are a matter of  #8220;personal choice #8221; for most staffers. In a belated shift, National Security Council staffers were required to start wearing them as of Friday. Secret Service agents are mandated to wear them when social distancing is not possible. And it wasn #8217;t just about masks. As the summer wound down, and Trump lagged behind Biden in polls for an election seen as a referendum on White House handling of the pandemic, the president #8217;s campaign aimed to project normalcy in an effort to convince voters that the president had the virus under control. After a botched attempt to restart Trump #8217;s trademark rallies in Tulsa in June, the campaign began slowly organizing smaller gatherings of supporters, usually outdoors at airports. Though the CDC recommended against large crowds and unnecessary travel, the president began crisscrossing the country, even while Biden largely remained at home, conducting virtual evets. The rallies got bigger and bigger as the months marched on, with little social distancing and masks recommended but not required. And crowds became part of the messaging for two of the president #8217;s recent signature events: Hundreds of people packed the White House South Lawn for his acceptance speech during the Republican National Convention, and the Rose Garden was packed for the nomination of his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a week ago. Six days later, Trump was again on that lawn. This time, he walked slowly to the waiting helicopter, bound for Walter Reed for a multi-day hospital stay. There were no cheering crowds. And everyone on the lawn, reporter and staffer alike, wore a mask. Trump did, too.</TEXT>

And as for Trump's undercutting of public health officials, officials are quick to point to contrary medical opinions. Journalist Bob Woodward recorded Trump early in the year admitting to downplaying the threat of the virus. The president always pushed forward, insisting the nation was nearly over the pandemic even as cases surged throughout the country. Even in the hours after the president #8217;s diagnosis, senior White House staff, including chief of staff Mark Meadows and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, walked around the White House complex without wearing masks. The White House, even now, says the face coverings are a matter of  #8220;personal choice #8221; for most staffers. In a belated shift, National Security Council staffers were required to start wearing them as of Friday. Secret Service agents are mandated to wear them when social distancing is not possible. And it wasn #8217;t just about masks. As the summer wound down, and Trump lagged behind Biden in polls for an election seen as a referendum on White House handling of the pandemic, the president #8217;s campaign aimed to project normalcy in an effort to convince voters that the president had the virus under control. After a botched attempt to restart Trump #8217;s trademark rallies in Tulsa in June, the campaign began slowly organizing smaller gatherings of supporters, usually outdoors at airports. Though the CDC recommended against large crowds and unnecessary travel, the president began crisscrossing the country, even while Biden largely remained at home, conducting virtual evets. The rallies got bigger and bigger as the months marched on, with little social distancing and masks recommended but not required. And crowds became part of the messaging for two of the president #8217;s recent signature events: Hundreds of people packed the White House South Lawn for his acceptance speech during the Republican National Convention, and the Rose Garden was packed for the nomination of his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a week ago. Six days later, Trump was again on that lawn. This time, he walked slowly to the waiting helicopter, bound for Walter Reed for a multi-day hospital stay. There were no cheering crowds. And everyone on the lawn, reporter and staffer alike, wore a mask. Trump did, too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON  #8211; President Donald Trump doesn't want to talk about abortion. After years of saying he would appoint "pro-life #8221; judges and bragging that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision would be overturned  #8220;automatically" if he won, Trump is now tiptoeing around the issue as he tries to get another justice confirmed to the Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election.  #8220;You don #8217;t know what #8217;s on the ballot, #8221; Trump interjected during this week's first presidential debate when Democrat Joe Biden said the ruling giving women the right to an abortion was at stake.  #8220;Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? #8221; Trump demanded.  #8220;It #8217;s not on the ballot. ... There #8217;s nothing happening there." That reticence stands in stark contrast to his past statements and underscores the risks Trump and Republicans are facing as they rush to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the election. With polls showing Trump trailing Biden nationally and in some battleground states, Trump is trying to deliver for his conservative base while avoiding making abortion a central focus of the election. His campaign worries it could turn off voters who support abortion rights and drive on-the-fence or undecided voters  #8212; especially women  #8212; to turn out for Biden en masse.  #8220;He knows at the end of the day that opposing access to safe, legal abortion is a losing strategy," said Kelley Robinson, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. While Trump insisted during the debate that Barrett's views on Roe v. Wade are unknown, there is little doubt she opposes abortion personally. She belonged to the University of Notre Dame #8217;s  #8220;Faculty for Life #8221; group. She signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops affirming the  #8220;value of human life from conception to natural death." In 2006, she signed onto a newspaper ad sponsored by an anti-abortion group in which she said she opposed  #8220;abortion on demand." The second page of the ad, which was unsigned, read,  #8220;It #8217;s time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children." Barrett insisted in a 2017 White House questionnaire that her personal views on abortion and other issues would  #8220;have no bearing on the discharge of my duties as a judge. #8221; But in a 2013 Texas Law Review article, Barrett didn't include Roe v. Wade on a list of 10 cases she said are widely considered  #8220;super-precedents, #8221; ones no justice would dare reverse even if they believed they were wrongly decided. During a 2013 lecture at Notre Dame on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Barrett said she thought it was "very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn" the landmark ruling. But she said in 2016 that even if  #8220;the right to abortion #8221; doesn't change, "I think some of the restrictions would change. ... The question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion. #8221; Barrett also has voted at least twice on abortion issues as an appellate judge, both times joining dissenting opinions to decisions in favor of abortion rights.  #8220;Oh, I think her record #8217;s awfully clear, #8221; said Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill.  #8220;She meets my standard of having evidence in the record, out there in public, on the record, that indicates that she understands that Roe was really an act of judicial imperialism that was wrongly decided. And I think her record of all the people being considered, the president considered, I think her record was by far the clearest on that. #8221; Abortion rights activists agreed.  #8220;Amy Coney Barrett's record could not be more clear," said Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for NARAL Pro-Choice America.  #8220;Trump made perfectly clear on the campaign trail in 2016 that he was going to appoint judges who were hostile to Roe v. Wade. ... We #8217;re taking him at his word." Trump, however, insisted during the debate that Barrett's views on the topic were unknown and said he'd never discussed it with her, claiming that would be inappropriate.  #8220;The president has been clear that he would never ask a judge to prejudge a case," said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. She stressed that Barrett had said on multiple occasions that  #8220;it is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge #8217;s personal convictions, whether they derive from faith or anywhere else, on the law. #8221; That approach stands in sharp contrast to Trump's past comments, including during a debate in 2016. It was then that Trump proudly declared,  #8220;The justices that I am going to appoint will be pro-life. #8221; He went as far as to say that overturning Roe v. Wade  #8220;will happen, automatically, in my opinion #8221; if he was elected president,  #8220;because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. #8221; It was a similar case during a Senate debate in Iowa this week, when Republican Sen. Joni Ernst criticized her opponent's support for abortion rights, while also saying she believes the chance of the court overturning Roe v. Wade is  #8220;very minimal. I don #8217;t see that happening." The desire to gloss over the subject reflects an acknowledgment that the issue is a potentially potent motivator for the Democratic base. Recent polls show that a majority of voters oppose overturning Roe. As they move toward Barrett's confirmation hearings, White House officials have expressed concern about what will happen if Democrats are able to successfully use the battle to highlight the potential impact on abortion rights as well as the future of the Affordable Care Act. If Democrats are able to energize their base and win over enough swing voters, some Trump allies fear Trump could win the confirmation fight and, in the process, lose the election. They #8217;re hoping that Democrats will go too far in attacking Barrett's faith and her family, energizing conservatives and turning off those in the middle. Trump's allies accuse Democrats of fear-mongering, arguing that they have been spreading anxiety about the court overturning Roe v. Wade for decades. But advocates of abortion rights say the alarm bells are justified, with 17 cases currently in the legal pipeline. And even if Roe v. Wade is not overturned outright, Barrett's addition to the court could lead to the further erosion of abortion rights, with more and more restrictions. Ford, from NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Trump and other Republicans  #8220;know that they are quite out of step with the mainstream #8221; and are trying to have it both ways  #8212; putting Barrett on the court  #8220;while also trying to dance around their agenda. #8221; But Mallory Quigley, of the Susan B. Anthony List, which seeks to elect candidates who oppose abortion rights, brushed off the suggestion that Trump was trying to hide anything.  #8220;President Trump has governed as the most pro-life president in our nation #8217;s history and never misses an opportunity to bring up his pro-life policy victories on the campaign trail," she said. "Americans agree overwhelmingly with President Trump and pro-life senators that want to pass reasonable limits on abortion - #8211; and see abortion policy set by the legislature, not courts. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Angela Shen YUKON, Okla. (KFOR)  #8211; The City of Yukon will consider a mask mandate at a City Council meeting on Oct. 6. A few council members have already said they plan to vote no.  #8220;I #8217;ve got nothing against masks at all. I wear one everyday at work, but I don #8217;t think it #8217;s the place of local government to say that you have to wear a mask, #8221; Vice Mayor Jeff Wootton said. If passed, masks would be required in all public places, and business employees would have to wear them. The city already passed an emergency declaration on July 10 that requires bar and restaurant employees to wear masks and for anyone going into a city building to do so. The specifics of the proposed mandate are up for discussion.  #8220;We do have freedoms. If I #8217;m going out to check my mail or walking down at the park, and I don #8217;t want to wear a mask, if there #8217;s no one around me, why would I want to be wearing a mask? #8221; Wootton said. Mayor Shelli Selbi made a post on Facebook that said she would vote no on a mask mandate. The proposal was brought forth by a local task force. Yukon residents have varying opinions.  #8220;I work at the Stephenson Cancer Center specifically with leukemia patients, so I think it #8217;s important to protect them. Us wearing masks, that #8217;s all it does. I don #8217;t believe it #8217;s infringing on our rights or anything like that, #8221; Amy Eskew said. Others say they don #8217;t think a mandate would be much use.  #8220;I don #8217;t think they #8217;re going to be able to enforce it. I think it #8217;s very important that we wear our masks and wear them properly, but I don #8217;t think anyone can really enforce it, #8221; Sydney Harmon said. The proposal would put the mandate in place from Oct. 7 to Dec. 10, but that could change with discussion at the meeting.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By: Clayton Cummins OKLAHOMA CITY - Operators of Oklahoma City #8217;s streetcars have spoken, and majority say they want to start a union. #160;Health and security concerns, even a lack of bathroom breaks are among the top concerns. #160; #160; #160; Mail-in ballots for voting were sent out in August and counted on September 22. #160;The results, two out of three people voting say a union is necessary. #160; #160; #160; Darryl Williams learned Monday morning his job operating streetcars came to end. #160; #160; Herzog Transit Services, EMBARK #8217;s contractor for streetcars, fired him he said for driving violations. #160;Williams believes there #8217;s an underlying issue. #160; #160;  #8220;Since they know that we are unionizing, their statement is we don #8217;t like it and now we #8217;re nitpicking, #8221; said Williams. #160; Bathroom breaks are among concerns of Williams. #160;Getting one while working, he said, was increasingly challenging. #160;  #8220;You try to get (a break and we #8217;re told) we really don #8217;t have anybody to give you a break right now, we need to keep the streetcar moving, #8221; said Williams. #160; Williams said security has become an issue with homeless getting hostile like urinating, spitting and other actions on the streetcar. He also alleges lax cleaning procedures. #160;  #8220;You might get on a streetcar that had been cleaned. I personally, it didn #8217;t happen all the time and we #8217;d let them know. We #8217;d write it on our inspection, #8221; said Williams. #160; According to EMBARK, streetcars are cleaned daily. #160; #160; Herzog Transit Services provided News 9 with this statement: #160;  #8220;As an employee owned company, Herzog #8217;s highest priority and responsibility is the safety and wellbeing of our customers who ride the streetcar, the general public in the vicinity of the streetcar and our employees who operate the streetcar. #160;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have treated our employees like a member of our family by suppling everyone the necessary PPE to be safe, increasing the sanitation protocols of the streetcar fleet to ensure a clean and safe environment, and providing every Herzog employee a full paycheck regardless if they were able to work due to COVID-19 related situations. #160;We have already started investigating the concerns brought to our attention in the press release as we are committed to delivering the cleanest and safest environment possible for the traveling public. #8221; #160; Out of a contract, the local Amalgamated Transit Union president hopes for fairness. #160;  #8220;This was not an economic issue where the employees were seeking a higher monetary income, #8221; said Chris Bourke, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 993.  #8220;It was issues that were not being addressed for safety and welfare of the employees. #8221; #160; The local union has reached out to Herzog to begin negotiations. They said they have not heard back. #160; #160; A spokesman for Herzog did not say whether the company would participate in contract negotiations. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mike Simons - OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  #8212; Oklahoma health officials continue to report a steady increase in the number of people hospitalized as a result of COVID-19, and the state's official death count from the disease caused by the coronavirus increased by three on Monday. Health officials said there were 665 new confirmed cases of the virus. The latest numbers from the Oklahoma State Department of Health put the total number of confirmed cases in the state at 91,982. The true number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher though because many people haven #8217;t been tested and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The state's count of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 was 655 through Friday, the most recent data available. That #8217;s an increase of 65 people from a week earlier on Sept. 25. Oklahoma #8217;s death count stands at 1,055. Health officials report there are more than 12,772 active cases of the virus and more than 78,155 people have recovered from it. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and a cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; The West Wing is a ghost town. Staff members are scared of exposure. And the White House is now a treatment ward for not one  #8212; but two  #8212; COVID patients, including a president who has long taken the threat of the virus lightly. President Donald Trump's decision to return home from a military hospital despite his continued illness is putting new focus on the people around him who could be further exposed if he doesn't abide by strict isolation protocols. Throughout the pandemic, White House custodians, ushers, kitchen staff and members of the U.S. Secret Service have continued to show up for work in what is now a coronavirus hot spot, with more than a dozen known cases this week alone. Trump, still contagious, has made clear that he has little intention of abiding by best containment practices. As he arrived back at the White House on Monday evening, the president defiantly removed his face mask and stopped to pose on a balcony within feet of a White House photographer. He was seen inside moments later, surrounded by numerous people as he taped a video message urging Americans not to fear a virus that has killed more than 210,000 in the U.S. and 1 million worldwide. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House was  #8220;taking every precaution necessary #8221; to protect not just the first family but  #8220;every staff member working on the complex" consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and best practices. He added that physical access to the president would be significantly limited and appropriate protective gear worn by those near him. Nonetheless, the mood within the White House remains somber, with staff fearful they may have been exposed to the virus. As they confront a new reality  #8212; a worksite that once seemed like a bubble of safety is anything but  #8212; they also have been engaged in finger-pointing over conflicting reports released about the president's health as well as a lack of information provided internally. Many have learned about positive tests from media reports and several were exposed, without their knowledge, to people the White House already knew could be contagious. Indeed, it took until late Sunday night, nearly three full days after Trump's diagnosis, for the White House to send a staff-wide note in response. Even then, it did not acknowledge the outbreak.  #8220;As a reminder, #8221; read the letter from the White House Management Office,  #8220;if you are experiencing any symptoms ... please stay home and do not come to work." Staff who develop symptoms were advised to  #8220;go home immediately #8221; and contact their doctors rather than the White House Medical Unit. Even when Trump was at the hospital, his staff was not immune to risk. Trump had aides there recording videos and taking photographs of him. On Sunday evening, he took a surprise drive around the hospital to wave to supporters from the window of an SUV. The Secret Service agents in the car with him were dressed in personal protective equipment.  #8220;Appropriate precautions were taken in the execution of this movement to protect the president and all those supporting it, including PPE, #8221; Deere said. Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley dismissed media concern about the agents' safety as  #8220;absolutely stupid and foolish." "How do they think he #8217;s going to leave? Is someone gonna toss him the keys to a Buick and let him drive home by himself? They #8217;re always around him because that #8217;s their job," Gidley said on Fox News. But agents told a very different story. Several who spoke with The Associated Press expressed concern over the cavalier attitude the White House has taken when it comes to masks and distancing. Colleagues, they said, are angry, but feel there's little they can do. One, speaking after White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tested positive on Monday, said it felt like he and some of his colleagues had been spared only by a measure of good luck. Others noted the difference between facing outside threats they have trained for  #8212; a gun, a bomb or a biohazard  #8212; and being put at additional risk because of behavior they characterized as reckless at times. The agents spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their jobs. The Secret Service has refused to disclose how many of its employees have tested positive or have had to quarantine, citing privacy and security. But in the midst of the election, thousands of agents are on duty and anyone who tests positive can easily be subbed out, officials have said. Secret Service spokeswoman Julia McMurray said the agency takes  #8220;every precaution to keep our protectees, employees and families, and the general public, safe and healthy. #8221; Trump has joined first lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive, in the residential area of the White House. It is typically served by a staff of roughly 100 people, including housekeepers, cooks, florists, groundskeepers and five or six butlers  #8212; who interact most closely with the president, said Kate Andersen Brower, who wrote the  #8220;The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House. #8221; During the pandemic, that staff has been reduced to a skeleton crew, with mask-wearing much more prevalent than in the West Wing, where few have worn them regularly. Brower said she recently spoke with three former employees who expressed concern about the health of current workers, but were too afraid to speak publicly.  #8220;The butlers always feel protective of the first family, but there #8217;s just a concern about whether or not the staff would get sick, #8221; Brower said. Most are older, she said,  #8220;because they work from one generation to the next. They are people who have been on the job for 20 to 30 years. They want to work to get their full pensions. #8221; For months now, cleaning staff have also privately voiced concerns about their safety, including lack of access to testing and inadequate protective gear. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's spokeswoman, said that "all precautions are being taken to ensure the health and safety of the residence staff, #8221; but she declined to be specific. While the White House has refused to implement new safety procedures  #8212; such as making masks mandatory  #8212; the building was noticeably emptier Monday, with more staffers now staying home on days when they are not needed on site. On Monday morning, there was just a single staff member in the ground floor press office, where two medical staff members administered COVID-19 tests, surrounded by empty desks. It #8217;s not the first time a White House has had to contend with a virus. During the flu pandemic of 1918, President Woodrow Wilson was infected as were members of his family and White House staff, including his secretary and several Secret Service members, according to the White House Historical Association. So were two sheep who spent their days grazing on the South Lawn. They were hospitalized but recovered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; His press secretary once described President Donald Trump as the  #8220;most tested man in America #8221; when it came to COVID-19. And variations on that message were the White House ready response any time critics questioned the president #8217;s lax approach to following guidelines for avoiding the novel coronavirus. But that testing operation proved woefully insufficient in protecting the president and those who work for him at the White House, as evidenced by a string of positive tests over the past week for Trump, his wife and others in their orbit. Trump demonstrated in dramatic fashion that relying on testing alone isn #8217;t enough to create a safe bubble. Mask wearing and social distancing are other key ingredients for preventing the spread of COVID-19, and both have often been in short supply at the White House. From the earliest days of the virus, Trump has provided conflicting advice on wearing a mask, noting that federal health experts were recommending them, but adding that  #8220;I don #8217;t think I #8217;m going to be doing it. #8221; At another point, he said that  #8220;maybe they #8217;re great, and maybe they #8217;re just good. Maybe they #8217;re not so good. #8221; And just last week, he poked at Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden on the topic:  #8220;Every time you see him, he #8217;s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet ways from them, and he shows up with the biggest mask I #8217;ve ever seen. #8221; While the White House has not insisted on masks, it has insisted on testing. Anyone in close proximity to the president or vice president is tested prior to the day #8217;s events, including reporters. The White House says the president is also tested regularly, as are his most senior aides.  #8220;He #8217;s tested more than anyone, multiple times a day. And we believe that he #8217;s acting appropriately, #8221; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in July when asked whether the president was sending mixed messages on mask wearing. McEnany herself tested positive for the virus on Monday, she said. Trump #8217;s doctor, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, has refused to say when Trump last tested negative for COVID-19. A negative test result can sound reassuring, but it doesn #8217;t necessarily mean a person is free from the coronavirus and not contagious. When the virus enters the body, it takes over a cell #8217;s machinery to copy itself, while fending off the body #8217;s immune defenses. But the process takes a few days, so it can take a while before viral particles can be detected by a test. In other words, testing too early can mean no virus will be collected on the swab. There are other reasons for false negative test results. A test could be conducted poorly and not get a good sample. And compared with other tests, rapid tests return more false negatives. The Food and Drug Administration has said the Abbott ID Now test  #8212; one used for screening at the White House  #8212; is meant to be used with people who are suspected of being sick and a negative test result doesn #8217;t rule out COVID-19.  #8220;It #8217;s helpful to keep in mind that tests discover the presence of coronavirus once there #8217;s enough viral material in a person to be able to detect it, #8221; Abbott spokesman John Koval said in an email.  #8220;No test detects the virus immediately after the person becomes infected. #8221;  #8220;Testing alone doesn #8217;t prevent disease spread, #8221; said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist now at the nonprofit group Resolve to Save Lives, which works to prevent epidemics. It must be combined with consistent mask wearing, hand washing, staying 6 feet apart and avoiding large gatherings. The main benefit of testing, Shahpar said, is to identify people with infections and isolate them before they can spread the disease to others.  #8220;Tests can have false positives and false negatives, and no test is perfect. It is also just a snapshot of the situation when the person was tested, #8221; Shahpar said. Asked if the testing provided a false sense of security, spokesman Judd Deere said the physician to the president and the White House Military Office worked with the White House to  #8220;ensure all plans and procedures, including testing, incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible. #8221; Health experts also advise social distancing, but that recommendation has been ignored for several recent White House events, most notably his nomination acceptance speech on the South Lawn in late August and a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony announcing the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Supreme Court. While the events were held outdoors, attendees sat shoulder-to-shoulder with barely a mask in sight. Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands  #8212; overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Barrett, her family, senators and others gathered in the close quarters inside the White House. Among those who attended who have now tested positive, in addition to Trump, his wife Melania and McEnany: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame and at least two Republican lawmakers  #8212; Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. There #8217;s no way to know if the Rose Garden event was where Trump was exposed. The president had a full week of official and campaign events before his hospitalization Friday.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Perris Jones Reporter OKLAHOMA CITY  #8212; State lawmakers held an interim study examining what changes can be made to hold law enforcement officers more accountable in Oklahoma.  #8220;Seriously, by God #8217;s grace, if we cannot get something done at the Oklahoma state Capitol that #8217;s substantial as it relates to law enforcement reform, then I don #8217;t think we #8217;re serving all of our citizens properly, #8221; state Rep. Regina Goodwin said. Advertisement Goodwin didn #8217;t mince her words Tuesday afternoon during the study on law enforcement reform in Oklahoma.  #8220;I #8217;m tired of talking. I #8217;m tired of task forces. I #8217;m saying what legislation can we pass that #8217;s significant? #8221; Goodwin said.  #8220;Black folks have been disproportionately killed by police, arrested by police or victims of excessive force, so we have to look at those numbers. #8221; She said she #8217;s looking for help on both sides of the aisle to look at changes to policing. The study included discussions about body cameras, excessive force, collective bargaining agreements and a database for officers with previous excessive force violations.  #8220;If they were fired and let go, why do they get to just go to another county and wreak havoc on another community? #8221; Goodwin said. One of the key speakers pointed out how qualified immunity reform is key in police reform, and that includes rules that keep officers from being sued. He said even though a small minority of officers are committing egregious misconduct, all officers suffer reputational loss when they avoid accountability. Goodwin told KOCO 5 that she expects pushback, but it won #8217;t stop her from pushing for change.  #8220;We #8217;ve got to keep trying. That #8217;s why we #8217;re here, and I would not be doing my job if I gave up, #8221; Goodwin said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By: Barry Mangold The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported 738 patients with COVID-19 are in a hospital, a new high for the state. #160; A majority of the patients are in Oklahoma and Tulsa Counties, with 233 and 185 each, respectively. #160; On Tuesday, Oklahoma Commissioner of Health Lance Frye reassured the State Board of Health that hospitals have open beds. #160;  #8220;I #8217;ve taken a look at all that thoroughly and can say that we still have capacity in the state, we #8217;re still doing okay, #8221; Frye said in the virtual meeting. #160; The number of hospitalized patients has grown in recent months. Tuesday #8217;s total is the first to break 700 since the start of the pandemic. #160; According to the OSDH daily report, 14% of intensive care beds and 18% of medical surgery beds were available in hospitals across the state. #160; Frye said the state expected case numbers to go up months ago when the state relaxed closures meant to prevent the spread of the virus. #160;  #8220;We knew that once people started moving around the numbers would come back up, inevitably. So, we wanted to be prepared for those. Luckily, we have been. Even though our numbers have gone up, we #8217;ve maintained hospital capacity, #8221; he said. #160; Dr. George Monks, the president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association said the rise in hospitalizations is concerning ahead of the winter season. #160;  #8220;We're entering flu season now with the hospital system being strained, #8221; Monks said.  #8220;You have to go get your flu vaccination this year. It #8217;s really important, we have to save as many beds as possible for those COVID patients. #8221; #160; LaWanna Halstead, the vice president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association said staffing is a concern going forward. #160;  #8220;Hospitals are currently very busy with both COVID patients and other members of the community needing health care. Our biggest issue is having the staff to take care of patients, #8221; Halstead said. #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by Erika Stanish OKLAHOMA CITY, OK  #8212; Months ago, the federal government gave the state of Oklahoma $1.5 billion in COVID-19 Relief Funds to cover necessary expenditures incurred due to the pandemic. FOX 25 investigates looked into how the state has spent some of the money and talked with several state agencies on how some of the charges qualified as COVID-19 expenses. Gov. Kevin Stitt announced the state would be transparent with its spending, posting a detailed report online. We went through thousands of charges, learning most was spent on medical items like PPE and testing kits, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, and telemedicine costs. Other charges include boosting inmate morale, updating the state website, and paying for large takeout meals. "This pandemic has provided an additional strain on everybody. Our inmate population is no exception to that," Justin Wolf said, communication director for the Department of Corrections (DOC). We found the DOC purchased items like DVD rentals, popcorn, and salt for inmates, totaling over $10,000. Wolf said during the shutdown, the DOC made the decision to end inmate visitation and programs, adding mental and emotional stress to inmates. "Suspending visitation wasn #8217;t a decision we made lightly, but it was a necessary one for inmate safety and unfortunately, that produces an additional strain on our inmate population," Wolf said. "Anytime our inmates are stressed or frustrated, that #8217;s just, it provides additional challenges for staff who interact with them on a daily basis. That #8217;s no different than it would be in an office setting where stress makes things more difficult." "At the same time, when we restrict volunteer access, volunteers are responsible for running a lot of our programs that provide our inmates not only function rehabilitation skills but also a good way to productively use their time. When you have an inmate, who is maybe trying to battle his addiction by going through a program, it #8217;s additionally frustrating when that program is no longer available and that inmate now has an abundance of free time to try and stay productive without that support structure," Wolf said. Other purchases included board games and a video game system. "Things like that are just some of the tools we have to help provide distractions and ways they can utilize their time that aren #8217;t counterproductive," Wolf said. According to the Department of the Treasury, "COVID-19-related expenses of maintaining state prisons and county jails, including as relates to sanitation and improvement of social distancing measures, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions." "Those (charges) are in direct response to the pandemic," Wolf said. One of the biggest expenses FOX 25 found on the list included $15 million to update state agency websites. "Over the course of the pandemic, we have recognized the need to better enable remote work for state employees and remote access to services for our citizens, especially our vulnerable population. The CARES FORWARD team implemented the Citizen Online Access grant, which allocates $36 million in CRF funds to support approximately 26 state agencies that provide the most critical citizen services. These funds will help these agencies improve remote access to their services in order to facilitate social distancing and allow Oklahomans to more safely and effectively access online support during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Baylee Lakey, spokesperson for the CARES FOWARD team. The Office of Management and Enterprise Services told FOX 25 the website upgrades will: - Create a seamless online experience for Oklahoma citizens when they engage with pandemic-impacted state agencies; -Allow the state workforce to work remotely without major impacts to business process or services provided for Oklahomans; -Create efficient, consistent, and reliable communication channels to Oklahoman's in the event of another statewide emergency. 25 state agencies have been selected as the first to be modernized. Those agencies are Oklahoma.gov, Oklahoma State Department of Health. Center for the Advancement of Science  amp; Technology (OCAST), Department of Public Safety, Oklahoma Corporation Commission, Department of Corrections, Department of Veteran Affairs, Office of Juvenile Affairs, Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Department of Transportation, Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, Office of Management and Enterprise Services, Office of Emergency Management, CareerTech, Office of the Medical Examiner, Oklahoma Election Board, Teachers Retirement system, Oklahoma Real Estate Commission, Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority, Oklahoma Health COVID-19 Information, Oklahoma Healthcare Authority, Oklahoma Rehabilitation Services, Department of Human Services, Oklahoma Tax Commission and the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. "The main criteria for selection were simply the agency websites that were most impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and interface the most with Oklahomans. More website modernizations will follow in the future, but it is most imperative that these sites are prioritized as they impact the largest amount of Oklahomans in need. Modernizations to these sites are on pace to be completed by the end of the year. We look forward to the possibility of more websites being added to this list," said Caden Cleveland, OMES director of legislative  amp; public affairs. FOX 25 also found charges made by the Governor's Joint Task Force totaling more than $20,000 on meals, including a nearly $7,000 bill for Swadley's BBQ. According to the Dept. of the Treasury, "Expenses for food delivery to residents, including, for example, senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions." We reached out to the governor's office to ask how many people are on the Joint Task Force and why so much money was spent. We have yet to hear back. There's $914 million left in CARES Act money that the state can use on COVID related expenses. Last week, FOX 25 asked the governor #8217;s office what plans they have for the remaining money. We have yet to hear back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by Erika Stanish OKLAHOMA CITY, OK  #8212; Months ago, the federal government gave the state of Oklahoma $1.5 billion in COVID-19 Relief Funds to cover necessary expenditures incurred due to the pandemic. FOX 25 investigates looked into how the state has spent some of the money and talked with several state agencies on how some of the charges qualified as COVID-19 expenses. Gov. Kevin Stitt announced the state would be transparent with its spending, posting a detailed report online. We went through thousands of charges, learning most was spent on medical items like PPE and testing kits, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, and telemedicine costs. Other charges include boosting inmate morale, updating the state website, and paying for large takeout meals. "This pandemic has provided an additional strain on everybody. Our inmate population is no exception to that," Justin Wolf said, communication director for the Department of Corrections (DOC). We found the DOC purchased items like DVD rentals, popcorn, and salt for inmates, totaling over $10,000. Wolf said during the shutdown, the DOC made the decision to end inmate visitation and programs, adding mental and emotional stress to inmates. "Suspending visitation wasn #8217;t a decision we made lightly, but it was a necessary one for inmate safety and unfortunately, that produces an additional strain on our inmate population," Wolf said. "Anytime our inmates are stressed or frustrated, that #8217;s just, it provides additional challenges for staff who interact with them on a daily basis. That #8217;s no different than it would be in an office setting where stress makes things more difficult." "At the same time, when we restrict volunteer access, volunteers are responsible for running a lot of our programs that provide our inmates not only function rehabilitation skills but also a good way to productively use their time. When you have an inmate, who is maybe trying to battle his addiction by going through a program, it #8217;s additionally frustrating when that program is no longer available and that inmate now has an abundance of free time to try and stay productive without that support structure," Wolf said.

    <TEXT>CLEVELAND -- The first presidential election I voted in was George W. Bush v. John Kerry in 2004. I was 21. I had turned 18 in 2001 so I couldn #8217;t vote in the infamous 2000  #8220;hanging chad #8221; election. I was anxious to have a voice this time around. Even though I was a political science major, I wouldn #8217;t have considered myself a political junkie. I watched the news. I knew the candidates. But I didn #8217;t read their platforms or anything. I figured I didn #8217;t need to because I was a single-issue voter. What was my single issue? Racism. All that mattered to me in my first opportunity to vote for a president of the United States was that my vote didn #8217;t go to either: 1) a candidate who was racist; or 2) a candidate who racists like. That was the bar. This was only three years after 9/11, so most Americans were still very concerned about national security. Me? I was more concerned about how, since 9/11, officers of the newly created Transportation Security Administration seemed to always select me for a  #8220;random search #8221; every time I went through the airport. Was it surprising? No. But, was it infuriating? Yes. I rarely saw white people get  #8220;randomly selected. #8221; It felt racist. You can also probably guess who my first vote went to. I knew President Bush had, on multiple occasions, refused to speak at the NAACP annual convention. I knew he #8217;d refused to condemn the Confederate flag in South Carolina. You can argue he wasn #8217;t racist, but I think you have to admit, Bush was the one the racists liked. Case closed for me. The next two presidential elections were an easy choice for me. I don #8217;t think I have to explain why. The 2016 presidential election was interesting, but not a very hard choice. It was interesting because Hillary Clinton #8217;s 1996  #8220;superpredators #8221; speech was clearly racist. I don #8217;t see how someone can reasonably argue otherwise. Normally, that would have prohibited her from getting my vote. But luckily for her, the other candidate was Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump #8217;s firms and/or his family #8217;s firms had been sued in the  #8217;70s,  #8217;80s, and  #8217;90s for allegedly racist business practices. He was quoted in a 1991 book as saying  #8220;laziness is a trait in Blacks. #8221; When asked about the book in 1997, Trump said the stuff the author wrote was  #8220;probably true, #8221; although two years later he said the quote was  #8220;made up. #8221; In 2004, he fired a Black guy on the Apprentice after criticizing him for his  #8220;unbelievable education. #8221; In 2011, he was the most famous proponent of the racist theory that Barack Obama was not an American citizen. Eric Foster is a columnist for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com. This was all before he ran. It only continued when he got in the race. Two weeks after his campaign announcement, the Daily Stormer, one of the most prominent online places for white nationalists and anti-Semites, endorsed his candidacy. Renowned white supremacist David Duke said,  #8220;Voting for these people, voting against Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage. #8221; On his Twitter account, Trump retweeted a graphic with phony crime statistics that said 81% of white homicide victims in 2015 were killed by Blacks. A January 2016 analysis of his Twitter account found that 62% of the accounts Trump had retweeted recently had  #8220;white-supremacist connections. #8221; Needless to say, on balance, I had to go with Hillary in 2016. She definitely made a racist statement, but racists were endorsing Trump like I was endorsing Obama in 2008. Like he was one of their own. No way I can vote for the same person as David Duke. Nope. Pass. Hillary Clinton. Final answer. That brings us to 2020. To be honest, I have that same 2016 feeling. In the  #8217;70s, Joe Biden aligned himself with segregationists who opposed court-ordered busing to integrate schools. He has a lengthy history of  #8220;tough on crime #8221; bills, even before the 1994 crime bill. In 2007, Biden described then-Sen. Barack Obama as  #8220;the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean...." Just this year, at a convention for Black and Hispanic journalists, Biden claimed,  #8220;Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community...." He can clearly use some diversity, equity, and inclusion training. But like Hillary, he #8217;s got the benefit of running against the Donald. On Sept. 29 in Cleveland, during the first nationally televised presidential debate of the season, President Trump was asked to condemn white supremacists. Instead of doing so, he said,  #8220;Proud Boys  #8212; stand back and stand by. #8221; For those who don #8217;t know, the Proud Boys are a far-right extremist group with ties to white nationalism. They greatly appreciated the shoutout. So here I am again. The single-issue voter. The answer is clear. Donald Trump is a racist. And because of that, the racists love him. Therefore, he cannot get my vote. Biden it is. I don #8217;t think I am alone in this being my most important issue. I think it is most important for a large majority of the people who look like me. In 2004, Kerry got 88% of the Black vote. Obama got 95% his first time, in 2008, and 93% his second time. Hillary got 89%. These kinds of numbers suggest to me that the decision for presidential candidate tends not to be a difficult one for Black voters. If the racists like you, how can we like you? The bar really is that low. Now, I wish it wasn #8217;t this way. I wish that I could take a more nuanced approach to presidential elections which involves researching platforms and policies and comparing and contrasting across a variety of issues. But I can #8217;t. I can #8217;t because racism is still very much alive in the United States. And I, and people who look like me, are the ones who bear the brunt of its continued existence. As long as racism exists, there is no other issue which takes priority. Racism has always been on my ballot. It is on the ballot again in 2020. Please vote accordingly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Associated Press, Chip Yost Mike Pence and Kamala Harris do not have a tough act to follow. The vice presidential debate set for Wednesday night follows the disorderly prime-time spectacle last week that had viewers of President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden #8217;s matchup bemoaning the moderator #8217;s inability to shut off a candidate #8217;s microphone. As vice president Pence has worked to level Trump #8217;s roughshod style and steer his response to the coronavirus pandemic. He will face a U.S. senator known for sharp questioning who has made it clear she wants to invoke her prosecutorial chops on the debate stage. The handling of the pandemic and the contraction of COVID-19 by the president, along with several others in the White House, will almost literally be center stage. Pence and Harris are expected to be separated by a plexiglass shield to reduce the risk of virus transmission. The debate starting at 9 p.m. EDT at the University of Utah is the only matchup scheduled between Pence and Harris. What to watch: COVID-19 Expect Pence and Harris to have starkly different assessments of the way the Trump administration has responded to the virus that #8217;s killed more than 210,000 Americans. Pence has led the White House #8217;s coronavirus task force, taking a high-profile spot at White House briefings, projecting an aura of calm and empathy rarely made by his boss. Harris, the former California attorney general, is likely to cross-examine Pence on the early response to the virus, the Trump campaign #8217;s decision to resume holding large rallies and the president #8217;s frequently cavalier attitude toward the disease. RACE Before Harris became the first Black woman to appear on a major party #8217;s presidential ticket, she had one of her most striking moments in the Democratic presidential primary when she questioned Biden for once opposing the federally mandated busing of students to desegregated schools. As she faces off with Pence, who is white, expect her to address Trump #8217;s comments at the last debate where he demurred when was asked to condemn white supremacy, along with his remark that there were  #8220;very fine people #8221; on both sides of a 2017 protest by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a counterprotester was killed. The GOP #8217;s push to quickly fill a Supreme Court seat once held by the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg could energize voters who see abortion, health care and other major issues on the line. Pence has emphasized his conservative Christian beliefs and anti-abortion stance on the campaign trail and portrayed Democrats as a threat to religious freedom. Harris, a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, set to hold a hearing on Trump #8217;s nominee, has been a staunch defender of abortion rights. A statement this week from two conservative justices raised new criticism of the court #8217;s 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested the court needs to revisit the decision. The move underlines liberals #8217; fears and conservatives #8217; excitement about the potential reshaping of the court. Harris has been a staunch defender of same-sex marriage. Pence, as Indiana governor in 2015, drew national attention for signing a law that allowed business owners to deny service to gay people for religious reasons. FUTURE PROSPECTS Pence is considered a potential successor to Trump and a likely 2024 presidential candidate. He brings executive experience as Indiana governor and vice president and would instantly be a leading contender if he jumps into the GOP race. Harris has only elevated her profile since joining the Biden ticket and is expected to mount another run for the presidency in the future. That could come as soon as 2024 as Biden hasn #8217;t committed to running for a second term if he wins this year. Look for whether Pence and Harris set the stage for their own political ambitions. GENDER DYNAMICS Unlike the last debate, with two men and a male moderator, Wednesday #8217;s debate features Harris, the fourth woman to ever appear on a major party #8217;s presidential ticket, and a female moderator in Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today. The Trump-Pence campaign is working to make inroads with female voters and suburban women in particular. Harris has made her own appeal on the campaign trail, telling voters that a Supreme Court challenge to the national health care law could end insurance coverage for birth control and enable insurers to treat pregnancy as a preexisting condition. SAFETY MEASURES Though Pence has not tested positive for COVID-19, his recent exposure to people who have led the Biden-Harris campaign to request a see-through barrier separating the candidates as a precaution against possible transmission. They will also be stationed more than 12 feet apart. Don #8217;t expect them to wear masks or shake hands. As with the previous debate, they #8217;re expected to have a limited in-person audience. TRUMP Though the president won #8217;t be on the debate stage, he #8217;s resumed his frequent Twitter habit since returning to the White House on Monday after spending three days in a military hospital for COVID-19 treatment. The president, an avid cable TV news viewer, may chime in via tweet as the debate unfolds. HOW TO WATCH: The 90-minute debate will be divided into nine 10-minute segments without commercial breaks. It will be aired on major networks and cable news channels, including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, PBS, NBC, MSNBC and C-SPAN. Most of the networks will offer a way to watch the debate live online, through their apps and accounts on YouTube and other social media channels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How many times do we have to write about the need to take care of our 9/11 first responders? How many times do we have to fight for funding for the health care of those who ran into danger after the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, and then spent months breathing in toxic dust at Ground Zero? Just when we thought these battles were over, here we are again. The federal government has taken nearly $4 million from the New York Fire Department's WTC health program because of a bureaucratic mess-up that began a stunning 16 years ago. Everyone knows the funds shouldn't have been taken from the health program. But for some reason, officials have been unable to clean up the situation and restore the funds. We are here because multiple New York City agencies use the same taxpayer identification number and because another part of city government owes the federal government money. Somehow, though, the Treasury Department clawed back the funds by taking money from a program that helps 9/11 first responders. There's some finger-pointing going on, too, as the Treasury Department notes that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is responsible for some of the offsets. But it shouldn't matter. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin should take the lead and find a way to make sure the money is returned to the program today. Instead, federal officials have worked out a way not to charge the program further. That's nice  #8212; but it doesn't go far enough. This can't wait until the FDNY program runs out of money. Mnuchin should coordinate with CMS and find a way to fully reimburse the FDNY health program  #8212; now.  #8212; The editorial board  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OKLAHOMA CITY  #8212; Oklahoma #8217;s fifth congressional district is a close race to watch. According to SoonerPolls, State Senator Stephanie Bice (R) is leading in her effort to win the seat by one point, meanwhile, another recent poll showed incumbent Congresswoman Kendra Horn (D) ahead by over seven points. The election results, one could argue, are up in the air. Each candidate has strong support from both sides, as they #8217;re considered relatively moderate compared to the more extreme politicians from their respective parties. With barely five weeks left until the November elections, Free Press will be providing coverage of races in the Oklahoma City metro area in depth. By doing so, we will give readers a better understanding of the choices you have on November 3. CD-5 General Election Stephanie Bice has been serving in the Oklahoma state senate since 2014. Most Oklahomans might know the senator for her work on changing liquor laws in the state. Bice wrote State Question 792, which modernized liquor laws in Oklahoma. The senator has been fighting hard for this chance to represent Oklahoma in D.C., as she faced businesswoman Terry Neese in an intense runoff in August. During the runoff, revealing reports showed Neese #8217;s questionable past business practices, and even Bice was attacked with an ad that accused her of supporting Harvey Weinstein through her policy making. Medicaid expansion In a phone interview, Free Press asked Bice about her stance on State Question 802  #8211; state medicaid expansion. The senator made it clear that she was not a supporter of it.  #8220;Like many other federal programs, changes in the future could impact the costs to the state of Oklahoma, #8221; Senator Bice told us.  #8220;If you #8217;re familiar with the structure currently, it is a 90/10 match  #8211; 90% paid by the feds, 10% by the state but there #8217;s no guarantee that that #8217;s going to be the case in the future. #8221; She went on to explain that Medicaid expansion is now inscribed in Oklahoma #8217;s constitution by virtue of passing SQ802. And she is concerned that if the federal government were to change its policies on how much it was to match the state in Medicaid support (i.e. changing to 70/30 instead of 90/10), then Oklahoma would be in more financial distress. Affordable Care Act When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, Bice believes that it has inhibited healthcare providers from providing affordable options and she claimed that it has consequently increased premiums. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation study, premiums for exchange-based plans nationally rose by roughly two percent in 2015, and currently, in Oklahoma, there are only two healthcare providers available under the ACA, which is a problem in Bice #8217;s view.  #8220;Looking to find ways to increase competition, which will drive down costs, is one of the key factors in looking at a replacement for the ACA program, #8221; Bice told us. The senator believes that there is a way to ensure that parts of the ACA, like lowering prescription drug prices and protecting those with preexisting conditions, is possible. However, she explained that the concrete steps for achieving this type of affordable healthcare with also less regulations for healthcare providers is complicated.  #8220;You have to look at increasing competition, and the reason that we have so many insurance companies that have left the market place is because the people that are on the exchange right now are typically unhealthy and they #8217;re driving up costs, #8221; she explained.  #8220;You need to be able to provide insurance for all Oklahomans and that means both healthy and unhealthy without penalties for not doing so. #8221; The road ahead Recently, a website titled  #8220;Can #8217;t Count on Bice, #8221; launched, providing critical takes on the senator. The site highlights how she voted for a budget raise for herself during the pandemic and accused her of  #8220;being silent, #8221; and not protecting Oklahomans #8217; health insurance due to the current fight to repeal the ACA in the supreme court. * *more in the article</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By Sabrina Eaton WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, told reporters on Wednesday that he expects a landslide presidential election victory for former Vice President Joe Biden that will oust numerous Republican Senators and make Brown chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Brown said President Donald Trump #8217;s decision to return to the White House and work maskless despite his coronavirus diagnosis risks infecting  #8220;the valets and the butlers and the food service people and the custodians and all the people that work around the White House," and shows he is  #8220;unraveling," He predicted Trump #8217;s unpopularity will hurt down-ballot Republicans enough to shift control of the U.S. Senate to Democrats. Republicans currently hold 53 of its 100 seats. Democrats hold 45, but typically control 47 votes because a pair of independents caucus with them. Brown said races in Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Iowa, Montana and Colorado could well break for Democrats. Republican-held seats in Alaska, Kansas, Texas, Kentucky and Mississippi would be harder to win, but he said are  #8220;more and more in play. #8221; The only Democrat-held seat that he believes will be hard to defend is in Alabama. Neither of Ohio #8217;s two U.S. Senators are up for re-election this year.  #8220;(Senate Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell essentially says to American voters and Trump says to American voters  #8216;You #8217;re on your own when it comes to this coronavirus,' #8221; Brown said.  #8220;People are going to resist that and vote people out of office that are so uncaring and so incompetent." Brown, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, says he would immediately work on emergency rental assistance to prevent mass evictions during the coronavirus pandemic if Democrats take control and he becomes its chairman.  #8220;A fourth of people who rent in this country spend more than half their money on housing, and their rent and utilities, #8221; said Brown.  #8220;They get a small injury at work, they miss a week of work and everything #8217;s upside down. They can lose their apartment and then everything gets worse, and that just shouldn #8217;t be happening in this country. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Brent Skarky OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR)  #8211; There is a state question on the ballot next month that legislators say will help pay for Medicaid expansion, but opponents say it #8217;s taking money away from the fight to stop smoking in Oklahoma. Back in June, voters approved a state question that will expand Medicaid. Now, state law makers are looking for ways find an estimated $250 million dollars to pay for it. Their proposed solution is to redirect incoming money from the state #8217;s tobacco settlement.  #8220;If we can #8217;t start finding sources to pay for this health care, #160; education is going to take a hit, #8221; Senator Kim David, the Republican from Porter said about the state question she authored, 814. Each year #160;since 1998, the state gets a payment #160;from Big Tobacco. Last year, it was about $67 million. 75% of that goes to into the TSET fund while the other 25% goes directly to the state. TSET then makes interest off that endowment. Last year it totaled $47 million, which is their current yearly budget. #160; State question 814 would flip-flop the percentages, putting 75% of the new revenue into the general health care fund #160;to help Medicaid expansion and 25% to the TSET fund.  #8220;This is strictly new money coming in. I wanted to make sure that their fund could continue to grow and it didn #8217;t stagnate, #8221; said David. But TSET advocates say those Big Tobacco dollars need to stay where they are.  #8220;TSET has been very effect in reducing smoking prevalence in Oklahoma, #8221; said Matt Glanville with the American Cancer Society and the group  #8220;NO on 814. #8221; He says TSET programs like their #160;marketing campaign and Tobacco Help Hotline have helped cut overall smoking in our state by 8% and by almost 17% among Oklahoma teens.  #8220;We are one of the leading states in youth use in e-cigarette. TSET needs to be able to combat that, #8221; said Glanville.  #8220;All of those Tobacco cessation programs that they currently pay for will now be covered under Medicaid, #8221; said David. Senator David says with COVID-19 causing more unemployment, there are more Oklahomans without healthcare insurance, which means Medicaid expansion could cost more than initially anticipated. And with state tax revenues low thanks to the pandemic and the global dip in oil prices #8230;  #8220;I don #8217;t want to take money out of education to help pay for healthcare when we have a whole fund coming into the state who #8217;s whole purpose of that fund is to pay for healthcare for that population, #8221; said David.  #8220;I think it #8217;s the right way to expand Medicaid expansion, #8221; said Governor Kevin Stitt. Governor Stitt says under State Question 814, TSET #8217;s $47 million budget won #8217;t be cut, it just won #8217;t grow as fast.  #8220;This state question doesn #8217;t touch the billion dollar corpus, it only touches the new money coming in, #8221; said Stitt. But opponents of 814 say there are other ways to pay for Medicaid expansion.  #8220;We are not making a true new investment in public health in Oklahoma. We are simply playing a shell game with public health monies, #8221; said Glanville. Oklahoma voters will decide what will happen to the funds on Nov. 3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The latest White House Coronavirus Report for Oklahoma shows the state in the "red zone" for cases by population and test positivity. OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH)  #8212; Coronavirus cases in Oklahoma remain elevated, according to the latest White House report released Wednesday. The report, dated October 4, shows Oklahoma remaining in the "red zone" for both cases per 100,000 residents, and for test positivity. While the numbers did trend down for the state compared to last week's report, Oklahoma was still 10th in the nation in cases per population, and had the 5th highest test positivity rate. "Community transmission has remained high across the state for the past month, with many preventable deaths," reads the report. Under the recommendations section, the report says masks "must be worn indoors in all public settings," but stops short of calling for an outright mask mandate. The report called on the state to increase messaging about the effectiveness of masks, limit the size of social, indoor gatherings, and to "keep testing at high levels." There were also specific recommendations to increase testing and tracing efforts on college campuses, and to provide more outreach to Native communities. Governor Kevin Stitt was not pleased with this week's report. In a statement from his office, the governor particular issue with the line "many preventable deaths." The governor vehemently disputes the editorial opinion included in this week #8217;s Coronavirus Task Force report. Our office immediately reached out to the White House for clarification and was assured that language was not unique to Oklahoma, but rather was included in the reports for dozens of states.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MANCHESTER, Tenn. (WZTV)  #8212; A Tennessee judge has been reprimanded and admitted to making a racially insensitive comment while in the courtroom. The State of Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct issued the reprimand late last month following an ethics complaint filed against Manchester General Sessions Court Judge Jere Ledsinger. According to the reprimand, Judge Ledsinger referenced the Tennessee Supreme Court's requirement on face coverings being worn in court, saying "the Grand Wizard of our Supreme Court said we have to wear these masks." The statement was made in front of criminal defendants in the courtroom, some of whom were African American. The reprimand states Judge Ledsinger issued a letter to the board following the comments, admitting to his statement and stating the comments were intended to "soften any resistance by those present in the courtroom to the requirements of wearing a mask, as we have had negative feedback" on the mandate. The judge admitted he was wrong in the letter and stated he meant no disrespect to anyone. The board's reprimand states as a result of his comments, "once such comments are made, the damage is done." The public reprimand made available by the board was the course of corrective action decided by the board and agreed to by the judge. In closing, the reprimand states "In short, comments such as the one involved here, even if made off-the-cuff and with no intent to be offensive, reflect an ethical lapse that undermines public confidence that our judges are unbiased in fact and appearance."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before we get to his defense of the Trump administration, let's discuss Mike Pence's opposition to a wall. There was something deeply pathetic about the vice president protesting a panel of plexiglass. The barriers had been proposed to protect Pence and his debate opponent, Sen. Kamala Harris, against hypothetical pathogens. The Trump campaign had insisted Pence did not need or want a wall for himself, but, "If Sen. Harris wants to use a fortress around herself, have at it," a Pence spokeswoman told Politico. This dig was meant to paint Harris as unreasonably fearful while obfuscating the reason plexiglass was considered in the first place. Pence had attended a maskless Rose Garden bonanza affiliated with COVID-19 diagnoses for at least 11 attendees, including President Donald Trump  #8212; who may have been infectious during last week's debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. In light of that, the vice president's anti-glass protestations were rather like a burglar breaking into a house and then mocking the owners for installing an alarm. But eventually an agreement was reached: Harris behind one transparent partition and Pence behind another 12 feet away. Glass barriers in place, the vice president began to fog them up. "You're entitled to your opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts," admonished the man speaking on behalf of a president who had, as of July, made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker. "Stop playing politics with people's lives," lectured the man whose boss has implied that citizens' fealty to him is what should determine whether their states receive federal aid. "When you say that what Americans have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices American people have made," scolded Pence, after Harris had not remotely said anything resembling that. What she had said, in fact, was that the administration's actions hadn't worked in halting the spread of a coronavirus pandemic that has now killed more than 200,000 Americans. Pence never raised his voice. His brow was in perpetual solemn furrow. Whenever Harris spoke, his default reaction was to sadly, seriously shake his head. He regularly talked over moderator Susan Page, but he did even that with the smoothness of a practiced politician  #8212; unlike Trump, whose interruptions at last week's debate made him appear unhinged. "It was much more civil," Wolf Blitzer appraised on CNN when the vice-presidential debate was finished. "It was a regular debate, not an emotionally abusive session," Jake Tapper agreed. Would we have expected anything else? Back in Pence's talk-radio days, he was billed as "Rush Limbaugh on decaf." In the current administration, his role is to make people feel OK about voting for Trump by counterbalancing Trump's bombast with comforting blandness. Pence would be in charge of battling coronavirus, he would be the bulwark, he would be the adult in the room. He is all the fervor without the frenzy, all the rancor but in a respectable format. He might have the charisma of a bag of milk, but that was the point: Voters have liked that sort of thing. Pour him in a suit and he's palatable. Harris, meanwhile, was a woman standing in for the 66% of women who, according to a recent poll, prefer Biden to Trump. She gave her fans plenty to talk about and screen-grab in the coming days. At least half a dozen of her phrases were instantly meme-worthy: "I am so glad we went through a little history lesson," which she said with a wide, pained smile, became a ready rejoinder for every woman who has ever felt talked-down-to. But Pence's performance was the real magic trick. He was a man standing up to defend a status quo that has become indefensible. He took the Trump administration's shoddy pandemic response, its mountainous falsehoods, its outsize sense of grievance and its weird conspiracy theories, and he packaged them into something that bordered on normal, something that Blitzer could call "civil." He turned it into a gallon of Lactaid. Pence, one presumes, did not want the plexiglass because the plexiglass might remind people that the nation was sick, in more ways than one. It wouldn't have been normal. And if things didn't seem normal, Mike Pence wouldn't be doing his job. As it happened, the partitions onstage might not have been up to the task of blocking the virus. Epidemiologists who reviewed pictures of them told the New York Times they seemed ineffective. And so Mike Pence's glass wall turned out to be mostly symbolic. Something nervous people had falsely hoped could provide protection against a dangerous virus. Something you can see right through.

    <TEXT>Federal and state law enforcement officials have begun expanded preparations for the possibility of widespread unrest at the polls on Election Day, a response to extraordinarily high tensions among voters and anxieties about safety stoked in part by President Donald Trump. FBI and local officials in several states have been conducting drills, running through worse-case scenarios, setting up command centers to improve coordination on reports of violence and voter intimidation, and issuing public warnings that any crime that threatens the sanctity of a Nov. 3 vote will not be tolerated. The efforts are broader and more public-facing than in past years as fears grow over the potential for violent clashes in cities across the United States. Law enforcement officials say they are not responding to any specific threats or information but are preparing for a host of different scenarios that could play out. Tensions are especially high given the increased political polarization and months of mass demonstrations against racial injustice that have seen violence by the left and right. Gun sales are way up. Six men were arrested after federal officials said they plotted to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., at her vacation home. Experts are concerned that right-wing extremists will be emboldened by Trump's recent refusal to clearly denounce the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group, and instead tell them to  #8220;stand back and stand by. #8221; Gay men have taken over the Proud Boys Twitter hashtag Trump has spent months suggesting without evidence that the election could be rigged. His call to supporters to  #8220;go into the polls and watch very carefully" has election officials worried that unofficial or self-appointed  #8220;monitors #8221; could create chaos and conflict at voting places. Here's the reality behind President Trump's claims about mail voting Mail-in ballot mix-ups: How much should we worry? An FBI official said the agency was considering the current climate of the country in its preparations to ensure safety at the polls, as well as working with other agencies to protect the voting system. The official would not discuss the plans publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Adding to the alarm is the fact this election will be the first in nearly 40 years in which the Republican National Committee isn't barred from coordinated poll-monitoring activities. Democrats fear that could open the door to voter intimidation, the reason the courts have largely prohibited Republicans from poll monitoring since the early 1980s. So far, experts who study extremism say they haven #8217;t seen any open discussion online of plans to instigate violence or interfere with voting. Elon University professor Megan Squire, a computer scientist who studies online extremism, said the far-right extremists she tracks on social media appear to be preparing for trouble  #8212; a  #8220;prepper mindset #8221;  #8212; without citing specifics.  #8220;They #8217;re waiting for something to pop off, #8221; she said.  #8220;It #8217;s like a simmering kind of feeling. #8221; She said the mindset is particularly keen among boogaloo supporters, a loose, anti-government, pro-gun extremist online network. Boogaloo adherents have shown up at protests against COVID-19 lockdown orders and protests over racial injustice, carrying rifles and wearing tactical gear. In one of the internet forums Squire follows, a boogaloo supporter recently discussed plans to stock up on water, food, gasoline and generators in case  #8220;infrastructure goes down and supply lines are cut off. #8221; Squire also said the Proud Boys, a group known for inciting street violence at rallies in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere, appear to be emboldened by Trump's comments, as do less organized and strident figures posting on Facebook. Amazon removes 'stand back and stand by' merchandise The deadly shooting by a heavily armed teenager during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August has fueled  #8220;pro-vigilantism #8221; attitudes among more mainstream conservatives, Squire said. And halfway through 2020, just over 19 million FBI background checks have been done. July hit an all-time high. Background checks are the key barometer of gun sales, but the FBI #8217;s monthly figures also incorporate checks for permits that some states require to carry a firearm. Each background check also could be for the sale of more than one gun. The Justice Department #8217;s civil rights division is responsible for enforcing federal voting rights laws and tasks U.S. attorney #8217;s offices with appointing special election coordinators to handle voting rights cases. The federal government has for decades sent prosecutors and federal observers to polling places to ensure compliance with federal law. Local offices from New Mexico to Florida have been prepping, holding tabletop exercises and pouring over potential security threats. But their jobs are especially fraught this year in part over concerns of politicization. Attorney General William Barr has repeatedly suggested without evidence that there could be widespread mail-in voter fraud, though there is little to back that up. This year, officials from a number of federal law enforcement agencies will be coordinating on Election Day at the FBI #8217;s Strategic Information and Operations Center, a global command center at FBI headquarters, people familiar with the matter said. Justice Department prosecutors from different parts of the agency, including the civil rights and national security divisions, will be on hand to monitor incidents and help coordinate a federal response in the event of violence and threats to election infrastructure or cyberattacks, as well as high-profile incidents at polling places, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Justice Department and Homeland Security Department have sent additional personnel to cities where violence has cropped up during protests. The National Guard has designated military police units in Arizona and Alabama to serve as rapid reaction forces so they can respond quickly to any potential unrest. But the first line of response on Election Day will be local law enforcement. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has launched a hotline that rings directly to assistant district attorneys, who will send detectives to investigate reports of voter suppression or intimidation. He said this week his office will not allow armed groups at the city #8217;s polling places amid growing concerns about voter intimidation by vigilante groups aiming to  #8220;protect the election. #8221; Such groups have caused violence at demonstrations. But Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League #8217;s Center on Extremism, said he has not seen any specific campaigns for groups intending to target polling stations.  #8220;A lot of the chatter that you see is going to be hyperbole, and one of the things we don #8217;t want to do is amplify hyperbole, #8221; he said. Segal said white supremacists often turn to violence  #8220;when they feel like their culture is being taken away, #8221; while militias  #8220;tend to get more antsy when they think their guns are being taken away. #8221; Now he sees a possible threat from a loose coalition of vigilantes and other armed extremists who  #8220;think that their election is going to be taken away. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dillon Richards Reporter OKLAHOMA CITY  #8212; A record 749 people are in Oklahoma hospitals with COVID-19. The state and its hospitals are continuing to learn how to prepare for the virus, in case the number continues to rise. Meanwhile, health leaders say surge plans aren #8217;t yet needed. But they could be in the future. Hospital capacity involves the number of available beds, but it #8217;s bigger than that. It also involves the ability to staff those beds, and that #8217;s where the state may run into trouble.  #8220;Oklahoma in general still has hospital bed capacity, but we do have limitations with respect to staffing, particularly nurse staffing, so that #8217;s a concern, #8221; said Dr. Dale Bratzler, OU Medicine enterprise chief quality officer. Bratzler said Oklahoma isn #8217;t at the point of concern yet, but it #8217;s something worth keeping an eye on  #8211; particularly with hospitalizations hitting a record and more than 200 people in intensive care units with the virus.  #8220;Should we see early flu season - and we #8217;re already seeing a few cases of influenza that have been confirmed in Oklahoma this year, if we were to see an early outbreak of influenza, and it generated a lot of hospitalizations, we could get our hospitals into trouble in a hurry, #8221; Bratzler said. Even if the state never has capacity issues, hospitalization numbers are still high. Many people are fighting the deadly virus, and the path ahead is uncertain.  #8220;One thing that is consistent about COVID-19 is that we cannot predict how any individual person will do. Some people will do just fine and recover rapidly, some people do well for a while, looks like they #8217;re getting better, and suddenly crash, probably because their immune system activates and starts causing that organ damage -- particularly lung damage -- that we hear about, #8221; Bratzler said. Bratzler emphasized that wearing a mask is one of the biggest things a person can do to slow the spread of COVID. And he recommended getting a flu shot as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By: Bonnie Campo OKLAHOMA CITY - A candidate running for a seat in Oklahoma #8217;s House of Representatives said he was assaulted while putting out yard signs Wednesday afternoon. Ben Janloo, a candidate for HD-97, said someone hit him over the head, and he ended up in the hospital with a deep gash to his scalp.  #8220;I already had two poles down, and I was checking my sign, and I don't remember after that, #8221; said Ben Janloo. Oklahoma City police took the report shortly after. The officer questioned if Janloo possibly fainted, but later said the injury appeared to be from blunt force trauma. Right now, there are not any suspects, or witnesses. Family said there are not any cameras with surveillance footage from the intersection of Hefner and Kelley, where the incident occurred.  #8220;I was scared for my dad. He is almost 70. If someone did that to him, it was a sucker move to do to my dad or to anyone else, #8221; said Lisa Janloo.  #8220;The political time this year has been the most hatred anyone has seen. We have gotten a lot of messages and phone calls of them not wanting his signs, or  #8216;take down your signs. #8217; People are so focused on a party label, instead of who the candidate is. #8221; Janloo's opponent in the house race is Representative Jason Lowe. Lowe issued the following statement: "I'm deeply saddened to hear my opponent say that he was hit while putting signs out for his campaign. I don't believe that anyone should be attacked, I pray for his safety, and I wish him a speedy recovery. Mr. Janloo, whether running against me or not, is a constituent, and I believe we all need to ensure that we treat our neighbors the way we want to be treated." Janloo said his team is using this as motivation in the race to improve the district. Also, as a result of the alleged attack, more volunteers helped place more yard signs throughout the day.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; The chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates says it is not reconsidering shifting the second debate from virtual back to in-person, despite a request from President Donald Trump's team. Frank Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press late Thursday that the nonpartisan group #8217;s decision was not going to be reversed. That means the second debate is probably not going to happen at all. The commission decided to make the Oct. 15 debate virtual after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Fahrenkopf says that the group wanted to  #8220;protect the health and safety of all involved" and that the decision was guided by the advice of the Cleveland Clinic, its heath partner for the 2020 debates. Trump #8217;s doctor, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, said in a letter Thursday evening that Trump would be cleared to resume public activities Saturday, 10 days after his diagnosis. Earlier Thursday, Trump balked at the virtual event and said he wouldn't participate. Joe Biden's campaign then said Biden would participate in a town hall hosted by ABC News on Oct. 15</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For years, an ugly underbelly of resistance to authority has festered in America. On Thursday, it was thrust into the open when the FBI arrested six militia members in Michigan and charged them with planning to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the state government. Another seven people were charged under Michigan law with plotting to attack police and start a civil war. The details read like a fictional thriller. One group planned to grab Whitmer from her vacation home, or recruit 200 men to attack the state capitol, kidnap her there, and try her for "treason." They bought a Taser and night goggles, tested an improvised explosive device, and conducted firearms training and combat drills. It #8217;s horrifying. Even more alarming: It #8217;s just one example of a rising tide of armed and violent right-wing extremists, militias and white supremacists plotting to create mayhem, or actually doing so, against those they perceive as enemies. Extremists have long lived in America #8217;s margins. Now they #8217;re bursting into the mainstream, as increasing numbers of people normalize them. That includes President Donald Trump, who refuses to recognize that these groups are the nation #8217;s chief domestic terrorism threat, as FBI director Christopher Wray told Congress last month. Their oxygen comes from social media, which allows them to find each other, organize, and amplify their grievances. The Michigan group communicated using encrypted online apps, raising questions about the need to regulate those platforms. This fetid strain surfaced in the 1990s, most notably when anti-government extremist Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing. This year, militia members have descended on lawful protests. One was arrested in New Mexico. Two Missouri members with a cache of weapons were arrested en route to Kenosha, Wisconsin, the site of police-shooting protests. The Michigan plot was more elaborate, but perhaps not surprising. As Whitmer issued emergency orders to fight the coronavirus, Trump attacked her, tweeting in April, "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!" In May, armed civilians stormed the state capitol protesting Whitmer #8217;s restrictions. By June, an FBI source had infiltrated the group. The agency and other law enforcement bodies stopped the plot, but what else is happening out of sight of watchful trackers? These groups, largely white and largely male, call themselves defenders of the Constitution. They are not. They reflect a growing disrespect for government, and use civil unrest to push their extremist ideologies and the need for armed resistance. They believe that being an American means you can do whatever you want, regardless of the consequences for others, a misguided notion of personal freedom. Now they have a passive champion in the president, who refuses to condemn their efforts to rachet up tension at encounters between police and violent protesters, who told one extremist group to "stand down and stand by," and who asks supporters like these to descend on polling places to monitor voting in November. As our country frays, this is no time for equivocation. Militia members are not principled heroes. Defenders of democracy must call them out.  #8212; The editorial board  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>President Donald Trump's reelection chances are, um  #8212; how to put this  #8212; not great right now. The Economist's model gives him only a 10% chance of winning the electoral college. FiveThirtyEight is only marginally more optimistic, giving him a 17% chance, his lowest odds of the entire campaign. Pennsylvania is viewed as the tipping-point state to get Joe Biden over 270, and a Monmouth poll released Tuesday gives him a lead from 8 to 11 points depending on turnout. That poll is not really an outlier, either. Even columnists who have been hedging on the possibility of a Trump comeback are starting to write things that suggest a blowout. At this moment, with the president badly behind, one would expect him to do whatever it takes to climb back into contention against Biden. One of the things would be a massive fiscal stimulus package that his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for well over a month. Trump advocated for this in ALL CAPS just a few days ago. So have the IMF and Fed Chair Jay Powell. And yet, according to my Washington Post colleagues Erica Werner and Jeff Stein, the president has decided to walk away from negotiations with Democrats: - - - "In a series of tweets posted less than 24 hours after he was released from the hospital, Trump accused Pelosi of failing to negotiate in good faith, after she rejected an opening bid from Mnuchin in their latest round of talks.... " 'I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hard-working Americans and Small Business,' Trump wrote. "The pronouncement was so stunning that Pelosi told Democratic colleagues on a conference call that the president's sudden change in position might be connected to the steroids he's taking as he battles coronavirus." It would be safe to say that Trump's decision flummoxed most observers and Trump allies alike. As the New York Times's Nate Cohn tweeted, in the last NYT/Siena poll, "voters overwhelmingly supported a new $2 trillion dollar stimulus package by a 72-23 percent margin. It's just astonishing that a president trailing by 9 points is going to pass on this opportunity." The NYT's Neil Irwin points out that the lack of a stimulus guarantees mass layoffs in an awful lot of cities located in swing states. Unsurprisingly, the stock market  #8212; Trump's favorite economic indicator  #8212; tumbled on the news. Nate Silver aptly summed up the political implications of Trump's decision: What is going on? Why would Trump decide to walk away from bolstering the one issue where he is competitive with Biden, the issue that resonates with voters the most? Let us consider the possibilities. We can rule out the notion that this is some high-risk, high-upside play for Trump. I predicted he would be engaging in repeated gambles for resurrection back in April. But  #8212; and this cannot be stressed enough  #8212; there is no political upside to this play. There is no framing in which Trump walking away from negotiations at this juncture looks good for him. It is possible that Trump is simply listening to his worst economic advisers. According to Werner and Stein, "some conservative voices had urged Trump to reject a new spending package." These include Art Laffer, who visited the White House last week, and Stephen Moore, who actually told Vox's Jane Coaston over the summer that "sending money to people is not a way to stimulate the economy." But this is a dubious claim as well. Trump tasked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with the negotiations, and Mnuchin pretty clearly preferred cutting a deal. Trump himself suggested he wanted a large stimulus a few hours before ending negotiations. There are three remaining possibilities, and none of them imply anything good for Trump. The first, consistent with my toddler thesis, is that Trump is throwing a tantrum. If the president cannot get what he wants, he will just take his ball and go home to remind everyone that he is still the president. Pelosi's steroid explanation would be consistent with this hypothesis. Toddlers, when they are losing, will often pitch a fit in an attempt to end the game. Another, related hypothesis is that Trump does not want to win reelection. Axios's Alayna Treene and Zachary Basu quoted one Trump campaign adviser saying: "You have to try to be this politically inept. What is going on in the White House?" Reading this quote, I kept flashing back to the opening of this Michael Lewis column about the night Donald Trump won in 2016: - - - "Chris Christie was sitting on a sofa beside Trump when Pennsylvania was finally called. It was 1:35 a.m., but that wasn't the only reason the feeling in the room was odd. Mike Pence went to kiss his wife, Karen, and she turned away from him. "You got what you wanted, Mike," she said. "Now leave me alone." She wouldn't so much as say hello to Trump. Trump himself just stared at the TV without saying anything, like a man with a pair of twos whose bluff has been called. His campaign hadn't even bothered to prepare an acceptance speech. It was not hard to see why Trump hadn't seen the point in preparing to take over the federal government: why study for a test you will never need to take?" - - - This is of a piece with a story that the New York Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni wrote back in June: - - - "The president is acting trapped and defensive, and his self-destructive behavior has been so out of step for an incumbent in an election year that many advisers wonder if he is truly interested in serving a second term. "Rather than focus on plans and goals for another four years in office, Mr. Trump has been wallowing in self-pity about news coverage of him since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, people who have spoken with him said. He has told advisers that no matter what he does, he cannot get 'good' stories from the press, which has often been his primary interest. 'These people,' Mr. Trump has growled to advisers about reporters, throwing an expletive between the two words. "He has complained that nothing he does is good enough, bristling at criticism that he hasn't sufficiently addressed the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by the police in Minneapolis.

    <TEXT>Newsday For years, an ugly underbelly of resistance to authority has festered in America. On Thursday, it was thrust into the open when the FBI arrested six militia members in Michigan and charged them with planning to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the state government. Another seven people were charged under Michigan law with plotting to attack police and start a civil war. The details read like a fictional thriller. One group planned to grab Whitmer from her vacation home, or recruit 200 men to attack the state capitol, kidnap her there, and try her for "treason." They bought a Taser and night goggles, tested an improvised explosive device, and conducted firearms training and combat drills. It #8217;s horrifying. Even more alarming: It #8217;s just one example of a rising tide of armed and violent right-wing extremists, militias and white supremacists plotting to create mayhem, or actually doing so, against those they perceive as enemies. Extremists have long lived in America #8217;s margins. Now they #8217;re bursting into the mainstream, as increasing numbers of people normalize them. That includes President Donald Trump, who refuses to recognize that these groups are the nation #8217;s chief domestic terrorism threat, as FBI director Christopher Wray told Congress last month. Their oxygen comes from social media, which allows them to find each other, organize, and amplify their grievances. The Michigan group communicated using encrypted online apps, raising questions about the need to regulate those platforms. This fetid strain surfaced in the 1990s, most notably when anti-government extremist Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing. This year, militia members have descended on lawful protests. One was arrested in New Mexico. Two Missouri members with a cache of weapons were arrested en route to Kenosha, Wisconsin, the site of police-shooting protests. The Michigan plot was more elaborate, but perhaps not surprising. As Whitmer issued emergency orders to fight the coronavirus, Trump attacked her, tweeting in April, "LIBERATE MICHIGAN!" In May, armed civilians stormed the state capitol protesting Whitmer #8217;s restrictions. By June, an FBI source had infiltrated the group. The agency and other law enforcement bodies stopped the plot, but what else is happening out of sight of watchful trackers? These groups, largely white and largely male, call themselves defenders of the Constitution. They are not. They reflect a growing disrespect for government, and use civil unrest to push their extremist ideologies and the need for armed resistance. They believe that being an American means you can do whatever you want, regardless of the consequences for others, a misguided notion of personal freedom. Now they have a passive champion in the president, who refuses to condemn their efforts to rachet up tension at encounters between police and violent protesters, who told one extremist group to "stand down and stand by," and who asks supporters like these to descend on polling places to monitor voting in November. As our country frays, this is no time for equivocation. Militia members are not principled heroes. Defenders of democracy must call them out.  #8212; The editorial board  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agents foiled a stunning plot to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, authorities said Thursday in announcing charges in an alleged scheme that involved months of planning and even rehearsals to snatch her from her vacation home. Six men were charged in federal court with conspiring to kidnap the governor before the Nov. 3 elections in reaction to what they viewed as her  #8220;uncontrolled power, #8221; according to a federal complaint. Separately, seven others linked to a paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and seek a  #8220;civil war. #8221; The two groups trained together and planned  #8220;various acts of violence, #8221; according to the state police. Surveillance for the kidnapping plot took place in August and September, according to an FBI affidavit, and four of the men had planned to meet Wednesday to  #8220;make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear. #8221; The FBI quoted one of the men as saying Whitmer  #8220;has no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must come to an end. #8221; Authorities said the plots were stopped with the work of undercover agents and informants. The men were arrested Wednesday night. The six charged in federal court face up to life in prison if convicted. The state terrorism charges the other seven men face carry a possible 20-year sentence. Andrew Birge, the U.S. attorney in western Michigan, called the men  #8220;violent extremists. #8221; They discussed detonating explosive devices  #8212; including under a highway bridge  #8212; to divert police from the area near Whitmer #8217;s vacation home and Fox bought a Taser for use in the kidnapping, Birge said.  #8220;All of us in Michigan can disagree about politics, but those disagreements should never, ever amount to violence. Violence has been prevented today, #8221; Detroit U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider told reporters. A few hours later, #160;Whitmer pinned some blame on President Donald Trump, #160;noting that he did not condemn white supremacists in last week #8217;s debate with Joe Biden and instead told a far-right group to  #8220;stand back and stand by. #8221;  #8220;Hate groups heard the president #8217;s words not as a rebuke but as a rallying cry, as a call to action, #8221; Whitmer said. Trump tweeted that the governor  #8220;has done a terrible job #8221; and again called on her to  #8220;open up your state. #8221; He said he does not tolerate any extreme violence. Whitmer, who was considered as Biden #8217;s running mate and is nearly halfway through a four-year term, has been widely praised for her response to the coronavirus but also sharply criticized by Republican lawmakers and people in conservative areas of the state. The Capitol has been the site of many rallies, including ones with gun-toting protesters calling for her ouster. Whitmer put major restrictions on personal movement and the economy, although many of those limits have been lifted since spring. The governor has exchanged barbs with Trump on social media, with the president declaring in April,  #8220;LIBERATE MICHIGAN! #8221; RELATED CONTENT Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met with Biden in 1st known session with a VP contender Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she censors her comments about Trump to ensure federal aid Michigan Gov. Whitmer Focuses on Workers, Health Care in Dem Rebuttal to State of the Union There is no indication in the criminal complaint that the men were inspired by Trump. Authorities also have not publicly said whether the men were angry about Whitmer #8217;s coronavirus orders. The criminal complaint identified the six accused in the plot against Whitmer as Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta, all of Michigan, and Barry Croft of Delaware. All but Croft appeared Thursday in federal court in Grand Rapids. They asked for court-appointed lawyers and were returned to jail to await detention hearings Tuesday. Fox, who was described as one of the leaders, was living in the basement of a vacuum shop in Grand Rapids. The owner said Fox was opposed to wearing a mask during the pandemic and kept firearms and ammunition at the store.  #8220;He was anti-police, anti-government, #8221; Brian Titus told WOOD-TV.  #8220;He was afraid if he didn #8217;t stand up for the Second Amendment and his rights that the country is going to go communism and socialism. #8221; The government said the plot against Whitmer appeared to have roots in a June gathering in Dublin, Ohio, attended by more than a dozen people from several states, including Croft and Fox.  #8220;The group talked about creating a society that followed the U.S. Bill of Rights and where they could be self-sufficient, #8221; the FBI affidavit said.  #8220;They discussed different ways of achieving this goal from peaceful endeavors to violent actions.  #8230; Several members talked about murdering  #8216;tyrants #8217; or  #8216;taking #8217; a sitting governor. #8221; The seven men charged in state court are accused of identifying the homes of law enforcement officers and making violent threats  #8220;intended to instigate a civil war, #8221; Attorney General Dana Nessel said. They were identified as Paul Bellar, 21, of Milford; Shawn Fix, 38, of Belleville; Eric Molitor, 36, of Cadillac; Michael Null, 38, of Plainwell; William Null, 38, of Shelbyville; Pete Musico, 42, and Joseph Morrison, 26, who live together in Munith. According to the affidavit, Musico and Morrison are founding members of the Wolverine Watchmen, which authorities described as  #8220;an anti-government, anti-law enforcement militia group. #8221; At least three of the 13 defendants were among some armed demonstrators who entered the Senate gallery on April 30 following a larger protest outside the Capitol against Whitmer #8217;s stay-at-home order, said Nessel spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney. At the time, a senator said the men shouted down at senators who were meeting amid debate over extending the governor #8217;s emergency declaration. The identities of the three men were not immediately available. The Watchmen have met periodically for firearms and tactical training in remote areas  #8220;to prepare for the  #8216;boogaloo, #8217; a term referencing a violent uprising against the government or impending politically motivated civil war, #8221; state police Det. Sgt. Michael Fink wrote in an affidavit. Some boogaloo promoters insist they are not genuinely advocating for violence. But the boogaloo has been linked to a recent string of domestic terrorism plots, including the arrests of three Nevada men accused of conspiring to incite violence during protests in Las Vegas. Boogaloo supporters have shown up at protests against COVID-19 lockdown orders and racial injustice, carrying rifles and wearing tactical gear over Hawaiian shirts. Michigan became known for anti-government paramilitary activity in the mid-1990s, when a number of loosely affiliated groups began organizing and training in rural areas. They used short-wave radio, newsletters and early internet connections to spread a message of resistance to what they contended was a conspiracy to impose world government and seize guns. They gained notoriety after reports surfaced that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted in the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, had met with group members, although their connections were murky.  #8220;That old militia world is still there, but kind of long in tooth, #8221; said J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University #8217;s Program on Extremism. Nonetheless, rallies at the Michigan Capitol against Whitmer #8217;s shutdown orders were recruiting events for such groups, said MacNab, who monitors their social media activity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LEONARD PITTS JR After three days of receiving treatment for Coronavirus, President Trump returned to the White House. The president climbed the steps to an upper balcony, then removed his mask before saluting the departure of Marine One and walking inside. BY ASSOCIATED PRESS  #8220;Are you not entertained? #8221; Maximus, in  #8220;Gladiator #8221; It helps if you think of it as a show. Granted, it #8217;s a favored conservative trope that liberals are the ones held hostage to so-called  #8220;Hollywood #8221; values. But there is no one who embodies the worst of the dream factory  #8212; of image over substance and overweening self regard  #8212; more than the reality show impresario Trump. He has turned the presidency into a production, stage-managed his office  #8212; and now, his COVID-19 diagnosis  #8212; with the sole aim of boosting his ego and political prospects. People have already died from this. Based on this latest episode, there may well be more to come. It could be a White House butler, chef or janitor. Maybe a body man, a journalist or a Secret Service agent. Maybe some member of Cult 45 who will be persuaded to emulate Dear Leader #8217;s cavalier attitude toward a deadly virus.  #8220;Don #8217;t be afraid of COVID, #8221; tweeted Trump before leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Monday, almost certainly against the advice of his doctors.  #8220;Don #8217;t let it dominate your life. #8221; Someone will likely die from that  #8212; on a ventilator, miserable and alone, gasping out the last of life, as loved ones can only watch via FaceTime or Skype. For whatever it #8217;s worth, it could yet be Trump himself. Because you may lie, deny and deflect to your heart #8217;s content, but eventually, the piper presents her bill. Of course, we all know how Trump treats creditors. So one is hardly shocked that, even after his diagnosis, with at least 14 people in his orbit  #8212; including his wife, his press secretary and former aide Kellyanne  #8220;alternative facts #8221; Conway  #8212; also testing positive, Trump still acts as if COVID-19 is no big deal. He is less concerned with being well than with seeming well, with depicting himself as unbowed and in charge. So you get that aimless motorcade around the hospital  #8212; some poor Secret Service driver trapped with him as he waves at MAGA hats while breathing out disease inside the hermetically sealed presidential vehicle. And you get that picture purporting to show the laziest president in recent history  #8220;working #8221; at the hospital. And you get that return to the White House where he stands on a balcony and makes a dramatic show of removing his mask, then strides his infected body into a building full of government workers. Trump is a living Hollywood facade  #8212; a front with nothing inside. So he resorts to photo ops like those to make him appear rugged and tough, with powers and abilities beyond those of mortal men. It #8217;s all as fake as a Western street on a Universal Studios back lot. Yet he will go to great lengths to make it seem real. Consider how he pressured his doctor, Sean Conley, to give a rosier assessment of his condition than was medically warranted. Conley even embraced his patient #8217;s love of hyperbole, dubbing Trump a  #8220;phenomenal patient, #8221; whatever in the world that might be. It was a dubious performance that cost Conley professional respect; a colleague said he behaved like  #8220;a spin doctor, not a medical doctor. #8221; But never mind, so long as Trump got what he wanted. And never mind the chef, the janitor, the journalist, the Secret Service agent. Never mind 210,000 Americans already dead. Never mind anything but the performer and his performance. You know what they say in Hollywood: The show must go on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It #8217;s election season  #8212; maybe the mostly brutally divisive one ever  #8212; and voters are being flooded with political advertisements and pleas to contribute to campaigns. That leads to questions: Where did that ad come from? Is it truthful? Is it mining my personal data? If I contribute money, will it get to the right place? As shown in the last presidential cycle, in the age of social media it is important to examine who is pulling the strings and what might be their motives. By searching the Herald #8217;s Election Ad Decoder, you can find out who paid for an ad, whether it contains false or misleading content, what data is being collected from you and where your money will go if you give. The Herald also worked extensively with academic experts to identify disinformation, hateful speech, foreign interference and content that promotes violence  #8212; flagging ads as such when they could jeopardize the integrity of the election.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OKLAHOMA CITY, OK  #8212; For decades, Oklahoma County leaders have been working to come up with solutions on how to fix the Oklahoma County Detention Center. In August, Oklahoma County Commissioners approved $34 million in CARES Act Funding to the Criminal Justice Authority to improve the deteriorating building. FOX 25 got an exclusive inside look at the jail to learn just how that money could be spent, starting with the jail lobby.  #8220;That is the fundamental piece of the jail that we #8217;re lacking right now. It #8217;s not clean. It #8217;s not safe because of COVID, because of the bugs and all of that, #8221; Greg Williams said, jail administrator. Currently, Williams said the holding cells are too small.  #8220;These cells are nearly standing room only, #8221; Williams said.  #8220;We have one hundred people a day come in. #8221; Most windows looking into the holding cells are broken and the area is dripping with water from leaks in ceilings and walls.  #8220;Is this a COVID rich environment? I don #8217;t know, but it looks like to me it is! #8221; Williams said. Other plans for the $34 million include updating the jail #8217;s sewage system and return air system. The improvements, William said, can help fight the pandemic by keeping both inmates and employees safe.  #8220;Until you can sanitize things, you know, you #8217;re almost fighting an uphill battle until you can get your sanitation under control, #8221; Williams said. But using the $34 million to build a brand new jail isn #8217;t in the cards just yet Williams told FOX 25.  #8220;I think a lot of questions would need to be asked before we even started that. What kind of jail? How big of a jail? Where are you going to put it? It #8217;s more than the funding. Building a project of jail is a lot more than just money, #8221; Williams said. According to Oklahoma County #8217;s website, total construction cost $52 million. Williams said building a new jail is a conversation for another day, but they must begin to act now before the current jail gets even worse.  #8220;As a community, we aren #8217;t happy with this building, but we have it, and this is what we have. We have to make the best of it and right now, #8221; Williams said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're a woman who has ever participated in any coed business meeting, you've likely experienced being interrupted and dismissed by a man. And you probably weren't surprised that it happens even to women at the highest levels of government and journalism, as we saw with Sen. Kamala Harris and USA Today Editor Susan Page during Wednesday night's vice presidential debate. Vice President Mike Pence talked over the candidate and moderator on several occasions, despite exasperated pushback from both ladies. Pence made it crystal clear his talking points trumped respect and decorum. He certainly proved once again that rules don't matter in his world. Rules that he signed off on to participate in the debate, I might add. "Mr. Vice President, I am speaking," Harris said on one occasion with tactful resistance. "I am speaking," she declared firmly in several other instances, a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for women across the country who have ever felt marginalized and shoved in a corner by men. If Pence is trying to get those suburban women voters who are still on the fence that the Trump team thinks is so important to their victory, acting like a narcissistic know-it-all wasn't the way to do it. He hit a sensitive spot with women all over social media. As one woman on Twitter saw it: "What stood out to me was that Pence felt entitled to be condescending to the female moderator by constantly violating the rules. He felt entitled to interrupt Kamala Harris. He felt entitled to try to control the topics. Women all over America felt his sense of male superiority." Another woman wrote this on the social media platform: "Kamala is giving me all the strength I need to interrupt inept men for the rest of my working life." Some smart men even saw the error of Pence's ways. CNN analyst Van Jones, in a perfect description, called the vice president "mansplainer in chief." Sadly, others just didn't get it. When CNN political analyst Gloria Borger tried to explain what it was like for women to watch Harris get repeatedly steamrollered by Pence, she herself was cut off by fellow panelist Rick Santorum, to which she cried out, "Mr. Santorum, I'm talking." Oh, the irony. Debates certainly come with some tension and fireworks, but when one side is not allowed to make their point that is not fair game. And while Pence doesn't use the same bombastic language as his running mate Donald Trump, his measured tone didn't make what he did any less insulting. Unfortunately, Pence's actions follow a typical pattern of men. A host of academic studies over the years have found that being shut down by men is not uncommon. A 2014 George Washington University study found men interrupt women 33% more often then men. A 2017 study by Tonja Jacobi and Dylan Schweers at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law concluded that "women on the Supreme Court are interrupted at a markedly higher rate during oral arguments than men. Additionally, both male Justices and male advocates interrupt women more frequently than they interrupt other men. In other words, women are more likely to be the interruptee, while men are more likely to be the interrupter." Interruptions are especially the case when women are outnumbered. And let's face it, at certain levels of business, say corporate boardrooms, men are always the majority in the room. Remember when Arianna Huffington rallied to increase the number of women on the board of Uber and another male board member, David Bonderman, said that woman talk too much? Harris kept her composure like most women are forced to do in these situations. You clench your jaw and hold back what you really want to say, or else you face the trope of being overly aggressive  #8212; an unfair image that followed former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. Black women face a double whammy of also being portrayed as the angry Black woman. We are supposed to smile and be cordial even when the other side is throwing verbal bombs. I actually wish Harris would have pushed back more, but understand the delicate balance. As a former prosecutor it must have been pretty tough to hold back. And toward the end of the debate she did "reclaim her time" as Rep. Maxine Waters would say. She politely insisted to Page that she get "equal time" after Pence had cut her off one too many times. And that is what we as women need to do to change the culture of how we are treated. We can't afford to be invisible and must instead get past the fear of being judged and speak up even when it makes us uncomfortable. Even when it is the U.S. vice president. Andrea K. McDaniels is The Baltimore Sun's deputy editorial page editor.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A federal judge in San Diego largely upheld California #8217;s law banning private prisons in a ruling late Thursday, acknowledging that the state has the authority to ensure the health and welfare of federal detainees within its borders. Under the ruling, at least four immigration detention centers with the capacity to house about 5,000 people would be phased out over the coming years. However, the ruling carved out an exception when it comes to privately operated facilities that house pretrial inmates charged with federal crimes who are in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. U.S. District Judge Janis Sammartino issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits the state from enforcing the ban, known as Assembly Bill 32, on those detention centers while litigation on the matter proceeds. Immigrant advocates celebrated the ruling, calling it a  #8220;major rebuke #8221; to both U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and The GEO Group, the for-profit contractor that runs several detention centers in California.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Peyton Yager OKLAHOMA COUNTY (KFOR)  #8211; Oklahoma County Commissioner Kevin Calvey and the Oklahoma Second Amendment Association is suing the Oklahoma County Jail Trust while assuring the commission has the power to keep ICE agents inside the Oklahoma County Detention Center.  #8220;We are going to stand up for ICE in Oklahoma County, #8221; Calvey said.  #8220;We are not California or Portland or Seattle. #8221; Jail Trust votes to move forward with allocating CARES Act funding Calvey says he #8217;s sticking to his word. Friday afternoon, Calvey filed a lawsuit, looking for a judge #8217;s stamp of approval. Calvey writes,  #8220;Oklahoma is not a sanctuary state #8221; and  #8220;state law allows jails to keep ICE-detained inmates in custody, even if there #8217;s no other legal reason. #8221;  #8220;We stand up for law enforcement here, #8221; Calvey said.  #8220;I will not let these extremists keep us from doing so. #8221;  #8220;You are tearing families apart, #8221; a public commenter said at Monday #8217;s commissioner meeting.  #8220;Why didn #8217;t you get an opinion before you did this? #8221; RELATED CONTENT Jail Trust votes to move forward with allocating CARES Act funding Flashpoint team discusses controversial jail trust vote for CARES funding Protests continue as jail trust accepts CARES Act funds Oklahoma County Jail Trust could vote to accept $34 million in CARES Act money Protesters outraged after OK County commissioners vote to send $34 million in CARES Act money to jail trust Oklahoma County Commissioners approve sending CARES funding to jail trust Jail Trust officially takes over from Oklahoma County Sheriff #8217;s Office It #8217;s been a battle of who has the ultimate power. The Jail Trust initially voted to remove ICE agents from the jail 4-2, but it turns out the vote didn #8217;t count because there wasn #8217;t a five-person majority. Then, Commissioner Calvey added the issue to the County Commissioner agenda himself. In a vote 2-1, the commission voted to keep ICE agents. Flashpoint team discusses controversial jail trust vote for CARES funding The topic has been a controversial conversation because Calvey sits on both boards, but he claims the commission trumps the trust.  #8220;We do have the authority, #8221; Calvey said.  #8220;It #8217;s in the lease agreement. Every nation on earth restricts immigration. Every single one of them. #8221; Commissioner Carrie Blumert voted against keeping ICE agents. She tells KFOR she reached out to Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater to see if the commission has authority over the trust, but she says she hasn #8217;t heard back. KFOR also reached out to Calvey, but has yet to receive a response.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>America is in peril. Our nation is buffeted by crises, and the warning lights are flashing red. We need a president with experience and character, someone who can extinguish the flames and rebuild the foundation. America needs Joe Biden. The former vice president believes that we can find our way back from the precipice, that progress can be made, and must be made, by working with the other side. That #8217;s essential to solving our baseline crisis  #8212; the way our nation is being torn apart by our differences. Biden #8217;s promise to work with Republicans, a hallmark of his 36 years in the U.S. Senate, should be celebrated. Our politics are rancid, festering with division and confrontation on nearly every issue. Finding some semblance of bipartisanship will help us deal with other problems. Failing to do that will doom us. Biden repeatedly promised to represent every American, not just those who voted for him. His faith in America and Americans is inspiring, and it #8217;s a message that #8217;s right for these times. As a nation, we face a host of epochal problems. The health and economic impacts of the coronavirus. Rising economic inequality. Racial disparities in criminal justice, health, education, the environment and the economy. The existential threat of climate change. The rise of authoritarianism around the world, and a dangerous surge at home in the belief that government is the oppressor and individual freedom is an end in itself. These are complex problems. Some demand fundamental changes. Some beg for a return to the values that long guided this nation. In this regard, Biden is much more than the candidate who is not Donald Trump. He brings a skill set and a big toolbox forged by a lifetime of experience. Biden, the 77-year-old Democrat from Delaware, has been here before. As vice president, he and President Barack Obama inherited the Great Recession and guided the country on the long road back. Their stimulus plan helped spark 78 consecutive months of job growth, producing 1.5 million more jobs in their last three years than in Trump #8217;s first three years. The unemployment rate dropped from 10% to less than 5%. Now as then, Biden is promoting a big infrastructure initiative to get Americans back to work. This time he is smartly marrying his $2 trillion plan to clean energy and climate change, whose effects threaten Long Island with rising seas and flooding. Biden, who also helped successfully handle the Ebola epidemic in 2014, including the preparation of a pandemic response playbook ignored by the Trump administration, has been rightly critical of the president #8217;s response to the coronavirus. Biden would encourage mask mandates and social distancing, develop a strong trace-test-isolate program, and institute new lockdowns if necessary. And he would let science and scientists determine whether a vaccine is effective and when it can be distributed. Biden believes in the capacity of government to do good. He would restore and maintain the norms of democracy and decency that have allowed this republic to function for 240 years. And he would criticize and hold to account the world #8217;s worst strongmen as necessary. Biden would act to restore the credibility our nation has lost as a world leader, using his deep knowledge and myriad overseas relationships to shore up alliances that have worked for decades to promote order and keep our enemies in check. He would put America back in the Paris climate change agreement and the World Health Organization, and he wants to confront China and Russia with an American-led coalition instead of ineffectively going it alone against the Chinese and coddling Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Beyond policy, Biden offers the decency America craves. His inclination is to empathy; by putting himself in someone else #8217;s position and feeling their pain and frustration, he finds the commonality that leads to real change. He will consider facts carefully and calmly, seeking out analysis on all sides of an issue before making a rational decision grounded in reality. His career is a study in avoiding extremism. We see that now in debates over health care, racial justice, and the Supreme Court, among others. That #8217;s what our inflamed system needs  #8212; someone to turn the temperature down, not up. Biden has faith in America #8217;s potential, its ambition, its ability to achieve amazing things, its wide vision and wide arms. He highlights its strengths, not its shortcomings, its dreams, not its divisions. And he wants us to support one another. He #8217;s not looking at some gauzy and unrealistic version of our past but the bright contours of our future. Joe Biden believes in America. And America needs that now more than ever. Newsday endorses Joe Biden for president of the United States.  #8212; The editorial board  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"This election is everything," Tamir Harper said. "I'm a 2000s baby. I've lived through everything  #8212; 9/11, wars, and now a historic presidency and also a pandemic." Harper, a junior at American University, is one of many students across the country who lobbied their colleges to make Election Day an academic holiday. In a Sept. 20 tweet, Harper called on the university to cancel classes to allow students to be able to vote in person and also volunteer as poll workers. As the tweet circulated, Harper organized an email campaign effort that led to over 175 emails being sent to university administration. Another student put together a petition, which reached over 500 signatures by the time it was sent to university administrators. Harper #8217;s efforts were a success. On Monday, American University announced its decision to cancel classes for Election Day, joining schools like Brown University, the University of Utah, and Colorado College who also gave students the time off. Student leaders launched a similar grassroots effort at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Chris Suggs, the senior class president, said he does not expect the university system #8212; composed of 16 colleges and one high school #8212; to agree, but that many teachers have indicated they will let students take time off regardless. Turnout among 18-to-24-year-olds voters has been historically low, just at 48.3% in the 2016 election, according to an analysis from Tufts University. Harper and student leaders like him are hoping that canceling classes will make voting more accessible. Students wait in line to cast their ballot at a polling station on the campus of the University of California, Irvine, on Nov. 6, 2018 in Irvine, Calif.Robyn Beck / AFP via Getty Images file But not every school has been as flexible, especially ones whose academic calendars have been truncated due to Covid-19. The University of Pennsylvania last month shot down a push from a bipartisan group of student leaders to make Election Day an academic Emma Wennberg, the Communications Director for PennDems, said that her group will continue "to try to pressure department heads to allow excused absences because the university has left it up to each individual department to set the guidelines." Emory University also punted the decision to the individual teachers, but Interim Provost Jan Love noted in a university-wide email that it "may not be possible because the university has compressed the semester calendar to cope with the pandemic." For the 2018 midterms, the university launched the Emory Votes Initiative which sought to increase political participation by providing rides to the polls and election information. The initiative continues this November, adding on guidance for those students who want to become poll workers in Georgia. But some Emory students pushed back the school needs to go farther and make Election Day an academic holiday. "Free information and rides won #8217;t cut it," said the editorial board of the Emory Wheel, the school's student-run newspaper. "Emory must aid students in exercising their most fundamental democratic right: the vote." They #8217;re also hoping it will encourage students to get involved in working the polls. Poll workers are in high demand this November, as most poll workers tend to be older than 61 years old, according to Pew Research, and therefore more vulnerable to Covid-19. According to the Emory Wheel, DeKalb and Newton Counties in Georgia, where Emory #8217;s campuses are located, faced a surge in poll worker applications partly thanks to the eager students, leaving new applicants on long waitlists. Lead student coordinator for  #8216;V.O.T.E #8217;:  #8216;Our vote is the future. #8217; At the University of Texas-Austin, sophomore Ainsley Dorsey and senior Neha Valmiki are recruiting their peers through their on-campus civic engagement organization Hook The Vote. By distributing poll worker registration forms and working with Travis County to ensure the students are eligible, they hope to make it easier for students to get involved. They're also putting together a shift schedule to make sure that each of the two polling sites on campus is staffed round the clock. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an influx of students signed up to be poll workers with the Madison City Clerk offices and with Dane County, where Madison is located. The City Clerk #8217;s Office said it has twice as many workers as in the past three presidential elections and are unable to accept additional applications. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell told the campus newspaper, The Badger Herald, that students who are registered and receive training will be a  #8220;great advantage #8221; for future elections too. "We are in good shape for election day," McDonell said.  #173;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My favorite OU/TX story: The year was 1980, my buddy Mike  amp; I went to the game every year. The party Friday night was on Commerce street downtown. We had a room at the Hilton also on Commerce st. Fans drank and yelled obscenities at each other all night on the sidewalks. There was a cop about every five feet, and if you so much as touched anyone they'd arrest you. We got hammered and decided to drive to another part of town to hit the bars and look for chicks. We got back to the Hilton about 3AM and guess what? No parking spaces anywhere. I let Mike out and tell him I'll go find a parking spot and see him at the room. So I drive around and around but there isn't a space anywhere. Finally I turn a corner and see quite a few empty spaces in a parking lot. I pull in and park. I then realize I have no clue which direction the hotel is in and decide to sleep in the car. I wake up in the morning sweating like a sonofabitch and notice there are cop cars all around me. I spent the night in the Dallas Police Dept. parking lot!! Top that!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Hunter McEachern OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR)  #8211; When thinking about addiction, we often think of those who are addicted. But what about the loved ones desperate to help? Oklahoma organization, Parents Helping Parents, does just that in providing support, education and resources so that families can better assist those on the road to recovery.  #8220;It really changed my life, #8221; said Virginia Holleman, who sought out Parents Helping Parents due to her son #8217;s substance abuse addiction.  #8220;I was scared, #8221; said Holleman.  #8220;My son was spiraling out of control with his disease of addiction. I was spiraling out of control in my disease of despair and codependency. I was trying to get him to stop, but I was doing all the wrong things. #8221; Holleman, with the help of Parents Helping Parents, not only learned how to take care of herself so she could better support her son, but also was provided with resources that aided in her son #8217;s recovery. Oklahoma organization provides resources, support for families of those struggling with addiction (Photo: Virginia Holleman)  #8220;It #8217;s just all about how to be there for those loved ones and how to make the best decisions for yourself when you #8217;re working with those loved ones, #8221; said Becky O #8217;Dell, executive director of Parents Helping Parents. Parents Helping Parents offers chapters across the state for families to gain these useful resources and knowledge. All chapter meetings have moved online this year, though, due to the pandemic.  #8220;In our virtual chapters, our typical format is bringing in either a professional or a parent to share their story and to bring some information, some skills and some resources to people and then doing a live Q amp;A format afterwards to allow for some conversation and some engagement, #8221; said Derek Talkington, virtual chapter coordinator for Parents Helping Parents. O #8217;Dell said stress from the pandemic may make it more difficult for those battling addiction, as well as for their loved ones. She said reaching out for help can be hard, but can be life changing.  #8220;We really promote self care, because if a family, parents aren #8217;t taking care of themselves, how are they going to take care of their loved ones and make the right decisions for their loved ones? #8221; said O #8217;Dell.  #8220;So that #8217;s what we #8217;re here for. We #8217;re here to give resources, to give hugs, to just be there. #8221; #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>President Donald Trump's illness from COVID-19 overshadows corruption allegations against a big Republican fundraiser. That may be a good thing for the national GOP, at least during election season. Once again the Foreign Agents Registration Act comes into play. With prosecutors citing the law's provisions, longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy is accused of conspiring to act illegally as a foreign agent while lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of Malaysian and Chinese government interests. Broidy and others allegedly conducted "back-channel, unregistered campaigns" to wield influence. The efforts failed, prosecutors said. Many of these little enterprises do. Former special counsel Robert Mueller made repeated use of the foreign agents act when he probed Russian efforts to influence U.S. politics, Before that, the disclosure statute had gone largely unenforced for decades. The charges against Broidy arise as Trump is screaming for his Justice Department to indict Democrats such as presidential challenger Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. Broidy raised millions of dollars for Trump's 2016 effort, after the president-to-be had indicated he was self-funding his campaign. The Broidy case involves Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, who prosecutors say funneled tens of millions of dollars into the United States to squelch a probe of his transactions. That investigation involved the alleged theft of billions of dollars from a Malaysian state fund. The defendant has been charged but is believed to be in China, protected from extradition. In August, authorities arrested former Trump aide Steve Bannon, who as 2016 Trump campaign leader targeted Hillary Clinton's links to "global" economic interests. The charges against Bannon involve an alleged scam surrounding construction of Trump's border wall. Bannon was taken into custody aboard the yacht of Chinese billionaire  #233;migr #233; Guo Wengui, who fell out of favor with Beijing in 2015. The FBI and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating whether Guo violated securities laws in a private deal involving the company GTV Media. One year ago, two business associates of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani were indicted, along with two co-defendants, on charges that they conspired to violate the ban on foreign donations and contributions in connection with federal and state elections. They're awaiting trial. The cash at issue comes out of Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, Republican efforts to dig up legitimate evidence of high-level wrongdoing involving Hunter Biden's sinecure with a Ukrainian gas company years ago, when his father Joe Biden was vice president, seem to have fallen short of the goal. Concerns about foreign money also have arisen in the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Rusal, a Russian aluminum company, invested heavily in a mill planned for eastern Kentucky. But a Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian election meddling called Rusal is a "proxy for the Kremlin." This raised questions from Democrats about McConnell's efforts to lift certain sanctions. Representing foreign interests, for decades a lucrative activity among the politically connected from both political parties, goes on unabated in Washington D.C. despite nationalist sloganeering. Regarding military equipment, big spenders on influence include South Korea, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Broidy is based in Los Angeles, but played a role in a major New York State scandal years ago. He admitted in 2009 to making nearly $1 million in gifts to state pension fund officials in a "pay to play" scheme, but ultimately was spared jail time. Despite that, he became deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2017 to 2018.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Police used tear gas on demonstrators and arrested 28 people during a third straight night of protests over the lack of charges against a suburban Milwaukee police officer who fatally shot a Black teen, authorities said, as they took to Twitter on Saturday to outline what they called an  #8220;escalation in force by the protesters. #8221; About 100 people gathered outside City Hall on Friday past Wauwatosa #8217;s 7 p.m. curfew and refused multiple orders to disperse, according to police. Police said they used tear gas on the crowd, after bottles were thrown at officers. On Saturday, the Wauwatosa Police Department posted on Twitter that people have been asking valid questions about the police response over three nights of protests. Police posted a picture of bottles they said were found in a backpack, including a bottle of lighter fluid, noting that the materials can be used to start fires.  #8220;Over the past three nights, we have seen an escalation in force by the protesters. Our law enforcement response is in reaction to this escalation, #8221; police tweeted. They said that on Friday night, protestors had Molotov cocktails and other fire starting supplies and guns were spotted in the crowd. Protesters have gathered every day since prosecutors announced Wednesday that #160;they would not charge Officer Joseph Mensah #160;in 17-year-old Alvin Cole #8217;s death. Mensah, who is Black, shot Cole after a foot chase outside a Wauwatosa mall in February. The police department #8217;s tweets come as some have chastised authorities for the way they have handled the protests. During Thursday night #8217;s demonstration, #160;police arrested Alvin Cole #8217;s mother, #160;Tracy Cole, and his sisters. Family attorney Kimberly Motley criticized the way police treated the family, noting Tracy Cole had to be treated for injuries. In a tweet addressing the police chief and mayor on Friday, Motley said  #8220;due to your failed leadership you have turned Wauwatosa into a war zone! #8217; About an hour after Friday #8217;s curfew went into effect, law enforcement began advancing toward the crowd. Police said they used chemical irritants, which they described as tear gas, as well as pepper balls and paint balls after bottles and rocks were thrown at them. Video posted to Twitter by local reporters showed heavy smoke in the air as police advanced, and multiple people taken into custody. Windows were broken at a Snap Fitness center, police said. Police said two of Friday #8217;s 28 arrests were for felonies, one was for a misdemeanor and 25 were for municipal citations. Police noted that some of the people arrested were blocking traffic, others had tried to start fires, and one person had materials to start a fire. Another person in the group posted a picture of himself with a handgun, authorities added, though it was not clear if he was among those arrested. Two people arrested were evaluated for minor injuries, police said. One of the arrestees was driving in one of three vehicles that had come to the Wauwatosa Police Department early Saturday. The vehicle almost hit an officer, according to police. The driver got into a second vehicle, and police arrested the person after a short chase, authorities said.  #8220;We can appreciate the anger and frustration that exists among those closely affected by recent events, #8221; police said in a statement Saturday. They asked people to continue to comply with the 7 p.m. curfew, which was to be in effect again on Saturday and Sunday nights. The National Guard is assisting local police. The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd #8217;s death. #160;Floyd, #160;who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck as Floyd gasped that he couldn #8217;t breathe. The co-founder and publisher of The Daily Caller said two of his reporters were beaten and detained by police in Wauwatosa on Thursday as they were videotaping Tracy Cole #8217;s arrest. Numerous journalists have been injured or arrested while covering protests nationwide in recent months. Neil Patel, who founded the conservative news outlet with Tucker Carlson, said in a statement that reporters Shelby Talcott and Richie McGinniss  #8220;were brutally beaten with clubs for no reason, #8221; the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. A message seeking comment from the Wauwatosa Police Department was not immediately returned to The Associated Press.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Associated Press FILE  #8211; In this Oct. 1, 2020, file photo Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett, listens as Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., speaks during their meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington. A scant two weeks after her nomination, Judge Amy Coney Barrett goes before a Senate committee that #8217;s bitterly split along partisan lines over whether the Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg #8217;s death should be filled now or should await the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, Pool, File) WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; A scant two weeks after her nomination, Judge Amy Coney Barrett goes before a Senate committee that #8217;s bitterly split along partisan lines over whether the Supreme Court vacancy created by #160;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg #8217;s death #160;should be filled now or should await the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election. The Senate Judiciary Committee #8217;s hearings are taking place on an accelerated timeline because President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans want her on the bench by Election Day. Adding to the swirl of politics around the nomination is the coronavirus pandemic and the role it might play. Barrett was introduced as the nominee at a Rose Garden ceremony linked to a cluster of virus cases, #160;including those of Trump and his wife, Melania. Viewers should expect to see the 48-year-old Barrett portrayed by Republicans as a #160;principled jurist and person of faith #160;in the mode of her mentor, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, and someone who will decide cases based on the law, not her policy preferences. Democrats will spend a lot of time talking about the unseemly rush to fill Ginsburg #8217;s seat. But they also will label Barrett a results-oriented conservative whose ascension to the high court would entrench a conservative majority bent on undoing abortion rights, loosening gun restrictions and turning back the clock on environmental regulations and anti-discrimination laws. Lawmakers know the public is watching, but as the hearing gets going and lawmakers seek to probe the nominee #8217;s views, they often slip into using legal jargon and refer to past Supreme Court cases in shorthand. It can sound as though they #8217;re talking in code. Expect senators to use these terms at Barrett #8217;s hearing, starting Monday: ___ ROE V. WADE, PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY These cases from 1973 and 1992, respectively, are the two main decisions on abortion rights. Barrett is the most open anti-abortion nominee to the Supreme Court in decades. She is certain to be asked repeatedly whether the cases were decided correctly, and whether they should be overturned, She #8217;s not likely to answer either question during the hearings. Barrett #160;signed an anti-abortion newspaper ad #160;in 2006, was a member of Notre Dame #8217;s Faculty for Life and has cast two anti-abortion votes as an appellate judge. __ STATE DECISIS In Latin, it means to stand by things decided. It #8217;s the legal principle that judges use to base decisions on earlier ones. When it comes up at confirmation hearings, it #8217;s often in reference to abortion rights and it #8217;s usually a way of asking if a nominee will overturn certain decisions such as Roe. Nominees invariably invoke stare decisis, or refer to something as settled law, to try to reassure senators that they have great respect for Supreme Court precedents, without committing to preserve any specific one. Respect for precedent, however, has its limits. Almost every court opinion raising the issue of abiding by precedents or getting rid of them invokes a line from a 1991 Supreme Court opinion:  #8220;Stare decisis is not an inexorable command. #8221; ___ OBERGEFELL V. HODGES The court #8217;s 2015 decision declared a nationwide constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry. Barrett has spoken approvingly of the conservative dissenting voices in the case who argued that states should set the rules on marriage, not unelected judges. The #160;issue became newly prominent last week #160;when Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote that the 2015 decision  #8220;enables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe that marriage is between one man and one woman as bigots. #8221; Thomas suggested the court needs to revisit the issue because it has  #8220;created a problem that only it can fix. #8221; Until then, he said, the case will continue to have  #8220;ruinous consequences for religious liberty. #8221; ___ ACA That #8217;s the shorthanded reference to the Obama-era health law, the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as  #8220;Obamacare. #8221; The Supreme Court will hear a Trump administration-backed challenge to get rid of the law a week after the election. A lot of talk will focus on the law #8217;s now-toothless mandate to require people to have health insurance or pay a penalty. In 2017, Congress got rid of the penalty, a decision that gave rise to the latest court challenge. The bigger concern is that if the court says the mandate as it now stands is unconstitutional, it will strike down the rest of the law with it. So Democratic senators in all likelihood will talk a lot about the threat to another provision of the law prohibiting discrimination against people with preexisting health conditions. Barrett has been critical of Chief Justice John Roberts #8217; 2012 opinion upholding the law and his 2015 opinion that preserved subsidies for millions of people to pay for health insurance.  #8220;I think the dissent has the better of the legal argument, #8221; she said in 2015. ___ RECUSAL It refers to a judge #8217;s decision to not take part in a case, usually because that judge participated in it at an earlier stage, or has a financial or personal conflict. Democrats are going to press Barrett to pledge to withdraw from any election-related cases, and perhaps from any involving abortion. She is not likely to commit to do so. ___ CHEVRON DEFERENCE A 1984 Supreme Court ruling, in a case involving the Chevron oil company, says that when laws aren #8217;t crystal clear, federal agencies should be allowed to fill in the details. That #8217;s what agencies do  #8212; on environmental regulations, workplace standards, consumer protections and even immigration law. But a growing conservative legal movement has questioned the Chevron decision. Several conservative justices have expressed some support for limiting agencies #8217; discretion. If a future Supreme Court were to limit the Chevron ruling, it would mark a big change in the law that would potentially make it harder to sustain governmental regulations. ___ BALLS AND STRIKES OK, that #8217;s not a legal term, but it will come up anyway. Roberts famously compared judges to umpires during his 2005 confirmation hearing, saying neither makes the rules, but rather both just apply them. He said he would remember, if confirmed, that his job is  #8220;to call balls and strikes. #8221; Lawmakers love to ask nominees about this analogy. ___  #8220;LET HER ANSWER THE QUESTION #8221; Again, it #8217;s not a legal term. Expect the committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., or the Republican sitting in his place, to interject when Democrats #8217; questioning of Barrett gets especially heated or they try to cut in if they feel Barrett is trying to filibuster. Question time is limited and senators often feel free to jump in to move the questioning along.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For all the "get out the vote" messages this election season, there #8217;s another effort to discourage people from casting a ballot. Lawsuits to thwart mail-in ballots. Threats to send law enforcement to polling sites. Disinformation campaigns to blur deadlines and threaten voters with arrest. Through a raft of tactics, President Donald Trump and some Republican allies are taking steps to try to decrease turnout for the election, experts say, a move that renders a stark contrast to others fighting to try to make voting easier amid the pandemic. Trump sees a low turnout as a path to victory and it may make strategic sense in the short run, analysts say, but it comes across as "anti-voter" and even "corrosive." The president also frequently makes unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud and voting-by-mail that serve to undermine the system, they said. "He sees shrinking the electorate as key to his success," said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California at Irvine. He said Trump is ramping up his attacks on voting, seeking to make it harder to vote. "If you are pro-voter, you want to make it easier to vote amid a pandemic," Hasen said. "Which is why you see voting rights groups pretty much lining up with Democrats." Republicans contend their efforts are about preventing illegal voting, although experts say voter fraud is extraordinarily rare. A recent analysis found Americans are more likely to be struck by lightning than commit voter fraud. "I disagree with the premise that anyone can do anything to decrease the turnout. If you want to vote this year, it #8217;s never been easier," New York Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy said, citing expanded options to vote by absentee or early or on Election Day. "There #8217;s going be a ton of votes of cast and any discussion of suppression is nonsense," the Republican said. Experts say the tamp-down strategy goes back to Republicans rejecting a strategy outlined after Mitt Romney #8217;s defeat in the 2012 presidential election. That strategy called for broadening the party by appealing to nontraditional constituencies, such as Latinos. Under Trump, they've gone in the opposite direction. They've sought to harden the party base and discourage opposition voting. That strategy took hold "because of the nature of how Trump campaigns and how Trump acts," said Kevin Madden, who was a spokesman for the Romney campaign. "He #8217;s trying to squeeze out a greater margin out of a shrinking base," Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff said of Trump. "There was a time in presidential elections where the thought was you have to appeal to swing voters  #8230; But now it #8217;s all about turning out your base." The reason for working to tamp down voting, especially absentees, is "they are behind now and they know the early vote tends to favor Democrats," Miringoff said. "So anything that can change the way the mail is sped along or any court challenges to slow it, makes sense from their perspective." Trying to demobilize an opponent #8217;s voters isn #8217;t all that new and was often deployed in 2016, said Cornell University government professor David A. Bateman. Every negative ad is an effort to demobilize. "But there is a distinction to be made from trying to demobilize your opponent #8217;s supporters and actually trying to prevent them from casting a vote," said Bateman, author of "Disenfranchising Democracy." "And what is new in this particular election is how it intersects with COVID-19 and the efforts to increase voting by mail in a time of COVID." And with the increased polarization of American politics, Bateman said, "you see an increased effort to suppress the vote"  #8212; in a variety of ways. The Trump campaign has intervened in more than 10 legal cases, fighting against actions to ease ballot access during the pandemic. They #8217;ve sued states such as Nevada to try to prevent them from mailing absentee ballots to all voters. In Pennsylvania  #8212; a key swing state  #8212; Republicans have asked courts to prohibit drop boxes for depositing ballots. They've been unsuccessful so far. All told, more than 200 lawsuits are going nationwide over pandemic voting. This week, two GOP operatives were charged with felonies for allegedly making "robocalls" to minorities in a multiple states  #8212; including New York  #8212; spreading falsehoods about absentee voting such as telling people they could be subjected to arrest, debt collection and forced vaccination. Beyond the courtroom, Trump has threatened to send law enforcement to polling sites  #8212; recalling a specter of Jim Crow days in the Deep South  #8212; and recruiting "poll watchers." Trump also repeatedly has sought to cast doubts on the security of mail-in voting and admitted earlier this year that making it easier to vote would hurt his party. "You'd never have a Republican elected in this country again," Trump said about Democrats #8217; proposal to widely expand mail-in voting. Langworthy said he sees the issue this way: "I believe the best way to vote is either early in-person or on Election Day and that #8217;s the best way to prevent some lawyer from stealing your vote." The New York chairman said local boards of election have struggled with the volume of mailed ballots and the "minutiae" of reviewing the validity of ballots. Langworthy said: "I think there #8217;s a lot of appetite of other party to change the rules on the fly and that erodes confidence in the security of our elections."  #160;</TEXT>

BY C-SPAN WASHINGTON Despite all the fury on social media about the fly on Mike Pence #8217;s head and Kamala Harris #8217; demeanor, analysts say the vice presidential debate is unlikely to alter the state of the presidential race. Yet the attacks on Harris afterward were particularly harsh. The comments during and after Wednesday #8217;s debate were full of complaints that the Democratic vice presidential candidate was too snarky, catty, and had an annoying voice. Many took issue with her facial expressions.  #8220;Take it like a woman. Don #8217;t make faces, #8221; tweeted former Fox News host Megyn Kelly.  #8220;Mike Pence was a gentleman, forthright and focused. He delivered his plan for America brilliantly, #8221; actor James Woods said on Twitter.  #8220;Kamala Harris behaved like a  #8216;Valley Girl, #8217; smirking and rolling her eyes like a petulant brat, dodging every question she was asked. #8221; Speaking with Fox New host Laura Ingraham after the debate, Ohio Pastor Darrell C. Scott said Harris was  #8220;Hillary Clinton in black face. #8221; #BlackHillary began to trend on Twitter. Harlan Z. Hill, a Republican consultant and advisor to the Trump campaign, tweeted  #8220;Kamala Harris comes off as an insufferable, lying b----. #8221; The post received more than 8,000 retweets. The next day, Fox News Media said it would no longer book Hill, who is a frequent guest on the network, because of the vulgar remark. History shows that voters vote for presidential candidates, not running mates. But there #8217;s another sort of history that was evident in this debate  #8211; a woman, particularly one of color, is in for a rougher time when she runs for office.  #8220;She #8217;s experiencing what Hillary Clinton went through, only on steroids, #8221; said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic consultant. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and author of  #8220;Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership, #8221; said women like Harris have to do two things: act within the stereotypes about them and transcend them. She said Pence, on the other hand, didn #8217;t have the same kind of negative assumptions to overcome.  #8220;She has to be very careful to not play into any stereotypes that would suggest that she is rude...and she can #8217;t be perceived to be inappropriately aggressive, #8221; Jamieson said.  #8220;And the problem is, what constitutes rude and aggressive are different for men and women. He gets more latitude than she does. #8221;  #8220;The word I kept hearing over and over again was  #8216;snarky, #8217; #8217; #8217; said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman. Steele, the only African American ever to head the GOP, is supporting the Democratic ticket this year.  #8220;I heard it from Democrats and I heard it from Republicans, #8221; he said. HILLARY CLINTON AND SARAH PALIN Four women have been on major party tickets in presidential elections: vice presidential candidates Geraldine Ferraro, a Democrat, in 1984; Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican, in 2008 and Clinton, the Democrats #8217; 2016 presidential candidate. Clinton was widely disliked. Network exit polls showed that 55% of voters had an unfavorable opinion of her. Harris faces similar challenges, said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, visiting practitioner at the nonpartisan Center for American Women and Politics in New Jersey. She cited similarities  #8212; both are seasoned attorneys, have been U.S. senators and are regarded as compelling speakers.  #8220;They #8217;re women not  #8216;staying in their place, #8217; #8220; she said. Palin was also unfairly treated, Jamieson said. While she had originally been brought onto the Republican ticket as an energy expert, by the end of the campaign, the Alaska governor had been painted as a flighty woman and poor mother. She said Palin was the subject of  #8220;vulgar, pornographic #8221; internet posts. Women have to look smart and tough, but not in a threatening way, and that can be difficult to do, said Peeler-Allen, who noted part of the problem is that a strong woman is seen as a threat by those accustomed to having power. Labeling Harris  #8220;Black Hillary #8221; is a way to apply decades of negative stereotypes about one of the best-known women in American politics to a candidate who is relatively unknown, Jamieson said.  #8220;Many people can #8217;t shake the idea that white men have a monopoly on talent and leadership, and many others are outright fearful and hostile of leaders who come from a different sector of society, #8221; said Steve Phillips, founder of Democracy in Color and host of the podcast  #8220;Democracy in Color with Steve Phillips. #8221; The result is that women of color, like Harris, have to work harder to prove themselves than white men like Pence, Jamieson said.  #8220;The male #8217;s competence is presumed, but the female #8217;s competence isn #8217;t, #8221; she said.  #8220;She has to show a higher amount of it, in order to have people to perceive that she has the same amount of it. #8221; WOMEN AS LEADERS The challenge for Harris is that  #8220;she #8217;s the antithesis #8221; of what people throughout history have seen from national leaders, Peeler-Allen said. Add to that, she said, the omnipresence of social media and lingering resentment of people of color gaining stature once seen as an exclusive right for whites.  #8220;Social media provides a safe place where people can say things. Fifteen years ago these things were said at backyard barbecues or in people #8217;s homes, or maybe in exclusive clubs #8221; Peeler-Allen said.  #8220;Now it #8217;s in the open. #8221; There #8217;s no question that non-white, non-males have a harder road, said Marlo Diaz Tucker, California state director for Concerned Women for America, a group that promotes traditional values. But that means  #8220;you just have to work harder to show people you #8217;re there to help and you have the skills. #8221; And, she said,  #8220;you have to do it with some poise and grace. #8221; TRUMP CALLS HARRIS A  #8216;MONSTER #8217; Kathleen Sullivan, a veteran New Hampshire Democratic activist, thought the anger was emblematic of the trouble the Trump campaign is having. She noted that on Thursday, Trump called Harris a  #8220;monster. #8221;  #8220;That #8217;s a term usually applied by children to something that scares him, so I guess it means Trump is afraid of a strong yet joyous, assertive Black woman, #8221; she said. After talking to 15 undecided voters from eight swing states on debate night, political consultant and pollster Frank Luntz told Fox News that  #8220;this was Mike Pence #8217;s night. #8221; Often, style and substance matter to undecided voters, he said, and  #8220;the complaint about Kamala Harris was that she was abrasive and condescending. #8221; Luntz found that  #8220;Harris #8217; reactions to Pence  #8212; the smiling, the smirking, the scowling #8221; left them far  #8220;angrier #8221; with her performance. #8221; But two post-debate polls gave an edge to Harris. A Morning POLITICO/Morning Consult post-debate poll found that viewers thought Harris performed the best, while 40% named Pence. Women approved of her performance even more strongly, while men split about evenly between the two. As voters begin to see more women in positions of power, Jamieson said they are becoming the rule, not the exception.  #8220;We #8217;ve now reached a point at which there are so many competent women in places across the culture, that the likelihood that we #8217;re going to have a female president has risen dramatically, #8221; she said.  #8220;Because that kind of experience with female leadership begins to undercut your stereotype. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>LAS VEGAS (KSNV)  #8211; Anyone who watched the vice presidential debate on Wednesday may not remember everything that was said, but there's a high chance they remember the fly that made a pit stop on Mike Pence's head. If you missed it live, surely you've seen the countless jokes, memes and comments about the fly -- and now here's one more. The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum has unveiled the "Mike Pence Fly Bobblehead." "Social media has been abuzz with talk of the fly at last night #8217;s debate, and when we received several requests for a bobblehead with Pence and the fly, we knew we had to get to work, #8221; National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar said.  #8220;We think this will be another fun bobblehead to put a smile on people #8217;s faces as they look back at 2020. #8221; The bobbleheads are only available through the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum #8217;s online store here. Trump, Biden and Harris bobbleheads are also available for purchase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>MIKE SIMONS, TULSA WORLD OKLAHOMA CITY  #8212; Oklahoma lawmakers are interested enough in police and criminal justice reform to have studied the matter at length this fall. Whether that interest can be translated into action in next year #8217;s legislative session is another matter.  #8220;Hearing how many other states are doing stuff and doing it in a bipartisan way tells me Oklahoma can do something, #8221; said Rep. Monroe Nichols, D-Tulsa, after hearing more than seven hours of testimony at a legislative hearing Tuesday. Nichols hosted the interim study with Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, Sen. Kevin Matthews, D-Tulsa, and Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond. At the outset, Osburn noted that the foursome consisted of two white suburban men and two black urban men  #8220;with very different perspectives and experiences. #8221;  #8220;Our worlds are very different, and that #8217;s OK, #8221; said Osburn.  #8220;That #8217;s the whole point. It #8217;s about everybody understanding each other better. #8221; The study was titled  #8220;A Bipartisan Study of Race Relations in Oklahoma #8221; and was moved from one of the cramped Capitol meeting rooms to a larger space across the street in the Oklahoma History Center in anticipation of a large crowd. The extra space, in the age of COVID, was needed, though spectators were relatively few. That expedited moving through a long list of speakers on potentially contentious issues. One idea that might have pricked up a few ears was Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin #8217;s remark that he and Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado are discussing some sort of joint unit to investigate officer-involved shootings. Public pressure has been mounting for some time for the Tulsa Police Department to turn such investigations over to an independent body. Nichols tried to get Franklin to commit to working on citizen oversight legislation that would be acceptable to law enforcement, but the chief wouldn #8217;t quite go there.  #8220;I understand the need for oversight, #8221; Franklin said.  #8220;We get that from our mayor. We get that from our City Council, all of whom are chosen by the community.  #8220;I #8217;m certainly open to having someone sitting in the room, seeing what we do, and they #8217;re welcome to reporting out and saying,  #8216;Yes, our police force is doing incredible work, #8217; #8221; said Franklin. The study began with a discussion of reform efforts in other states, and particularly Iowa, where the Legislature managed to pass a justice reform measure in a matter of a few days earlier this year. While somewhat limited in scope, it does provide for a statewide database aimed at preventing law officers from bouncing from job to job after being fired for misconduct. It also gave the state attorney general new authority to investigate and prosecute potential misuse of force and misconduct. Iowa Assistant Attorney General Kevin McCarthy said the legislation was the result of years of behind-the-scenes work involving both parties, two governors and the Attorney General #8217;s Office. The most obvious consensus target for Oklahoma legislators, judging from this fall #8217;s interim studies, seems to be training. According to one estimate, the state has roughly 550 law enforcement agencies, each with its own policies and training requirements. Large police forces, including Tulsa #8217;s, have their own academies, but the majority of communities rely on the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, or CLEET, whose state funding has steadily deteriorated over the past decade. Other recommendations included encouraging patience with high-profile cases, codifying law officers #8217; responsibility to intervene if another officer is using excessive force, enforcing data-reporting requirements and making K-12 education more accurately reflect American society and culture. While all of that sounds difficult enough, Nichols hopes it starts even tougher discussions.  #8220;Where it gets trickier is when you get into things like health disparities and wealth disparities, #8221; he said.  #8220;By putting this issue front and center, my hope is we can have similar discussions about education, about health, and about jobs and the economy, #8221; he said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The president, infected by a virus his administration failed to tame, spent three days in the hospital earlier this month for COVID-19. More than 212,000 Americans have died in the pandemic, and the virus is still spreading. Millions more are out of work, with shops and businesses shuttered in every state. Wildfires have burned more than 4 million acres in California, fueled by the fast-warming climate. Protests and spasms of violence have erupted in dozens of cities over police abuses and systemic racism. But the stakes on Nov. 3 are higher. In some ways, the future of American democracy is on the ballot. Trailing in the polls, President Donald Trump has refused to say he will commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses. No previous U.S. president has threatened not to honor the integrity of a national election. Republicans accuse Democrats, without evidence, of trying to steal or manufacture votes with mail-in ballots. Democrats accuse Republicans of seeking to suppress votes, with evidence in some states that lies in plain view. When Trump won the White House four years ago, he was something of an accidental president. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but won the electoral vote thanks to some 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. A one-term Trump presidency, if it ends in January, may be remembered as little more than a fluke of history, a brief detour into conservative populism after eight years of President Barack Obama. But if the president wins a second term with a renewed or stronger mandate, the picture will be very different. Eight years would be an era  #8212; an opportunity for Trump to place his stamp even more deeply on the nation's institutions and policies. He will pass more legislation, appoint more federal judges, cement his control of the Republican Party and deepen his purges of the federal bureaucracy, a process an aide once called "the deconstruction of the administrative state." A second term could make the Trump Revolution permanent  #8212; or, at least, more durable. A win by Joe Biden, on the other hand, would represent a decision by most voters that four years of Trumpism was enough. Depending on Biden's margin of victory and whether his party takes control of the Senate as well as the House, it could provide a mandate for a wave of ambitious Democratic legislation  #8212; although not the "socialist agenda" that Trump has ludicrously accused the challenger of secretly harboring. In almost every presidential campaign, the candidates solemnly tell voters that this will be the most important election of their lives. This time, the claim may well be true. "At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas," Trump said at the Republican National Convention in August. He's right; rarely in the postwar period have two candidates been so far apart on major issues from taxes and health care to immigration, climate change and foreign policy. For all that, the two candidates are alike in some ways. Both in their 70s, both hark back to the past. Trump's "Make America Great Again" suggests a return to the white- and male-dominated America of the 1950s. Biden campaigns to restore and expand the progressive policies of the Obama era. Trump has spent much of the last four years undoing regulations put in place by the Obama administration. If he succeeds in putting federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, which seems likely, he may get another wish: overturning or gutting the Affordable Care Act. Similarly, a Biden administration would set about undoing much of what Trump has done  #8212; some of it, the candidate brags, on his first day in office, with executive orders on the environment, immigration and labor regulation. More broadly, Biden would seek to revive a traditional Democratic agenda of federal activism in domestic affairs. One of his first acts, Biden says, would be to federalize the nation's response to the coronavirus  #8212; now fragmented among the states  #8212; by establishing a pandemic testing board and a medical supply task force in the White House. After that would come a wave of legislation if Democrats win a majority in the Senate: bills to eliminate Trump's 2017 tax cuts for individuals making more than $400,000 a year, modify and expand Obamacare to ensure it survives in the Supreme Court, provide "a road map to citizenship" for undocumented immigrants, and more. So the fundamental choice voters face is between a thoroughly Trumpist future and a return to the pre-Trump world  #8212; those parts that Biden and his allies can restore. To many on both sides, the stakes appear existential  #8212; a threat to the future of the republic as they see it. Even allowing for the excesses of campaign rhetoric, the contrast is stark. "This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny," Trump declared in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. To Democrats, the threat is Trump's not-very-veiled penchant for authoritarian rule. "The president is literally an existential threat to America," Biden told voters in Iowa. "What's at stake is whether or not our democracy endures," Obama said last month. They point to Trump's recurring attempts to ignore or defy limits on presidential power: his refusal to submit to subpoenas from Congress, his rejection of Congress' power of the purse by redirecting federal funds to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and his use of the Justice Department to investigate critics. "Constitutional democracy is on the ballot," William A. Galston, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked for President Bill Clinton, told me. "If Trump wins, his relentless expansion of executive power would be ratified." What won't change, no matter who wins the election? Partisan polarization, Galston said. "That's going to persist  #8212; because each party sees the other as an existential threat," he said. The stakes in an election aren't always clear before votes are cast. In 1860, probably the most consequential election in U.S. history, it wasn't obvious that electing Abraham Lincoln would lead to the Civil War in only six months. In 1932, it wasn't clear that Franklin D. Roosevelt would vastly expand the federal government through his New Deal programs to cope with the Great Depression. Americans who elected Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972 were given a clear choice  #8212; and that led to an expanded war in Vietnam, the Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation. Arguably the most important election since then was in 1980, when Ronald Reagan beat the incumbent, Jimmy Carter, and began to dismantle the liberal state. Until the consequences occur, Yale political scientist David Mayhew wrote, "we can have hunches but not answers." But the stakes this year are clear enough, at least, to ensure that this election will rank among the most important of our lifetimes  #8212; which makes it imperative for every voter to consider the choice carefully, and cast a ballot by any means available.

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; A voter initiative led by Michelle Obama is partnering with a similar group founded by NBA star LeBron James and other prominent Black athletes and entertainers to sponsor events in major U.S. cities starting next week to generate excitement about voting early for the Nov. 3 election. Mrs. Obama's When We All Vote and James' More Than A Vote are teaming to provide information, transportation, food, music, personal protective equipment and other support at early voting sites around the country Oct. 18-31.  #8220;Millions of Americans have already cast their ballot and with only 21 days until Election Day, making your plan to vote early is critical, #8221; Mrs. Obama said Tuesday in a statement to The Associated Press.  #8220;It #8217;s now up to us to do everything in our power to get our friends and family ready to vote early and safely together. We can #8217;t leave anyone behind. #8221; The former first lady is also launching a challenge to encourage more people to vote before Nov. 3. Her group also announced more than $1 million in grants and supplies to local partner organizations to host their own activities. Last week, Mrs. Obama repeated her endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a lengthy new video message that was sharply critical of Republican President Donald Trump. In-person events are planned for Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Detroit; Los Angeles; Milwaukee; Orlando, Florida; and Philadelphia. They will be held within walking distance of early voting sites and include free food from the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres, and other providers. Music, celebrity appearances, personal protective equipment and support for voters' rights from the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law and the Election Protection coalition will also be provided. Lyft has agreed to provide discounted transportation. When We All Vote also plans to host a virtual couch party on Oct. 23. Other partners include BET, Comedy Central, Johnson  amp; Johnson, MTV, the National Urban League, Radio One and United Way Worldwide. All attendees and staff on the ground will be required to follow COVID-19 safety guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oil executives are just like you and me: They worry about the election. "A Biden administration would absolutely kill our industry." Such comments from oil and gas chiefs featured in the Dallas Fed's latest sector survey. It is received wisdom that, if elected president alongside a few more Democratic senators, an administration led by Joe Biden would sacrifice the industry on the altar of the Green New Deal. After all, Biden says one thing but he's secretly just Bernie with better hair and teeth, right? Actually, any oil and gas executive with an eye on the decade ahead rather than their next quarter has good reason to hope Biden wins. Washington's battle over replacing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court gets to the heart of why. First, though, a gentle nudge for the American oil business toward self-reflection. Commanding 14% of the S amp;P 500 when Barack Obama was first sworn in as president, energy's weighting had sunk to about half that when President Donald Trump took his oath. Today, it's close to being a rounding error. This industry drilled itself into a ditch regardless of who sat in the Oval Office. Unlike oil and gas investors, the CEOs who are frequently rewarded for growth at all costs and insulated from sometimes catastrophic overreach have mostly done just swimmingly. One reason Trump's "energy dominance" agenda didn't halt the long decline is that its Soviet-tractor-quota approach merely encouraged the industry's worst self-harming impulses. Elsewhere in that Dallas Fed survey, participants were asked for their primary goals over the next six months. The top two answers: maintain or grow production - amid a historic oil glut and with balance sheets that look like they've been fracked themselves. This industry could use a little less dominance and a lot more discipline. Keep this in mind when Biden is decried as the sector's nemesis. Which brings us to the election and that Supreme Court seat. Americans who think climate change either isn't real or is overblown are in a small and shrinking minority. There is a partisan divide, of course, with Democrats overwhelmingly accepting climate change as a real threat. Still, a majority of Republicans also believe climate change is happening (though only a minority blame human activities) and that carbon emissions should be regulated as a pollutant. Moreover, millennial and Gen-Z Republicans show more concern about climate change and support for renewable energy than the elder cohort. Republican leadership, however, is of a different mind. This starts at the top, with a president who has long expressed doubt climate change is real and muses aloud on wind turbines causing cancer. It is emblematic of a party that long since gave up on late Sen. John McCain's carbon cap-and-trade proposals in 2008 and this year adopted a policy platform consisting of little more than an arrow pointing at Trump with the slogan "what he said." Gestures toward the issue are made for appearances' sake; in his recent debate with Sen. Kamala Harris, Vice President Mike Pence deployed the studiedly beige phrase "the climate is changing." But there simply is no consequential policy debate about climate change occurring within the GOP. This has become the firewall for fossil fuels against meaningful climate policy as the disconnect with public opinion widens, with the Republican-controlled Senate a critical defense. Fossil-fuel production is relatively concentrated within the U.S.  #8212; 80% of it comes from just nine states, according to ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based analysis firm. And while 18 senators might not seem like much, as ClearView points out they are significant when the filibuster rule prevents passage of legislation without 60 votes. Fossil-fuel production accounts for more than 1% of GDP in a further seven states and for some smaller proportion in many more. All this, plus partisan cohesion regardless of direct fossil-fuel exposure, has made pulling together a blocking minority eminently doable. But the filibuster hangs by a thread, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's push to seat Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court, cementing a 6-3 right-wing majority, could trigger its demise altogether. Several Democratic presidential candidates called explicitly for the end of the filibuster on the campaign trail, often linking it directly to addressing climate change. Biden didn't, and it seems doubtful he would push a Democratic Senate in this direction over climate policy. What could change that? How about a naked power play by an outgoing president and Senate to tilt the least-democratic branch of government their way for a generation, threatening things that probably would constitute a tipping point even for Biden: the Affordable Care Act, access to abortion, voting rights. For all its complexities, there is a simple way to think about what happens on Nov. 3. If Trump loses, then all the Republican never-Trumpers will be able to say told-ya-so. If Biden loses, then progressives will say the same thing to Democratic leadership. For the oil and gas industry, a Trump loss likely means the Senate flips too. Yet with Biden in the White House and the incumbent Democratic leadership still mostly in charge, the chances of a sweeping, AOC-style Green New Deal would be diminished. Climate change measures would still be enacted in some form  #8212; not least as part of a post-covid stimulus effort  #8212; but likely more along the lines of an actual transition rather than abrupt disruption. And adult management of the COVID-19 crisis and a large economic stimulus, along with tighter restrictions on fracking on federal land and methane emissions, could support oil and gas prices from both the demand and supply side, at least in the short term. A Trump win, with Republicans maintaining their slender grip on the Senate, might still seem preferable to oil and gas CEOs. This is short-sighted. The Green New Deal is itself a reaction to decades of obstruction by oil and gas interests and their Republican allies against even incremental measures to address climate change. As the clock ticks by, and the wildfires and hurricanes intensify, so climate change's mindshare among Americans grows  #8212; and so does frustration with inaction. If the industry's strategy to deal with this is simply to retreat ever further into a fortress built on the quirks of the U.S. political system, then it had best hope the other side, post-Biden and with gloves discarded utterly, never gains power and abolishes those quirks. That is the logic of the raw power politics revealed so brazenly in the Republican push for Barrett just four years after stonewalling Merrick Garland on spurious grounds now being ignored (not to mention rampant voter suppression, with oil-capital Houston an epicenter in this cycle). Indeed, such defensive thinking is implicit in McConnell's relentless focus on judicial appointments  #8212; the court-packing's already happened, folks  #8212; rather than actual legislating. Confident parties fight to win power and use it; fearful parties make a grab for power and obsess over how to keep it. The industry faces a choice between getting on board with a smoother transition, with more emphasis on market-based solutions, or keeping with Republicans' maximalist, but minority, position until political fortunes inevitably change  #8212; at which point mandates like California's gasoline-car ban will drop like bricks. The first option entails risk management; the second is a gamble with lengthening odds. Spencer Dale, chief economist at BP Plc, noted the risk for the industry in a recent presentation about future energy demand: "If the required reductions in carbon emissions cannot be met through energy efficiency or fuel switching, the only other way they can be achieved in this scenario is via widespread energy rationing. That is, policies which stop or restrict energy-using outputs or activities - generating significant economic costs and disruption." Oil majors such as BP find it easier (though not easy) to take a longer view; the E amp;P companies active in shale are more concerned with surviving the next 12 months. Even so, the larger ones should also have an interest in putting the industry on a more sustainable footing, not least because the costs of, say, doing the right thing on methane emissions would force many marginal competitors to consolidate or disappear. This is the lesson of energy's decline into index obscurity. Even with so much extraneous help  #8212; rising demand, OPEC+, reinstated Iran sanctions, zero interest rates, free flaring in Texas, Trump's regulatory rollback, unpriced carbon emissions  #8212; the industry has foundered. What exactly is required to make it work? A Supreme Court ruling that everyone must own two SUVs? Whether they realize it or not, those decrying the prospect of a Biden administration forcing the fossil-fuels business to finally internalize the costs of climate change are implicitly admitting this business cannot survive without massive subsidies. And one suspects the overlap between them and those folks who dismiss renewables with tired stuff like "but Solyndra!" is reasonably extensive. Similarly, if the industry only sees a future for itself via its political allies setting judges against majority opinion and making energy just another front in the culture wars, then it has lost the moral authority to help shape the inevitable transition. The line linking decades of discrediting scientific findings on climate as elitist oppression and our current moment, in which a sick president mocks masking against a deadly disease, may be a dotted one, but it is there. Rather than a dead end for the industry, Biden represents an off-ramp.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>by: Kaylee Douglas OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR)  #8211; Since the beginning of the pandemic, OU Medicine #8217;s Dr. Dale Bratzler has spoken openly his expert assessment of the coronavirus pandemic, and suggestions for how people should respond to reduce the amount of infections and deaths. His frustration about the state #8217;s response has increased along with the number of Oklahomans infected and hospitalized. During an interview Tuesday I asked him how he felt about the fact that some people believe he is an alarmist.  #8220;If I #8217;m an alarmist, so be it, #8221; said Dr. Bratzler Tuesday,  #8220;but I will push back the other way and say I #8217;m not sure that our leadership is being totally transparent about what #8217;s really happening in or state because everybody wants it to be good,  #8216;We #8217;re doing great, #8217; and that #8217;s just not the case, and all you have to do is look at the numbers. #8221; The number of Oklahomans infected and needing hospital care frequently reaching record numbers in October. As of Tuesday, 1,119 people in the state have died from the COVID-19. A projection by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation puts the number of death just above 1,450 on Thanksgiving. While Dr. Bratzler said he doesn #8217;t fully trust the accuracy of death projections because there are so many unknown variables, he said he believes this number is possible.  #8220;Since this pandemic began, we #8217;ve been seeing 35 deaths per week every single week for 31 weeks if you average it out over the entire 31 weeks of the pandemic, #8221; he said. What #8217;s more, without further social distancing mandates, he said the number of people infected will only continue to increase. It #8217;s frustrating for him as he looks around at other states, like Arizona, where stricter measures resulted in better outcomes.  #8220;Arizona was in the news a lot because of all the cases they had but they got it under control pretty quick, but they did some pretty aggressive things, and they controlled it, #8221; Dr. Bratzler said. He also pointed out the Oklahoma State Department of Health Weekly Epidemiology Report which now includes data on the impact mask mandates have when imposed in certain cities around Oklahoma.  #8220;The state health department actually has a graphic now that shows if you wear masks, and your community has a mandate, you have less new cases of COVID-19 and yet we can #8217;t mandate it in our state, #8221; Dr. Bratzler said.  #8220;What I really think is that we #8217;re dragging this out, something that we could have tamped down quite a while back. We just keep kind of dragging it out. #8221; Charlie Hannema, a spokesperson for Governor Kevin Stitt responded in a statement, saying,  #8220;Governor Stitt #8217;s thoughts on a mask mandate haven #8217;t changed  #8211; he encourages Oklahomans to wear one when around others but doesn #8217;t feel a statewide mandate is a one-size-fits-all solution. #160;As for Dr. Bratzler, he #8217;s certainly entitled to his opinion, but I #8217;d be curious his examples of places that have  #8220;tamped down the virus a while back #8221; while also being open for more than 4 months without restrictions. #160;In a perfect world, we #8217;d have zero new cases, but our overall death rate has declined to 1.1%, and our per capita death rate is 57% lower than the national average and significantly lower than other states that are still shut down. The data shows Oklahomans are working together to protect our most vulnerable while minimizing the other harmful effects of a pandemic. #8221; Dr. Bratzler pointed out that the mortality rate, or the percentage of people dying across the country has gone down because more young people are now being affected, and treatment has improved. However, even a 1.1% mortality rate is about 10 times higher than influenza.  #8220;I believe some of those deaths could have been prevented if we did not just rely on  #8216;personal responsibility, #8217; #8221; Dr. Bratzler said.  #8220;I stand by my recommendation that we should mandate masks across the state because the case counts are very high now, hospitalizations are going up, and we are going to see more people in Oklahoma die from this disease. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Alex Brandon The U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett as the next Supreme Court justice got underway Monday, three weeks before the presidential election. It is a constitutional process that did not need to be pushed through during a pandemic that includes President Donald Trump recovering from a COVID-19 infection and precautions limiting robust Senate engagement in the process. The hearing clearly violates Senate precedent set by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell only four years ago. He refused to take up President Barack Obama #8217;s nomination of Merrick Garland after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, nine months before a presidential election. Then, the Republican Senate leaders insisted voters ought to have a say in the next justice in the presidential election. Oklahoma Sens. James Lankford and Jim Inhofe backed the effort to deny the hearing. They give their support now for Barrett #8217;s hearing, offering the unsatisfactory argument that things are essentially different this time around because Republicans control the Senate and White House. In 2016, we felt Garland deserved a hearing, but once McConnell set precedent, he should abide by it. The smart money says that unless something dramatic happens in the next few days, the votes are in place to rush through the Barrett confirmation and and reconfigure the Supreme Court #8217;s philosophical bent. That, of course, sets a new precedent that Republican Senate leaders might not appreciate when the tables turn. The new rules is: No precedent matters, if you have the momentary majority. Might make right. The end justifies the means. There was no pressing reason to move forward with the nomination and hearing, other than political expediency. The high court and the Senate purposely moves at a deliberate pace. Three weeks before a presidential election is the wrong time to reshpe the U.S. Supreme Court. Confirm in haste; repent at leisure.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been in and around politics for a long time, and not once, ever, have I encountered a candidate who said he or she might not accept the results of an election. Until now. Certainly, in close-fought races candidates might ask for a recount. But once the precinct workers and town and city clerks and secretaries of state have checked and re-checked and certified, we consider the matter settled. We accept and abide by the results  #8212; at least until the next election. This year, we can #8217;t take that for granted. Why does this trouble so many of us? Let #8217;s take a step back and start with the idea of elections themselves. In the end, democracy is about understanding and respecting the will of the people. We do this primarily by asking them to vote. This is what puts elections at the core of the American system: They are literally how we Americans decide where we #8217;re going to head as a nation. The elections process is at the center of who we are. In fact, voting  #8212; and ensuring that the vote is fair and transparent  #8212; is how the institutions that represent us function. When the House of Representatives is deciding on policy, it votes. When the Supreme Court needs to decide a case, it votes. When state legislatures and city councils and New England town meetings have to set a budget or decide on taxes, they vote. Those votes are public, and they #8217;re tallied, and that #8217;s how we have confidence that the issue was decided fairly. When elections are done, we commit to a peaceful transfer of power to the winners. We hand power to them without taking up arms and without casting doubt on the legitimacy of their win. That #8217;s been part and parcel of who we are for centuries, and it #8217;s one of the features of our system that has made the U.S. a beacon to others. Now, however, we have a president who specifically questions whether or not he will accept the result of the election and step down peacefully. He talks  #8212; jokes, he says  #8212; about serving beyond his constitutionally allotted time, raising the specter of an American authoritarianism that once seemed inconceivable. And if the election does not go the way he wants it to, he may do what he #8217;s done for much of his adult life: litigate and insist on its illegitimacy. All of these are extraordinary statements are out of line with everything we #8217;ve come to accept about our elections. There is no question that these will be difficult elections to administer. If nothing else, the pandemic ensures that. We #8217;re accustomed to knowing election results by the end of the night, but this year a lot of votes will come in later, and it #8217;s expected that days or even weeks could go by before we know the winner. This will not be because voter fraud is taking place; as FBI director Christopher Wray just told Congress, there #8217;s very little evidence that it exists. Instead, it will be because the hard-working women and men who administer our elections at the local level will be doing their level best to ensure that every eligible voter #8217;s ballot gets counted. Already, President Donald Trump seems to have much of his base convinced that the only way he could possibly lose is by fraud. This is a president who insisted there was fraud even after winning the 2016 election. So, the challenge is, how do we uphold this core feature of our democracy? How do we ensure the results are accepted as legitimate? These are tough questions for our democracy, but I do know one thing: All state and local election officials have to do their best to ensure that everyone who is entitled to vote can cast a ballot, and that those ballots are counted as transparently as possible, without vote-suppression shenanigans.

    <TEXT>Andrea Eger The lone member of the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board to vote no on termination proceedings against Epic Charter Schools this week is a family member of one of the school #8217;s two co-founders who have reportedly become millionaires through their deal to manage the school. In multiple public social media posts, board member Phyllis Shepherd wished Epic #8217;s David Chaney  #8220;Happy birthday, nephew #8221; and signed anniversary well wishes to him from  #8220;Aunt Phyllis. #8221; A tip-off to the posts prompted the Tulsa World to track down public genealogy records that show Chaney and Shepherd are related on Chaney #8217;s father #8217;s side of his family. Both Shepherd and Chaney acknowledged being related but denied it represents a conflict of interest because they consider it to be a distant relation. State ethics rules prohibit a state officer from using their office  #8220;for the private gain #8221; of a family member, and the rules state that a state officer shall not participate in a matter  #8220;likely to have a direct and predictable effect on the material financial interests #8221; of a family member.  #8220;That #8217;s kind of a complicated thing. His grandmother was my half-sister, and she was like 14 years older, #8221; Shepherd told the World.  #8220;It #8217;s not a close relationship. I #8217;ve never been to his house; he #8217;s never been to my house  #8211; I certainly don #8217;t have anything to do with talking with him about virtual charter school board business. #8221; Assistant Attorney General Marie Schuble on Tuesday recommended that the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board enter into termination proceedings based on new findings from the state auditor that Epic #8217;s operators may have violated their contractual fiscal management standards and violated various laws, as well as for  #8220;good cause. #8221; Shepherd said at the meeting that she could not support such a move without Epic first having the opportunity to rebut anything reported in the state #8217;s forensic audit. Schuble explained that that is what termination proceedings are for, since a public hearing will be set in a few months at which she will present evidence and Epic and its attorneys will have the same opportunity. Only at that juncture would the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board be faced with the decision to vote to actually terminate Epic #8217;s sponsorship contract, and settlement and negotiations are also a possibility between now and then, Schuble had said. Ultimately, the board voted 3-1, with Shepherd voting no. Shepherd #8217;s public Facebook posts also included shares of Chaney #8217;s posts when his father, Roy Chaney, ran for the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Shepherd, of Henryetta, was appointed to the board that oversees all statewide virtual charter schools by House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, in 2018.  #8220;Our office was not aware of any relationship. The House expects its appointees to abstain where a conflict exists, #8221; said John Estus, a spokesman for McCall, when contacted by the World on Wednesday.  #8220;Because the House makes hundreds of required annual appointments, the House expects appointees to disclose conflicts that are not readily identifiable. This appointee did not disclose any relationship. Now that this has been brought to our attention, our office intends to gather additional information and review the appointment. #8221; Estus also noted that among the House #8217;s two appointees to the statewide virtual board, one also voted for Tuesday #8217;s motion to enter into termination proceedings against Epic.  #8220;There was no communication between our office and these appointees concerning Tuesday #8217;s board meeting, #8221; he said. Asked how she came to be appointed to represent the Second Congressional District on the statewide virtual board, Shepherd said,  #8220;The Speaker of the House called me. I have some friends  #8211; a son and daughter-in-law of one of my good friends I went to college with. They said they were looking for someone with teaching experience and I have 30 years #8217; experience. I don #8217;t have any idea how my name come up, but it was through them. #8221; John Harrington, who currently serves as chair of the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, responded to the information by saying he would be instructing the board #8217;s legal counsel to investigate.  #8220;Ms. Shepherd has not disclosed any violation of the ethics rules to our Board or its counsel, #8221; Harrington said.  #8220;The Virtual Charter School Board, like all boards, are governed by specific ethics rules, and members of the Board are advised of these rules. #8221; In September, Harrington led the censure and removal from the board #8217;s newly formed audit committee of member Mathew Hamrick. Hamrick was accused of intentionally avoiding public votes by the board in 2019 and 2020 on matters seeking to unmask Epic #8217;s use of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to date budgeted for student learning that Epic, the largest online school operator, is keeping private and for going rogue on the board #8217;s official support for the state auditor #8217;s legal battle over Epic Charter Schools #8217; spending records. As previously reported, records from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission show that David Chaney contributed to Hamrick #8217;s 2017 campaign for Senate District 45, which he lost. Chaney, whose for-profit school management company takes a 10% cut of every taxpayer dollar allocated to the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board for Epic, provided a written statement through a school spokeswoman, echoing Shepherd #8217;s sentiment about the family connection being a distant one.  #8220;We don #8217;t do family dinners together, and we are not of close enough relation to present a conflict, according to state statute. Anyone who knows Phyllis, a retired teacher, at all knows her to be independent in the best sense of the word, #8221; reads the statement. Chaney added that he thinks several board members and staff members at the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board  #8220;stand to gain if Epic can no longer operate. #8221;  #8220;For example, (Executive Director) Becky Wilkinson #8217;s daughter is the head of school for another virtual school  #8211; a competitor of Epic #8217;s. Barry Beauchamp (a board member) is now retired from Lawton Public Schools, but he can #8217;t be happy about the 1,500 students from his community who chose Epic instead. (Vice Chair) Robert Franklin has deep ties to brick and mortar schools and John Harrington is a consultant, and his customer base is brick and mortar schools who are hemorrhaging students as we continue to grow.  #8220;If you want to know who stands to gain the most from the board #8217;s action yesterday, look at the members who voted to begin the termination process. #8221; Staff writer Curtis Killman contributed to this story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oklahoma #8217;s rankings show improvement in the past two weekly White House Coronavirus Task Force reports, but that isn #8217;t necessarily good news. The state remains in the country #8217;s top 10 for weekly new cases and test positivity rates, but the nation #8217;s averages are increasing. The state had been in the top five in both metrics for two of three weeks when the U.S. averages were lower. Oklahoma ranks No. 9 in weekly cases and No. 8 in positivity rate, according to the Oct. 11 report released Wednesday by the state. The report is based on data from Oct. 3-9. The task force noted that it offered Gov. Kevin Stitt new data that included cases, test positivity and deaths by month in its packet to  #8220;show the time sequence #8221; of the disease spread in Oklahoma and the U.S.  #8220;These demonstrate the impact of comprehensive mitigation efforts when implemented effectively and that partial or incomplete mitigation leads to prolonged community spread and increased fatalities, #8221; the task force wrote. Oklahoma #8217;s new weekly case rate was 190 per 100,000 people, nearly double the U.S. average of 100 per 100,000. The state has been around double for five weeks. The state positivity rate is 10.0%, compared to the national average of 5.8%  #8212; the first time in six weeks Oklahoma hasn #8217;t been at least double the U.S. in that metric. Almost half of the state #8217;s counties (37 of 77, or 48%) are in the red zone for high levels of spread. Four-fifths of all counties (61 of 77, or 79%) have at least moderate spread.  #8220;Community spread continues in Oklahoma in both rural and urban areas, #8221; the report states.  #8220;Mitigation efforts should increase to include mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding crowds in public and social gatherings in private to stop the increasing spread among residents of Oklahoma. #8221; The counties in the White House #8217;s red zone in northeast Oklahoma are Tulsa, Adair, Craig, Creek, Delaware, Haskell, Latimer, LeFlore, Lincoln, Mayes, Okfuskee, Ottawa, Pittsburg, Sequoyah and Washington.

    <TEXT>The court-packing question came up again during last week #8217;s debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris. Pence pressed Harris: If the Democrats win the White House and Senate, will they increase the membership of the Supreme Court  #8212; that is, "pack" it  #8212; in order to dilute the 6-3 conservative majority that will be established if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? Harris declined to answer the question. Candidate Joe Biden did the same the following day. And should there be another presidential debate, when the question comes up, Biden should continue to refuse to answer. The question is a disingenuous attempt to deflect attention from the more profoundly important issues connected to this election. Increasing the size of the Supreme Court is an unsavory option, but it is not illegal or necessarily unscrupulous. Unfortunately, the idea is tainted by language  #8212; "packing" just sounds bad  #8212; and by President Franklin Roosevelt #8217;s clumsy attempt to expand the court in 1937. Nine is not a magic number designated in the Constitution. When F.D.R. #8217;s New Deal policies hit roadblocks in the Supreme Court, he noted that the size of the court had varied widely since the nation #8217;s founding: The court was established with six justices. In 1801 it had five. In 1807 there were seven justices. In 1837 it had grown to nine, and there were 10 in 1863. In 1866 the justices numbered seven, and in 1869, they were back to the current nine. (Note: My understanding of F.D.R. #8217;s court-packing episode is informed by the subject #8217;s treatment in H.W. Brands #8217; excellent biography of F.D.R., entitled "Traitor to His Class.") Roosevelt believed that a too-conservative Supreme Court was wrongly derailing New Deal legislation meant to alleviate suffering during the Depression and provide for a fairer, forward-looking America. Many of the rejected measures are ones that we now take for granted, such as minimum wage laws and fair labor practices. His solution was to appoint additional justices who could adapt to the times. Uncharacteristically, Roosevelt bungled his proposal, failing to convince the media, his fellow Democrats or the public. Fortunately, the court shifted on its own, obviating the need for enlargement. It began to rule in ways more consistent with a modern society. In March 1937, for example, it found, 5-4, that a Washington state minimum wage law was constitutional. Ideally, Supreme Court justices should be chosen on the basis of their integrity, fairness and competence. Centrist candidates, such as Merrick Garland, deserve bipartisan support, which Garland received before President Barack Obama nominated him to the court during the last year of his presidency. The problem with the current court is that it is already packed. Trump has publicly committed to nominate only justices who are ideological, who will overturn Roe v. Wade, for example. And that is precisely what he has done. Republicans played the hardest of hardball with the Garland nomination, and in this game the Democrats have no obligation to take one of their most potent weapons off the table. Anytime a politician won #8217;t answer a question, it looks suspicious, providing a choice opportunity for an opponent to make political hay. But Republican criticism of Biden #8217;s refusal is a glaring irony in light of the questions that both Trump and Pence refuse to answer. For example: How does the Trump administration account for the deaths from Pandemic 2020 that far exceed those of comparable countries? No answer. How, specifically, will the Trump administration provide for citizens with pre-existing health conditions? No answer. Will the Trump administration commit to a peaceful transfer of power? No answer. Are you, Mr. Trump, willing to publicly condemn white supremacists? Worse than "no answer": Trump shouldn #8217;t have told the Proud Boys to "Stand back and stand by." He should have told them to "Disband!" Strange, isn #8217;t it? The Republicans manage to gain political traction by accusing Democrats of a willingness to violate a rule that doesn #8217;t exist, while at the same time they refuse to answer questions about their flagrant violation of the rules, norms and laws that are the bedrock of our nation.

    <TEXT>There are 270,000 registered Muslim voters in Michigan. Those are serious numbers for a battleground state. If mobilized, Muslims could be a decisive factor on Nov. 3. My work is to make that happen. Born to Palestinian parents, I have dedicated much of my political life to southeast Michigan. I organized my own campaign for the Dearborn City Council, knocking on 4,000 doors. Before that, I was a field coordinator for Rep. Rashida Tlaib, now one of three Muslims in Congress. Today, I head Emgage Michigan, my state's chapter of the nation's largest Muslim PAC. In this role, I organize voter turnout operations, which we run year-round, not only in Michigan but in other states like Virginia and Florida. We also work to politically empower American Muslims  #8212; engaging candidates and elected leaders on the priorities of Muslim voters, which include domestic and foreign policy. Indeed, because of my Palestinian identity, I see these issues as inseparable: The way we treat others abroad reflects on how we treat each other at home. That's why Emgage Michigan lobbied two state senators and nine representatives for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, as well as supporting Kashmiri rights and opposing the far-right, Hindu national regime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. As a Palestinian, I am passionate about Kashmir because Palestinians suffer many of the same injustices that Kashmiris do. And those human rights violations, in turn, resemble and remind us of the situation many Americans face every day. The American Muslim community is remarkably diverse. We are overwhelmingly Black or of Arab and Middle Eastern or South Asian ancestry. Many of us are immigrants and many of us are U.S.-born. Many of us are affected by racism, but all of us are affected by Islamophobia. Because we have been marginalized, we are especially sensitive to the marginalization of others. A passion to right wrongs abroad and at home  #8212; and an awareness of the bleak overlap between the two  #8212; drives me forward. We mobilize for Breonna Taylor. We mobilize for the immigrants down the street. We mobilize because so many in our communities, people of color, are pressed down by systemic injustices. It is in that spirit, and with that conviction, that Emgage Michigan is putting its energy into statewide campaigns to mobilize Muslim voters. Though some of us are conservatives and others are progressives, it is our hope that Muslim voters contribute to a Biden-Harris victory. We know, of course, neither are perfect candidates. For example, Joe Biden is not the ideal candidate on the issue of Palestine. But he's a world better than Donald Trump. Can you imagine President Trump even acknowledging us, let alone listening to us? As it stands, whether Biden and Harris win depends on states like Michigan. And that in turn magnifies the importance of strong Muslim voter turnout. But the election is not the conclusion. The Biden campaign has demonstrated a willingness to listen to Muslims. If he wins, it will be, in part, because of us. And therefore, if he wins, he can also expect to hear a lot more from us. Nada Al-Hanooti is the executive director of Emgage Michigan.

    <TEXT>A cluster of investigations targeting the last presidential administration was supposed to help extend the current one for another term. But here we are in mid-October, and none of these Trump-era look-backs at the Obama administration's actions has yet to offer the incumbent much electoral aid. With his offense looking shaky, President Donald Trump could in theory try instead to play a little defense as opponent Joe Biden, polling well at the moment, apparently seeks to run out the election clock without fumbling. This week, The Washington Post reported that a federal prosecutor came up empty in his probe into whether President Barack Obama's aides improperly "unmasked" the identities of Americans kept anonymous in intelligence documents. For some time, Trump allies in the Senate and right-wing media, propelled by Trump on Twitter, have talked about this "unmasking" as the key to revising and reversing the record on Russiagate. This outcome fits with others. Official GOP dives don't seem to have delivered the desired results, including probes into the Clinton Foundation, Ukraine "servers," Biden #8217;s son Hunter and the roots of the FBI look at the Trump camp's many Russia contacts. None of former special counsel Robert Mueller's convictions have been dented either, except by the unusual interventions of Trump and Attorney General William Barr, all after the fact. Although one special DOJ investigation exposed systemically shoddy practices under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it found no abuse of power by top officials resulting from anti-Trump bias. So Trump and his private-sector lawyer Rudy Giuliani are left at this late hour to try to manufacture their best negative stories and memes about Democrats. Trump's spray of falsehoods about his foes ranges wide this week. These included: Obama sacrificing the lives of U.S. Navy SEALs to fake the Osama bin Laden killing; Trump's "saving" of the suburbs from destruction by ending an Obama-era housing rule; and his blaming Joe Biden and Obamacare, rather than his own administration's court efforts to eviscerate the health care law, for the danger that those with preexisting conditions won't be insured. Lawyer Giuliani, meanwhile, is peddling Biden "scandal" stories of opaque provenance. Special circumstances have in some ways lowered the bar for Biden. A shrewder opponent than Trump might have better capitalized on Biden's policy wiggles, and Biden's differences with those he beat in the Democratic primaries. On fracking and court-packing, Biden has seen fit to change postures or play it coy. But at the moment, his party seems no less united. As the incumbent, Trump might be better off playing a bit of defense. He could come clean on why he stalled his coronavirus response. He could reveal why he is so intent on concealing his tax information from lawful authorities such as Congress and the Manhattan district attorney. He could justify to the public how he thinks his policies on China, Ukraine, Russia, Iran and "law and order" have worked. He could seek to explain himself on many fronts in a debate or a town hall. On the highly unlikely chance that Trump deigns to do such things, the chances of reelection might improve. Early voting has begun, but there are still strategies available to both candidates that go beyond mudslinging, bromides and taking advantage of the other guy's gaffes. There's still time to clarify.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By JASON DEAREN, MIKE STOBBE and RICHARD LARDNER Associated Press NEW YORK (AP)  #8212; The Trump White House has installed two political operatives at the nation #8217;s top public health agency to try to control the information it releases about the coronavirus pandemic as the administration seeks to paint a positive outlook, sometimes at odds with the scientific evidence. The two appointees assigned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention #8217;s Atlanta headquarters in June have no public health background. They have been tasked with keeping an eye on Dr. Robert Redfield, the agency director, as well as scientists, according to a half-dozen CDC and administration officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal government affairs. The appointments were part of a push to get more  #8220;politicals #8221; into the CDC to help control messaging after a handful of leaks were  #8220;upsetting the apple cart, #8221; said an administration official. When the two appointees showed up in Atlanta, their roles were a mystery to senior CDC staff, the people said. They had not even been assigned offices. Eventually one, Nina Witkofsky, became acting chief of staff, an influential role as Redfield #8217;s right hand. The other, her deputy Trey Moeller, began sitting in on scientific meetings, the sources said. It #8217;s not clear to what extent the two appointees have affected the agency #8217;s work, according to interviews with multiple CDC officials. But congressional investigators are examining that very question after evidence has mounted of political interference in CDC scientific publications, guidance documents and web postings. The White House declined to comment. A CDC spokesperson confirmed that Witkofsky and Moeller were working at the agency reporting to Redfield, but did not comment further. Moeller said in an email to The AP,  #8220;I work for Dr. Redfield who is 100% committed to the science and the thousands of incredibly dedicated employees at the CDC. #8221; During previous pandemics such as Ebola, the CDC was the public face of the U.S. response, offering scientifically driven advice. The agency played the same role at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but stumbled in February when a test for the virus sent to the states proved flawed. Then, in late February, a top CDC infectious disease expert, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, upset the administration by speaking frankly at a news conference about the dangers of the virus when the president was downplaying it. Within weeks, the agency was pushed offstage. Still, CDC persisted in assembling science-based information that conflicted with the White House narrative. In May, a series of leaked emails and scientific documents obtained by The AP detailed how the White House had buried CDC #8217;s detailed guidelines for communities reopening during a still-surging pandemic. The resulting news stories angered the administration, and sparked renewed efforts to exert control over CDC, according to current and former officials. On a Monday in June, the new faces arrived unexpectedly at Redfield #8217;s Atlanta offices, said a former CDC official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency affairs. One was Witkofsky, who according to federal election records had a minor role in Trump #8217;s presidential campaign. She was installed initially as a senior adviser to Redfield. In a few weeks, she would take over as the agency #8217;s acting chief of staff and become the person at CDC headquarters who has the most daily interactions with him, the CDC officials said. Presidential administrations appoint CDC directors. And there #8217;s nothing new about a White House seeking a better handle on information released by the agency, said Glen Nowak, a University of Georgia professor who ran CDC #8217;s media relations. But past administrations placed overtly political appointees in Washington; the Trump administration has taken it to a new level by placing people in CDC #8217;s Atlanta headquarters, Nowak said. Before Witkofsky and Moeller, the Trump administration had appointed others at CDC in Atlanta who were viewed by staff with some suspicion. But none of the predecessors were there to report internal agency business up to Washington, according to the officials. Witkofsky seemed a particularly strange fit for the nation #8217;s top public health agency. She studied finance and business administration in college and graduate school, and at one point worked as a publicist and talent booker for Turner Broadcasting #8217;s Cartoon Network. Her political work included being an events director during the George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign. Though Witkofsky was largely unknown, she had met a few CDC workers months earlier. In March, on behalf of the administration, she had worked communications when Trump visited a CDC lab. In her new role, Witkofsky communicated regularly with Michael Caputo, chief of communications for CDC #8217;s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, an administration official said. At the time Caputo #8217;s office was attempting to gain control over the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR, a CDC scientific weekly known for publishing authoritative and unvarnished information about disease-fighting efforts, according to multiple accounts. Witkofsky #8217;s deputy, Moeller, is a longtime GOP supporter who worked on the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign in 2004. The most recent post on his Facebook page was a  #8220;Make America Great Again #8221; Trump campaign banner. They wanted him to sit in meetings and "listen to scientists, #8221; said one health official. An HHS spokesperson said Witkifsky and Moeller both report to Redfield. Witkofsky and Moeller are among officials the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is seeking to interview as part of a probe it launched in mid-September into allegations that Caputo and others in the Trump administration blocked the CDC from publishing accurate scientific reports during the pandemic. The apparent meddling and political pressure from the Trump White House, and from HHS, have caused even scientific experts to question some CDC decisions.  #8220;I don #8217;t trust the (political appointees) that they #8217;ve dropped into the CDC, #8221; said Dr. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was reassigned to a lesser job because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug pushed by Trump as a COVID-19 treatment.  #8220;That is absolutely frightening, #8221; he said.  #8220;(It) leads to the mixed signals to the public. And I think that is increasing the magnitude and duration of this entire pandemic. #8221;  #8212; #8212; #8212; Lardner reported from Washington.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>WASHINGTON (AP)  #8212; President Donald Trump #8217;s plan to mail millions of seniors a $200 prescription savings card has hit legal and budget roadblocks, making it unlikely the government can carry it out before Election Day. Democratic lawmakers have raised questions about whether the administration has the authority to order on its own billions of dollars in Medicare spending for what the Democrats say are political reasons. Administration and congressional officials say such questions have bogged down review of the plan by agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the White House Office of Management and Budget. A White House official had no comment on the status of the prescription cards, which Trump announced with a flourish last month during a health care speech in Charlotte, N.C. The Medicare agency, or CMS, said in a statement:  #8220;We know that many seniors struggle to afford their medication and because of these high costs may forgo treatment. The administration is committed to lowering out-of-pocket costs for our nation #8217;s seniors. We will provide more information about the prescription drug cards soon. #8221; One administration official said the odds are 75-25 the plan will not happen. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss back-and-forth internal deliberations. Earlier this month, Reps. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., Richard Neal, D-Mass, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., questioned the legality of Trump's plan, saying in a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar that  #8220;the president now appears to be attempting to buy votes just weeks before the election using taxpayer dollars. #8221; The lawmakers' objections appear to have hit a nerve in the administration. Among them:  #8212; The White House asserted that Medicare could legally send out the discount cards under its authority to conduct  #8220;demonstration programs #8221; testing new ideas. The $200 would test if extra cash made seniors more likely to stay on their medications and avoid costly hospitalizations. But sending cards to nearly all Medicare recipients is not a test, the lawmakers said. For example, there wouldn't be a control group against which to measure any results. Therefore, such a mass mailing would not meet legal standards for a Medicare demonstration program testing new ideas.  #8212; The cost to taxpayers has been estimated as high as $7.8 billion, not counting administrative expenses. The money would come from Medicare's Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund. But spending for the cards has not been authorized by Congress, which has the power of the purse. A congressional official said that if the Trump administration approves the plan, it in effect would create a budgetary  #8220;trap door #8221; through which future administrations could try to spend billions of dollars without congressional oversight. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal analysis. When Trump announced the plan as part of a Sep. 24 speech calling attention to his health care agenda, it seemed like the discount cards were about to go in the mail. People wondered if they would bear the presidents' name. The cards would allow seniors to save $200 off their prescription copays. Trump initially said 33 million Medicare recipients would get the cards, but administration and congressional officials said the latest estimate is 39 million.  #8220;Nobody has seen this before, #8221; the president said, with trademark salesmanship.  #8220;These cards are incredible. The cards will be mailed out in coming weeks.  #8220;I will always take care of our wonderful senior citizens, #8221; Trump added.  #8220;Joe Biden won #8217;t be doing this. #8221; The plan came as a surprise to rank-and-file officials at HHS and CMS who were expected to carry it out, said the administration official, adding that it was directed by the White House. The agencies are trying to move ahead on Trump's plan, but the official said it first has to pass the legal and procedural checks that would apply to any similar idea. Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the cards would help a lot of people a little bit but that doesn't address the underlying problem of high prescription drug costs.  #8220;It would do relatively little for seniors with truly catastrophic prescription drug expenses, #8221; she said. Trump long ago backed off his 2016 campaign idea for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, an approach his Democratic rival Biden is now pushing. But he supported a bipartisan Senate bill that would have capped out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients and required rebates if drugmakers raised prices above inflation. Senior Republican senators were cool to the legislation, though, and Democrats coalesced around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's more ambitious bill empowering Medicare to negotiate prices. Ultimately, nothing passed Congress.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH)  #8212; Fighting for his life, an Oklahoma City man is now on an ECMO machine in Tulsa battling COVID-19. It's been nearly four months since Tyler Whitmire was first exposed to the coronavirus. "He had an exposure at work and the patient was positive, #8221; said Angi Whitmire, Tyler #8217;s wife.  #8220;So, because Tyler had the signs and symptoms, they called him presumptive positive." That was on June 19. Tyler is a former EMSA medic and currently works in a cardiac catheterization lab at a local hospital. He spent the following weeks battling symptoms and was never officially released to return to work by his doctor. On September 23, his condition declined. "It was like instantaneous. He was like, 'Man, I just don't feel well. I'm achy.' And it just got progressively worse throughout the day. So, I encouraged him to go visit our PCP, #8221; Angi explained. He was swabbed at the end of that visit and three days later received a positive result. The whole family went into quarantine, and two weeks passed before Tyler was admitted into a local hospital. Angi said he seemed to be managing well until the following Monday. "He took a pretty significant turn for the worse, #8221; she said.  #8220;They tried BiPAP and it didn't work, so they ended up having to put him on a vent." Tyler's son, 7, was unable to see his dad in person and struggling to comprehend the situation. Angi said he would try to communicate with his dad through his hospital room window from the parking lot. Days had passed when doctors determined Tyler's best chance for survival was to use an artificial lung and heart machine to pump and circulate blood, also known as ECMO. But there was one problem: No ICU beds were available in the OKC metro. "His pulmonologist searched from Kansas down to Texas and we were blessed to find one at Hillcrest in Tulsa, #8221; said Angi. "He doesn't even know he's been transferred obviously. I know that he knew that was going to happen. He called me and I was blessed to be able to say a prayer over him and tell him I love him right before they intubated him." As Tyler continues to put up a relentless fight, his family can't help but wonder if he was infected twice. "I know that the second go-around is obviously 10 times greater than you know the first go-around. They're both respiratory involved. But you know, part of me wonders if, you know, he did have COVID the first time and he didn't get well, #8221; Angi said. Dr. Linda Thompson, a research scientist at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation said that could be the case, as very few reports of reinfection have been confirmed. "The course of the disease can be highly variable from person to person, #8221; said Dr. Thompson.  #8220;So, sometimes people have very mild symptoms in the beginning, and they can get mild symptoms for quite a while and they may not end up in the hospital until two or three weeks later. So, you know, in theory, that could be interpreted as a mild case that you got over and then a second case where it was much more severe." Thompson couldn #8217;t say for sure, as it #8217;s going to take more time and data to determine the virus' true nature. Angi can only hope and pray that no matter the course Tyler #8217;s bout with the virus takes that he comes out of it stronger and healthier than ever.  #8220;He's a fighter. He's a warrior, #8221; Angi said. Tyler remains in the hospital in Tulsa.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>After almost four years of Donald Trump in the White House, it has become all too easy to forget how abnormal his presidency has been  #8212; how many norms he has trampled, how many rules he has broken. But the final stage of Trump's reelection campaign is bringing all the strands of Trumpism to an unhinged crescendo. In the last three weeks, the president has: Publicly urged Attorney General William Barr to prosecute his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and former President Barack Obama for purportedly spying on Trump's 2016 campaign, although no evidence suggests they committed a crime. "These people should be indicted," Trump said. "That includes Obama, and it includes Biden." Renewed his false claim that Democrats have rigged the presidential election. "This will be one of the most fraudulent elections ever," he said. Warned his followers that if Biden wins, Republicans might never win another election. "They want to turn America into communist Cuba," Trump told a rally Monday in Florida. Refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses. "We'll have to see," he told reporters. "There won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation." This is, to put it mildly, not normal. Previous presidents often warned of dire consequences if their opponents were elected, but they didn't accuse their political foes of treason or of trying to end the American way of life. During Watergate, President Richard Nixon pressed the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service to investigate his critics, but he made the demands in secret, presumably because he knew it was wrong. No U.S. president has previously suggested that he might not accept the results of an election. Trump hasn't succeeded in seizing the powers of an autocrat, but he often sounds like he'd like to. Even Barr, who believes in a broad definition of presidential powers, has pushed back against Trump's attempts to dictate whom he prosecutes. But Trump's style and strategy are still doing serious damage to American politics. He's deliberately feeding partisan polarization, the animosity that drives Americans in both parties to view those on the other side as enemies  #8212; instead of merely neighbors with mistaken ideas. In the worst case, it could even inspire violence  #8212; as it almost did, apparently, when a group of men allegedly plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent target of criticism from Trump. Asked about the incident, the president said vaguely that he opposes violence from both right and  #8212; and added that he thinks Whitmer "has done a terrible job." The tendency for Democrats and Republicans to distrust and fear each other  #8212; a phenomenon political scientists call "affective polarization"  #8212; took root long before Trump ran for president. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that 45% of Republicans viewed Democratic policies as a "threat" to the nation; 41% of Democrats said the same thing about the GOP. A 2019 Pew poll found that 55% of Republicans say Democrats are "more immoral" than other Americans; 47% of Democrats feel the same way about Republicans. Previous presidents have used polarization as part of reelection strategies, of course. In 2004, President George W. Bush's campaign focused on maximizing Republican turnout and discrediting his Democratic opponent, John F. Kerry. In 2012, Obama focused on the Democratic base and discrediting his opponent, Mitt Romney. But they treated polarization as a necessary evil, not a guiding principle. Trump has made it a centerpiece of his presidency. He has frequently described the nation as divided between well-run Republican "red states" and poorly run Democratic "blue states" and has threatened to withhold federal aid from Democratic governors whose policies he dislikes. "Outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don't have crime in this country," he said Monday  #8212; an assertion that is wildly untrue. Last month, he even claimed that the coronavirus was mainly a Democratic problem. "If you take the blue states out ... we're really at a very low level," he said. That statement was also wildly untrue. Trump doesn't merely criticize Democrats for their policies. He has falsely charged that a Biden presidency would "destroy the American way of life." He has falsely claimed that Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God." "We got to vote these people into oblivion," he urged supporters at the White House. "Got to get rid of them." Political scholars normally see that kind of demonizing rhetoric in other countries. "We're seeing attitudes here that are familiar from places like Venezuela, Turkey or Hungary," Jennifer McCoy, a professor at Georgia State University who has studied those countries, told me. "When more people are saying they see the other party as a threat to the nation, or that they are afraid of the other party, polarization has gotten pretty serious," she said. "When one group views the other as a threat, they're much more willing to accept undemocratic moves by their side  #8212; because they want their guy to stay in power." Is there a way back? Yes, but it won't be easy. "A leader can choose depolarization as a strategy," she said. "Don't engage in retribution or vilification of the other side ... . Guarantee that you'll govern for all." Sounds more like Biden than Trump. But first, he needs to get elected. Doyle McManus is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.  #160;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How The Native American Vote Continues To Be Suppressed</TITLE>

    <TEXT>The right to vote has been an uphill battle for Native Americans. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped to secure and protect that right for many Native Americans and Alaska Natives. With the Voting Rights Act, voter participation among Native Americans increased. However, the Supreme Court invalidated the Section 5 preclearance formula in 2013 (Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)), removing one of the most powerful tools to ensure equal access to the ballot, including Alaska and Arizona, and two jurisdictions in South Dakota with significant Native American and Alaska Native populations. Since the Shelby County decision, efforts to suppress the vote have increased. For Native Americans, these voter suppression efforts can and do have devastating impacts. #160; "The right to vote is precious. It is almost sacred. It is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democracy."  #8212;Representative John Lewis Despite the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, many Native Americans living on reservations continued to be excluded from the democratic process. In 1948, Native Americans in New Mexico and Arizona successfully litigated their right to vote. Utah and North Dakota became the last states to afford on-reservation Native Americans the right to vote in 1957 and 1958, respectively. When the right to vote was finally secured, voter suppression laws kept Native Americans from voting and seeking elected office. In Arizona, for example, Native Americans could not fully participate in voting until 1970 when the Supreme Court upheld the ban against using literacy tests (Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970)). Today, the right to vote continues to be challenged through the passage of new laws and practices that either fail to consider, disregard, or intentionally target Native American voters. In order to understand the challenges faced by Native American voters, one must recognize the vast differences in experiences, opportunities, and realities facing on-reservation voters as compared to off-reservation voters. I will never forget the Navajo grandmother who spoke only Navajo and could not vote after Arizona passed its voter ID law in 2004. She tried several times to obtain an Arizona ID on her own but was denied because she was born at home in a hogan, and the boarding schools changed her Navajo name to English. She lived in a modest home on the Navajo Reservation without electricity and running water, and lived a traditional lifestyle taking care of her sheep. She was embarrassed and devastated when she was turned away from the polls for not having an ID. Working with her, a team from the Indian Legal Clinic traveled five hours to meet her at multiple agency offices to obtain her delayed birth certificate; we then went to two separate Motor Vehicle Division Offices. The first one did not issue same-day photo IDs, and the other initially denied her request. The office rejected her delayed Navajo birth certificate, until I was able to intervene and demonstrate to them that it was an acceptable document. The system failed to consider her reality as a Navajo woman and failed to value her as a voter. Fortunately, she was persistent in exercising her right to vote, but not all voters are, nor should they have to be. This example helps explain why voting can be difficulty for Native American voters. Turnout for Native Americans is the lowest in the country, as compared to other groups. While a number of issues contribute to the low voter turnout, a study conducted by the Native American Voting Rights Coalition found that low levels of trust in government, lack of information on how and where to register and to vote, long travel distances to register or to vote, low levels of access to the internet, hostility toward Native Americans, and intimidation are obstacles. Isolating conditions such as language barriers, socioeconomic disparities, lack of access to transportation, lack of residential addresses, lack of access to mail, and the digital divide limit Native American political participation. Changes to voting processes further frustrate the ability of Native Americans to vote. As part of their socioeconomic reality, Native Americans face obstacles when making choices about feeding their families or expending resources that might affect their right to vote. This could include renewing their P.O. box, replacing an ID to update a residential address, or driving a considerable distance to register to vote or vote. Nationally, the poverty rate of Native Americans is 26.8 percent. Native Americans are more likely to work multiple jobs, lack reliable transportation, and lack adequate childcare resources, thus making voting pragmatically difficult. An additional problem affecting many Native Americans is homelessness or near homelessness due to extreme poverty and lack of affordable housing on many reservations. A study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that between 42,000 and 85,000 people in tribal areas are couch surfers, staying with friends or relatives only because they have no place of their own. This lack of permanent housing impacts the ability of these tribal members to have a permanent physical address, yet this should not impede their ability to exercise their right to vote. Nontraditional Addresses, Voter Registration, and Voter ID Laws Something as simple as not having a residential address impacts all aspects of voting, including getting your mail, registering to vote, and complying with ever-increasing voter ID laws. While 84 percent of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, many Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in rural communities that lack residential addresses. Homes are usually described in terms of landmarks, crossroads, and directions. Numerous roads on reservations are unimproved dirt or gravel roads in poor quality and are often unnamed. After storms, many roads are impassable. Due to these poor conditions, the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver mail to the majority of the reservation residents at their homes. Due to the lack of residential addresses, most residents rely on P.O. boxes in a nearby town or get their mail through a trading post or other location. Some reservation residents have to travel up to 70 miles in one direction to receive mail. In Arizona, for example, only 18 percent of reservation voters outside of Maricopa and Pima Counties have residential addresses and receive mail at home. The Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the United States #8212;larger than West Virginia #8212;does not have an addressing program, and most people live in remote communities. Similarly, many other reservations lack home mail delivery. On the Tohono O #8217;odham Reservation, there are 1,900 P.O. boxes and some cluster mailboxes. Residents may check their mail every two weeks, and some only once per month. Through no fault of the voter, the lack of a residential address can result in the political subdivision placing the voter in the wrong precinct, the voter #8217;s ID address not matching the voter rolls, and/or the voter not receiving election mail timely, if at all. While many Americans can register to vote through the click of a button from the comfort of their homes, that is simply not the case for reservation residents. For reservation voters, there are few opportunities to register or update their voter registration due to location of voter registration services, the lack of residential addresses, and lack of broadband capability. Less than half of the homes on tribal lands have reliable broadband access. Even if a voter has access to broadband on the reservation, most online voter registration systems require a state ID to register to vote and do not accept tribal IDs. In Arizona, for example, an individual must have a state ID and a residential address on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles to register online, eliminating this option for most reservation residents. Registering to vote online or driving somewhere to register to vote, or voting itself, can be logistically challenging if not economically infeasible. For example, in Arizona, the lack of residential addresses resulted in registered voters having their IDs rejected at the polls or being included on a suspense list, meaning the voter is not placed in a voting precinct. While county offices may offer in-person voter registration during normal business hours, this can be challenging for Native American voters who may live 100 miles or more from the county seat. Further, for some Native American and Alaska Natives, oral translations must be provided for voter registration and voting. . . . more in the article</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.S. was the world's best prepared nation to confront a pandemic. How did it spiral to 'almost inconceivable' failure? Interviews with public health experts and reviews of studies by government agencies, watchdog groups and scientists reveal a cascade of blunders. Mark Johnson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Updated 7:46 a.m. CDT Oct. 14, 2020 Almost two months had passed since Chinese health officials first described a fast-moving new coronavirus that had jumped the species barrier #160;from animals to humans. By the time President Donald Trump strode into the White House briefing room on the evening of Feb. 26, the virus had killed more than 2,700 people in China and forced the lockdown of 11 million residents in Wuhan. Infections in Italy were rising by an astonishing 40% a day. That night #160;Trump assured Americans,  #8220;We #8217;re very, very ready for this, for anything. #8221; Then he held aloft a report co-produced by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security ranking 195 countries on their readiness to confront a pandemic.  #8220;The United States, #8221; he said,  #8220;is rated number one most prepared. #8221; The nation did indeed rank first on the Global Health Security Index. But the president never mentioned the report #8217;s ominous central finding:  #8220;No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics. Collectively, international preparedness is weak. #8221; Moreover, #160;the index revealed a number of U.S. flaws that have proved #160;crippling in the fight against COVID-19. #160;America received the lowest possible score for public confidence in government; low rankings among the index #8217;s 60 high-income countries for doctors per capita (38th) and hospital beds per capita (40th); and a dismal rating for access to health care  #8212; 175th out of 195 countries. What the index could not have predicted  #8212; what stunned the nation's public health experts as months passed  #8212; was America #8217;s lethargic and inconsistent response, and its failure to follow basic precepts of its own pandemic playbook. "It's not that the index measured anything inappropriately, it's that none of it was acted on," said Joe Smyser, CEO of the national health care nonprofit Public Good Projects. "I don't think we've ever failed on this scale. The level of failure is almost inconceivable." The pandemic #160;playbook, passed down from President Barack Obama to President Donald Trump, #160;had been one of the nation's key planning documents: #160;a 69-page blueprint laying out the decisions to be made and agencies to be mobilized in a health disaster. Throughout its pages, the document stressed the need for an early public health response coordinated by the federal government. Joe Smyser, CEO of the national health care nonprofit Public Good Projects It's not that the index measured anything inappropriately, it's that none of it was acted on. I don't think we've ever failed on this scale. The level of failure is almost inconceivable. That did not happen. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel interviews with public health experts and reviews of numerous studies by government agencies, watchdog groups and scientists reveal a cascade of blunders that contributed to the deaths of more Americans in the pandemic than died in the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. Among the most serious lapses: Money for public health had been cut steadily for decades. The cuts became critical because America's #160;leaders ignored warnings about #160;the dire consequences should #160;the federal government abandon #160;its central role in a pandemic, and leave #160;states to fend for themselves. When this scenario occurred, #160;some states were forced to #160;compete #160;with #160;one #160;another #160;in order to purchase #160;scarce #160;medical supplies. Further, in the absence of detailed federal guidelines, states imposed a hodgepodge #160;of lockdown policies, only to have some #160;undermined by politicians, including the president. Despite more than a decade of scientific warnings about #160;the specific threat posed by coronaviruses, #160;the government and drug companies allowed a potential vaccine to be shelved for three years instead of #160;testing it in #160;human trials. Trump routinely dismissed the advice of his own health experts, downplaying the severity of the pandemic. The president told journalist Bob Woodward, as recounted in the book "Rage," that #160;he played down the pandemic #160;to avoid triggering panic. While leaders #160;of other countries #160;united their #160;citizens behind the idea of collective sacrifice through lockdowns and other measures, U.S. leaders, especially the president, politicized the pandemic. When #160;Americans #160;most needed to pull together, they slipped deeper into #160;bitter polarization. #160; With its pandemic playbook, "The U.S. was very well prepared," #160;said Eric Toner, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. #160;"What happened is that we didn #8217;t do what we said we #8217;d do. That #8217;s where everything fell apart. We ended up being the best prepared and having one of the worst outcomes. #8221; #160; In disasters, Americans have grown accustomed to looking down with pity at other countries that have fared worse and need our help. COVID-19 shattered that image. Eric Toner, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security What happened is that we didn #8217;t do what we said we #8217;d do. That #8217;s where everything fell apart. We ended up being the best prepared and having one of the worst outcomes.  #8220;The U.S. accounts for less than 5% of the world #8217;s population, but more than 25% of total COVID-19 cases reported across the globe, #160;and it currently ranks among the top 10 countries in COVID-19-related deaths per capita, #8221; wrote the authors of a Sept. 16 commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  #8220;During the years to come, #8221; the authors predicted, #160; #8220;the U.S. undoubtedly will undergo national-level reviews to understand how its strong capabilities were squandered when the country needed them most. #8221; #160; When the #160;Journal Sentinel asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide evidence that officials #160;used the pandemic playbook, a spokesperson offered none. Instead, she said the Trump administration's response "was informed" by three #160;more recent plans. One of those plans, "The National Biodefense Strategy" from 2018 is not a step-by-step guide for responding to a pandemic, but more a list of goals. Trump departed from one of those goals when he chose to downplay the virus rather than provide "accurate, timely and actionable public messaging." The other two reports #160; #8212; the Biological Incident Annex #160;(2017) and the Pandemic Crisis Action Plan (2018)  #8212; were both found to be flawed during a pandemic preparedness exercise #160;called Crimson Contagion. #160;The simulation took place in August 2019. More than four months later, when #160;the #160;pandemic was not a simulation, but real, other #160;nations saw the danger, acted quickly and suffered #160;far fewer deaths than did the U.S. #160;Thailand began screening passengers from Wuhan on Jan. 3  #8212; a full two weeks before #160;American airports #160;began doing so. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention #160;found #160;no evidence #160;the virus entered #160;the country before airport screening took effect on Jan. 17, according to the HHS spokesperson. "This administration's early and decisive action has saved millions of lives," the spokesperson said, adding, "Dr. Fauci testified to this before Congress." #160; However, a review of testimony by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shows he never said millions of lives were saved by #160;the president's action, only that #160;lives were saved. A week after the first case reached his country, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told citizens,  #8220;Fighting this epidemic means fighting the enemy." Government posters proclaimed that  #8220;to stay home is to love your country. #8221; In contrast, three weeks into the lockdowns of Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, Trump sent out tweets, urging their governors to "LIBERATE" all three by lifting the stay-at-home orders. South Korea authorized a diagnostic kit in February and opened drive-through test centers on Feb. 23. The U.S. opened its first public drive-through test facilities more than two weeks #160;later in Seattle and in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle. In the #160;rankings for pandemic readiness cited by Trump, Thailand, South Korea and Vietnam had finished 6th, 9th and 50th, respectively. In the COVID-19 pandemic, all three have experienced far fewer infections and deaths per capita than did the The U.S. accounts for less than 5% of the world #8217;s population, but more than 25% of total COVID-19 cases reported across the globe. Today the U.S. has seven times more people than South Korea, but 300 times more COVID-19 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The U.S. has five times more people than Thailand, but 2,000 times more COVID-19 cases. The U.S. has three and a half times more people than Vietnam, but 6,000 times more COVID-19 cases. * *more in the article*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Evan Onstot OKLAHOMA CITY  #8212; Attack ads in the high-profile race for Oklahoma #8217;s Fifth Congressional District make some big claims. Democrat Kendra Horn stands side-by-side with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one ad claims. Advertisement Republican challenger Stephanie Bice sided with payday lenders, another claims. "Kendra Horn just doesn't get it." It #8217;s a line of attack heard in nearly every ad against incumbent U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn, D-Oklahoma City. "She's voting with Nancy Pelosi nearly 90% of the time." According to ProPublica, that statistic is true. Since Horn took office, she has voted the same as Pelosi 86% of the time. But that #8217;s not a great metric. As speaker, Pelosi rarely votes. In fact, she hasn #8217;t voted more than 91% of the time. Perhaps a better metric is how Horn #8217;s record compares to those of fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives. GovTrack in 2019 ranked Horn the ninth-most conservative member out of 236 House Democrats. There #8217;s no doubt Horn #8217;s voting record is more liberal than Oklahoma #8217;s four Republican representatives. But linking the ninth-most conservative Democrat in the House with one of the most liberal  #8212; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  #8212; as another ad does, is inaccurate. This ad #8217;s rating: misleading. As for Horn #8217;s opponent, "Stephanie Bice voted to let payday lenders charge 200% interest. Outrageous!" an ad claims. The House Majority PAC is targeting Bice, a former Republican state senator who faces Horn on the ballot, for her support of the payday loan industry. Bice voted to allow payday lenders to offer additional high-interest loans of up to $1,500 in 2017. The 200% number is the annual percentage rate of interest. It #8217;s more than 17% per month. Former Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed the bill, saying she believed the loans could be a pricier option for families when other payday loans were already available. "When Stephanie Bice needed money fast, she turned to payday lenders to fund her campaign, #8221; the ad claims. Bice, like many Oklahoma politicians, has accepted campaign contributions from payday lenders and those who lobby on their behalf. We found about $1,000 in contributions the year of the vetoed bill and about $5,000 last year. So the claim is true. However, the claim that Bice turned to the industry when she needed quick money for her campaign is a stretch. Even before winning the GOP primary, Bice had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. The ad gets a rating of half-true.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BY LEONARD PITTS JR.  #8220;Jared Kushner is under federal investigation for diverting money to terrorist organizations according to a guy I met at the gas station who told me he works for the FBI #8221; is something I would never be allowed to publish.  #8220;Donald Trump, Jr. has an escalating cocaine dependency problem according to a woman I ran into at the supermarket who told me she #8217;s his dealer #8221; is another sentence my editor would flag. There is, you see, this thing in the news business called judgment. You may or may not have ever heard of it, though it is supposed to be one of the foundation stones of journalism. Many of us have spent years pretending otherwise. Which is to say, pretending we are not in the business of deciding what is important and what isn #8217;t, what is authoritative and what is not.

    <TEXT>Sorta related article: BY LEONARD PITTS JR.  #8220;Jared Kushner is under federal investigation for diverting money to terrorist organizations according to a guy I met at the gas station who told me he works for the FBI #8221; is something I would never be allowed to publish.  #8220;Donald Trump, Jr. has an escalating cocaine dependency problem according to a woman I ran into at the supermarket who told me she #8217;s his dealer #8221; is another sentence my editor would flag.

    <TEXT>The reckoning The country can #8217;t recover from Trump #8217;s presidency unless he #8217;s held accountable By Sam Tanenhaus OCTOBER 16, 2020 Some Americans entertain a fantasy that goes like this: President Trump is voted out of office, finally faces justice for his serial misconduct and shuffles off to prison. A wearier, probably larger population looks forward to scrubbing the nation #8217;s memory of these past four years and returning to pre-Trump life. A third sizable group shows unwavering loyalty to Trump. Sam Tanenhaus is writing a biography of William F. Buckley Jr. He is a former editor of the New York Times Book Review. One lesson of American history is that the country #8217;s worst injuries are those we #8217;ve caused ourselves. This history is not uplifting, but it is edifying, and it haunts. Failing to perform the necessary diagnostic surgery after a time of collective wrongdoing has costs. The steepest is this: Subsequent generations inherit a weakened democracy. Today it is imperative to confront the facts of the Trump era. We elected as president a homegrown insurrectionist. He rose to the highest position in our democracy and damaged it. Even now, he continues to assault our laws and institutions, our independent judiciary, our national security, our health, and our constitutional system of checks and balances. It #8217;s unimaginable, ludicrous even, to contemplate doing nothing about Donald Trump. [Let history, not partisans, prosecute Trump] No single course for a post-Trump reckoning will satisfy, let alone reconcile, the country #8217;s divergent constituencies. And some damage can #8217;t easily be undone  #8212; harm to America #8217;s standing in the world, for example, and the fatally negligent response to the coronavirus pandemic. But in the search for accountability there are middle-path options that fall between prosecuting this singular president and prosecuting his broader legacy. One is to begin with a problem that Americans across the ideological spectrum agree needs fixing: our elections. Elections are the place to start because so much of Trump #8217;s misconduct relates to them. Special counsel Robert Mueller #8217;s investigation into Russia #8217;s interference in the 2016 election resulted in three dozen indictments or guilty pleas and five prison sentences, all related to Trump campaign actions during that election and afterward, when the president and others tried to cover up what they had done. Trump #8217;s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, have both done time. The Senate Intelligence Committee  #8212; led by Republicans  #8212; produced a nearly 1,000-page report detailing the Trump team #8217;s misdeeds, most pertaining to the 2016 election. Prosecutors in New York, meanwhile, are digging further into Trump #8217;s payment of hush money to a porn star ahead of the vote. And of course, in his impeachment, Trump was charged with misusing his office to try to get help from Ukraine in his reelection campaign  #8212; in violation of election law and of the framers #8217; fear that a president might, in James Madison #8217;s words,  #8220;betray his trust to foreign powers. #8221; Former vice president Joe Biden speaks to reporters before boarding his presidential campaign plane in Erie, Pa., last Saturday. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post) In at least one thing Trump has been proved right. Joe Biden is a strong opponent. If he is elected (increasingly likely), and if Democrats hold on to their majority in the House (it seems probable) and achieve one in the Senate (distinctly possible), they will be in a position to mount the kind of full-scale investigation they have been kept from doing while Trump is president. [A rap sheet for a former president] But will the next administration hold the Trump crew truly accountable for past crimes, such as those uncovered by Mueller, the House impeachment committees and the Senate, to say nothing of the Trump family #8217;s financial dealings? Should it? Yes, some will say, because of Trump #8217;s long trail of malfeasance and mis-governance, which also involves top administration figures such as Attorney General William Barr. But the price of such an inquiry would be considerable. It could rebound against Democrats and undermine public confidence in their fairness and sense of proportion. We are a fiercely divided country. As the historian Garry Wills remarked to me recently, the true crisis of our moment consists  #8220;of Trump showing us not about Trump but about us. #8221; Republicans continue to support Trump as faithfully as any president in modern memory. It is true that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he won 30 states. No matter the result in November, the tribal feelings that now define American politics will not change. They might intensify. This is partly an outgrowth of Trump #8217;s approach to the presidency  #8212; his unapologetic conception of the office as explicitly serving him and those on his side, even as he wages war against those who oppose or even question him. The formula, as Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine, is blunt and direct:  #8220;If Trump #8217;s opponents are doing something, it #8217;s a crime; if Trump and his allies are doing it, it isn #8217;t. #8221; The president #8217;s supporters have a grievance of their own. They can say that Trump #8217;s enemies tried to delegitimize him from the moment he took office. His detractors spoke early and excitedly about impeachment, as though the removal of a president was sport. This was why cooler heads, like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urged caution after Democrats regained a majority in the House. [How a Biden White House can hold Trump accountable by holding itself back] With Ukraine, everything changed. The facts were clear. Trump #8217;s plea to the Ukrainian president that he  #8220;do us a favor #8221; by announcing that he would investigate Biden was a textbook case of abuse of power. It hardly mattered. Republicans mounted a counteroffensive, echoing Trump #8217;s cry of  #8220;witch hunt. #8221; The rest was an elaborate performance in which the only verdict that seemed to matter was public opinion. Yet the most significant poll showed that two-thirds of Americans, regardless of the outcome, would not change their minds. Attacks on Trump, no matter how justified, have dependably aroused his base. There is no reason to think his post-presidency will be different. What #8217;s to stop Citizen Trump from continuing to operate at the margins of the law, but without the cover of the White House and in the knowledge that there would be a reluctance to prosecute a former president? A fresh investigation, broadcast over the  #8220;lying #8221; media, could play right into Trump #8217;s program of self-glorification. And yet, America is not just a political carnival with gladiators in the arena and spectators in the stands. It is also a democratic republic  #8212; a nation of laws, procedures, history and tradition. A good, or rather ghastly, example of history failing to hold its chief actors accountable is the first president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson, in 1868. For many years schoolchildren were taught, with the aid of the book  #8220;Profiles in Courage #8221; by John F. Kennedy, that Johnson #8217;s escape from removal was an act of high statesmanship. Supposedly Sen. Edmund Ross of Kansas, a Republican who went against his party and voted to acquit,  #8220;may well have preserved for ourselves and posterity constitutional government in the United States. #8221; The real villains, in Kennedy #8217;s view (shared by many at the time), were the  #8220;Radical Republicans, #8221; who arrogantly treated the defeated Confederate states as  #8220;conquered provinces #8221; and wanted to  #8220;crush their despised foe #8221; and voted to convict. President Trump departs the White House on Sept. 26 after nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Today the episode is judged very differently. Johnson, most agree, was one of the worst presidents in history and a danger to the republic. Taking office after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, he flagrantly violated the principles of post-Civil War Reconstruction. He sided with  #8220;all-white Southern state governments full of ex-Confederates, stood by when they enacted  #8216;black codes #8217; that oppressed ex-slaves, and took no action when racist mobs began to murder black Southerners, #8221; according to a history in The Washington Post. Johnson #8217;s removal would have sent a powerful message about the nation #8217;s new, post-slavery course; his acquittal instead reinforced pro-Confederate sympathies, which have lingered for generations. [This is not normal] So, too, with the case of the next president to face impeachment, Richard Nixon. He resigned in 1974 when it became clear that he faced removal for his Watergate crimes. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. For years, the thinking was that Ford #8217;s action was statesmanlike, and the nation gratefully heard his soothing assurances that  #8220;our long national nightmare is over. #8221; But the pardon helped plant the seeds of a counter-history of Watergate, promulgated by Nixon and his defenders, that Nixon was not the perpetrator but the victim, hounded by the liberal media, and that the investigations and impeachment were an example of  #8220;the criminalization of politics. #8221; * *more in the article*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>* *article* This summer, the Trump Administration carried out an extraordinary assault on our democracy by attacking peaceful protesters and supporting violence. In June, Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr ordered National Guard and federal police forces to aggressively fire chemical agents at peaceful protesters in order to clear the way for a photo op across the street from the White House. In July, unidentified federal agents #8212;including hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents #8212;roamed the streets of Portland in unmarked cars. They beat, intimidated, and spirited away citizens without cause. Americans were taken into custody, their eyes covered, without any sense of what authority was arresting them. CBP agents used the very powers bestowed on them to guard our borders as a means to instead terrorize American citizens. And in August, in the wake of the horrific shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Trump openly fanned the flames of violence, even going so far as to defend the actions of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old charged with the murder of two individuals and the serious injury of another. A government where lawlessness is ignored and excused is a government where lawlessness is encouraged. With this dangerous escalation in tension, it seems possible #8212;perhaps even likely #8212;that in the short period prior to the November election, employees of the federal government may be ordered to do things that violate the law or the rightful powers of the executive branch. Members of the executive branch, from political appointees to civil servants, take an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States; they are not the employees of Donald Trump, bent to his whim. They work for all of us. It must be made clear now that any official who engages in law breaking will be held accountable by a future administration. President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr #8217;s excuses and rationalizations for illegal behavior should not get in the way of any future prosecution. Individuals who work in the Trump Administration must be treated like anyone else: If they break the law, they must be held to account. This will help ensure that any future administration is discouraged from repeating such outrageous and lawless behavior. But promising to prosecute Trump #8217;s lawlessness is not enough. The last four years have demonstrated that our current laws are not sufficient to ensure an administration free of grift and graft. Trump #8217;s presidency has shone a light on critical structural flaws in the system that have allowed for executive powers to be used and abused with reckless abandon. To have an executive branch that seems more interested in personal gain than serving the public deeply corrodes our democracy. Since Trump became President, his lawlessness, norm breaking, and disregard for the sanctity of the office has touched on all aspects of his presidency. He has refused to provide copies of his tax returns, precluding Americans from knowing of potential conflicts of interest. He has appointed highly unqualified, big money donors to crucial positions. He has held dozens of political events at Trump properties, hosted scores of foreign officials in his hotels and, in October last year, he even went so far as to award a huge government contract to his Doral resort in Miami to host the G7 summit (a move that was quickly rescinded after backlash from all corners of the political arena). For President Trump, conflicts of interest are so ubiquitous they have quite literally become an everyday occurrence. According to the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Trump has over 3,340 conflicts to date. That averages two-and-half conflicts of interest per day since he became President. We cannot afford to have another President so brazenly pursue personal profit and political self-interest over duty. That #8217;s why the first order of business for a Biden Administration and Congress should be to overhaul the anti-corruption requirements for people serving in the Administration. And it starts at the top. The President and vice president should be required to limit personal holdings to assets that do not create any potential conflict of interest, or use a blind trust. The President and vice president should also be required to disclose all appropriate financial dealings, and that includes releasing their tax returns. Since President Nixon, every President #8212;with the exception of President Ford #8212;has released his tax returns. (President Ford instead made public a decade #8217;s worth of summary data on his federal taxes.) In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, Vice President Joe Biden made available all of his tax returns dating back to 1998. It is that commitment to transparency and honesty that we need in the White House. These ideas are not a pipe dream or a long-term goal. They are achievable now. Last year, the House passed the For The People Act, otherwise known as H.R.1. This historic anti-corruption bill is a comprehensive overhaul of our democratic system. It is something voters are desperately calling for. It expands voting rights, limits partisan gerrymandering, and amplifies the voices of small dollar campaign donors instead of wealthy special interests. It also outlines clear and robust ethics requirements for the President and vice president. It would require both individuals to adhere to the ethics rules highlighted above and it would help ensure the removal of any conflicts of interest. If Vice President Biden wins in November, he will have a monumental task on his hands. In the wake of the division and violence stoked by his predecessor, it will require a common vision and a government that people can trust, especially as the country looks to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Restoring public trust will be essential to galvanizing broad support for a progressive agenda that truly solves the challenges this country faces. By passing political reform and ethics reform early on, a President Biden can show that he will be a President that serves not his financial interest, but the people #8217;s interest. And he can end the era of lawlessness that has gripped our country for four long years.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because there is so much to take in while walking through the new exhibit at the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art, one is not likely to notice the changes in the exhibit space #8217;s carpet. Throughout most of this two-story multimedia installation, which chronicles the history of the Holocaust from pre-World War II Europe to the establishment of the state of Israel, the carpet is patterned in varying shades of gray. But once visitors climb the stairs to the exhibit #8217;s upper level, where the exhibit #8217;s focus on the Nazis #8217; systematic extermination of its perceived enemies, including some 6 million European Jews, the carpet is streaked with red  #8212; emblematic of the innocent blood shed as the Nazis went about enacting their  #8220;Final Solution. #8221; It #8217;s just one of the telling details that have gone into the creation of Sherwin Miller Museum #8217;s Sanditen/Kaiser Holocaust Center, which will open to the public Nov. 10. The museum held a press event last week to showcase the new installation, which greatly expanded its original Holocaust exhibit.  #8220;While we wanted to tell as complete a story about the Holocaust as possible, #8221; said Mickel Yantz, the museum #8217;s director of collections and exhibitions,  #8220;we also wanted to make it current, to show that this is not something in the distant past. We wanted to show that the hatred that fueled the Holocaust is still here, still very much alive. #8221; It #8217;s a point the exhibit makes as soon as one enters the gallery. Three mannequins are dressed in what Yantz called  #8220;the evolution of the uniform of hate, #8221; from a white-hooded Ku Klux Klan outfit placed before a photograph of the devastation to Tulsa #8217;s Greenwood District in the 1921 race massacre, to the uniform of a Nazi officer, and ending with the white golf shirt, khaki pants and tiki torch that became emblematic of the Charlottesville  #8220;Unite the Right #8221; neo-Nazi rally in 2017. The exhibit properly begins with a section devoted to everyday life for European Jews in the 1930s, featuring everyday items that might be part of a typical household, from a teddy bear to a prayer shawl to the re-creation of a sitting room.  #8220;Something that often gets lost in this history is the fact that the Nazis were a political party, #8221; Yantz said, indicating a display that traces elections in Germany through the 1920s and  #8216;30s, showing the Nazis #8217; ever-increasing rise to power. This leads to a gallery focusing on how Nazi propaganda became the party #8217;s most effective weapon, whether it was used to demonize its perceived enemies or to encourage enrollment in such organizations as the Hitler Youth.  #8220;The 1936 Olympics, which were held in Berlin, were a part of that propaganda, #8221; Yantz said.  #8220;It was an attempt to pull the wool over the world #8217;s eyes, to show that everything was fine under the Nazi regime. The fact that Jesse Owens ended up being the star of the Olympics did not make Hitler too happy. #8221; Yantz said the museum wanted to give a particular emphasis to how it depicted Kristallnacht, the  #8220;Night of Broken Glass, #8221; when members of the Nazis #8217; paramilitary militias destroyed more than 260 synagogues, along with Jewish-owned businesses, schools and homes.  #8220;As we are an art museum, we wanted to feature work by Oklahoma artists in this exhibit, #8221; Yantz said.  #8220;Tracy and Rick Bewley, artists from Oklahoma City, came up with a concept that perfectly captured what we wanted for this part of the exhibit. #8221; The Bewleys #8217; piece, which hangs in the stairwell of the exhibit space, is made up of more than 250 pieces of colored, fused glass hanging on clear threads to symbolize the stained-glass windows shattered during Kristallnacht. The stairs themselves are put to educational use, as the risers are printed with a timeline tracing the Nazi rise to power. The upper floor deals with the aspect of the Holocaust that is likely most familiar  #8212; the horrors of the concentration camps and the extermination of millions. The exhibit includes a display of the various badges that people considered undesirable by the Nazi regime were forced to wear, from political rivals to criminals, from homosexuals to the homeless.  #8220;One of the hardest things to communicate in an exhibit like this is the sheer number of people, #8221; Yantz said.  #8220;It #8217;s hard to get one #8217;s head around 6 million Jews. That is why we set up an  #8216;infinity box #8217; that contains eyeglasses from the period. The mirrors in the box make it seem as if there are miles of these eyeglasses, to try and give a sense of the scope of this tragedy. #8221; Other exhibits include a re-creation of the sort of barbed-wire fence that surrounded the Auschwitz death camp and a bookcase that can be moved to reveal a photograph of the staircase that led to the  #8220;Secret Annex #8221; where Anne Frank and others tried to hide from the Nazis. The final gallery area covers the end of the war and the liberation of the camps. Reproductions of issues of the Tulsa World extolling the war #8217;s end are part of the display, along with service patches of every U.S. military unit that took part in liberating the camps. The final gallery features examples of the museum #8217;s  #8220;Kinderstone #8221; project, in which young visitors to the museum were given a stone on which was printed the name and age of a child who died in the camps, which the visitors would then decorate to honor that child #8217;s memory. Throughout the exhibit are video scenes playing excerpts from interviews with Tulsa survivors of the Holocaust, including Arno Kahn, Eva Unterman, Harry Guterman, Leah Lapkin and Sherman Ray, sharing their memories of those years. * *more in the article*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A color-coded map of active COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma. See the interactive map below to find the data for your zip code. (Paul Monies/Oklahoma Watch) El Reno, McAlester and Broken Arrow had the biggest ZIP code increases in coronavirus infections in the past week as hospitalizations hit a new record in the state. The total number of Oklahomans infected with the virus since March reached 105,308 on Friday, with the death toll reaching 1,154, said the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Daily hospitalizations, meanwhile, reached their highest point in the pandemic on Thursday at 793, an increase of 27 percent since Oct. 1. The milestone accompanied reports of tight capacity for intensive care unit beds in the Oklahoma City area, largely related to staffing. The Oklahoma Hospital Association said the state faced a shortage of nurses and health care professionals even before the pandemic. That #8217;s been exacerbated as hospitals with infected employees adjust staffing schedules and private agencies have offered lucrative incentives for nurses to temporarily relocate to other areas of the country.  #8220;To effectively manage hospital expenses, hospitals do not routinely staff empty beds on an ongoing basis, #8221; the association said in a fact sheet issued Thursday.  #8220;Capacity is tight at times year-round even without a pandemic. As ICU needs arise, hospitals work to provide staff for more beds. #8221; To free bed space for COVID-19 patients, Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he could issue another executive order stopping hospitals from performing elective surgeries. But health department officials said the localized snapshots of tight ICU capacity don #8217;t reflect the changing nature of hospital staffing throughout the day.  #8220;OSDH is closely monitoring hospital capacity and working with hospitals to ensure they have the resources they need to give the best quality care to all Oklahomans, #8221; said Matt Stacy, a consultant to the agency on hospital issues.  #8220;There are a lot of factors that can influence data on any given day, and we will continue to monitor hospitalizations closely to see if state intervention is required to ensure hospital beds are available to COVID patients who need them. #8221; * *more in the article*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>(KOKH/Connor Hansen) OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH)  #8212; A new lab in Oklahoma City is mailing COVID-19 tests directly to people's homes. Dr. Jesse McCool, CEO of #160; Wheeler Labs, says they were able to get their lab up and running in just about 45 days. He says you can now order a test online and have a result guaranteed in 72 hours. "The idea to help out Oklahoma get back to work really resonated with me," McCool said. McCool has been working in biotech for about 20 years. After seeing COVID testing get a slow start earlier this year, he decided to get involved.  #8220;Something that seemed to be missing was widespread access," McCool said. Sorry, we couldn't load this embedded content View It On Our Full Site Test kits can be ordered directly off the lab's website. There's no supervision needed and no nasal swab, just spitting into a tube and sending it back. It costs $125 but is one of the more accurate PCR tests. McCool hopes to promote more widespread testing.  #8220;Really anybody who might have considered testing, but maybe can #8217;t find a convenient way to get the testing performed," McCool said. "The elderly, people who might be immunocompromised and really not willing to go out to a clinic, to a minute-clinic or just be out and about." Wheeler Labs is also selling the kits to businesses that might want an easy way to test employees. As COVID case numbers and hospitalizations spike in Oklahoma, the lab hopes this will help fight the spread.  #8220;Now, we #8217;re facing a real crisis again in the city and in our state, so we #8217;re here sort of just in time to, I think, lend a hand to help survey and manage the Coronavirus in Oklahoma McCool said.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By Brent Larkin, cleveland.com CLEVELAND -- It takes a special kind of foolish to run for president in a way that alienates as many voters as possible. In 2016, Donald Trump summoned every insult in his arsenal to defeat a deeply disliked Hillary Clinton, a woman who also happened to be immeasurably more talented and qualified. Four years later, the tiny man who inhabits Donald Trump #8217;s world seems to believe that running the same way against former Vice President Joe Biden will produce the same result. It #8217;s a strategy so incredibly inane it brings to mind one of the late Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes' classic comments. In 1968, Rhodes said watching Michigan Gov. George Romney run for president was  #8220;like watching a duck try to make love to a football. #8221; Now the duck is back, quacking louder than ever, dialing up chaos and craziness with words and behavior that shatter any remaining pretense Trump is the least bit normal. Down big in the polls nationally, common sense argues for Trump to spend the next two weeks frantically trying to expand his historically small base. Instead, he has reverted to demonstrably false attacks, bizarre conspiracy theories and rallies with no social distancing and few masks, which only remind voters of his utter disregard for their health and safety. In recent days, President Trump has railed against the two biggest sycophants in his cabinet, suggesting that Attorney General Bill Barr #8217;s job is at risk for not indicting Trump #8217;s political enemies, and ripping Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for not yet finding and releasing Hillary Clinton #8217;s emails. He has retweeted a false conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama and Biden might have had a Navy Seal team murdered. And Trump has suggested he may have been infected with the coronavirus by Gold Star families, called Sen. Kamala Harris a  #8220;monster #8221; and retweeted a doctored photo of Biden in a wheelchair. There are hundreds of reasons why President Trump should be denied a second term. In the interest of brevity, I believe that number can be reduced to two. First, a significant majority of Americans have figured out there is something horribly wrong with him. Second, faced with the nation #8217;s greatest health crisis in more than a century, Trump not only failed to protect the country, he couldn #8217;t even protect himself and those who work for him. Truth is, he barely even tried. The president #8217;s COVID-19 failures have been widely reported. No reason to regurgitate them here. On issues relating to the legitimacy of Trump #8217;s Republican credentials and his fitness for office, I #8217;ve long believed members of the conservative intelligentsia have the most credibility. After Trump was diagnosed with the coronavirus, David Frum, speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, wrote in the Atlantic on Oct. 2,  #8220;Trump should never have been allowed anywhere near any public office. Wish him well, but recognize that his deformed spirit will never be well  #8211; and that nothing can be well for the country under his leadership. #8221; A day after Trump #8217;s Sept. 29 debate with Biden in Cleveland, George F. Will wrote in The Washington Post,  #8220;A plurality of Americans have concluded that Trump has much to feel inferior about, and Tuesday probably changed neither this nor the nation #8217;s dread about its accelerating decay. #8221; Writing about Trump #8217;s  #8220;savagery #8221; in The New York Times on Oct. 1, David Brooks promised,  #8220;What Trump did to that debate Tuesday night is what he #8217;ll do to America in a second term. #8221; Then, in three sentences, Brooks obliterated arguments made by those who argue Trump #8217;s policies and so-called accomplishments make it worth tolerating the lies, malice, corruption and incompetence.  #8220;Some Republicans see Trump #8217;s immorality as a sideshow they will tolerate to secure other goods. But his immorality is voracious, a widening gyre that threatens the basic stability of civic life. If he undermines the election, and his Republican enablers let him, he #8217;ll approach what comes next with appalling ferocity. #8221; In Ohio, those enablers are many -- namely, the entire Republican political establishment. And as Nov. 3 nears, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has emerged as one of the most culpable. LaRose has refused to expand the number of secure ballot drop boxes  #8211; even after one of the nation #8217;s most respected federal judges, U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, enjoined that decision, ruling that LaRose had failed to present evidence that he lacked the authority to place those boxes in places other than boards of elections. Reporting by the nonprofit journalism watchdog ProPublica has linked a top LaRose staff member to a Trump supporter peddling widely discredited theories of widespread fraud in mail voting. When it comes to political independence, LaRose talks a good game. But fear of angering the Trump base consistently causes Republican officeholders to behave in ways contrary to what #8217;s best for Ohioans. At a time that demands a sense of moral urgency aimed at providing Ohioans with as many risk-free voting options as possible without compromising security, LaRose has failed them. LaRose and many of Trump #8217;s other Ohio enablers won #8217;t have to face voters until 2022. Trump doesn #8217;t enjoy that luxury. If every qualified American who wants to vote is allowed to vote, Trump cannot win. He probably can #8217;t even keep it close. Trump surely knows that. The enablers absolutely know it. Less certain is how far this desperate man might go to keep his job. We #8217;re about to find out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>OPINION Mark P. Painter Donald Trump is not a racist. Neither is he a Fascist. Sure, he shows many of the same traits  #8211; and people are free to use those as evidence of racism or Fascism. But deep down, he is neither, because deep down he is shallow. #160; Trump is not a Republican. Nor is he a Democrat. Yes, he claims to be a Republican, but he has repudiated the Republican principles I grew up with  #8211; balanced budgets, free trade, fiscal responsibility, civil rights, fair dealing, honesty. He was a Democrat when he toyed with running for president the first time, and was for abortion at any stage, among other very "liberal" #160;positions. He was also a member of businessman and 1992 presidential candidate Ross Perot #8217;s "Reform Party" for a while. Trump is, if anything, a confirmed member of the Opportunist party. Trump is not a businessman, though he played one on TV. At least, he is not a good businessperson. #160;He could have just taken the huge fortune his father left him, put it in the S amp;P 500, and now have more than what he claims to have now. Yes, even without declaring numerous bankruptcies, cheating contractors #160;and other shenanigans (polite word for crimes), he could have tucked his money away, gone to a tropic island, and be richer than he is. Trump is not rich because he #8217;s smart; he is rich because he started rich. He still has some money because he hasn #8217;t lost it all  #8211; although the revelations of his taxes just coming out cast doubt that he has much of anything but debts. The one time he ran a public company (Trump Hotels  amp; Casio Resorts, ticket symbol: DJT) Trump was paid at least $39 million in salary and other questionable compensation. The company, of course, went bankrupt. Stockholders lost 90% of their investment. He #8217;s run the country as he ran his business. #160;Massive deficits (not even counting the pandemic additions), alienating allies, and managing the entire government as one big criminal-grifting enterprise. We should have known. We knew about Trump "University" #160;that cheated students. We knew about the Trump foundation, which used other people #8217;s charitable contributions to pay personal debts. We knew he won #8217;t show his taxes, because that will hasten his path to prison. Donald Trump is not immoral  #8211; in his own mind. He does many things that #160;many other people would consider immoral. Even leaving out the multitude of wrongs toward women and wives, some people consider lying, cheating people, and stealing money from charity, just to mention a few, to be immoral. But Trump is amoral. #160; Trump #8217;s amorality explains all the above. He has no principles, no party, no ideology. #160; Everything exists only in relation to him. Cheating and lying is just what he does and has always done. When Trump pardons Roger Stone, it #8217;s because it is good for Trump  #8211; keep those #160;who know his #160;secrets quiet. When he fires inspectors general (I #8217;ve lost count how many), it #8217;s to keep them from investigating his and his minions #8217; machinations. When Trump talks about "Law and Order," #160;it is simply a dog whistle to folks in the suburbs and places like Gallia County to be afraid that Blacks, or immigrants, or Martians are going to murder them in their beds, and only Trump will keep them safe. Just as Nixon did. That almost all protests are against violence means nothing, because Trump #8217;s people show the very few violent incidents over and over. He acts like a racist because he believes it will help him get votes. He would be the opposite if he thought it helped him. And together with his now attorney general, he is actually destroying the rule of law. #160; William Barr #8217;s job is to put a tuxedo on despotism and kleptomania. Trump has no conscience, no moral compass. All actions and decisions are weighed by the standard "What #8217;s good for me?" That #8217;s the genesis of calling soldiers who died or were captured "losers." Trump simply could not understand someone who would risk life and limb for our country  #8211; the greater good doesn #8217;t even occur to him. The coronavirus issue confirms all this. Even after Trump himself is infected, as a result of his cavalier and dangerous handling of the pandemic, he takes off his mask. He takes a joy ride in a closed car. He risks others #8217; lives on a whim. We have all known people like this. Most people weigh what will benefit them against other considerations. But we have not known many who are purely amoral. #160;Most people believe there is a right and wrong, at least sometimes. Not Trump. As his sister, retired federal judge Marianne Trump Barry has said, "He has no principles. None. None." The best definition of amoral is "unaware of or indifferent to questions of right or wrong." #160; Trump has never known this difference; or he doesn #8217;t think it matters. A lie is the same as the truth. It becomes the truth if it benefits Trump. After telling a lie, he probably believes it himself  #8211; unless he would benefit from telling another lie. #160;And his lies can be effective. #160;The Economist newspaper interviewed voters in Youngstown who believed Trump had reduced the debt and fixed health care! So, if we vote for four more years of this unreality show, we are agreeing to the daily deluge of lies, obfuscations, irresponsibility, incompetence, and outright criminality that has hallmarked this administration. Trump just doesn #8217;t know any better. #160;Or care.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Demonstrators gather in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody. JOHN MINCHILLO AP This year #8217;s racial-justice protests have captured the attention of the exiled Cuban community in Los Angeles and other parts of the country  #8212; and especially that of a former Castro #8217;s Cuba child like me. Perhaps nothing has rattled me more than watching the violence against fellow citizens and local businesses burned or looted on television. My life experience compels me to warn today #8217;s young protesters to be critical of furious mobs that seek to derail what might otherwise become a fount of political transformation: their youth. I left Cuba in 1981, a 9-year-old refugee whose only experience with sheltering in place and protesting came from the numerous repudiation rallies in front of our home during the 1980 Mariel Boatlift. The rallies broke like a fever all over the island, indicting innocent and guilty alike. We feared for our lives, barricaded the doors and nailed our windows shut. There was no distinction between criminals and upstanding citizens, no gray area in which to take refuge. There was only  #8220;them #8221; and  #8220;us. #8221; What may otherwise have led to dialogue and political transformation turned into divisiveness and chaos. Since the protests that began after the brutal killing of George Floyd, my family and I have watched from afar, with a certain amount of pride for a country that believes in its citizens #8217; right to dissent and raise their voices against injustices. But also with great fear  #8212; after all, we are all-too-familiar with sprawling anger and frustration that embroils everything in its path, losing sight of its original destination. When a mob marched on our house in April 1980, demanding we leave our beloved island, all we could do was find a way to do so. Fear is powerful, and paralyzing. The dangers that speaking out posed for us then were far greater than those that might await for us in exile. As we watch this year #8217;s social-justice protests from afar  #8212; we know we #8217;ve been there before. I know that was decades ago, in a place a few people have ever been, but as foreign and recalcitrant Castro #8217;s Cuba may seem, no nation is immune to violence, or censorship, or repression. No nation is immune to human-rights violations and social injustices so profoundly painful we can #8217;t bear to breath. In contrast to the mob that marched against my house in the spring of 1980, young people today have the potential to find their most pressing expression of discontent at the intersection of age (youth), gender (in flux) and race (ever more diverse). For it is not any youth who takes action against a nation they feel has betrayed them, but young Americans who bear the responsibility to become true agents of change, ultimately giving political significance to the sentimental, romantic notion of unruly youths. Become the voice of the one and the many, and lead us into political action. My family and I were victims of a system that silenced us. My parents were not part of the privileged class, nor were they radical opponents of the 1959 Cuban Revolution. We held no official titles, owned no palace in Havana. We lived in a small town, with intermittent electricity and little water or food. We were not national leaders who defected or student body presidents who suddenly turned right. But our very desire for opportunity and dreaming was enough to get us accused of ideological misconduct and civil disobedience. Thinking for ourselves was a crime against the state. For this  #8212; and at great personal risk and with no small sacrifice  #8212; we had no choice but to leave Cuba. We have lived in Los Angeles since 1984 and, in all these years, I never felt a need to speak as I do now. Young people, who stand in that interstitial space between childhood and adulthood, and as a special group of humanity, have the potential to reveal the deeper truths many of us no longer remember. Straddling maturity and the generative power of a child #8217;s imagination, their finer aesthetic and profound awareness of what is just in this world should guide them. Not violence, not chaos. They should be angry  #8212; we all should. But they must let that anger turn into a dynamic, potent and critical perspective. They are more than a social construction and the consequence of cultural trends. They are young and in absolute possession of that magical state called transformation  #8212; a true political machine. I would advise them to go to work, write letters, join a local caucus, continue to protest peacefully and realize that they have a power many places in the world do not have: the power of their votes. Use it. -Susannah Rodriguez</TEXT>

    <TEXT>*article*- Congress is past the point at which it can deliver more coronavirus relief before the election, with differences between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, her Senate Republican rivals and President Donald Trump proving insurmountable despite the glaring needs of the country. Trump #8217;s GOP allies are reconvening the Senate this week to vote on a virus proposal, but it #8217;s a bill that failed once before, and that Trump himself now derides as too puny. The debate promises to bring a hefty dose of posturing and political gamesmanship, but little more. Even the architect of the Senate measure, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., isn #8217;t claiming the vote will advance the ball. Once the measure fails, he plans to turn the chamber #8217;s full attention to cementing a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court by confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett. It is likely to be the Senate #8217;s final act before Election Day. In that context, this week #8217;s vote has the chief benefit of giving Republicans in tough reelection races one last opportunity to try to show voters they are prioritizing COVID relief  #8212; and to make the case to voters that Democrats are the ones standing in the way.  #8220;It was important to indicate to the American people before the election  #8212; not after  #8212; that we were not in favor of a stalemate, that we were not in favor of doing nothing, #8221; McConnell said in a Kentucky appearance last week. McConnell is resurrecting a measure in the $650 billion range that would repurpose $138 billion in small business subsidies to provide a second round of paycheck relief, add $300 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits, and help schools and universities reopen. The last version of the bill left out help for states and local governments sought by Democrats and another round of $1,200 direct payments demanded by Trump. The last coronavirus relief package, the $1.8 trillion bipartisan CARES Act, passed in March by an overwhelming margin as the economy went into lockdown amid fear and uncertainty about the virus. Since then, Trump and many of his GOP allies have focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help. Trump has been anything but consistent. He now insists that lawmakers should  #8220;go big #8221; with a bill of up to perhaps $2 trillion, a total reversal after abandoning the talks earlier this month. But Trump #8217;s political problems aren #8217;t swaying Senate Republicans.  #8220;He #8217;s talking about a much larger amount than I can sell to my members, #8221; McConnell said. RELATED CONTENT WH stimulus offer: Pelosi says Trump  #8216;wants more money at his discretion, #8217; while Senate GOP thinks it #8217;s too expensive 2nd stimulus checks: WH ups offer in virus aid before talks with Pelosi; McConnell says package  #8216;unlikely #8217; before election The most recent bill from House Democrats weighs in at $2.4 trillion  #8212; or more than $2.6 trillion when excluding a $246 billion tax increase on businesses that #8217;s unlikely to gain GOP acceptance. The package is a nonstarter with Senate Republicans and McConnell, who is making the case for a more targeted approach that #8217;s well south of $1 trillion. The moment is challenging for Pelosi as well. For months she has been promising a COVID relief package of more than $2 trillion stuffed with Obama-era stimulus ideas. Even though the Senate and White House are both in GOP hands  #8212; and will be at least into January  #8212; she has sharply rebuffed anyone who suggests that Democrats should take a smaller deal now rather than risk going home empty-handed until next year.  #8220;This is not the time to say,  #8216;Okay, let #8217;s fold. #8217; This is what we have been building up to, #8221; Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a recent teleconference. She said Sunday that she remains optimistic of reaching an agreement with the administration but that a deal would have to come within 48 hours  #8212; or Tuesday  #8212; for it to be enacted by Election Day. Taking a smaller bill now would likely require Pelosi to give up tax cuts for the working poor and accept a far smaller aid package for states and local governments. But it would also mean that relief would flow immediately to millions of workers whose supplemental unemployment benefits were cut off this summer. Liberal economist Jared Bernstein, who worked for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in 2009 and advises him now, says inaction would mean  #8220;a lot of completely avoidable suffering for economically vulnerable people. #8221; When an aid bill finally passes may depend on the outcome of the election. If Trump loses, Congress is likely to stagger through a nonproductive lame-duck session comparable to the abbreviated session after the decisive 2008 Obama-Biden victory or the 2016 session that punted most of its leftovers to the Trump administration. That scenario would push virus aid into 2021. Delays in coronavirus aid come as the recovery from this spring #8217;s economic shutdown is slowing and as the massive stimulus effects of the $1.8 trillion March relief measure wear off. COVID cases are spiking again heading into a third wave of the pandemic this winter. Poverty is climbing and the virus is continuing to take a disproportionate toll on minority communities.  #8220;If Congress doesn #8217;t act the next administration is going to inherit a real mess, #8221; said Harvard economist Jason Furman, a former top Obama adviser.  #8220;Economic problems tend to feed on themselves. #8221; He is in the Democratic camp that prefers imperfect stimulus now rather than a larger package in four months or so. Instead, if history repeats, COVID relief is likely to be the first major item out of the gate next year, but it #8217;s not clear even then that it #8217;ll be as big as Democrats hope.  #8220;Pelosi decided in July that the political benefit of the next package would accrue to the president #8217;s benefit and therefore she was going to lay out the most aggressive terms possible, #8221; said veteran GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, who predicts that Pelosi won #8217;t get much more next year than she could have gotten now  #8220;unless they #8217;re willing to break the filibuster for a $3 trillion bailout for blue states. #8221;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>By: Clayton Cummins A local nonprofit says they #8217;re hoping they #8217;ll be able to purchase a former downtown hotel to house the area #8217;s homeless veterans. #160; Homeless Military Veterans of Oklahoma City began talks with the current owner of the former Holiday Inn hotel located near the intersection of Main and Dewey streets this week. #160; #160;  #8220;It is very heartbreaking to see the men and women that risk their life for our freedom come home to nothing, #8221; said Kelly Hall, President of Homeless Military Veterans.  #8220;Right now, I have two rental houses that we have been paying out of pocket to help the veterans get off the street, so far without aide. #8221; #160; The 10-story hotel was built in the 1970s and is over 104,000 square feet. #160; For Hall, housing area veterans without a place to call home is a personal fight. His father was once a homeless veteran. #160; #160;  #8220;Seeing the community and everything with them actually being homeless veterans as well, was really heartbreaking, #8221; said Hall.  #8220;It seemed like someone needed to do it. #8221; #160; Hall said he first tried to occupy the building in 2018. He said he #8217;s waited years for the opportunity to purchase a building. #160;  #8220;I really don #8217;t think there is a word to describe it, It would be like winning the lottery, #8221; said Hall.  #8220;It #8217;s been me and my mom basically doing it ourselves the past couple of years, my brother stepped in and helped my stepdad. #8221; #160; A grassroots movement hoping to create a brighter future for the men and women who #8217;ve given so much. #160; #160;  #8220;Veterans are a pretty big deal in Oklahoma City, they don #8217;t have anywhere to go after they get their treatment, #8221; said Hall. #160; #160; If this nonprofit does get the building, they will ask for volunteers and donations of supplies. #160; #160; Right now, the nonprofit is accepting monetary donations on their website or you can text 405-300-1819 to donate. #160; #160;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>- ByJonathan Backer Earlier this month, federal and state authorities charged 13 members of a private militia with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. #160; According to the federal criminal complaint, they laid the groundwork for their scheme in Cambria, Wis., where they conducted firearms training, combat drills, and attempted to create an improvised explosive device. #160; Had the group #8217;s scheme succeeded, they planned on taking Whitmer to Wisconsin for a show trial. The Whitmer plot follows quickly on the heels of militia activity in Kenosha in the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting. #160; When protesters took to the streets, various private militias coordinated plans on social media to descend upon downtown Kenosha for the ostensible purpose of  #8220;protecting #8221; persons and property. #160; Predictably, the evening ended in tragedy, as one member of the militia milieu, Kyle Rittenhouse, opened fire on protesters, killing two and injuring another. These two episodes were not fated to happen. #160;Legal tools exist that could have prevented these private militias from endangering Wisconsin residents. #160;Private militias are illegal in all 50 states. Forty-eight state constitutions, including Wisconsin #8217;s, explicitly outlaw private militia groups by requiring that all military forces in the state be in  #8220;strict subordination #8221; to civil authority. #160; These constitutional provisions reflect the commonsense principle that private and unaccountable groups do not get to decide for themselves when to use or project the ability to use force. #160; RELATED:Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping conspiracy wasn't the first anti-government plot with Wisconsin ties Indeed, strict subordination clauses buttress each state #8217;s finely reticulated framework governing military forces. #160; In Wisconsin, for example, the state constitution provides that the governor is the commander in chief of the state #8217;s militia (i.e., its military forces). #160; As such, only the governor or his designee is authorized to call the state #8217;s militia into active service. #160; The Legislature is the entity authorized to determine the composition of the state #8217;s militia and to provide for its organization and discipline. #160;These legal provisions would be superfluous if private militias could self-activate, answering to no one but themselves. Because Wisconsin #8217;s strict subordination clause confirms that the state #8217;s militia is the only game in town when it comes to organized military force, it can be a powerful tool to neutralize the threat of private militias. #160; In 2017, heavily armed militias and alt-right organizations terrorized the residents of Charlottesville, Va., during the  #8220;Unite the Right #8221; rally where one counter-protester was killed and 19 others injured. #160;The City of Charlottesville responded to this tragedy by filing suit against the rally organizers, relying in part on Virginia #8217;s strict subordination clause. After a state court confirmed the viability of the plaintiffs #8217; legal theories, each of the defendants entered consent decrees barring them from returning to Charlottesville to engage in paramilitary activity. #160; A similar lawsuit currently is pending in Albuquerque, N.M., where District Attorney Ra #250;l Torrez is using his civil authority to enforce his state #8217;s strict subordination clause against a militia that interposed itself between protesters and counter-protesters at a demonstration this past June where an individual opened fire and injured a protester. In addition to strict subordination clauses, 29 states have criminalized private military units. In Minnesota, for example, it is a misdemeanor for individuals to  #8220;associate themselves together as a military company with arms. #8221; #160; Twenty-five #160;states criminalize paramilitary activity. #160;For example, it is a felony in Michigan to teach, demonstrate, or assemble to receive training concerning  #8220;the use, application, or construction of any firearm, or any explosive or incendiary device #8221; for use in civil disorder. Although private militias attempt to argue otherwise, their conduct is not protected by the Second Amendment. #160;As my colleague Mary McCord recently wrote, the Constitution #8217;s framers adopted the Second Amendment to address concerns that a standing army could lead to tyrannical rule. #160;As an alternative, the amendment provided for the arming of citizens so that they could serve as part of a  #8220;well regulated Militia #8221; subordinate to civil authority. #160;State constitutional and statutory schemes prohibiting private militias and paramilitary activity are therefore completely consonant with the Second Amendment. #160;The Supreme Court said as much in the 1886 decision Presser v. Illinois, which upheld Illinois #8217; antiparamilitary laws. #160;Such laws, the Court held,  #8220;do not infringe the right of the people to keep and bear arms. #8221; #160;The Court reaffirmed Presser in its 2008 decision District of Columbia v. Heller, which held that although the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms for self-defense, it  #8220;does not prevent the prohibition of private paramilitary organizations. #8221; In addition to prohibitions on private militias and paramilitary activity, other laws criminalize the unauthorized exercise of law enforcement authority  #8212; conduct in which private militias often engage. #160;For example, it is a felony in Wisconsin for a private individual to falsely assume the duties of a public officer. #160;Under that statute, the militia members purporting to be  #8220;protecting #8221; property against looting in Kenosha this past August could have been arrested for usurping law enforcement #8217;s role before blood filled the city #8217;s streets. And as concerns grow concerning the possibility that private militias might deploy to polling places on Election Day, law enforcement should take note that voter intimidation is a felony in Wisconsin. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has made clear his intention to enforce Pennsylvania #8217;s voter-intimidation laws should private militias interfere with the electoral process. #160;Wisconsin should follow his lead. With the numerous tools available to rein in private militias, the recent uptick in militia activity in Wisconsin is not destiny  #8212; it is a choice. #160;During the 1970s and 80s when an anti-government militia, Posse Comitatus, gained a foothold in central Wisconsin, local law enforcement cracked down on the group and put it out of business. #160;Wisconsin #8217;s leaders have the same ability to take decisive action against private militias endangering the state #8217;s residents today. The only question is: Will they? Jonathan Backer is an attorney at Georgetown Law #8217;s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a native of Kenosha.</TEXT>
