    <TEXT>FHD looks great on 24-inch 4K monitor (e.g. [Dell P2415Q](http://tanalin.com/en/blog/2015/05/dell-p2415q-review/)) when scaled with no blur  #8212; with each image pixel displayed as a group of 2 #215;2 identical physical pixels. Image pixel is so small in this case that it #8217;s almost indistinguishable, so blur just _decreases sharpness_ while not adding any useful  #8220;smoothing #8221;.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point of nonblurry integer-ratio scaling by pixel duplication is that it #8217;s _lossless_ and makes sense _exactly_ (and in fact _only_) at integer ratios. So the requested mode should basically just substitute the existing  #8220;Centered #8221; mode with filling the rest screen space with black. The result is technically the same as using nearest-neighbour interpolation as long as the physical resolution is a multiple of signal resolution, but the concept is not the same.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sounds interesting. Is it going to support simple nearest-neighbour interpolation? What #8217;s its compatibility with games? E.g. GeDoSaTo works with _some_ DX9 games, but doesn #8217;t work with other (including modern) games, so it #8217;s more a limited workaround than an ultimate solution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope. While a single logical pixel is _almost_ indistinguishable in full-screen games at Full HD _logical_ resolution and 4K _physical_ resolution, higher pixel density still makes true 4K much more _sharp and clear_ than Full HD. That #8217;s even more important for _text_ where atomic elements (characters and lines they consist of) are _much smaller_ than typical elements in games, and text on a 4K monitor is much more smooth and clear than on a Full HD one. Needless to say, when playing a game, we can move away from monitor while when working with text, we can sit closer. Also, the _extremely_ important factor at least for me is [crystal inversion](http://www.techmind.org/lcd/#inversion) that causes horrible flickering which is _much less_ noticeable on a 4K monitor compared with a monitor with physical Full HD resolution (just because of this, I would even buy a 4K monitor if the maximum available resolution was [properly scaled] Full HD). Finally, there is such thing as interpixel grid which is annoyingly noticeable on Full HD monitors while absolutely unnoticeable on 4K monitors of the same size.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The ability to switch to _nearest-neighbour_ scaling is already available in nVidia driver for Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD since version [384.47](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1016125) (2017-06-29). Unfortunately, the feature is [unusable](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1019141) in many _games_ that incorrectly interpret data received from RandR and are blurrily upscaled and then _cropped_ instead of being properly upscaled using nearest-neighbour interpolation. Such problematic games are e.g. [Limbo](http://playdead.com/games/limbo/), [Syder Arcade](https://www.syderarcade.com/), [Trine Enchanted Edition](http://www.frozenbyte.com/games/trine-enchanted-edition).

    <TEXT>Unlike lower resolutions or bigger monitors, with FHD on 24" 4K monitor image pixels are *small enough* to be almost *indistinguishable* at least as long as the image is antialiased. With 4K resolution on 8K monitors, this will be even more true even without AA. With HD and lower resolutions on 24" 4K monitor, image pixels are big enough to be visible indeed, but there are also pixel-art games and their fans who like the pixelated nature of pixel-art. Finally, that #8217;s a false dichotomy in the first place: whether to blur during scaling should be an *option*, so that nonblurry scaling could be used by those who understand what it is and really want to use it, while those who like blurry image or don #8217;t understand what is the point could continue using the current scaling algorithm. It #8217;s about freedom of choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Lossless in-game music** I would LOVE to see a  #8220;Red Alert #8221; remake with high-quality stereo music (preferably LOSSLESS). The original game had low-quality (mono, 22 KHz, ADPCM) music.  #8203; **Complete lossless soundtrack with  #8220;Face the Enemy 1 #8221;** Also, would love to finally be able to purchase COMPLETE  #8220;Red Alert #8221; soundtrack in a LOSSLESS format such as FLAC. The original soundtrack Audio-CD lacked several tracks included in the game. Namely, I #8217;m INCREDIBLY interested in the  #8220;Face the Enemy 1 #8221; track. For me,  #8220;Face the Enemy 1 #8221; is the best musical track in the game (of course besides "Hell March" that had its own charm). The soundtrack Audio CD did contain  #8220;Face the Enemy 2 #8221; (not 1) listed as just "Face the Enemy" with no number. The  #8220;Face the Enemy 1 #8221; track is available on the Frank Klepacki #8217;s site in the  #8220;Listen #8221; section and ironically listed as  #8220;Face the Enemy 2 #8221;, here is its direct URL for clarity (unfortunately it is in the lossy MP3 format with a low bitrate of just 128 Kbps, so it is far from lossless quality): [https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.podsnack.net/playlists/tracks/30686fe812e0ef68d7b24b3i19052643](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.podsnack.net/playlists/tracks/30686fe812e0ef68d7b24b3i19052643)  #8203; **High-resolution 2D graphics and 16:9 support** Higher-resolution graphics and 16:9 aspect-ratio support in the remake would be nice too. Preferably 4K-ready, but still based on sprites, just rerendered with higher pixel density. After remaking  #8220;Red Alert #8221;, remakes of other 2D-based C amp;C classic games, such as  #8220;Tiberian Dawn #8221; and  #8220;Tiberian Sun #8221; would be nice too. Thanks.</TEXT>

Also, some of TVs advertised as 4K are not true 4K in terms of color reproduction due to using PenTile-like [RGBW](https://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/rgbw-201510084189.htm) pixel pattern with white subpixel shared between adjacent pixels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; if its something they could make a toggle... Sure, nonblurry scaling should be _optional_ so that everyone could be happy in every use case. Though user-interface-wise, an explicit option exactly for blur would probably be unneeded if nonblurry scaling was implemented as a natural _replacement_ for the existing  #8220;Center #8221; scaling mode. The  #8220;Center #8221; mode as is would probably get [unneeded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/55hb0u/lets_get_integer_nearest_neighbor_gpu_scaling/) once we have nonblurry scaling implemented because the current  #8220;Center #8221; mode is basically exactly what nonblurry scaling is, just with the ratio forced to be 1x (100%). For example, someone would unlikely want to have 640 #215;480 centered on the 3840 #215;2160 screen (with **96%** of the screen filled with black) if they could get _exactly_ the same image, but 4x larger  #8212; with each pixel represented as a square group of 4 #215;4 physical same-color pixels. So  #8220;Preserve aspect ratio #8221; would provide blurry image as currently, while  #8220;Center #8221; would enable nonblurry scaling  #8212; with integer-ratio scaling transparently applied to fill the screen as fully as possible with minimal black margins. Fwiw, Windows 10 uses nonblurry scaling for non-DPI-aware applications at integer ratios (e.g. 2x = 200%) with no option to enable blur.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Does it mean that Firefox can't possibly have better conventional scaling? This means that I clearly understand what I want and am talking about. Browsers themselves are irrelevant here.  gt; You'll get better results with a higher rendering resolution Sure, as long as the game uses vectorial graphics, GPU performance is enough **and** the game #8217;s UI elements don #8217;t get proportionally smaller like in Cities XL Platinum. This is **not** just about performance. You can read about this and other important points in detail in the  #8220;[Powerful GPU is not a solution](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/#h-performance) #8221; section of my article.  gt; Many modern games already have resolution scale sliders Which I intentionally never use exactly because scaling with fractional ratios (and currently with any ratio) results in blur. Sharpening is **not** an acceptable solution for me. My monitor has a sharpness setting, but I never use it. And even if I wanted to use sharpening, I would prefer to apply it to uncorrupted image instead of artificially-blurry mess. Just [compare](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/reddit/nonblurry-vs-sharpened.png) the clean image upscaled nonblurrily by pixel duplication with the image upscaled using blurry bilinear interpolation and then sharpened.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; it's definitely more flexible than a fixed resolution - 1080p. Integer-ratio upscaling is **not** just about scaling FHD to 4K. **Any** resolution could be upscaled on **any** monitor as long as logical (signal) resolution fits entirely in physical resolution with a ratio of 2 or greater. For example, a 640 #215;480 image could be displayed on a 1920 #215;1080 screen with a ratio of 2 and horizontal black margins of 320+320 pixels and vertical margins of 60+60 pixels.  gt; windowed, borderless, fullscreen, VSR, games changing resolution Looks like you have a lack of basic technical knowledge regarding the topic you are talking about. Scaler knows (and should know) **nothing** about high-level software abstractions like windows  #8212; regardless whether regular or borderless (a borderless window is a window too, just with no border). Scaler gets entire drawn screen as a **monolithic** image, scales it, and returns the scaled result as a new monolithic image. In case of DSR/VSR, the rendered image #8217;s resolution is larger than physical monitor #8217;s resolution, so scaler **down**scales the drawn image, which is the opposite to **up**scaling. For upscaling lower-than-physical resolutions, the nonblurry-scaling algorithm is [trivial](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/#h-algorithm).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; it's blurry after TAA anyway, even without resolution scaling. There is no such thing as  #8220;just blur #8221; as an opposite to absence of blur. Blur may be _less_ strong or _more_ strong. For example, blur added by nVidia-driver scaler is noticeably stronger than blur added by P2415Q monitor #8217;s scaler. If we have _two_ sources of image-quality decrease, their _total_ impact is _higher_ than impact of each of them _separately_. And while temporal antialiasing has a concrete useful purpose, using bilinear interpolation for integer-ratio upscaling just _unreasonably_ makes image worse than without its _extra_ blur. And actually antialiasing is even not blur. TAA _resembles_ blur, but strictly speaking it #8217;s not  #8212; Afaik, TAA basically works by mixing adjacent frames.  gt; So the only way out is sharpening. I #8217;m fine with TAA as is. In conjunction with nonblurry upscaling by pixel duplication. ;-)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sure, if user has enough horse power, it is possible to switch to a higher resolution like QHD instead of FHD and get somewhat better detail. Using a resolution which is just _slightly_ higher (e.g. 2000 #215;1125 instead of 1920 #215;1080) would probably not make much sense, only a considerably higher resolution would make real quality difference. But if the user wants to use exactly FHD (or a lower one) on a 4K monitor, they should be free to do this with no unreasonable quality loss. FHD on 4K monitor should not look worse than on FHD monitor. Pixel-art should not become blurry mess. Games like Cities XL Platinum should be playable.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Free IntegerScaler app for blur-free upscaling of windowed games</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-01-09 01:34:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**IntegerScaler**](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/) is a free Windows 7+ utility for upscaling games with an integer ratio and with _no blur_. Such scaling is known as _integer (integral) scaling_ and _pixel doubling_. The app is compatible with _all_ games that support _windowed_ mode. ## FHD #8594;4K scaling This allows playing games e. #8201;g. at Full-HD (1920 #215;1080) resolution on 4K (3840 #215;2160) monitors with no quality loss, unlike ever-blurry bilinear full-screen scaling used by displays and graphics drivers. ## Old and pixel-art games Scaling with no blur may also be useful for old games and pixel-art games. See e. #8201;g. a [screenshot](http://tanalin.com/_x/reddit/integer-scaler/simcity-2000/) (172 KB) showing the SymCity 2000 game (1993) (640 #215;480 native resolution) upscaled with IntegerScaler to 4K resolution. ## Advantages Compared with Windows Magnifier, IntegerScaler _automatically_ precisely positions the area to scale and fills with _black_ the rest screen space around the scaled window. Unlike the previously announced commercial Windows #160;8+ app, IntegerScaler is free and supports Windows #160;7+. ## How to use Just press `Alt+F11` while the game window is active. For games that suppress third-party keyboard shortcuts (e.g.  #8220;GRID Autosport #8221;), use delayed scaling via `Ctrl+Alt+F11` (note the added `Ctrl`). The app also has a _systray icon with a menu_. ## Requirements 2.0: Windows 7+ (1.x was Windows 8+). Both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the app are provided. ## Reporting bugs Bugs are possible, feel free to report. Please note that potentially blacked-out secondary displays and possible lack of support for variable-refresh-rate (VRR) technologies like FreeSync/G-Sync are the known issues of the whole Windows #8217; magnification mechanism and _cannot_ be fixed on the application level. ## On the blur issue Hardware scalers (both of GPUs and monitors) blindly use blurry bilinear interpolation _regardless_ of whether scaling ratio is _fractional_ or _integer_. With _fractional_ ratios like 1.75 (175%) or 2.5 (250%), either blur or distortion are indeed _inevitable_. But with _integer_ ratios like 2 (200%) or 3 (300%), image can be upscaled with _no quality loss_: each image pixel can be represented as a square group of integer number of _same-color_ physical pixels. E.g. 2 #215;2 at 200%, and 3 #215;3 at 300%. ## Related links * [Live web-demo](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/demos/non-blurry-scaling/) of what integer-ratio scaling is. * [Nonblurry integer-ratio scaling](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/)  #8212; article about the blur issue, solutions, progress, and more. * [Petition](https://www.change.org/p/nvidia-amd-nvidia-we-need-integer-scaling-via-graphics-driver) (2000+ votes) for adding nonblurry scaling to graphics drivers. * [Request](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/844905) for adding nonblurry integer-ratio upscaling to nVidia graphics driver (65-pages thread).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I'm not really seeing that much difference Make sure the game is in DPI-aware mode. The criterion is simple: the game-window size in physical pixels should correspond to in-game resolution. For example, window of a game running at FHD resolution should occupy about 1/4 (1/2 horizontally and 1/2 vertically) of 4K screen at 200% OS-level zoom, not entire screen. Games that are not DPI-aware require disabling DPI virtualization (DPI scaling) in executable #8217;s properties, to have proper window size with no blurry scaling automatically applied by Windows to non-DPI-aware applications. To disable DPI virtualization for a specific game, right click on the game #8217;s executable, then choose:  #8220;Properties #8221; item  #8594;  #8220;Compatibility #8221; tab  #8594;  #8220;Settings #8221; section  #8594;  #8220;Change high DPI settings #8221; button  #8594;  #8220;High DPI scaling override #8221; section  #8594;  #8220;Override high DPI scaling behavior.

    <TEXT> gt; Faster Than Light. That game is 720p. You can't do integer scaling with that game whatsoever unless your monitor is exactly 1440p. You can use integer ratio with this game with a monitor of any resolution. The [key advantage](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/#h-nearest) of nonblurry integer-ratio scaling over regular nearest-neighbour scaling is that ratio is _always_ integer  #8212; _regardless_ of ratio of physical and logical resolutions. The rest screen space is just filled with black. It works like the  #8220;Centered #8221; mode, just with 2 #215;2, 3 #215;3, etc. physical pixels instead of 1 #215;1 physical pixel per logical pixel. For example, 1280 #215;1024 image can be displayed on a 3840 #215;2160 screen with a ratio of 2 by displaying each image pixel as a group of 2 #215;2 physical pixels with black margins of 56 physical pixels above and below, and 640 pixels  #8212; leftward and rightward. Specifically 1280 #215;720 is perfectly (with no black bars) upscaled to 3840 #215;2160 (4K) with a ratio of 3 where each logical pixel is represented as a square of 3 #215;3 same-color physical pixels.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Integer-ratio scaling makes sense with a physical/logical ratio of 2+. It #8217;s unclear why FTL #8217;s authors decided to use 1280 #215;720 resolution instead of the mainstream 1920 #215;1080 or its quarter 960 #215;540. Nearest neighbour at fractional ratios results in image distortion, especially at small ratios below 2. Whether it still looks better than bilinear is a matter of taste. For me, such distortion is unacceptable (for example, lines originally having same width get twice-different width when scaled with a ratio like 1.5 using nearest neighbour) and direct opposite to the IntegerScaler #8217;s purpose.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>IntegerScaler 2.0 supports Windows 7</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-02-11 03:47:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>[**IntegerScaler**](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/) is a #160;_free_ app for upscaling games with _integer ratio_ and _no #160;blur_. Useful for playing modern games at #160;FHD resolution on #160;4K monitors for higher performance, as #160;well as for pixel-art games and retro gaming. Previously ([1.x](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ae1mfz/)), only Windows #160;8+ were supported. **Update:** Version 2.4 fixes the #160;bug that caused system mouse pointer (cursor) under Windows #160;7 to #160;be invisible when scaling was turned #160;on. ## What is integer-ratio scaling? Integer-ratio scaling uses _integer_ ratios and allows to #160;play e.g. at #160;FHD resolution on a #160;4K monitor with _no #160;quality loss_, by representing each logical pixel as a #160;square group of #160;2 #215;2 physical pixels of the #160;_same_ color with _no interpixel diffusion_. Such scaling is also known as _pixel-perfect scaling_ and _pixel doubling_. ## Related links * [Live web-demo](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/demos/non-blurry-scaling/) of #160;what integer-ratio scaling is. * [Nonblurry integer-ratio scaling](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) #160; #8212; article about the #160;blur issue, solutions, progress, and #160;more. * [Petition](https://www.change.org/p/nvidia-amd-nvidia-we-need-integer-scaling-via-graphics-driver) (2000+ votes) for #160;adding nonblurry scaling to #160;graphics drivers. * [Request](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/844905) for #160;adding nonblurry integer-ratio upscaling to #160;nVidia graphics driver (67-pages thread).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What is the resolution of your monitor? The whole point of the [integer-ratio scaling](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) is that it uses _integer_ ratios. The least integer ratio higher than 1 (100%) is 2 (200%). So the monitor #8217;s native resolution should be at least _twice_ higher than the resolution of the game to scale to take advantage of integer-ratio scaling. For example, with a 4K monitor, possible game resolutions include 1920 #215;1080 (Full HD) (200%) and 1280 #215;720 (HD) (300%).</TEXT>

I #8217;m not sure what you mean by _hardware cursor_. Windows-rendered cursor is as _software_ as in-game-rendered one. **Mouse** itself as a hardware device **does** work (games react to it), just cursor (the on-screen arrow/hand/crosshair/etc. that moves when moving mouse) is hidden, and only if it is rendered by Windows and not by the game itself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; input lag (and high CPU usage on Windows 7) CPU usage of magnification in Windows 7 is similar to Windows 10. Lag is possible (depends on how Microsoft implemented magnification) but unnoticeable.  gt; "Hardware cursor" means the cursor is drawn every display refresh cycle on top of everything else by the GPU. This generally is invisible to the operating system. I #8217;m not sure we are talking about the same type of cursor. Will return after testing a couple of games. _Update:_ tested  #8220;Civilization III #8221; and  #8220;Dota 2 #8221;. C3 does not support windowed mode at all and so is not a subject for scaling. D2 indeed uses OS-rendered cursor. But looks like the whole cursor issue only takes place at OS-level zoom of lower than 200%, so I decided to enable cursor for OS-level zoom of 200% and higher in IntegerScaler #160;2.1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Magnification does not involve injecting any code into specific application process. It just scales a specific _area_ of the screen regardless of what windows or their parts the area contains if any. IntegerScaler precisely positions the area-to-scale according to the game-window position, while not affecting the game itself other than centering its window to guarantee there is enough space for black background around the window. If something called EasyAntiCheat treats Windows #8217; built-in magnification as cheating, this is most likely just a bug that should be reported and fixed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that #8217;s a wrong assumption. GPU vendors just _didn #8217;t care_ while pixel density was low and almost unchanged for many years. The more pixel density is, the better pixel doubling works. With 8K monitors, we will be able to use 4K with no sharpness loss as long as proper nonblurry scaling is implemented, and no one will say single image pixels are noticeable and Nearest Neighbour is bad. Even today with FHD on 24 #8243; 4K monitor, image pixels are almost indistinguishable in antialiased 3D games. Not to mention pixel-art games and retro gaming.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wave (`*.wav`) format is *lossless*, MP3 is *lossy* and uses a so called *psychoacoustic* algorithm that provides such huge compression ratio. Other popular *lossless* formats are [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/) (`*.flac`) and [Monkey #8217;s Audio](https://monkeysaudio.com/) (`*.ape`), but unlike Wave, they provide some compression (typically 40-70% depending on the material). SoundCloud re-encodes uploaded files anyway. Re-encoding lossy to lossy gives more quality degradation than encoding lossless to lossy, so uploading a lossless file could help increase quality of the SoundCloud-encoded file. Just make sure to disable direct download of the lossless file via track properties on SoundCloud if you don #8217;t intend to make it available for free.</TEXT>

Some time ago, I asked SoundCloud #8217;s technical support why they re-encode even those MP3s that _already_ have exactly the same bitrate (128 kbps) they use for online playing, they answered that this allows them to ensure the file is playable in browser.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is a free analog based on exactly the same magnification mechanism  #8212; [IntegerScaler](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/). I am the author of it. And unlike the commercial Windows #160;8+ app, it [supports Windows #160;7](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/apc6dg/). Unfortunately the magnification approach is a stopgap anyway since it is limited to games supporting _windowed_ mode and also potentially introduces an extra lag. Some games may also be somewhat jerky when using magnification. Windows itself and multi-window applications cannot be used with no blur at all at lower-than-physical resolution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are two main usecases when blur is undesirable: * FHD resolution on 4K monitor where single image pixel (2 #215;2 physical pixels) is almost indistinguishable (and 4K resolution on future 8K monitors where image pixel will be totally indistinguishable). Probably only owners of 4K monitors who use them at OS-level zoom of 200% are able to see and understand that; * pixel-art games where maintaining pixelated nature of the image as intended by the game authors is important. In other cases (e.g. non-pixel-art old games), some people could like blur while others could dislike it. It #8217;s OK as long as both user groups are free to choose what they want. I call it being _able_ instead of being _forced_. Currently we are _forced_ to have blur _always_  #8212; even when it could be avoided.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Afaik, it #8217;s still a rare feature even in TVs. Heard before about its [support](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/#h-partial-tv) in some of Panasonic and Sony 4K TV models. Do I understand correctly that your LG TV is 4K and it upscales with no blur not just FHD (1920 #215;1080, 2x), but also HD (1280 #215;720, 3x)? How does it upscale a lower, non-multiple and non-16:9 resolution like 640 #215;480  #8212; are there black bars to maintain integer scaling ratio, or is nonblurry scaling used just for the two specific resolutions (HD and FHD)? For example, with true integer-ratio scaling, at 640 #215;480 on a 4K display, black bars should be not just at the left/right, but also _above_ and _below_ the 4x upscaled image because `2160 / 480 = 4.5` which is fractional. Could you specify the exact model of your TV and the corresponding menu option to enable nonblurry upscaling? Thanks.</TEXT>

The  #8220;Key bindings #8221; settings section shows _keyboard_ keys instead of _gamepad_ buttons and does not react to pressing gamepad buttons when trying to redefine any of buttons. And the emulator even hanged and then closed itself (crashed?) after several seconds when I just pressed `Escape` to cancel redefining a button. It would also be nice to have a more Windows-like user interface resized more predictably and not cropped when resizing window. * Looks like there is no support for nonblurry [integer-ratio scaling](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) unlike e.g. higan, bsnes, Snes9x and RetroArch.

    <TEXT>IntegerScaler is not just for 4K displays. It works with lower-resolution displays as well. What depends on native display resolution is how thick (if any) black bars around the scaled image are. For example, 320 #215;240 perfectly fits 4K height (`2160/240 = 9`), so there are no black bars above and below the scaled image, only at the left/right (just due to different aspect ratios of the image and the display). On a Full HD display, the highest integer ratio for the same 320 #215;240 image is 4 (`1080/240 = 4.5`), while the rest 0.5 (60+60 pixels above and below) is filled with black like in centered mode.</TEXT>

When in the window  #8220;Settings #8221;  #8594;  #8220;Controller #8221;  #8594;  #8220;XInput Controller #8221;, I press a window button like  #8220;Pad A #8221; or  #8220;Pad X #8221;, another window opens where there are such sections as  #8220;Controller Buttons #8221;,  #8220;System Buttons #8221;, etc. Before, I thought nothing happened (I was just returned to previous screen) when I pressed the window buttons in the  #8220;Controller Buttons #8221; section, but now I figured out I should choose a my-gamepad button that should bind to a corresponding console button. But looks like this does not work either: e.g. I binded console-gamepad #8217;s `Y` and `X` buttons to my-gamepad #8217;s `RB` and `LB` buttons correspondingly, but in MK3 the `LB` button still does a high kick (instead of expected block) and `RB` does a low kick (instead of expected run), so the game is unplayable.  gt; I can't promise a more Windows-like UI, but you're right that the resizing is pretty janky right now. Even an emulator with highest emulation accuracy and quality cannot be used if it doesn #8217;t have a usable user interface. And given that I wasn #8217;t even able to rebind buttons, the current interface unfortunately looks like not quite intuitive. :-( But it could. ;-)  gt; If you instead mean an option to force only an integer ratio for the output video (i.e. only scale 4x for 1080p instead of 4.5) Exactly. Integer-ratio scaling is not just about pixelation (otherwise Nearest Neighbour would be enough, but it causes distortion at fractional ratios). When using integer-ratio scaling, each logical pixel is represented by a group of _integer_ number of pixels of the _same_ color with _no_ interpixel diffusion/blur, and the resulting scaled image is centered on the screen with filling the rest screen space with black. Resulting pixel groups are square in general (2 #215;2, 3 #215;3, etc.) and rectangular (e.g. 4 #215;5 in case of vertical stretching or 5:4 with horizontal stretching) if aspect-ratio correction is needed (e.g. DOS games with resolution of 320 #215;200 are usually stretched to 320 #215;240 to achieve the aspect ratio of 4:3). higan, bsnes, Snes9x and RetroArch do support integer-ratio scaling. If something is still unclear, please see my comprehensive [article](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) about integer-ratio scaling. Fwiw, it is also available in [Russian](http://tanalin.com/articles/lossless-scaling/). Best regards.</TEXT>

ASIO wrappers are a better-than-nothing workaround for consumer devices with no native ASIO support  #8212; e.g. Realtek audio built into motherboard.

    <TEXT>Based on my experience, `GetDeviceCaps(hdc, LOGPIXELSX)` works (and should work like any Windows API function just thanks to backward compatibility) consistently across Windows Vista+ versions including Windows 10. What Windows 8.1+ adds is Per-Monitor DPI Awareness and corresponding things like the `WM_DPICHANGED` event and the `GetDpiForMonitor()` function, but those are optional and should not affect DPI-aware apps written for Windows 7-8. I #8217;m not sure what 40% increments you are talking about. Even Windows 7 allows to set any zoom up to at least 200% with a step of 1% (e.g. 189%). The issue is unlikely related to API difference. Maybe a rounding error. Note that declaring an application as Per-Monitor DPI-Aware (`
    dpiAwareTrue/PM/dpiAware`) solely makes sense if the application _really handles_ the `WM_DPICHANGED` event and updates its GUI accordingly. If not, it #8217;s better to use the regular DPI-awareness declaration: `
    dpiAwaretrue/dpiAware`. This would also rule out theoretically possible (though still unlikely) weirdness caused by Windows believing the app is really Per-Monitor DPI-Aware. Good luck.</TEXT>

The vertical shift is slightly smaller, but this is possible just due differences in visual styles between W7 (3D) and W8+ (flat). The bug is apparently _not_ specific to Windows #160;8.1+. I #8217;m still not sure what the scale the `GetScaleFactorForMonitor()` returns, but I believe it #8217;s **not** meant to be used for determining DPI when programming DPI-aware applications. Fwiw (irrespective to the bsnes overlapping bug), Windows 10 applies zoom immediately (Windows 7 did require log-off/log-on) and does this differently for regular DPI-aware apps (they are scaled as _bitmap image_ until log-off/log-on) and Per-Monitor DPI-aware apps (not scaled, but sent with the `WM_DPICHANGED` event so that the app could scale itself). If an app does not handle the `WM_DPICHANGED` event, it should not be declared as Per-Monitor DPI-aware and should be declared as regular DPI-aware (`
    dpiAwaretrue/dpiAware`), otherwise its size will be incorrect until log-off/log-on.</TEXT>

There are monitors that are _formally_ FreeSync-compatible, but actually support a _narrow_ refresh-rate range of e.g. 56 #8211;60 #160;Hz which is almost useless and pretty equivalent to lack of FreeSync support. It also makes sense to test the monitor when buying to make sure it has uniform backlighting, no dead pixels and no other possible defects.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That might depend on how resolution scaling is implemented in the specific game (e.g. Unreal Engine 4 supports nonblurry scaling, but most of UE4-based games don #8217;t use this feature), but typically there is [blur](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) even if upscaling ratio is integer such as 2.0 in the FHD-to-4K case. And there is blur _always_ if a generic resolution setting is used instead of the resolution scaling feature built into some modern games. So FHD on a 4K monitor typically looks worse than on a native-FHD monitor. A software scaler like [IntegerScaler](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/) may help with games that support windowed mode.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wow. Will the monitor support **pixel-perfect integer-ratio upscaling with no blur** by pixel duplication (doubling)? It is also known as **integer scaling**. The point of this upscaling method is that scaling ratio is always integer and there is **no quality loss** because each logical pixel is represented as a perfect **square** group of integer number of physical pixels such as 2 #215;2 or 3 #215;3 and there is no interpixel diffusion at all. For example: * 1280 #215;720 (16:9) to 2560 #215;1440 with 2 #215;2 pixels; * 640 #215;480 (4:3) to 1920 #215;1440 with 3 #215;3 pixels and 320+320 black bars to the left/right from the scaled image; * 800 #215;600 (4:3) to 1600 #215;1200 with 2 #215;2 pixels and 480+480 left/right bars and 120+120 top/bottom bars. This is important for: * getting higher performance in modern games; * preventing unreasonable quality loss when playing games that don #8217;t upscale their user interface, so a more performant GPU can #8217;t help; * maintaining the pixelated image nature in old and pixel-art games. All existing monitors and graphics drivers blindly use blurry bilinear upscaling regardless of whether scaling ratio is _integer_ (2.0, 3.0, etc.) or _fractional_ (1.75, 2.5, etc.), though blur is solely inevitable at fractional ratios.

    <TEXT>Display-side and GPU-side scaling methods are _not mutually exclusive_. Both methods have their advantages and downsides. Both could _coexist and complement_ each other. Display-side scaling would most likely be done in hardware and so would have virtually _no extra lag_. But display-side scaling would be built into a _specific_ display model and couldn #8217;t help owners of other displays. Graphics-driver (GPU-side) scaling would universally work with any existing and future displays, but with such scaling, display always gets signal in its _native_ (physical) resolution, so effective _bandwidth is limited_  #8212; this will be especially important and noticeable with 8K displays where HFR #160;4K would be possible with display-side scaling while being impossible with graphics-driver scaling at least with currently available interfaces. Also, electromagnetic radiation from signal cable is much higher with GPU-side scaling (e.g. 4-times higher at the ratio of 2 e.g. in case of HD-to-QHD or FHD-to-4K scaling) than with display-side scaling when signal comes in its original resolution instead of display resolution. Electromagnetic radiation may affect electronics, e.g. add interference noise to sound speakers, and is potentially dangerous to health. Scaling via graphics driver would also potentially introduce an extra lag. Third-party scaling software for Windows is unfortunately limited to upscaling games running in _windowed_ mode, and potentially introduces an extra lag (at least that caused by using windowed mode itself). A universal solution (not tied unreliably to specific 3D APIs and their versions) for upscaling games running in _true (exclusive)_ full-screen mode in Windows is _technically impossible_. There are two scaling applications for Windows I #8217;m aware #160;of: a commercial one mentioned by #160;you, and the free [IntegerScaler](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/) developed by #160;me.

    <TEXT> gt; Why this is suddenly moving into the GPU driver is beyond me. * Monitors don #8217;t support the feature. Some entry-level monitors don #8217;t even support aspect-ratio-maintaining upscaling. GPU scaling helps. * Even if new monitors did start supporting integer scaling, this wouldn #8217;t help all owners of existing monitors. GPU scaling would. * Windows does not have access to contents of the screen in exclusive full-screen mode. * Compositor/DWM in windowed mode potentially adds an extra lag compared with exclusive full-screen mode. So that #8217;s not _moving_ the feature into graphics driver, that #8217;s implementing it _for the first time ever_ (aside from some Panasonic and Sony 4K TVs capable of nonblurry upscaling for the FHD-to-4K special case). Monitor-side and GPU-side implementations of integer scaling are _not mutually exclusive_. Stating something else would be a false dichotomy. Integer scaling should be available in **both** monitors and graphics drivers  #8212; just like all other existing scaling modes are  #8212; to cover all usecases as fully as possible.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; unlimited layers. Great.  gt; you need to test the demo to check for the resolution. HiDPI support / user-interface scaling is something that should be explicitly implemented by developer. Such HiDPI support involves positioning and sizing UI elements according to OS-level zoom (and/or to zoom manually chosen by user via plugin settings), and using higher-resolution graphics at higher zooms levels. So as the developer (?) of the Wusik plugins, you should certainly know whether you implemented user-interface scaling in the plugins.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no idea what 1.5 you are talking about. Integer scaling automatically uses the _maximum_ integer ratio possible with the specific combination of the input and native resolutions. So if the full ratio is 1.5 (though specifically with QHD monitor this would result in a weird input resolution of 1706,67 #215;960), the closest integer ratio is 1.0 (the rest 0.5 is filled with black), so the result is identical to the current  #8220;Center #8221; mode. Real-world examples specifically for the QHD monitor: * 1280 #215;720 (16:9) to 2560 #215;1440 with 2 #215;2 pixels (2560/1280 #160;= 1440/720 #160;= #160;2, perfect fit); * 640 #215;480 (4:3) to 1920 #215;1440 with 3 #215;3 pixels and added 320+320 black bars to the left/right from the scaled image (screen height is entirely occupied by the scaled image, black background is only needed at the left/right due to different aspect ratios  #8212; input 4:3 and native 16:9); * 800 #215;600 (4:3) to 1600 #215;1200 with 2 #215;2 pixels and added 480+480 left/right black bars and 120+120 top/bottom black bars (the native ratio is 1440/600 #160;= #160;2.4, the closest integer one is 2.0). For even more clarity, see also the [live demo](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/demos/non-blurry-scaling/) and a complete set of [reference-rendering images](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/#h-algorithm-ref) in my article.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**The good things:** * the article on the Intel website is a somewhat _more official_ information source than a Twitter post; * the Intel-GPU-driver team _clearly understands_ the difference between integer scaling and nearest neighbour; * _both_ integer scaling and nearest neighbour are going to be available in the Intel graphics driver; * using nonblurry scaling via Intel graphics driver _won #8217;t affect performance_. **The things I #8217;m worried about:** * they still incorrectly consider _pixel art_ as the main usecase for integer scaling, while getting higher performance when playing 3D games (e.g. racing games) at FHD on a 4K monitor is _at least as important_; * they mention some potential implementation issues related to _OS composition model of multi-plane overlay, cursor coordinate mapping and touch interaction_, though OS should actually have absolutely NO IDEA about the type of scaling used by the graphics driver and full-screen scaling should be 100% transparent for OS and applications. So what we #8217;ll get might not be exactly what we expect. Not to mention multiplane overlay support is only available in Windows 8.1+; * the specified _minimum resolution supported_ is 640 #215;480, though when using graphics driver for scaling, it should be possible to use ANY user-defined custom full-screen resolution because resolutions natively supported by the display _don #8217;t matter anymore_. For example, the typical resolution in DOS games is 320 #215;240 (aside from 320 #215;200 and aspect-ratio correction), and SNES/Genesis use 256 #215;224, and it would be nice to be able to use/add such full-screen resolutions even if they are not available by default; * they say that emulators can #8217;t use full-screen integer scaling via graphics driver. But in fact, many emulators _do support_ exclusive full-screen mode like regular non-emulated games while _not all_ of those emulators have built-in support for integer (or even nearest neighbour) scaling; * just curious what the  #8220;fixed function display engine #8221; is (mentioned in the  #8220;Will the system power or game #8217;s performance be impacted? #8221; section of the article).</TEXT>

Did you try to switch fast between blurry and nonblurry images in the [demo](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/demos/non-blurry-scaling/)? Fwiw, my knowledge about integer scaling is not just theoretical. I experience integer scaling every day when browsing the web with [SmartUpscale](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/smart-upscale/) extension for Firefox/Chrome, watching FHD videos with MPC-HC, and playing games like  #8220;GRID Autosport #8221; at FHD with [IntegerScaler](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/).</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I honestly can't see a big difference Whether the difference is big is rather subjective. The best way to see the difference, as I said earlier, is switching quickly between blurry and nonblurry images. And the [live demo](http://tanalin.com/_experimentz/demos/non-blurry-scaling/) allows that. Just switch your web browser to full-screen mode (typically with the `F11` key), load an FHD image into it (it will then be scaled to 4K with 2 #215;2 pixels if your desktop resolution is 4K), and toggle the  #8220;Enable blur #8221; checkbox (in the control panel at the right) multiple times sequentially (once you checked or unchecked the checkbox, you can conveniently do this with the `Space` key instead of mouse clicks).  gt; I cannot do any pixel-peeping because both screenshots and screen captures come out at 1080p When scaling with IntegerScaler, you can take screenshots with the `PrintScreen` key  #8212; that way you get a screenshot in the desktop resolution instead of the in-game resolution.

    <TEXT> gt; Printscreen: No, it didn't work with PrintScreen, I get the image resized within my main monitor. I #8217;m not sure what  #8220;image resized within monitor #8221; means. When IntegerScaler upscaling is enabled, PrintScreen should give an upscaled image, at least that happens for me. For example, if a game is running at FHD and upscaled with IntegerScaler to 4K, the resulting screenshot will have the 4K resolution with each FHD pixel represented by a square group of 2 #215;2 same-color pixels. Note that you should manually paste clipboard contents into a graphics editor instead of relying on third-party software that might intercept pressing the `PrintScreen` key and do other things such as e.g. taking a screenshot at in-game resolution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Unfortunately all monitors and GPUs add blur when upscaling regardless of whether the ratio is integer or fractional. So Full #160;HD on 4K monitors looks worse than on monitors with native Full #160;HD resolution. The blur-free type of upscaling is usually called **integer scaling**. After 5 years of the 4K-monitor era, support for integer scaling has finally been recently announced for Intel graphics driver (unfortunately only for the upcoming GPU Gen11+). Hardware support is also planned for the EVE Spectrum community-assisted QHD monitor. Limited support is also available in Linux (via either XRandR or nVidia driver). For windowed games under Windows, it #8217;s possible to use integer scaling via magnification software like [IntegerScaler](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/integer-scaler/). See the  #8220;[Nonblurry integer-ratio scaling](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/) #8221; article for details on the blur issue, the integer-scaling solution, usecases, existing workarounds, potential solutions, algorithm description, FAQ, ways to get involved, and progress so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, but with today #8217;s CPU performance, the FLAC-decoding performance hit can be considered negligible. For example, on my i7-3770T, playing a FLAC file (even 96KHz@24bit) with foobar2000 takes typically below 0.1% of CPU power. So playing 10 tracks would take less than 1%. Note also, that performance hit depends on FLAC compression level, so extreme levels should just not be used to keep performance hit low.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nice. However HiDPI support needs not just higher-resolution graphics bundled. The app itself should _implement_ resizing and positioning UI elements depending on pixel density (DPI) at least under Windows. Could you provide a screenshot taken _specifically_ under Windows at OS-level zoom of 200%? And another question. The product [page](https://www.inphonik.com/products/rym2612-iconic-fm-synthesizer/) says that the instrument  #8220;genuinely reproduces the unique and characteristic sound of its hardware counterpart (digital saturation, huge feedback amount, natural distortion,  #8230;) #8221;. Is there a setting to disable emulation of such specifics and so get highest-quality-possible FM sound, just based on the _architecture_ of the original YM2612? Thanks. P.S. Looks like your site is unavailable from Russia with no workarounds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks. Unfortunately the Windows screenshot is apparently taken at 100% zoom at Full #160;HD resolution and does not allow to see how the instrument looks at **200%**  #8212; a popular HiDPI mode often used with 4K monitors like Dell P2415Q. Nice that the emulated sound specifics can be bypassed. As for the issue with access from Russia, the site apparently uses a CDN with multiple IPs used in random order. Some of them (e.g. 142.93.108.123) are available from Russia while others (e.g. 167.99.137.12) are not. All of them are apparently owned by DigitalOcean that suffers from many of their IPs blocked in Russia for the purpose of blocking Telegram.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, byuu. Are you aware that pages of your website lack the `title` element (`
    titleExample/title`)? This leads e.g. to that all the tabs in browser have the same meaningless  #8220;title #8221; equal to the domain:  #8220;byuu.org #8221;. Could you fix that? Thanks. _Update:_ Looks like there is now a `title` element, but it #8217;s always the same and equal to the same  #8220;byuu.org #8221; domain. Also the pages lack the first-level heading element  #8212; `h1`, incorrectly using the `header` element instead. The `header` element has a totally different meaning than head**ing** elements like `h1`, `h2`, etc. So e.g. on the https://bsnes.byuu.org/ page: * the `title` element should contain the  #8220;bsnes #8221; string; * the  #8220;bsnes #8221; heading should be marked up as `h1`; * subheadings such as  #8220;Download (stable) #8221;,  #8220;Download (nightly) #8221;,  #8220;Development #8221; and  #8220;Supported Systems #8221; should be marked up as `h2`; * and  #8220;Primary: #8221; and  #8220;Secondary: #8221; (in the  #8220;Supported Systems #8221; section) should be marked up as `h3`.</TEXT>
