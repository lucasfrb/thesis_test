    <TEXT>Protecting minorities? Well yes that's relevant to the country, but is of course an area where Corbyn has a spotless reputation. Don't think you'll find a politician with as strong a record of always being there for the country's minority population. Ironically it's that same quality that you're criticizing him for - being insufficiently willing to join in the moral panic against various foreign "enemy" groups. Are you really claiming that Corbyn isn't motivated by a desire to help the country / the world? Even if you disagree with him on what that looks like, questioning the motivation of a true believer like Corbyn is a weird leap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Ok so at least he's not as racist as the Tories? That's your argument?! Unbelievable Isn't that the comparison being made? You're the one going way out on a limb and saying "anyone would be better than Corbyn" rather than sticking to some more defensible criticism.  gt;Did he attend the memorial for the Munich terrorists? Did he call Hamas his friends? How many times was he involved in Iranian state propaganda? No, no, and not at all? People got on Corbyn for being at a ceremony in Tunisia honoring Palestinians who had been assassinated by the Mossad. None of the Munich terrorists were buried in the cemetery or even the country where that ceremony was held: https://evolvepolitics.com/there-were-8-munich-terrorists-none-are-buried-at-the-tunis-cemetery-that-jeremy-corbyn-visited/ Corbyn said something in a meeting about "welcoming our friends from Hamas to the debate table" - not really anything to suggest he was claiming personal friendship with them, much less the Hamas organization. Corbyn has not ever been involved in Iranian state propaganda. He appeared in a normal tv guest sort of way a couple times on an Iranian TV channel called Press TV that frequently featured British guestsn(including other MPs): https://www.thejeremycorbyneffect.com/jeremycorbyn/category/press-tv-allegations Does that cover it for you? I hope this drives home what a ridiculously higher standard Corbyn is held to than any other UK politician. The smallest hint of impropriety that would go unnoticed in any other politician becomes a multi-year scandal, and meanwhile you're here being outraged at the idea that he should win any points for being less bad than his main opponents. If the Tories were some fringe group maybe you'd have a point, but they're in power! It's impossible to deny that Corbyn replacing May or Johnson would have been a big win for anti-racism in the UK.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Does it? I think this is pretty explicitly making the case that "Yes obviously any attempt to do big things will involve some failures, but currently we are so scared of those failures that we're erring on the side of doing too little." Like this bit about renewable energy investment:  gt;Take, for instance, the wildly successful Obama administration program to loan money to renewable energy companies that became infamous because one of those companies, Solyndra, was a bust. That program led to a slew of successes (including Tesla) and turned a profit to taxpayers. As Michael Lewis argues at length in his book The Fifth Risk, the problem, if anything, was that it was too cautious  #8212; so afraid of a Solyndra-like story that it wasn #8217;t funding sufficiently risky investments. But they proved right to be afraid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did we read the same piece? Not sure where you're getting that it's an argument for Klein's political allies to get more power. It's a pretty broad sweep saying "we have a problem with not being able to get things done in this country" and advocates for general institutional reform around the theme of reducing the number of veto points standing in the way of any given action. The trouble with the response "meh, doing things is overrated anyway, tends to backfire" is that it works equally well no matter where we are on the spectrum of how easy it is to get things done. Unless you're an anti-doing things maximalist, there has to be a point where that objection is outweighed by some countervailing force, like all the problems Klein brings up resulting from how difficult it is to get anything done. So to have a conversation about this we've got to think about that balance, not just repeat generic "here's why veto points are good" talking points.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's of a piece with the weird and problematic nature of suburbs that both of those are the case. On the one hand it's a lot cheaper to get the same amount of space in the suburbs, but on the other hand it's illegal to get less than a certain minimum amount of space. So if you're poor enough that you can't afford that smallest available suburban lot, or the car you need to survive out there, your only choice is to pay way more per square foot in a city. On the other hand if you have enough money to get into the suburbs at all, it's a lot cheaper to live a middle class lifestyle out there than in the city.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This repetition of "tiny, overpriced bodega" is sort of putting me off - makes it feel like you have some enmity towards bodegas or urban grocery stores generally beyond the discussion of their potential for virus infections. I guess I can only really speak for myself as an urban dweller (Brooklyn), but I've been getting along fine with the combination of the small grocery store across the street and delivery, no subway grocery trips for me. To go back to the original article, the issue isn't really so much urban vs. suburban, but walkability. If an area is walkable there will be a lot of small grocery stores catering to relatively small numbers of people, which is good for robust supply chains and for reducing infection. If people don't walk then they'll travel from longer distances to a hub, whether by car or public transit, and that's less good. And then separately as you say public transit is probably more infectious than driving. But if you're in a walkable neighborhood like the one I live in you can cut out both driving and public transit entirely.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a distinction between the true tiny bodegas and the many small but not that small urban grocery stores. Variety really isn't much less than in larger suburban stores, there are just fewer of each item on the counter at any one time. I'd agree walkability doesn't imply hard neighborhood borders, but I think it's hard to argue it doesn't make avoiding infection and surviving when society is not running normally a lot easier.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;New York's example would suggest otherwise, surely? The outbreak was far worse there than anywhere else in the entire country. There are lot of factors making New York different from other parts of America beyond it being particularly walkable. And I'd say it's up there in terms of "can manage to keep functioning effectively with a given rate of infection."  gt;And if we're talking survival, cities are at the far tip of a very long supply chain; they're probably the most vulnerable locations in a genuine crisis, not the least. As opposed to where? Everyone's at the far tip of a lot of long supply chains. Not like people in rural America, much less the suburbs, are living off the land. The difference is that cities are bigger markets and tend to be hubs in those supply chains, making continued supply more likely and reliable.  gt;Anyway, thinking about it more this entire discussion is based on an incorrect premise -- that the main vector of transmission is through supermarkets or other food stores, which isn't the case. In normal times that premise is incorrect, maybe less so when all the other places people congregate are shut down. What are the other major vectors when we're all in lockdown? New York at least is now seeing steady declines in new cases per day, so whatever they are they seem to have mostly been closed off.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what to make of the dichotomy this presents. When is there ever a decision being made about whether some need should be met by the nonprofit or for-profit sectors? Nonprofits are about transmitting resources from the donors to whatever purpose the nonprofit is set up to serve. If enough money flows into nonprofits meeting a particular need I guess they might do so well as to make it unprofitable to get into that business, but that seems like a great outcome to me - think of wikipedia driving encyclopedia companies out of business. It's certainly true that supply rising to meet demand is a more reliable way of having a need met than waiting for nonprofit charity to do something about it, but that doesn't say anything about the usefulness of giving to charity.</TEXT>

Americans in that age group were also far less likely than other age groups to view capitalism favorably. When VICE surveyed a group of its Gen Z readers in 2019, six in 10 predicted that the wealth gap would worsen in the next decade; 20 percent believed the United States would pivot to socialism by that point; and 57 percent identified socialism as an economic solution that would help combat violence against marginalized people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh sorry, right link but I guess they made the forum there members only. Here's the text: HARVEY 'TWO-FACE' DURDEN Harvey Durden is a hero. Harvey Durden is a monster. Harvey Durden is a visionary. Harvey Durden is a schizophrenic. Harvey Durden is splashed across the front page again. You don't talk about Harvey Durden. http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maco0otRui1qblm56o1_500.jpg Harvey was born in 1942, the only child of his young parents. His father was absent for his first few years of life  #8211; away at the war, and returned a changed man, frequently abusive and more frequently drunk. A quiet child, Harvey read voraciously, at one point becoming particularly obsessed with Thomas Hobbes and his ideas about the need for a powerful state to keep people's base impulses in check. Harvey succeeded academically, and by the time he was a teenager he knew exactly what he wanted to do with his life: work as a prosecutor to put men like his father, and all the other bullies large and small he had encountered in his life, behind bars. By the late 1960's Harvey was living his dream. He escaped from his unhappy family life, got a job in the New York district attorney's office, and was widely seen as a rising star who could succeed at just about anything. He even became a close friend and protege to Anthony Wayne, who was using his wealth and influence to fight New York's slide into crime and urban decay, and saw that a young crusader could have a bright future ahead of him. After Harvey impressed Anthony, he also began to receive occasional visits from Iron-Bat, coordinating as best he could with the authorities during his long, private war against injustice. But the life he had found was not all Harvey hoped it would be. For every hardened criminal he locked up there seemed to be a dozen sad, desperate people who were never equipped to thrive in modern society, and were instead being relentlessly ground up by the machinery of the state. He had trouble sleeping, and when he did sleep his dreams made him long for wakefulness. Despite the many who admired him Harvey had few real friends, and his only really solace through all this was his fiancee Marla Dawes, one of his co-workers at the DA's office. Still, he persevered. Harvey had long been adept at hiding any trace of his true feelings, and he could be charming, even charismatic, when he wanted to be. When his boss, District Attorney Carl Hogan, was killed in a super-villain attack, Harvey was selected as an interim replacement, and then won his first election, making the job permanent. He tried to put aside his doubt about the society he was living in, and whether anything he was doing was truly justice, but the harder he clamped down on those thoughts, the less he slept, and the worse the nightmares became. http://media.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/47850/harvey%20dent.jpeg A courtroom sketch of Harvey caught at an unguarded moment: 1966 Things came to a head when in 1968, in the midst of a high profile battle against the super-powered mob running much of NYC, a bomb went off in Harvey's apartment. It killed Marla, and nearly killed Harvey as well. He was recovered alive, but terribly injured, with half his body covered in gruesome scars and burns. The attack shattered Harvey's already fragile grip on reality. As he looked at his face, one half destroyed and the other shockingly preserved, all of the thoughts and desires Harvey had pushed down into his sub-conscious surged up to the surface. The ruined half of his face seemed to speak, and Harvey listened. He moved to a broken down old house in a bad neighborhood, and began his recovery. While still on medical leave, Harvey took to wandering the streets of his new neighborhood looking for fights, and for recruits. The scarred but still charismatic man began to gather a following, particularly among New York's underclass. He told people that they were not special, that all the progress and advancement that was supposed to save them was a lie. Instead, they would make their own rules, tearing down the society that had become a leviathan, crushing those it was supposed to serve. His followers would meet in out of the way places  #8211; abandoned warehouses, bar basements, anywhere that had been cast aside as they had, and they began to put together their new society. It was a culture born of brutal violence, first directed against each other in (barely) non-lethal 'fight clubs,' where young men searching for an outlet for their frustration and rage were allowed to pound each other into the concrete. As Harvey's following grew he began to direct them towards more organized mayhem. Robberies, vandalism, assaults, and every other variety of crime was unleashed. Some were directed towards gathering resources for Harvey's new army  #8211; while others simply reveled in the sheer nihilistic urge to lash out a society whose legitimacy was simply no longer acknowledged. http://www.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/legacy/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fight-club.jpg Crowd at one of the original 'fight clubs': 1969 Meanwhile, Harvey returned to work. He used his influence to shift attention away from his followers and stymie the investigations into what his people were calling Project Mayhem. Where before he had been adrift, but beloved by his colleagues, now he was laser-focused, even as those same colleagues were disturbed by the changes that had come over Harvey. Of course the physical scarring was unnerving enough, but even worse were the changes in Harvey's personality. While at times he was his old affable self, sometimes a different persona seemed to take over: one that was quick to anger, and seemed to seethe with barely contained violence. These shifts, along with Harvey's appearance, gave rise to the name that would later become synonymous with Harvey Durden: Two-Face. Both eager to help and eager to get Harvey out of their hair, colleagues were quick to suggest that Harvey relax and take his time returning to work. Quickly accepting their offers to pick up any slack he left, Harvey became a ghost around the office  #8211; immersing himself in Project Mayhem and only coming into work to keep an eye on what information the city had on his extra-curricular activities, and to block as many of their investigations as possible. Under Harvey's watchful eye his organization grew  #8211; with fight clubs (also sometimes called 'freedom clubs' by more idealistic members) and mayhem chapters springing up in city after city. The guardians of law and order, both police and super-heroes, proved powerless to fight the spread of mayhem. All the firepower in the world, whether in the form of SWAT teams or eye-beams, wouldn't help them, because it couldn't be brought to bear against an organization that barely merited the name. They were amorphous, secretive, and destructive. The occasional captured member couldn't reveal much except the Club Rules: first among which was that members shouldn't talk, and shouldn't ask questions. http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/344/3/6/project_mayhem_by_empty_can-d34lxqn.jpg Project Mayhem continues to escalate: 1970 Eventually though, cracks began to show. Iron-Bat, who by this point mostly focused his efforts on large-scale super-villainy, philanthropy, and geopolitics rather than street crime, took notice of the spreading violence and began to investigate. While the police were handicapped by their need to follow the letter of the law (meaning that they couldn't simply round up every reported fight club member, since even if they could confirm membership consensual fights are generally legal), and increasingly by their infiltration by mayhem members, Iron-Bat cut through the ranks of Project Mayhem, getting closer and closer to the center. Harvey knew that it was only a matter of time before he was outed  #8211; someone who looked like him couldn't exactly remain anonymous, and made plans for his future. By early 1971, the chase was almost over. After months of investigation, Iron-Bat was forced to conclude that his old friend Harvey Durden was the mastermind behind Project Mayhem. He armored up, and headed to Harvey's home, which he had reason to believe was now the nerve center of the vast mayhem organization. When Iron-Bat arrived however, the home was cleaned out, empty of not only anything incriminating, but of anything to suggest someone had ever lived there. The only item that remained was a two-headed coin with one damaged side and one whole. Frustrated that Harvey had slipped away, and assuming that he had disappeared permanently, Iron-Bat (in his Anthony Wayne identity) made a call to the DA's office to check when Harvey had last been at work. By the time the secretary told him Harvey was in the building, Iron-Bat had blast through the roof of Durden's house and was flying towards the office. http://www.officialpsds.com/images/thumbs/Two-Faces-Coin-Replica-psd71010.png Harvey's coin: 1971</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Iron-Bat found Harvey alone in a vacant office at the top floor of the building, holding some kind of device in his scarred left hand, and a gun in his right. Iron-Bat informed Harvey that he knew who he was, and that he would come quietly if he knew what was good for him. Before Iron-Bat could move to apprehend him, Harvey warned him to stop, and revealed his trump card. He held up the device in his left hand and revealed it to be detonator, linked to explosives wired throughout the DA's office, as well as much of the rest of downtown Manhattan. Harvey had been planning to wait until nightfall when casualties would be lower, and wipe out the world's financial center in a single blow. Now though, Iron-Bat had forced his hand, and any attempt to stop him would kill thousands. Iron-Bat was stuck, but had one more card left to play. He had done extensive research on Harvey to determine if he could really be the one behind Project Mayhem, and one piece of information was too shocking to be believed. The bomb that destroyed Harvey's apartment, scarring him and killing Marla, was of identical composition to other explosives used in the early days of Project Mayhem. It wasn't set by the mob, as everyone had assumed, but by Harvey himself. Iron-Bat didn't know how Harvey would react to this revelation  #8211; but it was all he had. For a moment Harvey simply denied that it could be possible at all, but his words froze in his throat as the revelation truly hit him. The alternate personality that had guided him for these last years had not originated in the attack as he had always thought. Instead, it emerged earlier, taking over Harvey's body when he thought he was asleep or near-delirious with insomnia. It killed Marla and scarred Harvey, engineering his final loss of confidence in humanity and the systems that were supposed to hold civilization together. Finally realizing the true extent of what he had done, Harvey was hit by a wave of remorse. He wanted to take it all back, to give up and throw himself at the mercy of a world he had tried to destroy. But that was impossible. The other Harvey was still there, holding the detonator in his scarred left hand. It took only an instant for Harvey to realize the one way this situation could end that didn't leave half the city in ruins: he put his gun in his mouth, pointed it towards the scarred side of his face, and pulled the trigger. http://newsinfilm.com/images//2008/05/two-face.jpg Harvey gets ready to end it all: 1971 Six months later, Harvey woke in a hospital bed. He had been comatose, with most of the doctors monitoring him predicting he'd never wake up. To preserve his image and the legitimacy of the government that had trusted him, Iron-Bat hadn't told the world about Harvey. He had simply let those who had heard the shot call in Harvey's attempted suicide to the police, while he concerned himself with dismantling the explosives that had been placed around the city. Harvey was missing an additional chunk of his face beyond what the explosion had taken years ago, but he was a free man. If he chose he could simply walk out of the hospital, get a job, and leave the insanity of recent years behind him. http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa67/Undertaker_071/2face1.jpg Harvey Durden in the hospital: 1971 As these thought raced through Harvey's head, a couple of orderlies entered the room, pleased that their patient had woken up. They gave Harvey water and asked how he felt. Harvey told them quite honestly that he hadn't felt so good in years. The two orderlies looked at each other and turned back to Harvey. After a moment of silence one said,  #8220;That's good boss, we knew you'd be back on your feet. So once we get you out of this hospital what's our next move? The police and the bat have been rolling us up pretty good, but most of the guys are just waiting for you to tell us what's next. #8221; Harvey looked at the two Project Mayhem members, and a smile crept across his face, starting on the scarred side and making it's way to his unmarred half. A normal life had never been for him anyway. It was too bad that Marla had to die, but her death and his disfigurement had been necessary to help him see the world as it truly was. By the time he was being wheeled out of the hospital to a waiting car Harvey's mind was overflowing with plans. The world hadn't heard the last of him yet. Knowing that the moment there was a hint of his returning to his old ways Iron-Bat would reveal his identity and make things much more difficult for him, Harvey initially laid low. He communicated his orders through intermediaries, and largely kept up the image of a convalescent, staying at home, taking few visitors, and working on his manifesto. This document, eventually published under the title  #8220;Society's Future: Mayhem, #8221; was designed to be a recruiting and propaganda tool, spreading Harvey's philosophy of aggressive rejection of nearly all aspects of modern society. By the end of 1971 Harvey's feverish writing had produced a 50 page document, which he was able to have published relatively easily despite it's disturbing content because of the public hunger for information on the now somewhat well known district attorney who had been the target of attacks and then tried to kill himself. http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/US/abc_archive_NTBA1455A_wg.jpg Opening chapter of Harvey's manifesto: 1971 Just days after publication Harvey held a press conference where he first presented a summarized version of the arguments in his manifesto, and then moved on to announce that he was the head of the movement known as Project Mayhem, which was declaring war on industrial society as of this moment. At that point in the speech a team of Harvey's men attacked the stunned reporters and audience members, killing over a dozen and allowing Harvey to escape in the chaos. From that time on Harvey stayed far away from the public. He traveled the world, living everywhere from a cabin in Montana, to a Rio de Janeiro slum, to an Apocalypse cult camp in Afghanistan where he supported their fight against the Soviet Union (though he would eventually reject the Apocalypse cult and their goal of destroying human life altogether as thoroughly as he did modern civilization). Project Mayhem continued to launch attacks all over the world, while recruiting impressionable young men drawn to it's mix of nihilism, unfettered embrace of every human urge, and desire to hold someone, anyone, responsible for their lives just not living up to expectations. Project Mayhem continued to grow, and it's capacity for violence continued to escalate, for decades. Harvey remained the (Two-)face of the organization, but he recruited a many competent lieutenants who carried out operations on every corner of the globe. Perhaps the most famous of these lieutenants was Robert  #8220;Bob #8221; McVeigh a soldier turned bodybuilder who lost his balls through steroid abuse and eventually turned to Project Mayhem and their destructive philosophy as a way to punish the world for what he'd lost (or so said the syndicated psychoanalysts). Robert orchestrated Project Mayhem's most destructive single attack  #8211; a bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995 that claimed over 5,000 lives. Robert himself died in the aftermath of the attack and was seen as a martyr to mayhem and came to occupy a place second only to Durden's in the organization's pantheon. http://images1.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Fight-Club-meatloaf-873493_852_480.jpg His name is Robert McVeigh: 1995</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Throughout his over two decade reign of terror, everyone from the the FBI to the KGB to the League of Avengers had tried to track down Two-Face and bring him to justice. There had been close calls, but by the time of McVeigh's 1995 attack the effort to capture Durden were exactly nowhere. After that attack Iron-Bat decided that enough was enough. He had long viewed his moment of mercy that allowed Harvey to walk free as his greatest mistake. Fortunately, he had one great asset in the search that no one else had: Anthony Wayne. Soon after Harvey came out of his coma in 1971, Anthony made contact with his old friend, both to help him recover and keep an eye on him to make sure he didn't revert to his old ways. Unfortunately Harvey managed to still long enough that Wayne didn't make any conclusions in time to stop Harvey's return to villainy, but the contact formed the basis of an ongoing relationship. Wayne put on the guise of a man wracked by guilt over his role in the system Harvey so passionately decried. Of course Harvey was paranoid enough to not allow any clues to his location to make their way to Anthony, but he was also sufficiently intrigued by the opportunities of having Wayne as an ally that he didn't cut off contact entirely. The two men maintained a strange, irregular correspondence for decades, as Wayne searched for a way to use the relationship to get closer to Durden, and Durden searched for a way to discern whether Wayne was genuinely sympathetic,or just a tool of the many organizations hunting Project Mayhem. http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2011/08/begins308.jpg Anthony Wayne, not exactly a man of the people: 1995 By 1995, Wayne's long game was close to paying off. The sheer time and effort of corresponding with Harvey in secret for over 20 years, with no obvious attempts at subterfuge, had worn down some of Harvey's deeply ingrained suspicion. So when Anthony wrote to Harvey after the Oklahoma City bombing that he was inspired by what Harvey's people were doing, and was ready to take a more active role, Harvey didn't reject the idea out of hand. However, one last test was needed: Harvey needed to meet Wayne face to face. If Wayne was simply a tool of a long-term FBI project, the famously frivolous billionaire would never agree to an absurdly dangerous meeting with the most wanted man on Earth. Harvey offered, Anthony agreed, or for the first time in decades, the two men prepared to meet. By this point Anthony was 80 years old, but through a combination of the Infinity Formula anti-agic drugs his own company had been selling since the late 1960's and the various enhancements that he'd added to his body over the years, he still appeared to be in vigorous middle age, and even without his armor had physical capabilities well above the human baseline  #8211; and in some areas beyond anything an ordinary human would be capable of. Of course Harvey would give him no indication of where he was heading, and a lifetime of combating global intelligence agencies meant he'd sniff out any attempt to have Anthony tracked or followed. Anthony's only option was to simply stick his head into the lion's mouth, and hope that he'd be able to act before it's jaws came rushing down. http://th06.deviantart.net/fs18/PRE/f/2007/211/f/8/Bruce_Wayne___Batman_Beyond_by_No_Sign_of_Sanity.jpg Wayne had a bust made of what he'd look like at 80 without modification. What a sense of humor on that guy: 1996 Anthony informed a few of his closest allies of what he was doing, ordered them not to even think of following him, and went to his rendezvous with the local chapter of Project Mayhem. He allowed himself to be searched, blindfolded, and ultimately sedated, to be shipped out to whatever part of the globe Harvey was currently hiding on. When he woke up an indeterminate amount of time later, he was in a bland, institutional room  #8211; alone with Harvey Durden. Harvey's appearance had changed over the years, as his injuries slowly healed and he sought various cures that could give his wounded parts full function and reduced pain, while retaining essence of his now famous 'Two-Face' appearance. He smiled at Anthony, apologizing for the theatrics and inviting him to share a meal. The old Harvey Durden charisma, which had won elections and built a following willing to die for their leader, was in full force. Anthony couldn't help still liking his old friend on some level. He may have a philosophy that would bring ruin to the world, and been willing to kill for it, but the mixture of charm, obvious intelligence, and dead-eyed determination to do whatever it took to accomplish his goals certainly made him compelling. This made it easy for Anthony to play along with his role, seamlessly integrating genuine doubts about the modern world, and particularly with the military-industrial complex in the warm embrace of which Anthony had spent much of his adult life, with the persona of Anthony Wayne: bored playboy who might be swayed by some radical ideas if he could be convinced that the rush he was getting was for the greater good. The two talked for hours, and by the end of the evening Anthony wasn't exactly given the run of the compound, but he was given sufficient benefit of the doubt to not have his head cut off and mailed to Wayne International HQ as a message. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JDF20fmuhLY/TBbN2nFtOmI/AAAAAAAABgU/9g595edM9Lc/s400/298131-95711-two-face_super.jpg Two-Face greets Anthony Wayne: 1996 Over the next few days Anthony continued talking with Harvey, doing whatever he could to convince him that he was truly on his side. When the tests began to include handing over Wayne Internationals secrets, Wayne complied without hesitation. This was now not only a gamble with his own life, but with the lives of people across the globe who would fall if Harvey got the chance to use the information Anthony gave him. After over a week, Harvey was close to being convinced, and began to talk about sending Anthony home and putting him in position for further strikes. While it would ensure his own survival, this was of course not acceptable to Anthony. Spending a week with Harvey was fascinating, but if he was simply sedated and allowed to return him without ever pinpointing Harvey's location, the mission would be a failure. Fortunately, Anthony had a plan in place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wayne, ever the early adopter, was already stuffed to the gills with cybernetic enhancements and computing hardware (including a slot on his lower neck for the aforementioned gills). Much of the hardware was rather more military oriented than what you'd expect to find on your average playboy billionaire, but a combination of Wayne's carefully cultivated thrill-seeking leisure time activities and some decent stealth tech was good enough to fool both the public and the Project Mayhem techs who had worked him over. Of course simply hiding a transmitter would have been far too obvious: even if he could get it in undetected he would surely be found out the moment he started broadcasting, and Harvey was likely paranoid enough to be jamming the whole area anyway. By the mid 1990's spy satellite technology had reached an unprecedented pinnacle of technological brilliance. Anywhere on Earth could be observed precisely enough to see what newspaper someone was reading (an analogy that would soon need to be upgraded as people stopped reading newspapers). Between Wayne International and Iron-Bat's contacts in the US government and League of Avengers, Anthony had the best technology available. The problem of course is know exactly where to point those bad boys. Fortunately, Wayne had devised a solution to his problem. Hidden in the cornea of Wayne's left eye, there was a tiny camera and laser light emitter. If Anthony was merely allowed to look at the night sky it could use the positions of the stars to determine his position down the inch, as well as the scheduled positions of every Wayne International satellite in orbit. Given a few moments it would silently and invisibly use it's laser emitter to contact those satellites. The laser was weak and the process lossy  #8211; but it was sufficient for the only message that needed to be transmitted: HERE I AM. Of course the satellites couldn't transmit back, so there was no way to know if contact had been made effectively., but given the nerves of steel (iron?) necessary to get this far, Anthony was not about to let a little uncertainty about success and failure, life and death, to stand in his way. The obstacle to all this was of course that Anthony had to get outside. He'd hoped he could do so naturally, but Harvey was too paranoid even for that, and Anthony never left the inner sanctum of Harvey's compound, without so much as a window to jump out of if necessary. Luckily for Anthony, even with all of his armor he hadn't completely neglected his hand-to-hand combat training. You never know when you'll be busted down to just your wits and your fists (and whatever classified technology you can embed in out of the way parts of your body). One evening, on his way back to his quarters after a late dinner with Harvey, Anthony overpowered the two guards that had been sent to accompany him, and made a break down the corridor. After quite the harrowing few minutes of kicking down doors and avoiding security, he made it to an outside door, and discovered that Harvey's current base of operations was on an enormous abandoned oil rig. It wasn't clear where exactly the rig was, but as Anthony sought out a bit of cover and stared determinedly at the night sky, thanking the gods he didn't believe in that it wasn't a cloudy night (he knew the gods he did believe in, e.g. Thor, didn't have anything to do with it) he could at least hope that the tech hiding in his eye could figure out. After a few minutes of avoiding blinking and trying not to move his head lest it interfere with the already worryingly inexact transmission, the guards found Anthony. Realizing that his only hope was that his broadcast had gotten through by now, Anthony gave himself up to his pursuers. By the time the guards returned Anthony to Harvey he had slipped back into his na #239;ve billionaire persona, and began making excuses: he had gotten scared, just wanted to slip out and see where he was, maybe make a couple phone calls to friends and family to let them know he was alright. At this point though, Harvey wasn't buying it. Anthony had dispatched two highly trained guards, and evaded a network of security patrols for far too long. Clearly something was going on here, and even if everything Anthony said was true, he was obviously too unreliable to let free. Given that they hadn't detected any transmissions go out they wouldn't have to kill him immediately, as a billionaire hostage is always handy in a pinch, but he was now firmly on the prisoner rather than honored guest side of the fence he'd previously been straddling. And, just because that's the kind of organization Project Mayhem was, they might have to take his balls. Hearing all this behind his mask of fear and confusion, Anthony quietly calculated the chances of his message having gotten out, the speed at which his allies could respond, and when would be the opportune moment to deploy what remaining tricks he had in a desperate last struggle to buy a few more precious moments. As the knives were coming out and Anthony got ready for a bit more body-modification surgery than he was comfortable with, a series of impacts rang out on the hull of the rig. The cavalry, it seemed, had arrived. As Harvey's guards rushed out to deal with the situation they discovered a detachment of American special forces, lead by a team of Anthony's allies: his girlfriend Iron-Woman (Pepper Gordon), his adopted son Nightangel (Warren Grayson-Wayne), and his protege Iceman (Tim Drake). Harvey's men, whose defense had always been more security through obscurity and anonymity rather than firepower, quickly fell before the onslaught. The team had been waiting in League of Avengers orbital HQ, and had pulled the trigger on an orbital insertion the moment Anthony's message got through. As the battle raged outside, Anthony and Harvey were left alone. Confident that he could slip his bonds and take Harvey if necessary, Anthony tried one last time to reach out to his old friend. He told him what he'd done, though implying that he'd simply contacted Iron-Bat for help rather than being one in the same, and asked Harvey to just surrender. After all so many years and so much spilled blood Harvey couldn't truly hope for redemption or forgiveness, but he could at least take his defeat gracefully rather than being shot down like a mad dog. With just a glimmer of emotion on the unscarred side of his face Harvey agreed, and put down his gun just before the door blew open and he was ordered down onto the floor. In the years after Harvey Durden's downfall he remains a potent figure. Project Mayhem still exists, but without their leader they are slowly losing ground to the army of intelligence agencies arrayed against them, particularly in the heightened state of alertness imbued into the security state to fight the Apocalypse cult after 2001. Durden's letters from his maximum security jail cell are poured over by the media, and the old manifesto is still passed around in dorm rooms (and as time goes by, on the internet), tempting disillusioned students to throw off the chains of morality and learned weakness. Harvey Durden's life took him to strange places, and most of the time he doesn't seem to regret it. There are offers from plastic surgeons to fix his face, but he always waves them away as he has for decades. Harvey prefers it this way. He's spent most of his life with two faces, and who knows whether he'd lose the monster or the man if they took one away. http://a3.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/41/8026f28a7a9c3f22ebb17f1fcf7b6e91/l.jpg Harvey Durden and Marla Dawes: 1967</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Excess mortality can also be caused by the lockdowns. What happens if you have a stroke and nobody's there to notice and call 9-1-1? From what I understand lockdowns generally have a negative effect on mortality even apart from the effect on coronavirus infection. Sure there may be the occasional additional death of the kind you mention - but really that's pretty marginal given that it's only relevant for people who live alone during the hours when they wouldn't be alone if not for the lockdown. Weighing against that you get the huge mortality benefits from the reduction in spread of *other* infectious disease due to the lockdown, and the fact that on average people's normal daily routines are much more dangerous than sitting around in their houses. Getting rid of commuting alone saves a lot of lives, without even going into all the people with dangerous jobs or hobbies they're avoiding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Except that's the opposite of what we've seen for the last few decades. Ever since the neoliberal turn we've been in a bizarre opposite world where politicians have a bias in the direction of austerity. They're great at holding back during the upturn (when's the last time you saw an overheated economy with high inflation and low unemployment?) but can't bring themselves to spend enough in the downturn. You're right that it seems like the bias should go the other way, in favor of taking the short term gains of keeping labor market tight at the cost of creating inflationary pressure, and that does seem to be the way it used to be, but no more. I'd theorize it's a result of the true constituents of politicians shifting from voters, who want tight labor markets and don't mind a little inflation, to donors, who don't really mind unemployment being high but really hate inflation.</TEXT>

If her ego wasn #8217;t so out of control she #8217;d run for a lower, more applicable and realistic office than Governor. But nope. Governor or bust apparently. Because ego. This is a really wrong way to think about Nixon's run. It's not like she drove some more plausible candidate out of the race. The New York political establishment is so freaking scared of Cuomo he was pretty much going to run unopposed, until Nixon stepped in to take him on. We got this weird celebrity candidate because that's the kind of person who can mount a real run but doesn't really have anything to fear from Cuomo. And now we're enjoying Cuomo's mismanagement of this crisis.  gt;Ay caramba. He #8217;s the Governor of New York State. Not New York City Cuomo was actually did better in NYC than in the rest of the state. in both the 2014 and 2018 primaries.

    <TEXT>The trouble with that reasoning is that population growth is constrained by how much housing is available. The issue isn't that there are steadily more people in the city relative to the amount of housing, it's that there's steadily increasing demand for housing in the city, and supply isn't keeping up. If more units were built the population would grow faster because more people would fit in the city. You know you're building enough housing to keep up with growth when the price of housing stops rising.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have done extensive research on the topic, yes. Have you done any research on it? It seems like you don't even have a coherent position except "rent control is bad." The paper you link to claims rent control increases rents in non-rent controlled units. That's certainly an argument you can make opposing rent control... but it completely contradicts your claim that rent control reduces the incentive to build new housing. In fact it implies rent control would *increase* the incentive to build new housing, since the rents you'd be able to charge on that new non-rent controlled housing are higher than they would be without rent control existing in the city.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No. You also don #8217;t know what contradict means. If a LL were freely able to control their housing stock (e.g. remove a rent stabilized T), they could then convert their rent regulated rentals into sales (e.g. condo conversion). That is one example. One example... of what? My point is that if rent control causes the rent landlords can collect on non-rent controlled property to go up, and all new construction is not rent controlled, then rent control actually increases the incentive for new construction, since the housing units in the new building can be rented out at a higher rate. Do you see what I'm saying?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think there's any risk of the state having trouble incorporating current private school students into the public school system - they're a pretty small proportion of the total. I guess I go a little farther than the author of the piece in that I don't see the appeal of having separate religious schools. I can see the justification for Catholic schools back when they originated in a time of serious anti-Catholic prejudice, though even then I don't think religious segregation was the right solution. But now having parallel school systems where students are indoctrinated in a particular religion seems like one of the varieties of private school I'd most want to ban.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't think that would be a big problem - the implication of this research is that we are evolved to grow old and die. Given that we don't see many animals evolving to have very long lifespans, it's likely that short lifespans are actually somehow advantageous on a species level. So an immortal species of monkey would probably spread less quickly than the standard monkeys it was based on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The idea is that it keeps the supposed benefit of qualified immunity - making sure officers aren't punished for something they couldn't know wasn't allowed - while eliminating the giant glaring loophole of that being an excuse to never actually disallow anything. This way one lucky cop gets off the hook for committing each category of violation based on the "how was I to know?" excuse and from then on any additional violators have no such immunity. I'd be okay with getting rid of qualified immunity altogether, but it's particularly maddening that we could so easily get the entire benefit it's supposed to produce without choking off the whole concept of holding police accountable through this sort of suit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's comparable to coal miner unions and global warming. Unions are great for protecting workers from the arbitrary authority of their bosses, but they tend to side with those bosses against the public on non-labor issues. Coal miner unions are going to oppose de-carbonization that would lose them their jobs just like police are going to oppose the reallocation of resources away from state violence and towards social spending that would lose them their jobs. In both the main problem is the industry, whether coal or state violence, that needs radical change if not outright abolition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I've always thought the big priority should be deconstructing the police force into its different elements. As you say we need investigators / detectives, and there should probably be some kind of SWAT unit in case of active shooter situations and such, pretty much all the other work of the police could either be ditched or done by some sort of unarmed "social worker with a badge" first response team. It's kind of nice to have an authority figure walking the streets in some areas... they should just be someone focused on keeping the peace and connecting people to resources, not an armed paramilitary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a real classic "politics is the mindkiller" post. If /u/FCfromSSC could just escape slightly from the "red tribe vs. blue tribe" binary he's caught in the whole situation might seem a lot less confusing to him. It's absolutely wild that he brings up the Branch Dravidians and Waco as some kind of counterpoint to the protests. Remember what's being protested against here is the brutality and militarization of the police force. Waco is a great example of that! This is just fundamentally not a "tribal" issue. Urban police forces work for "blue tribe" elected leaders. Waco was perpetrated by "red tribe" FBI agents. Your cultural affiliation does not protect you from police violence, and it doesn't prevent you from being complicit. Don't act like the enemy are over-enthusiastic protesters rather than the system they're protesting against, and while that system is terrible and it's hard to believe I have to say this, I strongly recommend you try going out and protesting before resorting to terrorism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; There is no such thing as a benevolent gov't. You want more gov't, you want more oppression. Every single time in the history of the world has proven this. Hmm how do you square believing that with the fact of "small government" America being far more repressive towards its citizens than "big government" social democratic countries? I think we just can't simplify everything about the type of government we have down to its size. The welfare state adds a lot to the government's size, but doesn't do anything to produce more oppression. Look at Trump: obviously a very oppressive, nasty guy to have in power. Has he used the welfare state to control people in any way? Any oppression being enabled by social security? Medicaid? Food stamps? All he and his authoritarian cronies seem interested in regarding the benevolent parts of the government is getting rid of them, not somehow using them as part of their oppression.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Yes, Waco was a horrific tragedy perpetrated and lied about by the security state and politicians. If you're against that sort of thing you're on the same side as the current protest movement. I'm sure somebody out there protesting today has a "Remember Waco!" sign. It seems plausible enough that Waco would have generated more of a reaction from progressives had it been perpetrated against the sort of 'blue tribe' people they're more primed to sympathize with, but so what? New Yorkers have a bigger reaction to police violence in New York than they do to violence in Miami, proximity / social proximity is a factor in how people react to things, that's just reality. None of that contradicts that there is a national movement against police violence that you should show solidarity with whether your central example of such violence is Waco or George Floyd.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; No, if I'm against that sort of thing, I'm espousing a similar named goal.  gt;  gt;  gt;  gt; That says nothing about intended focuses, proposed solutions, or even each 'sides' actual goal. So are you in fact against arbitrary state violence against the civilian population or do need to keep doing this "if you were against that sort of thing" construction? This protest movement of course contains multitudes and represents all sorts of goals, but a benefit of that decentralization is that I think you can count on the fact that people really are out there for what they claim to be organizing around: ending police brutality. There isn't really the capacity to have a secret separate reason to be in the streets on a large scale. I guess the greater sympathy of the "blue tribe" towards these protests and the anti-police brutality issue might not necessarily be enough to make you vote Democrat, but I hope you can at least see that if you care about that cause you are in a real sense an ally of these protesters. The "blue tribe vs. red tribe" dichotomy just doesn't work very well on this issue. The Democratic leadership is still pretty law and order while the rising leftist youth movement wants to abolish the police. Meanwhile the Republican leadership are mostly near fascist in their desire to hand over limitless power and resources to the security forces, even as many on the "red tribe" are fervently anti-government. If we want to preserve and even expand our freedoms we need to be coming together around are common problem of police state overreach regardless of loyalty to one political "tribe" or the other.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;By contrast, the media are encouraging rioting that kills a lot of people, and ruins communities so thoroughly that a great many more will die from second-order effects. You've got to apply your skepticism a little more evenhandedly. You understand how a false narrative was perpetrated around Waco to justify oppression, but then you completely fall for basically the same false narrative of "no they're violent, they're crazy, they deserve it" when it's applied to protesters.  gt;I note that no one actually seems to be able to demonstrate a clearly better system, despite a very large nation with 50 states and lots of major metro areas to experiment in. Pretty much all other developed countries get away with far less police violence than in the US. Police kill about 4 people a year in the UK and 1000 in the US, and that sort of ratio is not unusual. Clearly there's some massive room for improvement in American policing.  gt; The protesters and the rioters are overwhelmingly blue tribe. The people encouraging and making excuses for them are almost exclusively blue tribe. Blue Tribe as a cohesive group actively encourages hatred and violence against people like me, and this has led to large-scale real-world violence that appears to be getting worse over time, as well as discrimination and abuse in a myriad of other forms. I am more worried, personally, about the consequences of being ruled by people who actively and passionately hate me than I am about winning the evil cop lottery and getting gunned down while reaching for my wallet at a traffic stop. Come on man, this is some truly unhinged stuff. There's no blue tribe plot to destroy you. What group are you part of that you're imagining all this hatred and violence is being encouraged towards? I promise you nobody at these protests has any ill-will towards you - they want the same things you do! And really it seems like these protests are producing more progress on police reform than anything in a long time, so I don't think you can really be too down on their tactics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The problem that I see is that ultimately what are unarmed social workers or  #8220;public safety #8221; people going to do when either the people they contact tell them to fuck off or that they tell someone to do something and the subject whose being told something doesn #8217;t do it. Under this model they should get in their car and drive off if not having armed police being present is the objective. What kind of situations are you imagining here where having a gun would help? In the vast majority of situations just the presence of an authority figure with the capacity to record the interaction and give you a ticket is plenty. In the small minority of cases where physical force is called for, it's rare for anything to be needed beyond a bit of man-handling. That tiny little remaining sliver of cases that benefit from the potential to apply lethal force are not worth having the front line government representatives promoting public safety for ordinary citizens be armed paramilitaries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; the only issue I'd say about that is those situations could escalate and should require somebody with a gun and arrest power should it come to it. Of course what one could suggest is to have officers that are specialists in lower level stuff. Just spitballing. Yeah I think there's certainly room for armed representatives of the state somewhere in the system, but they should be specialists called out to deal with particular crisis situations, not the front line of generic first responders and beat walkers. I'd envision it sort of like the fire department - hanging around in stations and then getting a call that there's an active shooter or something and springing into action. But the key is they should show up if the situation escalates, not be there already and potentially escalate the situation themselves.</TEXT>

The waste of resources is funding a paramilitary police force that treats protesters like enemy combatants instead of as citizens exercising their rights. It would be easy enough to send some cops to observe, deter looters, and break up fights without launching full scale assaults on peaceful protesters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I call the cops to enforce laws when I feel there is a dangerous situation or when someone who projects authority needs to control a situation. An unarmed social worker cannot handle these situations, with the exception of a wellness check. Drunk and disorderly people aren't going to listen to a social worker. And they are a physical threat. What kind of situations are you thinking of here? You mention drunk and disorderly people - surely that's a classic example of where you just want a friendly public safety representative who can restrain someone if necessary but definitely won't shoot them? I think a lot of your objections here are based on imagining taking some random social worker and sending them off into these situations. What I'm advocating is for people who are still required to be able to get physical if needed, but just on a hand to hand level as opposed to in the form of lethal violence. The big problem with our system is we have armed paramilitaries who feel like their job is practically like being in combat assigned to deal with low level public order disturbances and quality of life violations. With a million such encounters, once in a while one of them tragically touches off into a deadly incident - especially when there are additional factors at play like racial tensions or arrest quotas. We should keep a small number of those sort of hard core fighters in reserve for when they're really needed, and turn most of the cop job over to a very different looking group.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Or, as FCFromSSC is pointing out, to what end? The Red Tribe can avoid the exact situations that BLM is trying to solve, and has no guarantee that BLM or the broader left will want to slow -- or even stop speeding up -- the police state when it goes after things outside of their sphere. Even from the most charitable perspective, BLM specifically has increasingly focused on local actions in deep blue areas, in no small part due to the failures of federal- and state-wide actions in the last decade. Even if successfully implemented and actually achieving their goals, what cause is there to expect anything to result in Red Tribe locals? Isn't a major point here that the 'red tribe' has also been the victim of police aggression, as in Waco? I don't see anybody as having avoided the situation BLM is trying to solve. All of the reforms BLM is advocating for will benefit people in rural areas as much as in cities. If your concern is that they'll just reform those laws on the local level while not being able to implement the same agenda nationally it's not for their lack of trying. If you want the same thing for your home town you should probably start organizing for it there.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I could as easily cite the antifa riots where organized thugs beat people bloody while the police sit by idly and watch. Haha given that that's a fictional scenario I somewhat doubt it.  gt;You and other Progressives can claim that this is all crazy random happenstance, but it seems to me that the evidence is clearly against you. Nor is this a bi-directional thing. There's no equivilent on the other side to these riots, or to the Kavanaugh or Covington episodes, or in hoaxes like the UVA or Smollett incidents, or Hands Up Don't Shoot, or to the Antifa riots. No one's shown up to gun down democratic members of congress. The FBI isn't breaking the law to try to overturn a democrat president. This stuff is overwhelmingly coming from progressives, to conservatives. You are very wrapped up into some kind of right-wing grievance vortex. I don't think this sort of victim Olympics really resolves anything, but my god, each of your example has such a direct comparison on the other side - 'red tribe' activists with guns were just recently gathering around state capitals, Kavanaugh made it onto the court while McConnell blocked multiple years worth of Obama judges from consideration, Democratic Congresswoman Gabbie Giffords was shot while giving a speech by a right-wing extremist, the head of the FBI literally broke the law to leak damaging statements about Hillary Clinton right before the 2016 election, likely swinging the election for Trump... on and on. It's easy to feel like your group is uniquely persecuted and the other guys get away with anything, but I promise you that is not close to being the case for American conservatives in 2020.  gt;I believe the rioters are violent and crazy because I'm watching video of them beating the shit out of people and burning down and looting large chunks of our major cities. When your mental model of someone is "they are crazy and drive to irrational violence for no reason" usually the issue is that your model is off. I've also been watching the protests, and participating in some, and the 'looting' element could not be a tinier or more irrelevant fringe. Almost no protest has gotten even unruly without a police attack on the protesters. Meanwhile a tiny number of people using the resulting chaos to get their kicks breaking a window or stealing a tv are not much of a threat to anyone's safety, much less to western civilization. I worry we may have too much [inferential distance](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w) between us on this to communicate effectively. I'd really urge you to get away from whatever media source is apparently showing you endless loops of burning buildings and scary 'rioters' and try to get a fuller understanding of what's going on in the country at the moment. And in the bigger picture, I hope it's some comfort that this ongoing move of our society in a more accepting and tolerant direction will always tolerate you and the less of the 'red tribe' as it tolerates any other cultural group. The painful aspect is just the transition from that "traditional White Christian American" tribe going from the overwhelmingly dominant group to just one among many, which can feel like persecution to those previously on top.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can't prove a negative of course, but the point is that they've shown the only supposed hard evidence of significant fraud that was ever presented does not actually suggest fraud. Of course anyone can speculate about the presence of fraud in by either side in any given election, but that's all it is: speculation. I understand that Bolivian right-wingers have faith that the speculation must be accurate, but until they can offer any evidence to support that claim that doesn't get rapidly debunked there's no reason for the rest of us to believe them.</TEXT>

Which I guess counts out most of your ilk. Haha do you want to make a bet about whether the zone is actually going to be taken over by a 'warlorld'? So far the evidence I've seen for that is a video of a random late night scuffle over graffiti tagging rights.  gt;And that's not what the comic is depicting though, is it? What do you mean? Doesn't the comic show them doing all this anarchist stuff in the middle of a town with buildings and cops and stuffy conservatives in top hats?

Again, literally the only evidence of "warlordism" we've seen so far is a random late night scuffle over graffiti tagging. You can't really deny the endless livestreamed evidence right in front of your face that the space isn't being dominated by "warlords"?  gt;I know you're not overly bright, since you're unironically in support of this ridiculous shit, but do notice that in the comic they're building things/creating infrastructure and "the CHAZ" isn't doing that(minus their "farm" and I will give them kudos for that, though it won't be enough). Haha they've existed for less than week! Not exactly much time for construction projects, but besides the 'farm' they've already got a free library, food pantry, outdoor movie theater, defensive perimeter, and probably more I'm not aware of.</TEXT>

What I'm asking is why you think that's the case.  gt;Cool and that doesn't negate what I've said, that they are entirely reliant on infrastructure that they have not built nor that they maintain. I guess that takes me back to wondering what your point is. Remember the feudalism / early capitalism example - everything always starts based on the previously existing infrastructure, no new thing has ever been some perfectly pure brand new project untouched by and unrelated to everything that came before. This is a small stretch of a city experimenting with living without police. It's not going to be some commune disconnected from the rest of the country, it's going to be a little bubble where things run differently that some people live in and other people visit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That they should go ahead and do so? For the most part the local residents and businesses are supporting the CHAZ project, and don't seem to have any difficulty operating normally. Many have reopened since it started - remember pre-CHAZ this area was a rolling battleground between police and protesters. The new autonomous zone status quo is the least disrupted things have been for a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't seem like it should be. Rent control helps existing residents stay in their homes. YIMBY policy helps make sure that enough new homes get built. Maybe if you had decades of effective YIMBY policy prices would be low enough that there wouldn't be a role for rent control, but obviously that's not the case these days. I'd say there's pretty clearly a role for both in fighting the housing crisis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; How peacefully do you think the residents are living with a large influx of strangers claiming territory? Seems to be pretty peaceful so far. The only violence I've heard of has been a couple minor late night scuffles between protesters, and given how right-wing hate mobs have been picking over every detail I'm sure we'd have heard all about it if any residents were having trouble.  gt;How do you think the business owners are fairing after months of misery opening doors to self-proclaimed anarchists? No one is visiting those shops, they are opened out of desperation. Where are you getting that? The eyewitness accounts I've been reading say the shops are bustling due to greatly increased foot traffic, with businesses and protesters getting along very well. Lots of BLM signs and giveaways from the businesses, and less harassment and intimidation from the protesters than they used to get from the police.  gt;You cannot tell me that this time last year these people were worse off than they are now, and you certainly can't say that they will be able to operate at a normal pace while this continues. Last year to now who knows - as you say they've just been through not just the recent police riot but also the pandemic and everything else we've all been dealing with in 2020. But in the long run I think this could be a very positive thing for the neighborhood - pushing them to operate at not just a normal pace but better than a normal pace. Founding a tourist attraction will do that for you - shop and restaurants love the foot traffic!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a strange thing to say. Remember rent control never applies to newly built housing. The usual critique of rent control is that it actually raises rents for the non-rent controlled units, because there's more competition for them from the people not already locked into a rent controlled unit. And if that's the case you'd actually expect rent control to *increase* new housing production by increasing the incentive for developers. In contrast I can't really think of any mechanism by which rent control would discourage new development.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This list of demands is pretty vague and absurd. I get the impression that they had a public assembly and put in a lot of random ideas from a lot of people without much quality control. But I'm sort of okay with that, because the unachievable demands give them an excuse to continue to exist. Having a little anarchist enclave in Seattle like Freeport Christiana in Copenhagen or Exarchia in Athens would be great.</TEXT>

It's a lot easier politically to have the Fed do a mass cancellation of debts owed to it than it is to invalidate debts private parties owe to each other. The downside of course being that it sort of leaves the public holding the bag rather than scummy private creditors... but this is all premised on the public being willing to use their money printing machine, so being left holding the bag isn't so bad.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha yes they always answer "Well I was browsing leftbook and saw they considered hosting an event with accused class reductionist Adolph Reed, so that's a no for me." DSA has pretty much the racial composition you'd expect of a progressive middle class activist organization. It's whiter than the country is because the young educated professional class or aspiring professional class types who make up its membership are whiter than the country as a whole. DSA has so far not had much luck reaching out to working class recruits of any race. It's a real issue that we should devote time and effort to, but it's pretty clearly not a racialized one. If anything recruitment efforts would probably be helped by sticking closer to the "class reductionist" program of easily understandable universal demands instead of the "abandon our successful political project of running in Democratic primaries and replace it with creating organizing spaces for Black Lives Matter" program this article advocates for:  gt;Yet, in a sense, Heideman is right: it is time for mass politics  #8212; but not the type that Jacobin is suggesting. There is mass politics going on in the streets right now, with hundreds of thousands of primarily working class youth taking part. Our mass politics should help organize national and international protests for Black lives. We should organize a national campaign to get cops out of our unions. It #8217;s time to build Black Lives Matter assemblies in our workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods in coordination with Black led community organizations and unions to continue the movement.  gt;And yes, there is a role for national electoral politics, but not within the Democratic Party, which is tear gassing protesters in the streets. The capitalist parties don #8217;t want to fight racism; they profit too much from it. Capitalism and racism go hand in hand. So, it #8217;s high time for DSA candidates to publicly break with the Democratic Party and form a new party, on a socialist ballot line against the party responsible for George Floyd #8217;s murder. The mass politics we need is one that strengthens and deepens Black struggle by connecting it with the strength of the working class in our workplaces, as well as politically opposing the current co-optation by the Democratic Party.</TEXT>

To be clear, that is indeed from my perspective of "accomplishing progressive goals is a good thing." If you disagree with me on that you'll have a very different perspective on the CBC. As representatives of America's black population, a very progressive group, I'd wish that the CBC would also be progressive. Failing that, I'd hope that they'd at least push to expand black representation in congress. But instead they're so far over on the other side that they [consistently endorse white corporate candidates against progressive black challengers!](https://prospect.org/politics/eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman-and-the-cbc/) There isn't some big mystery here, the white corporate establishment reps behave the same way. If you're a progressive you simply cannot count on the support of either the Democratic Party leadership or the CBC.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay? I guess I'd agree with you in terms of recommended political strategy for third parties, but what are you getting at? Personally my theory of how best to achieve progressive change is to run progressive candidates in Democratic primaries rather than as third party candidates, and from what I can tell the main obstacle to that project is the network of incumbent non-progressive Democratic politicians and their allies in the donor and media world who are working together against that progressive uprising - aka "the Democratic establishment."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I tend to agree on the pessimism front - really I don't think either performative wokeness or or aggressive class based demands are going to lead to a boom in working class DSA membership. The org is probably destined to continue to look basically how it looks now in terms of class and demographic composition. That said, trying to broaden the organization's demographic base should be a permanent major priority. It would be really really good to break out of that young professional category. What concerns me in the 'class reductionism' conversation is that the anti-class reductionist side sometimes implies, like in this article, that the organization has a racialized problem with attracting minority members that can be fixed by rejecting the 'class reductionst' line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Meaning you object to this part?  gt;It is easy to look back and see the damage caused by racist assumptions memorialized in black and white. Media coverage is not benign; it has consequences in policy decisions that affect the lives of real people. The past is rife with examples of poor communities of color bearing the brunt when the press reports assumptions instead of facts #8212;the war on drugs, the myth of crack babies, condemning government officials for their failure to protect children. Seems tough to argue with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well it depends on what kind of new housing is built - if it's market rate the people who move in and benefit will be a higher class than if it's designated affordable housing. So better to spend public money building public housing to help out those who need it most. But since there's no downside to building more housing it's still very much worth letting the market rate housing get built by private developers rather than banning increased density. The situation we're in now is the result of year after year, decade after decade, of not building enough housing. It's going to take a long time to make up the shortfall that has built up, and you won't see huge price decreases immediately, but the sooner we get the housing production machine going the quicker we start moving towards a long term solution.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the basis of this is a pretty cynical view of human nature - ironic since leftists are often accused of a naively positive view of human nature. It is extremely difficult to get people to take serious action on an issue they don't see as effecting them personally. The areas where the interests of white workers overlap with those of non-white workers are the areas where there's hope for progress in the form of a multi-racial working class coalition. In areas where white workers don't have any interest at stake, or even just don't understand that their own interests are at stake, there's much less possibility of getting anything done. So we've got to seek out those common interests and emphasize how all of our struggles are connected, rather than the all too common and disastrous opposite strategy of demanding that we only try to help the worst off. It's the charity model vs the solidarity model - do you have limited resources to give away that you should save for the most needy? Or are you trying to build a coalition that will be more powerful the more members it has?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Every job police stop doing reduces the number of police man hours needed, which reduces the number of officers needed. And it turns out that barely any of the jobs police do currently require an armed paramilitary. Unarmed public servants trained to deescalate could easily take over traffic enforcement, beat walking, noise complaints, domestic disputes, mental health checks and all the rest of the unglamorous not shown on tv stuff that comprises the vast majority of police work. There's room for a rump of armed officers for true active shooter type situations, but that could easily be only 5% of present day numbers, and would practically never come into contact with everyday citizens.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The difference between what and what? I think the point is that it was always possible, and indeed common, to be fired for some silly reason that your boss decided to take too seriously. The only difference now is that some small fraction of people who get unjustly fired are fired because of social media outrage, which is if anything a more progressive force than the whims of bosses. I'm super-in favor of increasing job protections to avoid arbitrary firings, social media motivated or not. But beyond that this is just people complaining about other people yelling at them on the internet.</TEXT>

I think in this context they basically are, in that they are all part of the pre-internet cultural elite that is being disrupted by the internet. The true elite in the sense of our corporate overlords don't have much to worry about from "cancel culture" so far since they're not dependent on the public's good will in the way cultural elites are.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The James Gunn situation seems to have been a failed attempt by right-wingers to induce a cancel culture misfire. They had some brief success, but it turned out that most people hearing about it didn't judge Gunn particularly harshly for his old joke, and soon he got his job back. The system works! Of course for more ordinary jobs than "big famous movie director" my solution is to just have some basic employment protections in the US so your boss doesn't have the option of firing you over your internet commenting history in the first place. "Employment at will" that allows arbitrary firings is the problem, not the fact that some small percentage of those arbitrary firings are the result of a social media frenzy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm still not seeing why "prominent critic of cancel culture is actually major canceler herself" is an unacceptable story to you. Yeah, I hope this discredits Weiss somewhat, she certainly deserves it. And it makes an important larger point about how people tend to define "cancel culture" as "criticism of me and my friends" rather than anything more consistent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Urban dynamics are so counter-intuitive. As OP says pre-crisis NYC was experiencing a population loss in the middle of boom times. The obvious explanation is that high rents were driving people out. It's a weird problem to have - there's so much demand to live in NYC that the prices are so high that a lot of people currently living there are forced to leave. The obvious solution would have been to allow more housing to be built, but now we have accidentally ended up with the opposite solution: a huge crash in demand for all the reasons OP describes. Bad for people who own land in NYC, good for people who are planning to live there no matter what and now get to do so more cheaply.</TEXT>

Biaggi was part of a progressive wave that unseated almost the entire traitor IDC caucus, and Bowman is just one of many DSA members who are likely to win this year - just today they announced that Marcela Mitaynes beat Felix Ortiz for state assembly. The rest of the races haven't been called yet because of NY's incredibly slow absentee ballot counting but they look very good for the DSA slate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's the concluding paragraph:  gt;We have to get past this. If this planet is to have a future, we have to start caring about each other #8217;s interests. I do not support the Russian government, because it is an atrocious human rights violator, Putin is an autocratic criminal, and all governments must be opposed, but what happens to Russians themselves matters to me. They are not my enemies and they are not yours, and to the extent that a government #8217;s actions serve the ends of its people #8217;s health, they may be justifiable even if illegal. The only enemies are those who seek to use other people #8217;s misery as an opportunity to amass more money and power, and those who present that predatory behavior as neutral rather than abhorrent. The New York Times is far more worthy of condemnation than any country trying to hack its way toward a vaccine for coronavirus. What's your problem?</TEXT>

The point he's making over and over again is not "atrocities are okay" it's that "just because the US government perpetrates them doesn't make atrocities okay." It's not a defense of Russian atrocities, it's a criticism of double standards in the media. The exact same action is treated very very differently depending on which country did it.</TEXT>

You as an individual are not friends with either the Russian government or the American government. Both are pretty nasty organizations - and I'd certainly rather live in America than Russia. What the article is saying is that you shouldn't let the American media scare you with dumb fearmongering about the Russians. This is what internationalism is all about - not mindlessly following the American line on something not because you're a pro-Russia traitor, but because you are a thinking individual who can see through one-sided propaganda.</TEXT>

Putin is clearly a dictator and should be opposed on that basis, but there are plenty of dictators in the world and none of them are really a threat to your freedom as an American. The anti-Russia hysteria in the American media is more about finding scary outsiders to shove blame for our problems onto than it is concern for the political freedom of the Russian people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Huh, I guess I had the opposite impression, seemed to me like it was Mounk doing a lot of "how to avoid admitting you don't have a leg to stand on" rhetorical moves. It's just so, so easy to sell a narrative based on "let me list out this string of anecdotes that support my position." The quintessential example for me is always the old Breitbart "Black Crime" subject heading. If you want to demonize a sufficiently large movement or group of people it's easy to find a new story every day about some awful thing they've done, and after reading that sort of thing for a while the larger trend just seems like common sense despite the narrative being a totally artificial creation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>David Brin has a new novel subverting this concept by making humans the relatively wise and ancient species who have handed over most front line work to the far more risk-tolerant and impulsive "demmies":  gt;We never expected that inventing Star-Drive would lead to this. We were first! Bold explorers who brought light and movement to the galaxy, teaching others and forging a grand alliance with all races. (Well, most of them.) It seemed the galaxy would be ours to lead and to share!  gt;Till we met demmies.  gt;Oh, they #8217;re not so bad. They mean well. Impulsive and exasperating, sure. Often brilliant, cheeky, moronic, volatile, always astonishing... did I mention exasperating?  gt;And lucky.  gt;Gradually, it dawned on humanity  #8212;  gt;Hey, that #8217;s what WE wanted to be!  gt;In ancient myths and sci-fi dreams, it #8217;s how we pictured ourselves. As the impulsive-lucky ones, not the wise, patient elders. Only now...  gt;... they reverently call Earthlings "the Ancient Ones." And demmies are having all the fun!  gt;That is... until the good ship Clever Gamble sent a team down to a planet even demmies couldn't handle! https://www.davidbrin.com/ancientones.html</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is a key point:  gt;It helps to think of this debate as taking place on a spectrum. Social justice advocates think the bands of acceptable opinion and arguments shouldn #8217;t be narrowed, precisely, but rather pushed to the left  #8212; shifted to include formerly excluded voices from oppressed communities and to sideline voices that seek to continue their exclusion. Their critics think the traditional bands of debate are, broadly speaking, correct, and that we #8217;d all be worse off if the social justice advocates succeed in moving speech norms in their direction. The "cancel culture" debate seems to be mainly about people who don't want the range of socially acceptable opinion to move left, but can't argue that case on its merits and so instead have to pretend what's happening is an overall narrowing of the range of acceptable speech.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What's our current policy? The point this article is making is that mainstream gatekeepers treat some views like "blacks are inferior" or "we should have a worker's revolution" as unacceptable and don't let them get published. There isn't really any hard and fast rule for which side of the line a view falls on, just a lot of publishers playing things by ear and a lot of people on twitter trying to work the refs. So now we are seeing what change looks like in that kind of system - a lot of people publicly voicing displeasure about what views are permitted or excluded, and then content producers trying to figure out how what needs to change to appease their audience. Reform ideas are welcome, but "cancel culture" *is* the current system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess I'd say you can definitely get away with posting "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" online - for example here it is: https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html It seems like what you're getting at is that you want to say the n-word? I certainly agree that that's a taboo, but that predated the internet, much less "cancel culture."  gt;Depends which ones. I think our public education system is a train wreck, but I don't discuss it around my retired union-leader/teacher mother in law or my current-teacher friend. I know they would not agree with what I think the solutions are. Yeah there you go - the worst online "cancellers" can do to you is reveal what you really think to people you know in real life. So you post about how you hate teacher's union and get so much woke twitter hate that your teacher friends find out about it. Could be awkward I suppose, but you've apparently been doing well enough just avoiding the subject so far. The only way there's a potential problem is if what you really think is sufficiently abhorrent that it would make people around you think much more negatively of you. Again, it's more a problem of your intense ideological conflict with those close to you coming to the surface rather than some external online force having the power to "cancel" you.</TEXT>

Why do we need the police doing traffic enforcement? School hall monitoring? Mental health checks? Subway ticket checks? Noise complaints? Beat walking? And on and on. There are really only a very small number of tasks that require paramilitaries. Thus we defund the police and send those funds over to where they'll do more good.</TEXT>

There are a lot of things that you can say on online that can lead to a social media mob forming - remember GamerGate? It's an aspect of the medium not of "woke" ideology. I'm definitely with you in strongly opposing censorship and thinking that limitations on free speech inevitably get used against the left. But I'm not sure if working the refs is the same thing. The limitation on speech is the existence of these mainstream gatekeepers, not which exact views they decide to include or exclude. Thank god for the internet and how it makes them less relevant, but as long as we're there we might as well try to push them to the left.</TEXT>

Are these really situations where you think it would be good to bring a gun into the mix? They refuse to turn down the music so you... threaten to shoot them? Give them a ticket! The job of being a cop is not like being Spider-Man, they're not patrolling the streets and running into crimes. It's 99% bureaucratic rule enforcement in situations where the bureaucrat having a gun just makes things more dangerous for everybody.  gt;Car stops are extremely dangerous...you want unarmed civilians doing that with no powers of arrest? Similarly I'm trying to imagine the scenario where the cop having a gun helps here. So they tell someone to pull over - maybe that person refuses, but then obviously the cops shouldn't open fire on the highway. If they let themselves be pulled over they're apparently basically willing to cooperate, talk to them, give them a ticket or a warning or whatever... what's the problem?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Academics are firmly part of the working class. There are the occasional superstars who make good money, but the average professor is becoming ever more low-paid and precarious. They're not the most destitute people in society or anything, but obviously that's not the standard for who's in the working class. In fact academia is a particularly left-wing anti-capitalist segment of society - tough to think of one that is more so really. Obviously everyone's lives and ideas are shaped by the fact that we live in capitalism, but if anything that's less true for academics than people who work in the private sector. This isn't to say you should blindly trust the academic consensus on any given issue, just that you should *definitely* not do the opposite and assume that whatever academics think about something the real truth must be the opposite.</TEXT>

I think fines are a perfectly reasonable ways to control people's behavior in not too urgent or dangerous situations like playing music too loud. If someone repeatedly disobeys keep upping the fines. Everybody cares about money, no need to bring violence into the mix.  gt;Car stop? Why stop at all? A traffic agent is just a civilian who has no power to detain you. Try to imagine yourself in a world where traffic cops have been replaced by something more like parking attendants. You're speeding and one of them signals for you to pull over - do you lead them on a car chase? Or just pull over the same as you would now? If anything people would be more likely to pull over without the risk of getting shot or arrested in the process of being told to obey traffic laws. Or you're talking about getting beat up... once you've been pulled over they have your license plate number, what do you think is going to happen to someone who beats up the traffic attendant giving them a ticket? The idea that people doing generic public order tasks all need to be prepared to make arrests and use deadly force is silly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure how you got "There aren #8217;t any legal consequences" from this - for one thing a fine is an obvious legal consequence, and are the variety that are at least supposed to be used for these sorts of low level offenses already. Though I do agree we should really just wipe out a lot of low level offenses altogether - we've got libertarianism for the rich and a police state for the poor these days. For another it's perfectly consistent to have some more serious penalty waiting in the background if someone refuses to pay a ticket while not having the front line ticket giver be an armed paramilitary. You have yet to present a scenario where there would be any quality of life hit to pulling back the oppressive hand of the state a little from people's everyday lives. Unless someone is actively in the middle of a violent rampage they don't need a violent response from the government, and when violence is necessary it should be held to the minimum necessary level - meaning psych ward nurse style deescalating interventions rather than paramilitaries in most contexts. You have yet to come up with any scenario</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; There's a leap there from that specific definition of transphobic to "anti-trans." To quote the essay from her site - "of course trans rights are human rights and of course trans lives matter." This doesn't read like someone who is anti-trans. Robinson makes it sound like she's on the level with Ben Shapiro, but like, come on. Ben Shapiro is a repugnant hate monger. JK Rowling just... isn't. I certainly agree that Shapiro is a far more odious figure than Rowling overall, but isn't this his exact position on trans people? Shapiro:  gt; #8220;And I am not denying your humanity if you are a transgender person. I am saying that you are not the sex to which you claim to be. #8221; I don't think Shapiro or most other anti-trans activists would explicitly say that trans people's lives don't matter or that trans people shouldn't have human rights, they just share Rowling's objections to basing the social categories of "male" and "female" on something other than biological sex.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm a little confused by this bit of your reply:  gt;Despite her "Sex is real" tweet, she's also very clearly correctly gendering trans people correctly. See here:  gt;Months later, I compounded my accidental  #8216;like #8217; crime by following Magdalen Berns on Twitter. Magdalen was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian who was dying of an aggressive brain tumour. I followed her because I wanted to contact her directly, which I succeeded in doing. However, as Magdalen was a great believer in the importance of biological sex, and didn #8217;t believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises, dots were joined in the heads of twitter trans activists, and the level of social media abuse increased. Where in that passage does she gender a trans person correctly? I'm pretty sure Magdalen Berns was a cis-woman. Is it just that she says "trans women" near then end? I agree it's crazy to call someone a bigot for their sexual orientation - obviously it's physical characteristics and not internal self-identification that determine physical attraction. All of this "who would you personally be interested in having sex with" stuff seems like a distraction to me though. A brief look at Magadalen's wikipedia page shows that an unwillingness to have sex with anyone with a penis was not the main reason people called her a bigot:  gt;Speaking on the subject of gender and sexuality, Berns stated: "You don't get 'assigned' reproductive organs...males are defined by their biological sex organs. Likewise, homosexuals are people who are attracted to the same biological sex."[3] She described trans women as "blackface actors" and "men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women",[39] said that "trans women are men",[40] that "there is no such thing as a lesbian with a penis",[41] and that she'd "rather be rude than a fucking liar". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalen_Berns This is really a perfect example of the nonsense of this whole "cancel culture" debate - Berns says bigoted things, gets pushback online, Rowling pretends Berns only said much less bigoted things that she really did, and says therefore the pushback was an irrational woke cancel culture mob who could be coming for you next. Add up another ten similar examples and it's enough for most people online to not even bother looking into whether any one of them is actually valid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The American and UK liberal press and the Obama administration were actually very friendly to the Chavistas. That's a pretty crazy thing to say. The liberal press has had a no holds barred hate on for the Chavistas since day one. It's hard to find an article on Venezuela in these mainstream publications that doesn't refer to Maduro as a "dictator" - much less one that actually gives any airtime to the Chavista side of the argument.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This was an interesting read. I was with you all the way through this paragraph:  gt;When wealth generation becomes concentrated and restricted, public institutions start to struggle, people feel they have less opportunity, and social issues start to bubble up like the formation of outgroups of all kinds. A massive oversimplifation, I know, but a useful general framework to approaching issues that avoids (mis)placing blame on cultural degeneracy, "evil" corporations, or other common scapegoats that are largely symptoms of greater problems. But then I was very confused by this following one:  gt;Today, this mindset seems to align with the conservative right, but in the 1986 article it's the "liberal answer" to the problem of ghettos that I identify with: You're describing the left wing take on these issues... and then you say that mindset aligns with the conservative right? I don't *think* I would encounter any argument in saying that the left wing take is to blame social pathologies on wider economic problems and the right wing take is to blame economic problems on social pathologies? This is why left-wingers have demands like "Jobs not jails!" while right-wingers tend to oppose action to uplift the poor who they think should just try harder or evolve a better culture. Reminds me of all the left critiques in the last few years of how Hillbilly Elegy tried to explain Appalachian poverty on area's culture rather than the decline in good jobs, for example: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/hillbilly-elegy-review-jd-vance-national-review-white-working-class-appalachia/</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;This kind of misunderstanding is why I generally try to avoid using the left-right paradigm as much as possible and why using it here in the context of a discussion on 50+ years of political history was a mistake.  gt;...  gt;The point is - a balance between the pro-business and pro-regulation sides (right  amp; left) with robust debates on specific policies is probably a sign of a healthy national political conversation. Yeah the broad "left" and "right" terms are so contested that they sometimes obscure more than they clarify. The way I try to at least somewhat consistently use them is that "right-wing" means defending existing social hierarchies, while "left-wing" means flattening existing social hierarchies and moving society in a more egalitarian direction.  gt;But we seem to have fallen to a place where paths to success starting from the bottom are becoming very scarce, and so these debates don't matter as much until we can identify the root cause and start looking for deeper solutions. The broad strokes of the problem and solution seem relatively clear: there is inadequate demand for labor, so we need to pursue policies that bump up labor demand (or restrict supply). As you mentioned protectionism and immigration restrictions are potential policies would help with that, though perhaps a bit disruptive and circuitous relative to the more direct approach of state demand stimulus via traditional keynesian fiscal policy or more exotic approaches like a job guarantee.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Depends on who I am. If I'm me, some random guy in America, I probably focus on some activism regarding supply chains and on pushing the American government in a less imperialist direction. If I'm a worker in one of those countries I try to organize unions and achieve political power with a worker's party. If I'm the leader of a worker's party running a developing country I'd model my economic strategy on whichever fast growing East Asian country my country has the most in common with - China, South Korea, Taiwan, etc. with the exception that the role played in those economies by private businesses would be played by worker cooperatives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; does require access to greater levels of both economic and cultural capital. Greater than what? They certainly are not at the bottom of our society but having enough "economic and cultural capital" to become a professor obviously doesn't put you in the ruling class. There are plenty of unionized bus drivers out there who have a larger and more secure income than most professors - though of course less cultural influence. I'd agree academics are drawn more from the middle than the bottom, but since when is the middle class the ruling class around here? This kind of hair splitting within the working class (as defined by those who need to work to survive and thus firmly including most professors) is just another kind of idpol. All of us on the "supplier" rather than "buyer" end of the labor market have some serious shared interests and need to stick together. We certainly don't want to eject influential subgroups like academics whose cultural power is a very good thing to have in the coalition. And even more so we shouldn't assume something's a bad idea just because that influential portion of our coalition favors it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Those countries developed quickly by attracting capital to invest in them (often by ignoring workers rights and crushing unions to provide stability), used those wages to kickstart their internal economies with increased consumption and then went into a more technological direction. You can't really do the same thing with a socialist model because ownership of the means of production by the workers excludes capital investment to a significant degree. Very good point. I've thought about some kind of mixed system to remedy that issue. It's easy enough to mandate a minimum number of seats on a corporate board for worker reps - as in this plan from non-socialist Elizabeth Warren to have workers elect 40% of the boards of American corporations: https://www.vox.com/2018/8/15/17683022/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-corporations Something like that could be used in a similar way to how China and others have used requirements that foreign investors have local partners with a controlling interest for any investment. Say workers elect 60% of corporate boards... and then foreign capitalists are welcome to invest subject to the restriction that they'll be putting that investment in the hands of their new employees / partners.</TEXT>

That said it's perfectly plausible to just do some reading and gain a basic understanding of most issues without shelling out all the time and money for a degree in the relevant subject. Alternatively you can use the shortcut of just following the lead of some more knowledgeable person or institution that you trust.</TEXT>

If I was around back then I'd be one of the people saying "Listen, these mobs of angry poor people are really not as much of a crisis as their political adversaries are trying to make it sound. Sure nobody wants random people to get hurt by angry mobs, but if you really want to do something about that you should change the system that got them so angry in the first place rather than just denouncing mob violence."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. Whereas what I'd be looking for is a tuned *up* version of what already exists in Germany. Already the German model has some major benefits for workers relative to workers living in countries without codetermination (higher wages, more capital reinvested rather than distributed to shareholders, less outsourcing), and that's with the German version being specifically designed to keep the elected worker board reps as far away from day to day decision making as possible (they are on the supervisory board that chooses the management board that actually runs the company). A version with a higher percentage of worker board members and some tweaks to maximize rather than minimize practical worker control is clearly feasible and would have even more of an impact.</TEXT>

You're more free when employed at a unionized workplace than a non-unionized one. When unions are not compelled, a majority of workplaces end up being non-union - meaning any individual who is hired at one of those workplaces is just as compelled not to join a union as an individual hired at a place that requires they join a union is compelled to join a union. The theoretical "choice" of being able to start up a pro-union campaign runs into the practical reality of that being a huge and incredibly difficult project that most people don't actually have the capacity to accomplish. Thus by mandating unions we hugely increase the actual practical freedom of everyone who works for a living and isn't already unionized.</TEXT>

This is a very interesting paragraph to read once we're thinking about it from a conspiratorial perspective:  gt;Indeed, there was something bizarre about that entire three-week period when the parties were trying to negotiate a settlement. Cipel #8217;s demands changed several times, and at some point during negotiations McGreevey #8217;s representatives contacted the FBI. Why would they do that unless they thought they were being extorted or believed they were being set up #8212;that perhaps the whole thing was a sting? And as if to illustrate how tenuous a grip each side had on what was going on, there was the episode involving a lawyer and supposed friend of Cipel #8217;s, who showed up for the negotiations and sat at the table, without anyone knowing who he was. Each side assumed he was with the other team.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Our economy is not a strategy game where upon hearing "Research Complete" you get new shiny solar panels instead of ugly cooling towers. Moving all our power industry to "green" is essentially the same as "deindustrialization". I'm trying to find some way to steelman this into not being nonsense but am coming up empty. What are you saying? Obviously it's possibly to install way more non-fossil fuel energy production capacity without "deindustrializing."  gt;Decades long shouting over each other rather. Not many environmentalists are fans of nuclear, and if someone like Trump would embrace it, we would see a lot of "Westinghouse pushes Nuclear as a diversion against the true reform" articles. Again, what are you getting at here? Yes this is a controversial issue, and within the environmentalist movement there's a lot of argument about what role nuclear should or shouldn't play in this. None of that contradicts that the goal of that movement and the goal advocated by this article is to find viable ways to replace our current carbon-intensive energy system.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Solar is less efficient, depends on such factors as daylight, full transition to it would require massive investments on the scale of trillions... All of that is common knowledge. Less efficient in what sense? Obviously there's a major sense in which it's more efficient in that it doesn't require using up any fuel. Clearly a full transition would indeed be very expensive... that's what this is all about, that we need to organize that kind of big expensive transition before it's too late. Fortunately there's some movement in that direction already since even in the current regime we're seeing renewable prices dip ever farther below coal prices.  gt;Coal plants and natural-gas processing plants are only the top of the iceberg, the whole sectors of mining and industry support it, by dismantling them you wreck those industries as well. We don't need so many coders. Oh is this what you mean by deindustrialization? You were mentioning primitivism earlier so I assumed it was a more literal "no longer be industrialized" version of that word rather than just "we need to replace a big chunk of our industrial sector with a somewhat different industry."  gt;You could say that building up renewable industries would create as many jobs and wealth, but it's like arguing that destroying your new house and building up an even newer shinier house instead would benefit GDP. Hmm I guess I agree that tearing down our current energy system and replacing it with a new renewable one should not be justified in terms of benefit to GDP any more than tearing down and replacing your house should be. But fortunately that's not an argument anyone's making. Instead they're saying "this current system is causing a lot of harm so let's replace it." It's sort of like if your current house was emitting toxic fumes that bothered you and your neighbors - you should replace it to solve that problem. Your critique sort of reads like someone saying "No! Don't destroy that house, we won't have anywhere to live!"  gt;What about developing nations? Can they allow such transition? I'm not sure that harm to the global economy from climate change would be bigger than from this kind of wild schemes. As I think is already apparent from your own concern about what will happen to old coal plants and mining infrastructure and such, developing nations actually have it somewhat easier on this. The less fossil fuel infrastructure you already have lying around the less of a problem all those sunk costs are for transitioning to renewable infrastructure. And of course they have a major incentive to since they're already the ones with the toughest time affording to import fossil fuels.  gt;In fact, you could see a glimpse of what could happen if we give a green light to radical environmentalists with COVID; and the long-term impact on the economy isn't even clear at this point. This is again something that's explicitly addressed in the article - COVID shows the bankruptcy of one version of "radical environmentalism" - the one that shames people about their personal choices - by showing that even all of us collectively staying home for a few months doesn't get us close to a solution. Meanwhile COVID tells us nothing about the kind of transformation of the energy sector the piece advocates for.  gt;This article is a blunt political propaganda, just look at this passage: It definitely makes a strong political pitch, but I would try to distinguish between "political propaganda" in the sense of coming up with whatever arguments you need to support a give political candidate, and articles like this that are mainly a discussion of a real world problem that also includes some information about who to vote for if you want to solve that problem. It's the ideal good type of political content really - not propaganda for one side but not pretending there isn't a difference between the sides either.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This seems backwards - on the one hand union leaders tend to be more "woke" than their memberships, while on the other hand what we see on the ground is a lot of interest in DSA from union members and very little from union leaders. I think there's something to that kind of "woke vs blue collar" culture clash in terms of DSA's ability to bring in members who aren't young well educated people, it's just not relevant to the union endorsement situation. New York unions endorse very woke candidates all the time as long as they are approved by the local political machine.</TEXT>

Having said that, yes clearly wanting to bust any union, including a police union, is an anti-union stance. You could well be very pro-union in other contexts and just want to bust police (or teacher) unions but there are obvious pro and anti union sides to a discussion of "should these workers be unionized?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha the COVID analogy does not help much because from my perspective you're making all the same errors in that context as you're making in the climate change context.  gt;Sweden and Belarus fare not worse or better than the rest of the world. But we had a lot of ugly politicking around the issue. In the end vaccines will be developed and distributed. Just to do a quick fact check of the above, let me note Sweden's death rate compared to neighboring countries with different policies: ["Sweden #8217;s per capita death rate was 35 per 100,000 as of May 15. Meanwhile, Denmark #8217;s death rate was 9.3 per 100,000, Finland #8217;s 5.2 and Norway #8217;s 4.7."](https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2020/07/03/covid-19-deaths-in-sweden/). Also worth noting that despite its light quarantine regime Sweden's economy contracted by [8.6%](https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/gdp-growth) last quarter, compared to a US decline of [9.5%.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/30/896714437/3-months-of-hell-u-s-economys-worst-quarter-ever) And then there's this for the rest of Europe:  gt;EU average: -11.9 Belgium: -12.2 Czechia: -8.4 Germany: -10.1 Spain: -18.5 France: -13.8 Italy: -12.4 Latvia: -7.5 Lithuania: -5.1 Austria: -10.7 Portugal: -14.1 So far it seems to me like strict lockdowns do barely any additional damage to the economy beyond what pandemic conditions do anyway without any government response, but do play a role in reducing spread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>... I'm sorry but doesn't that completely refute your point? You criticize government interventions to prevent the spread of covid, asking "Was the harm to the economy (and thus human welfare) justified though?" but it turns out that the country you point to as one where the government didn't intervene as much suffered about as bad an economic contraction as everywhere else. It turns out there wasn't much of a harm to the economy from government anti-covid interventions at all. And meanwhile it does seem that those interventions help to reduce the infection rate.</TEXT>

In some cities when homicide detectives are called in from being off duty they first have to go in to the station, pick up their police car, and then go to the crime scene. In others they are allowed to take their police car home with them and go directly to the crime scene from home. Apparently cities that allow them to go directly from home to the crime scene have significantly better murder solve rates. Obviously there's nothing that significant the city limits in particular, but I think anything we can do to make cops live closer to where they work will produce good results, and this would have that effect.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The early Christian Church, prior to Constantine, was essentially a cross-cut of the urban classes. The most prominent members were well-to-do members of the urban  #8216;middle class, #8217; but the social hierarchy of the Church generally extended downward from them into the urban underclass, rather than upwards into the elite. Far from being a late arrival, our  #8216;average Roman cobbler #8217; was a prototypical early urban convert to Christianity. What the early Church lacked were the true elites as well as a strong presence in the rural countryside. https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/ It's fascinating how much continuity there is in how reformist ideological movements spread through society.

    <TEXT> gt; This has no continuity with wokeism, which is clearly the ideology of the elite. Protestantism I have little idea about, but I'm pretty sure that was heavily backed by the elite of the day in the countries where it flourished and was mostly geopolitical. See this is another fascinating parallel - you are making the same argument about wokeism that this article is devoted to chastising when applied to early Christianity. From this first paragraph:  gt;In particular, Sohrab Ahmari made the claim that, prior to the conversion of Constantine, Christianity was a religion of the  #8220;elite, #8221; and that it was only after Constantine that the  #8220;average Roman cobbler #8221; might have converted. This does not reflect what we know of the early Church. This is then disputed with a description of who the elite were:  gt;A (very brief) word about what  #8216;elite #8217; means here. When we talk about elites in the Roman Empire, we can mean a few things. We can mean the imperial elite, the equestrian and senatorial orders in Rome, who controlled the mechanisms of empire and reaped the benefits; a super-elite, if you will. We can also mean local elites. Most government in the Roman world remained fundamentally local. We sometimes refer to these folks as the  #8216;curial #8217; class because they held positions as town councilors (curiales or decuriones). Those were almost always the richest and most powerful men in the community (and their families), at least until the fourth century when the burdens of holding such offices made it convenient for those who could to seek exemption. Great wealth in the Roman Empire, be it local or on an imperial scale, almost always meant large agricultural estates. And then a description of who the actual early Christians were:  gt;Christian catacomb tomb inscriptions in Rome show exactly the sort of  #8216;middle-class #8217; urban artisans we would expect  #8211; the sort of men and women who were not elites themselves, but made a living supplying the needs of the elites. These are, as Brown puts it,  #8220;women as weavers of silk #8230;men as makers of mirrors #8230;barbers with their instruments #8230;grooms leading fine horses #8221; (Brown (2014), 37). Dare we say it  #8211; cobblers making shoes? And indeed it makes sense that the early Christians were not so elite as all that, since their dogma involved condemnations of wealth and the elite:  gt;Consider  #8220;But woe to you who are rich #8221; (Luke 6:24) or  #8220;Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith #8230;.is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? #8221; (James 2:5). Or  #8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus #8221; (Galatians 3:28). The appeal to the marginalized is fairly obvious. All of the above seems to parallel pretty precisely the shape of the "woke" movement in our society. Much like early Christianity and early Protestantism it finds its core base of support in the middle classes - those with enough resources to spare the time to think about lofty religious/ideological issues, but not so many that they don't feel the appeal of denouncing the existing social order. Your depiction of wokeism as an elite ideology makes the same mistake as the description of early Christianity as an elite ideology - conflating that urban middle class with the elite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;But I don't actually think "secular humanists" have enough of a coherent, common creed to be considered one group. Basically, if you're an atheist or an agnostic and you think ethics, if it exists, is human- (or sentient-being-) centered and grounded in the material world then you're a secular humanist. I basically agree with that definition. I might then describe "wokeism" as the particular secular humanist ideology that is having such success these days, both within the pool of secular humanists, and by jumping to and converting non-secular humanists, like how Christianity was a current within Judaism that managed to jump over and start converting gentiles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Certainly it didn't come from within any sort of organized atheist movement, but I'd describe organized atheism as being pretty marginal within the larger context of modern secular humanism. A pretty huge proportion of the population, including many who theoretically claim to be religious, have an essentially secular humanist outlook. Even among out and out atheists the organized atheist movement isn't anything like the kind of force that organized religion is among religious people. I would say it started in secular humanism in the sense that it is firmly grounded in secular humanist justifications rather than religious justifications, which is a pretty big shift. I might describe it as the application of secular thinking that had gained confidence in areas where religion doesn't even try to give any answers being applied to cultural areas that were traditionally the preserve of religion.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't see what you find so implausible about an ideological movement that isn't a puppet for some power center. It's helpful to think of it memetically - Christianity was a very memetically potent set of ideas for that time and place, with a natural tendency to spread and convince people. We've seen this exact thing happen with Christianity in other more recent contexts - think about how it spread in 1500s Japan before being decisively crushed by the state in a way the Romans never quite managed, or how it's even now spreading in China despite opposition from their government.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I guess that's what I'm talking about when I say that even many religious people have an essentially secular humanist outlook - you could call them religious humanists. They're basically what you get when religion has to adapt to survive in a memetic environment with very powerful secular humanist memes bouncing around that eat traditional religion for breakfast. It's either that or go fundamentalist and try to close believers off from those external memes entirely, which in its way can be as disruptive as letting them in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; What about rich people? Randomly googling for the richest Americans seems to show that the vast majority of them either donated to the Democrats directly, or to some woke-coded causes such as lgbt issues. Some seemed to have little political activity or donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past. Just from a cursory glance I did not find clear-cut conservatives. (Although I know they presumably exist i.e. the Koch brothers, but even those seem more libertarian than conservative.) I guess thinking that randomly googling famous rich people was a good way to get to the bottom of this issue was probably where you went wrong. It's basically a sampling issue - the minority of rich people who have liberal politics that will make them popular with the masses are very public about it, while the conservative majority mostly keeps quiet and we only hear about the ones doing truly gigantic stuff behind the scenes like the Koch brothers. Here's a bit more info:  gt;SG: One of the most striking points you make is that the picture we sometimes get of billionaires isn #8217;t representative. There aren #8217;t a handful of left-leaning billionaires, like Soros and Buffett, and a handful of right-wing billionaires, like the Mercers and the Kochs. The vast majority are extremely right-wing, particularly on economic issues. Can you talk about that? How does reality diverge from popular perception?  gt;ML: One reason we think stealth politics is an alarming phenomenon, from the perspective of upholding democracy, is that if a regular citizen were to try and determine what billionaires want from politics based on what they hear those billionaires say in public, they might not be so alarmed. Because publicly, billionaires align themselves more with policies most Americans want.  gt;However, what we discovered is that that picture is not accurate. You have some very outspoken billionaires who tend to support popular economic policies, like Warren Buffet or George Soros, but they are not representative of the group as a whole, which tends to be rather fiscally conservative. We think that creates a misleading situation for voters.  gt;You mentioned the Kochs. We do know about the Kochs  #8212; we know that the Koch brothers are very conservative and very active. But that #8217;s a result of really difficult and excellent journalistic work done by folks like Jane Mayer and some academic researchers. Prior to that, they actually fit the model of politics we described. They tried to stay out of the limelight, and then when they were in the limelight they would say really vague things very few people would disagree with  #8212; for example, that they support economic freedom.  gt;We suspect there are a lot of other billionaires whose actions, while not as prominent and dramatic as the Kochs, have done these sorts of things and escaped public scrutiny. https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/07/billionaires-and-stealth-politics So yes, by "the elite" I mean the literal elite, the equivalent to the Roman landholder classes. The middle class have a disproportionate influence over the culture, since they are largely the ones creating and consuming it, but ultimately they work for the owner class. Of course none of this is to say that there aren't plenty of "woke" people in the owner class, or even that the owner class can't be generally more woke than the population at large. Again, look at the Roman example - that's what happened after Constantine. The Christianity of the middle class was eventually taken up in modified form by the elite, and then took a lot longer to replace paganism among the actual majority of the population - countryside dwellers. If you want to argue that we are well into the period where the true elite are being converted by wokeism that's very reasonable. The key difference is that all of these ideological movements - early Christianity, early Protestantism, wokeism, really were ideological movements that gained ground by being convincing to converts, who eventually included the rich, as opposed to being some kind of project of the rich.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're taking a somewhat more narrow view of the definition of "wokeism" here than I am. I'm putting it alongside the rise of Christianity or the Protestant Reformation in terms of being a serious development in our ideological structure. A good definition might be something like a secular belief in the fundamental dignity and equality of all humans - basically a big chunk of the Christian ideological package with the supernatural bits filed off and the "all human beings" explicitly including foreigners, women and sexual minorities. I think the "wokeism" you're referring to, and maybe how that term is used more often around here, is a more intense strain of that ideology, with a "no tolerance for intolerance" sort of attitude towards suspected unbelievers and heretics. If anybody is a Hard Core History fan I highly recommend the Prophets of Doom episode: https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/ It's very interesting listening to his depiction of the Protestant Reformation, and this one particular extreme outgrowth of it, with the modern woke reformation parallels in mind. Revolutions in modes of thought sort of pull the rug out from under people and can lead to a lot of weird excesses, like what happened in Munster, but ultimately that sort of thing isn't what defines the larger transformation any more than the Protestant Reformation is defined by Munster's millennial preachers (see isn't it hilarious how this stuff rhymes? Millennials... couldn't make it up if you tried). As for the issue of how woke or not the rich are: my point is not to argue that there aren't plenty of woke rich people. I don't think we quite have the numbers on how "woke" overall the rich are relative to the general population. We do have the data that they're a lot more conservative than the general population, but as you say that is likely more about wanting to protect their money. My point is that woke ideology flows outward from the middle class, not down from the rich, much as Christianity and Protestantism did. In a sense it actually fits well with your "the real elite is the cultural elite" take - the rich are just downstream recipients of the culture like the rest of us. The trouble is they do still dominate our economic and social life and won't really be persuaded by any cultural development to go too much against their own interests.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Nothing convinces people better than power. And really you can't get people to defy power without being a rival power. My understanding is that the Roman leadership weren't particularly concerned about the spread of Christianity at first, and then by the time they were worried and tried seriously persecuting the Christians the community was large enough to be its own power center - powerful enough at least to avoid annihilation. But then we still really need some of this "memetic effectiveness" concept to explain how 5-10% of the population managing to not get genocided out of existence grows to become the dominant group in society. I think people on the anti-woke side don't want to look at it this way because it's more comforting to think of "wokeness" as this 'other' ideology being perpetrated by sinister elites rather than a more 'natural' development that is spreading through the population based on some kind of objectively superior memetic fitness. And really that's not how the woke would tend to see it either, though maybe they'd like it better if I phrased it as "Your ideas are more convincing and when people hear them they tend to be drawn in that direction, meaning you'll likely ultimately win out."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who are you defining as the elite? It's obviously a pretty disputed term - for this purposes I'm thinking of the modern equivalent of this group:  gt;A (very brief) word about what  #8216;elite #8217; means here. When we talk about elites in the Roman Empire, we can mean a few things.

And that's the elite that I think really dominates economic and social life sufficiently to warrant the term. So if we're talking about that elite I think we can pretty definitively say that none of these movements - Christianity, Protestantism, wokeism, originated in the elite. So what's this separate "cosmopolitan elite" that you're referring to?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Well that would be a trivial and useless concept that explains nothing so in pursuit of an explanation the concept has been rescued and defined as "the machinery involved in propaganda dissemination," i.e. the original definition which was the acedemy, media, and education system. Well yeah no one was saying the neoreactionaries have a smart analysis. Certainly the academy, media and education systems are mechanisms for cultural transmission. But when you're looking at multi-century long cultural processes this conspiratorial "the change must have a cause, look for someone who made a decision to cause that change" way of thinking if not very effective. Nobody thought to themselves "let's implement a vast project of cultural transformation" and then executed that plan. Changes have causes of course, but we should be looking for causes like we do in biological evolution - changes in climate or predation, or just internal competition for mates, results in some new adaptation. Big changes are clearly possible by that evolutionary mechanism without being planned or decided upon by anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very good points. We need to think about this in the context of cultural evolution. If the environment has been stable for a long period of time then people's traditional ways of dealing with that environment will probably have adapted to the point where almost any change makes things worse. But then if the environment changes or those people move into a new environment their traditions won't be so well adapted and will need to change. Of course when traditions do start to change in response to a new environment you get a lot of pushback from people doubting whether that change is actually adaptive. Ultimately though this is a decentralized process of people figuring out what behaviors are going to serve them and adopting those behaviors. Turns out you can go ahead and violate old sexual purity norms now that we have contraceptives and antibiotics, so then people stop putting so much stock in those norms, so it goes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The "Democrats have been moving right" concept is a bit out of date. They certainly moved way right on economics after the sixties or so, but I'd say they bottomed out around the 2000s and have been trending back left since then. Maybe there's some chance that the Republicans will follow them in that direction and become a little more pro-worker than they are now, but there's not really any scenario in which the parties flip and the Republicans end up more pro-worker than the Democrats.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The texan rule punishes kids who go to good schools and creates a perverse incentive to avoid them (which has been observed). It's funny I've always thought of that incentive as one of the top benefits of that system. It helps reverse the whole "got to move to a good neighborhood to send my kids to a good school" incentive that causes so many problems. I'd guess even with this rule most parents would prefer to send their kids to better resourced schools with higher achieving students, but it would be nice to have something pushing the other way.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;My understanding is that you'd mostly game the system only if you wanted to get into UT Austin. But if every university exclusively relied on highschool scores, I expect we really would see a big exodus from the decent schools. So in practice this would mean lots of parents moving their families to poorer areas where their kids will be bigger fish academically? I can see the incentive it would be create to do so, but there are a enough incentives pushing in the other direction that "exodus" seems a little strong. But again, to the extent that happened it would be fantastic! One of the biggest things schools in poor areas need are savvy, privileged parents who will hold the school to account in the interests of their own children's educations. And beyond the schools the presence of those families will benefit their new communities - or perhaps their old communities, since a lot of parents in that category may be ones who under the current system would bail on their poor community but under this rule would stick it out.  gt;This is what is important. But like bussing, it would be very unpopular and I don't see what it achieves. Why would it be unpopular? Most people's experience with it would their kids suddenly having a better chance of getting into schools because the admissions aren't so concentrated at the 'best' schools. Then they might see some people showing up at their schools who otherwise would have gone to their 'better' schools - so what? And of course the people switching schools to game this system have no cause to complain. The existing elite cohort who would now have a harder time getting into top schools would be worse off, but they'll be fine.</TEXT>

Seems like the obvious response to this is questioning why we'd be worried about random people kidnapped by a serial killer turning on and killing each other after escaping from him. Even if you don't believe that *all* racial animosity is driven by capitalist inequality, I think it's safe to assume that a making society more equal overall would do some amount of good in reducing racial conflict. We should of course be wary of racial biases in the way the proposed universal programs are administered, but it's not like there's a risk of implementing those programs taking us a less racially egalitarian place than we are currently.</TEXT>

In a country where the general population turned against welfare because of the perception that minorities are abusing it, what makes you think racial animosity will go away if economic inequality is taken care of? So your concern actually is that implementing universalist pro-worker policy will worsen race relations in the US?

Here's a bit more on that topic if that's not something you're familiar with: https://truthout.org/articles/how-capitalism-and-racism-support-each-other/ So your take that it's the opposite - that pushing back against capitalist oppression will actually make racism worse - seems very off to me.</TEXT>

Remember the issue was that you were concerned that if we don't defeat racism before defeating capitalism the races will "turn on each other." Without that you don't have much of an argument left against the "let's focus on the big capitalism related problems we all share" take. Even with its limitations the New Deal was an incredibly positive development even for partially excluded racial minorities, and of course the non-racially exclusive universal programs that "class reductionists" are arguing for now would be even better.</TEXT>

So don't try that Uno Reversal shit when you haven't even thought it through. What is this supposed to mean? The equivalent would be someone in a socialist group saying "racism is good!" which would indeed get someone shouted down even in the most "class reductionist" of groups.  gt;What they're saying is "you don't need to talk about racism because talking about capitalism is more important" which is idiotic. This is closer but not quite there. The core "class reductionist" point is that our problem is that our social system inevitably produces an impoverished underclass, not what the racial breakdown of that group is relative to wider society. Trying to solve that kind of problem with anti-racism is like pushing on a string - no matter how hard you push on racialized fixes it doesn't bring any force to bear on the actual problem. Meanwhile coming at the problem from a class angle and trying to directly solve people's problems does a lot of good on race without even trying to, since the disproportionately non-white underclass disproportionately benefits.</TEXT>

Each cop who feels a little more of a connection to the city and a little less like they're a soldier going into enemy territory when they go to work is a victory. Plus I think there's a selection effect where the kind of new cop hires who would most be turned off by having to live in the city are the ones I least want to get hired. Obviously this is a pretty small action in the grand scheme of getting the NYPD under control, but I can see some pretty clear benefits and no drawbacks so why not?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The "leg I am standing on" is the fact that you are drawing a correlation without proof, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Isn't that what you're doing with the 'watch out, overthrowing capitalism may read to race war' take? I think there's a general correlation between fixing class issues and fixing racism - look at how we got the civil rights movement at the time when we had the least class inequality and how Trump is rising today after a few decades of neoliberalism. But really that concept is not required at all for me to believe that class issues are where we can make the most positive change, I just brought it up because I was so disturbed to see you seemingly making the opposite claim, that you're hesitant to work on fixing class issues because you're concerned it would make racism worse.  gt;Yes, because we currently live in a racist country (again, a statement that most Americans agree with now), and shuffling around financial value won't magically change that. Your big solution is that "fixing class issues will also fix race issues" and you have no proof to this, as evidenced by the fact that fixing class issues in the past DID NOT FIX RACE ISSUES. My position is that we should fix class issues because those are the most important issues to fix. One of the many benefits of fixing those issues would be a likely reduction in racial tensions, but they'd be worth fixing even without that aspect. What concerns me is seeing people using race issues as an excuse to not tackle class issues - it seems foolish both for how it prioritizes race over class, and for how it ignores the historic synergy between making progress on both of those issues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;If you show up to a socialist meeting and say "don't talk about race, just talk about class" you are basically doing the same thing as showing up to a BLM rally and saying "m4a is bad". This is because socialism is about hierarchies and not just about economics, so it's not like a socialist meeting is purely about class issues. I know metaphors are hard, you should probably stop trying to use them. Socialism is of course a broad movement, but clearly class is a lot more central to its critique of the social order than race.  gt; "Capitalism produces an underclass, therefore we need to stop talking about the ways in which a democratized economy could produce an underclass for different reasons." That sounds like a fun conversation, and is one I've literally never seen anyone having. Any articles or what have you could point me to about what the dynamics of race would be in a democratized economy?  gt;It's very bizarre to use the fact that class analysis could "do a lot of good on race without even trying to" to argue, essentially, that you shouldn't actually try to do good on race. Believe it or not, it is actually completely possible to address two problems at once! Especially bizarre since as mentioned previous attempts to correct class issues in this country have been shunted off into race antagonism and you assume this will simply not happen anymore. What does "do good on race" mean to you? From my perspective the only political issue where it makes sense to organize around race is explicit discrimination - there is such a thing as having different rules for different races, and that's unacceptable and needs to be fought on the basis of anti-racism. With that largely accomplished our "race" discourse has shifted to being more about how the harms of capitalism fall disproportionately on different races - some are overrepresented among the rich, some among the poor. But the problem there is the existence of that "poor" category that it sucks to be in, not who exactly is in it. Centering the problem of poverty around "more of this group is poor than that group" is actively counterproductive to putting together a coalition capable of doing something about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Why wouldn't they feel like they're going into "enemy territory" if they are going from Staten Island or similar to the South Bronx? Pat Lynch, the NYPD Union Boss and giant asshole, lives in Bayside. Sure, he technically lives in NYC but he most definitely feels like he would be going into "enemy territory." Every little bit helps. Sure this rule might push some people to move to those cop neighborhoods instead of somewhere out of town, but it is also going to push some people who don't like the city out of the recruitment pool altogether - and those are the people I don't want as cops. That brings us nicely to your next point about recruitment shortages - these are pretty good jobs and it's a big city. This restriction would just give a boost to the part of the applicant pool that doesn't hate the city they're patrolling.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It turns out that a huge proportion of online advertising spending is wasted. To use a prominent example here, ebay was spending millions to make sure an ad for ebay was at the top of google search results for "ebay" and it turns out that all they were doing was getting people who would have clicked on the naturally occurring free link to instead click on a paid link. It's amazing that so many huge companies can be blowing so much money on this stuff without good reason to think it works.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Man you are just exhaustingly bad-faith. I really don't feel like I am but maybe we are talking past each other. Let's try to set out our premises here. What do you think of these statements: There is not any conflict between promoting racial justice and promoting economic justice, and that indeed efforts to promote one tend to help with promoting the other. Even if racial discrimination completely vanished blacks would stay at the bottom by inertia. [Even without a racial element families tend to perpetuate their class status over many many generations](https://theweek.com/speedreads/627278/florence-same-wealthiest-families-600-years). Most of the harm racism does is mediated through class. The problem for black people in America is not that life is much worse for a black person than for a white person of the same class, the problem is black people are disproportionately lower class. Are there any of those you'd dispute?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The purpose of socialism is to dismantle hierarchy not to specifically dismantle class. If it was only about "dismantling class" there would be no need for it to be internationalist. A Strasserite can dismantle class. A socialist dismantles hierarchy. They are not the same, and if you think they are, you can't complain about being called a Nazbol. Which you are. Not sure how to respond to this except to wonder where you're getting these definitions. I hate to be the "according to the dictionary" guy but here's the full Merriam Webster definition:  gt;1: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods  gt;2a: a system of society or group living in which there is no private property  gt;b: a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state  gt;3: a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism Or how about wikipedia:  gt;Socialism is a political, social, and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers' self-management of enterprises. It includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. I'm not sure how you're defining "Nazbol" either but I guess I'll go ahead and be insulted to be called one anyway since I assume that's the purpose of accusing someone of being a cross between the Nazis and the Bolsheviks. Feels like it's probably a little excessive as a term to describe one side of the debate of how to create a multi-racial democratic socialist workers' movement.  gt;Congratulations, it is the very conversation we're having right now, and you are the one saying that. That is what you are saying. I cannot make it clearer that the person saying "we need to stop talking about race problems that might still arise even post-capitalism" is you. Except you haven't actually said anything about what racial problems might arise post-capitalism or how to deal with them, you've just brought up the possibility of such problems in arguing against a race-neutral approach to defeating capitalism. It feels more like an attempt to stop one discussion than an attempt to start a different one. Have you come across any actual speculation or discussion of what race would look like in a post-capitalist America?  gt;See? Perfect example. Thank you for your cooperation. "The only time it makes sense to organize around race is when it's too obvious to ignore or pretend it's something else." Congratulations on having the faux-color-blind mentality of a Boomer middle-manager, my dude! The next line in your script is "I don't care if you're white or black or purple". You are worse than useless. At least I've gone from a Nazi to just a color-blind middle manager! Though that's a strange comparison - corporate America and its army of middle managers are way way more comfortable with organizing around race than around class. Half the Fortune 500 are putting up "BLM" signs, none are advocating for class struggle. So if I were to be equivalently rude I could say "Congratulations on having the faux-progressive mentality of a Boomer middle-manager, my dude!" It's a lot easier for the elite to make themselves feel better with superficial anti-racism than it is for them to take real material action that would benefit the disproportionately non-white poor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well yes, I think racism is a real issue too, just not single most important issue in our society like class.  gt;The entire premise of your ideological viewpoint seems to be that the inverse of this would work. That's the reason you're saying we don't need to talk about race, dipshit. Well no, I'm saying class is the huge problem that we need to focus on solving. One of the many benefits of doing so is the potential improvement of race relations, but it would still be plenty justified to keep class at the center of our politics if that correlation didn't exist. The part where it can seem like I'm saying not to talk about race is when pushing back on the all too common error of people thinking that because class related problems hit different races disproportionately that those problems must have some race-related solution. Whether the problem you're concerned about is food insecurity, homelessness, police brutality, unemployment or whatever, the sensible way to attack that issue is by directly attacking it, not by trying to find some over-complicated way to reduce the disparity between how much each race experiences that problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure what this "doesn't matter what excuse" device is supposed to demonstrate. None of this is actually convincing me that it's a bad idea to hire cops from high crime areas. It seems like in both scenarios your concern is that people who grow up in high crime areas will be corrupt if we let them become cops. But I can as easily make the opposite case, that it'll work out much better: Yes let's say socioeconomic struggle as the reason for concentrations of crime. If I suddenly incentivize a law enforcement career for people who grew up in an economy stacked against them, I will give those people jobs and create law enforcers who understand and sympathize with the people upon whom they're enforcing those laws. They're better able to serve and protect the community, and that's why we end up with less crime.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From what I understand this is a statement against the government's incompetence and corruption, and saying that the solution is to vote for this new left of the PSUV formation that will solve those problems while not handing the country over to the imperialists. Hard to say if it has a serious chance of doing so, but they're who I'd vote for if I was in Venezuela.</TEXT>

It's way too easy to say "this isn't the time to split the revolution's ranks" for decades and then end up with a decaying gerontocracy of party bureaucrats who have come totally disconnected from the people they're supposed to represent. Venezuela has been under continuous attack by the West and its own 5th columnists for nearly 20 years and there's no end in sight, are they supposed to just put democracy on hold indefinitely?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You seem to be starting with the assumption "effective taxation is impossible" and working back from there - you can't decide whether they'll avoid it or do less business in response but the one thing you're sure of is it won't raise any money? Your concern is actually addressed in the article:  gt;Other legislators are fearful that collecting this tax will cause businesses to flee our state, workers #8217; 401K #8217;s to lose money, and the New York Stock Exchange to leave Manhattan. New York adopted this tax in 1905, (New York Tax Law  #167; 270.1), despite threats from the New York Stock Exchange that it would then immediately move to New Jersey. And in all this time the Stock Exchange has never left New York. The London Stock Exchange collects a significant stock transfer tax #8212;and, regardless, continues to flourish mightily. Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore and France also have stock transfer taxes. It cannot seriously be claimed that if New York collected the stock transfer tax, that the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX and NASDAQ would all flee into cyberspace. After all, stocks are already traded electronically, and New York is increasingly effective in collecting state taxes on online purchases made out-of-state. In terms of the general question of reducing government spending - it depends on what the spending is on I suppose. There are certainly some things the government spends money on I don't think we need to bother with, but there are plenty of other things I wish they'd spend more on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah I agree the distinction Haider was drawing between his own position and Reed's was somewhat unclear. Seems to be for the most part agreeing with Reed's "anti-idpol" critique in terms of the need for much more of a class analysis than mainstream liberal anti-racist discourse allows, but disagreeing with the stronger version that says anti-racism is inherently in opposition to class analysis. If I'm reading it right I'd say I basically share that position. I'd almost want to call the "strong version" above a straw man but of course there are people out there who believe it. Possibly a [weak man](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Weak-Men-Are-Superweapons)?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Basically true, but this isn't really the kind of talking point we should be busting out right now. It's ceding too much ground to the delusional "the deficit is a big problem" crowd. What people need to understand is that for the past few decades we've had much more of a problem with deficits being too low than too high.</TEXT>

Haha Cuomo is about as far from a die-hard Democrat as you will ever see while remaining part of the Democratic Party.

    <TEXT>Looks like you are disagreeing with the data on that. The high levels of vacancies in those new "luxury" units is certainly a problem, but it's a problem in that it reduces how much good that new development does in increasing supply and bringing down prices. It's an argument for policies like a vacancy tax, not giving up on increasing supply altogether.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got it. But that doesn't really argue against new development reducing prices does it? 7% over 5 years is a pretty slow rate of rent increase by modern American standards. Seems perfectly plausible that rents would be significantly higher in the absence of the new development you're seeing. That's certainly how it's been going in a lot of places that have much higher rent increases alongside a shortfall of new construction.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not sure what you mean by "ends the conversation" - I assume this article is just one part of an ongoing conversation. I think the points you're making are very reasonable as arguments that allowing additional market rate construction is not going to lower rents much on the low end of the market in the short term - and I'd completely agree with you on that. But the policy debate people are actually having is the extent to which this sort of development should be allowed / encouraged, not whether it is a silver bullet for housing affordability. The fact that a new apartment building in a neighborhood decreases rather than increases rents in that area means there is no justification for opposing new apartment buildings. Meanwhile in the likely event that even a maximalist YIMBY plan would not immediately fix housing affordability at the low end, we need additional policies beyond pro-development ones to maintain and expand the affordable housing stock.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trump seems to have basically inherited the slow and steady growth economy of the Obama years, but came in at the tail end when the economy was finally starting to get back up to capacity. Obama's big failing was not managing a normal recovery where the economy gets back to trend. Trump's best move economically was blowing up the deficit via tax cuts, which is good for growth, but of course was the least efficient possible way of spending all that money. The good scenario for Biden would be if he's similarly heedless of the deficit, but spends money on public goods rather than just handing it to the rich.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say the slow recovery was more about inadequate stimulus, for which there is a lot of blame to go around in DC. But in terms of partisan politics, it's just a fact that Democrats were pushing more stimulus and Republicans less, so while the Dems didn't go nearly far enough they still look good by comparison. I'm not sure what you're saying the "regulation and tax cuts" explain - the economic trend of the pre-COVID Trump era was pretty much a straight line continuation from the Obama era. That said, like I mentioned above I do agree the tax cuts were good for the economy and presumably contributed at least somewhat to that expansion even if we don't see it in the data. Though again - oh my god could we get way more expansion bang per taxpayer buck from throwing that money at producing public goods rather than at the already wealthy. They just don't tend to spend that much more when they get extra money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Like printing more and more money to pay your bills, how is this not devaluing the currency? Possibly because money pushed in at the bottom is very quickly hoovered up by big business and goes into the big piles of billionaires. So devaluation of currency or the furthering of the super-rich's hold over us all. The idea isn't that you can print an infinite amount of money without devaluing the currency or causing inflation, it's that those should be the metrics we use to figure out how much money we can print, instead of using non sequitur statistics like the size of the debt or deficit.  gt;Secondly is the idea of using foreign loans to buy "stuff" do they appreciate that the money they borrowed to buy the stuff is there long after the stuff is in landfill? The interest on the loan will outlive us all, its like borrowing money to buy ice cream, the ice cream is gone in minutes but we pay for it for a long time. The only way that swapping money for stuff works is of the stuff lasts a very long time and does not devalue or is used to boost the economy to a greater extent than the cost of the loan. What's the "using foreign loans to buy stuff" reference? Certainly the US government isn't at all dependent on foreign loans for any of its spending. Remember the Fed can easily enough set interest rates at whatever level it likes with or without foreign bond purchases.  gt;America seems to exist on the strength of its dollar, what with the petrodollar under threat from renuables and the economy of China on the rise I am not sure the dollar is always going to be the bedrock of international finance. A strong dollar is beneficial in some ways but harmful in others. Most Americans would likely benefit from a weaker dollar because it would make American labor cheaper by international standards and thus boost employment. The trouble is the American elite benefits from a strong dollar and take action to keep it that way.  gt;All in all you can say that getting into debt without any real benefit is a good idea, you can say that printing money will mean money is always abundant, but unless you can show me a country without mass homelessness, breadline citizens and cared for people while a few privileged souls live in luxury, I won't think your financial system is as sound as it could be. What's important to remember is that none of this is really some different financial system that's being proposed, it's just an accurate description of the financial system we're already living with. But to answer your question, look at Japan: they recently hit a 200% debt to GDP ratio, unemployment is under 3%, and they have no hints of any difficulty in continuing to spend as much money as they want while setting the interest rate on government bonds wherever the BOJ thinks is appropriate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It certainly benefits those people, along with those who would have paid $3300 for a worse place before and now get a nicer one, and those who would have been pushed out of the area altogether at the $3700 price point but stick around at $3300. Some of that benefit is pure gain resulting from more housing being produced, and the rest comes at the expense of landlords, so even with higher income renters getting a lot of the benefits I call it a big win.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Puritanical? I think you may not be using that word right. If anything it's the debt paranoiacs who are being impractically puritan.  gt;Obviously just debt itself is not the problem.... but if our national debt becomes a burden on which interest grows the net burden faster than it can be replaced by net wealth creation that is a problem. Eventually as we pump up our debt higher and higher it will need to be addressed. This is just not a serious concern. Japan has double the debt to GDP ratio the US has and doesn't have any problem keeping interest rates down or spending as much as their legislature decides to.  gt;The national debt issue is already having serious political consequences, such as offering republicans a completely non sequitur scapegoat on which they think they can dissolve social security (even though it would be a completely stable system if they hadn #8217;t borrowed from it into bear insolvency). I'd point to that as an example of how the inappropriate concern about the national debt is already causing problems by providing a cudgel to beat the welfare state with. The fact that Republicans lie about the national debt being a big problem in order to justify cutting social security doesn't imply it actually is a big problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The size of the debt is a somewhat arbitrary number, but inflation is not the only thing bad about printing money, funding the government through money printing creates massive market distortions, misallocation of capital, incentivizes unproductive risk taking, and drives wealth inequality. None of that is the case, where did you get that idea?  gt;The fed will no longer be able to control bond yields when constrained by inflation. They cannot buy bonds for example to lower the interest rate, without increasing the money supply. So the interest rate can become out of control if inflation did occur. Currently its only kept in check by trade deficits and foreign investors hoarding dollars as a safe haven because its the least worst currency. If this trend would reverse, inflation would skyrocket, interest rates would have to rise, and the cost to service the national debt would multiply many times over. Well yes, this gets back to my point that inflation is the real limitation on spending, not the deficit or the number of outstanding bonds. I think you're overestimating how at-risk the US is to inflation though - other developed countries without the global safe haven currency or big trade deficits don't seem to be having any more inflation than we are.  gt;This is the typical employment fallacy. You could say if we destroyed all modern technology everyone will be better off because we'd have 100% employment as hunters and gatherers. The problem is not a strong dollar, the problem is the country's failure to invest in training people for new jobs, instead we are trying to lower our living standards to the point our workers are willing to compete with third world countries. The "typical employment fallacy" isn't a thing (literally zero google hits lol). Not sure where you'd get the idea that reducing unemployment would lower American living standards. Seems like we are just discussing the supply and demand sides of the labor market. The policies you propose help improve the quality of the American workers, while the ones I mentioned reduce the price. Both are handy for increasing the number of American workers who get hired. The situation isn't so simply as a stronger dollar or a weaker dollar always being better. Instead we have to find the best balance we can - which to me looks something like having the dollar at the maximum strength that is still consistent with full employment. Stronger than that and we start to get produce unemployment and hurt wages, weaker and we're leaving money on the table in foreign trade. The more of the supply side interventions like those you suggest that we implement the higher the maximum dollar value that is still consistent with full employment gets.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The big problem was that we never got back up to our previous growth trend after the financial crisis, which we usually manage within a few years of a recession: https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/2018-19-1.png It seems like you're trying to make some anti-Republican point, which I'm all for - they bear a lot of the blame not just for crashing the economy in the first place, but also for sabotaging the recovery. The strongest critique of Obama is that he didn't fight them hard enough, and just generally didn't have as different of an outlook from them as we would hope.  gt;I mean, they created the longest and biggest bull Market in history last time. I #8217;d rather have sustainable growth then one big pop and another crash. The trouble is we haven't actually escaped from that "growth via asset bubbles" model. We started blowing up another big asset bubble almost as soon as the last one popped. If we had managed faster growth there would actually have been less of a bubble, since the real economy wouldn't be lagging so far beyond the stock market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; The middle class mostly have dollar denominated savings and income while the rich mostly own assets and variable income. So its easy to see how printing money to fund government spending on assets is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class and poor to the rich. This is a very good and important point to make, but not really relevant to what I'm saying. The key is that you say government spending *on assets*. When the Fed prints money and uses it to buy bonds it is purely giving away money to those who already own assets, inflating the value of those assets and hurting those who don't have any - and as you say there's a sort of fractal nature to this where the more assets you have the more you benefit. The key to avoid that is to not spend that newly printed money on assets, but instead on public goods. Build a railway or an affordable housing complex or a hospital and instead of throwing that money away on the rich, it goes to all the firms and workers involved in producing that thing. And then at the end of it you have a nice public good rather than just bigger numbers in a rich guy's stock portfolio.  gt;Right, other developed country's currency are not currently the world reserve currency like the US dollar. You can't lose what you don't have. And certainly there are many examples of currency collapses recently (Venezuela, Argentina, etc.) and real inflation in developed countries is much higher than government metrics which are engineered to underestimate it. My point about other developed countries is that the reserve currency stuff is clearly not required for America to have its current level of inflation, since lots of countries achieve similar inflation levels without having their currency be the reserve currency. Currency collapses like we see in the countries you mentioned all have one thing in common - the country has large debts not denominated in its own currency. That's not an issue for the US or similarly developed countries that control their own currency.  gt;I think this makes sense, but I think its much better to achieve this by investing in education and training for people to get better jobs, so you improve employment with a stronger dollar and quality of life. By deliberately weakening the dollar you are essentially just robbing worker's purchasing power to give it a foreign country so they can pay us with our own money to make them things. Just because we aren't smart enough to allocate our own workforce properly. Education and training are very long term plans though. It doesn't work to say "sure we have high unemployment now, but we are investing a lot in education so once our current generation of students are adults unemployment will go down!" Unemployment needs to be fought via demand stimulus that can be implemented fast enough to matter - whether that's from a weaker dollar, increased federal spending or what have you. The supply side stuff you like is great but more of a long term best practice than anything that's helpful in managing the business cycle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What are you talking about? This is a sub for Bernie supporters and I'm a huge Bernie supporter - and like most of those supporters am not planning to vote Green this November. To quote a wise socialist activist: The kind of self-marginalizing, moralistic, inward-looking symbolic politics the Green Party represents--the rejection of strategic thinking as a betrayal of principle, the refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for shaping political outcomes, the smug certainty that pursuing the same failed strategy over and over and over again is a mark of exceptional virtue rather than intellectual bankruptcy--all this is *endemic* on the left, endemic in the technical sense of the term, a disease that will always threaten the left and especially at moments of defeat, because it is, after all, a kind of despair. The Green Party has been pursuing the same strategy of symbolic presidential runs for decades with no visible result--no growth in vote total, no effect on the national conversation, no leverage to push the Democrats left, just nothing. AOC did more for the left by winning a few thousand votes in a congressional race than the Green Party has in its entire existence. The Green Party not only hasn't grown, it simply can't grow. If the Greens ever really had a banner year and managed to get all the way up to, say, 3% of the presidential vote, it would become crystal clear to everyone that the Green Party had caused a Republican presidency, and its vote total would crash back down. The Green Party leadership may believe with perfect equanimity that Trump is exactly the same as a Democrat (or that even considering who might win a presidential election when one votes in a presidential election is a dirty compromise), but its voters don't; there's a good reason that the Greens have never surpassed their 2.7% "victory" in 2000, and it's the same reason that polls show support for the Greens cratering this year from an already extremely low 2016 result: very few left-wing voters really want a Republican to be elected president. Many people blame the Green Party's comprehensive failure at every level on a US electoral system biased against third parties, but this is too kind to the party. The Vermont Progressive Party has been building power in that state for decades, after all, and has even won statewide office. The Greens' failure to achieve anything remotely like this level of success anywhere in the country is no doubt in part due to simple incompetence, but the deeper problem is its choice to run presidential candidates and create a spoiler dynamic that makes it toxically unpopular with virtually everyone who shares its politics. The supposed justifications of this foolish strategy (that it preserves ballot access, that it might someday net the party some matching funds) collapse on the most cursory examination; the truth is that a moral commitment to vanity presidential campaigns that help Republicans is at the heart of the party's identity. Where does this identity *come* from? The odd thing about the Green Party is that it embodies a perspective on the US political system whose naivete and idealism is unmatched outside middle school civics textbooks. Many of us on the left remember a time when we ourselves were young enough to believe that the US political system was a forum in which voters expressed their unmediated individual preferences, etc.; most of us grow out of it and come to recognize that the electoral system is a terrain of struggle shaped by larger social forces. Some of us continue to engage with it on those terms and attempt to move the ball forward despite the obstacles; others decide that it is not an effective site of struggle at this historical moment and go do other kinds of organizing work. Not the Greens! They just keep doing the same unworkable thing, and regard a serious strategic assessment of the terrain as a terrible compromise on principle. While I have been harsh on the Green Party so far, I must say that in Howie Hawkins they have found their perfect standard-bearer. Hawkins has spent the past two decades continuously losing elections. In 2017, after decades in Syracuse politics, he ran for *mayor of Syracuse* (population 140,000, a fourth of the size of a Congressional district) and got a grand total of 4% of the vote. That's, yes, one thousand votes--the very same year that Jabari Brisport ran for New York City Council as a first-time candidate (every district is larger than Syracuse) and got 30% of the vote, 9,000 votes. Let me be clear: Winning as a third-party candidate is hard, but it's not impossible. A serious candidate with an organizing mindset really can win. Bernie Sanders won, all those years ago in Burlington. But Hawkins isn't a serious candidate; he isn't really trying. He's pretending to run for office, again and again and again, in order to make some obscure point that is clearly lost on the overwhelming majority of the electorate, as well it might be. Did you know that the Green Party doesn't control a *single* state legislative seat, *anywhere* in the country? There are thousands of such seats, most of them tiny, but none tiny enough for the Green Party's organizing skills. Instead they're gonna run for president, again. If you're serious about building a third party in the US, there are a lot of ways to begin advancing that project--building a social base and local power, developing tactics and strategy, etc. There are a lot of examples to learn from, from the Nonpartisan League and the Populists to Kshama Sawant to the VPP. The Green Party isn't among them. It isn't a step in the right direction, or any direction. If you wanted to start a third party in the US right now the first thing you'd need to say is "we're definitely NOT like the Greens." Every minute and every dollar spent advancing the Green Party project is a minute and dollar wasted. The left can't afford this waste. Polls indicate that the Greens' vote total is likely to crater this year, perhaps because voters don't share their analysis that it's cool if Trump wins; that's all to the good, because the seas are rising quickly and the left can't afford this crap.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It seems like you're misremembering some key events here. As you say the Greek people voted overwhelmingly to not accept the enforced austerity terms of the bailout agreement, as recommended by Varoufakis. But then it turned out the Syriza leadership had called that referendum hoping it would go the other way, and ended up reversing course and agreeing to a basically identical bailout, betraying the result of the referendum. That betrayal, and the acceptance of austerity, was what led Varoufakis to resign. Here's a bunch more detail: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Greek_bailout_referendum</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In that scenario everything is like it is now except private businesses are democracies. So prices are still set by the market. What would change is that the "owner" and "worker" roles in a business would be consolidated. So rather than each worker being paid the market value of their labor, they'd be paid that plus their share of the profits, which would be shared among those worker-owners rather than shipped off to non-productive investors.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You'd enter by applying and be hired, not that different from getting a job currently. If it's an existing business payment happens like now - biweekly paycheck or however else they vote to arrange it. Sounds like you're asking about how startups would work. It's helpful to think about how the owner and worker roles have been consolidated. In their capacity as owners, they would be like current investors in a startup, not expecting much of a profit for a long time after founding the business. On the other hand in their role as workers they would still pay themselves a salary, just as workers at startups get paid currently despite the lack of profit. The big reason why we don't see more worker cooperatives in our economy already despite their being generally [at least as efficient than conventional businesses](https://www.democracyatwork.info/the_performance_of_workercooperatives) is that they have a hard time attracting startup capital. Why invest in a cooperative that will end up owned by its workers rather than in a conventional business you'll get to own? Ideas to promote the cooperative model thus focus on capital provision - for example subsidizing cooperative startups, banning conventional startups to free up those resources for cooperatives, or mandating that businesses direct a percentage of their income towards buying out the original owners in favor of their workforce.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I'm disputing is that it's the same "they" who are feeding us the poison of low density development and offering the "cure" of rent control. Rent control is just an additional solution to high rents that works very well alongside YIMBY policy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You see that that's an op-ed from Megan McArdle that does not cite a single economist right? I truly have yet to read a rent control critique (including the linked one) that's not just wandering around in la-la land. McArdle claims in there that on the one hand rent control increases rents on non-rent controlled units, and on the other hand reduces incentives to build new housing. But obviously only one of those can be true - either it reduces rents for non-rent controlled units and thus reduces the incentive to build new housing, or it increases rent for those units and thus *increases* the incentive to build new housing. Feels like she's not even trying.</TEXT>

Neither is being pushed by the same establishment power centers that got us into this mess.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I agree that's a poor article. It's not as though rent control is just one thing, the details matter. Ultimately what drives development are expectations. A rent control policy that caps annual rent increases by the amount of inflation, for example, means when developers are assessing the profitability of projects they must do so given that the initial price point will lock them into only ever being able to raise rent by less than inflation from then on out. Meaning it could make sense to leave half a building empty for awhile instead of caving and lowering the initial asking rent because should you lower the ask you won't be able to raise it later. It might be counter-intuitive but the effect is landlords charging more given rent control and being loathe to come down in prices. Absent rent control as described it could make sense to take a variable loss on a per unit bases for a few periods by renting out cheap given a slow market because something is better than nothing. Every rent control policy excludes new development, so this is never an issue anywhere. Once again, this speaks strongly to my "critiques of rent control are completely disconnected from policy reality" point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really, there are only cities with rent control in five states (California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Oregon) plus DC. Meanwhile in 37 states it's actually banned! And in the places where it does exist it's almost exclusively a remnant of a more progressive past era of urban policymaking, not something that's supported by the current political establishment. Though that is hopefully starting to change in some places as the same pro-housing movement that's pushing YIMBY reforms also backs rent control (like we saw in Oregon last year: https://www.curbed.com/2019/7/1/20677502/oregon-yimby-single-family-zoning-nimby-rent-control)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No there's no deadline, it's a one off - rent control is implemented on everything from 2005 and earlier, and never applies to anything built after that. And it applies to the current price the place was listed at when rent control went into effect, so there's no gaming the price of a unit except potentially in that already passed few month window when it was about to go into effect but hadn't yet. If you're newly putting a unit on the market starting now the control won't apply to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rent control is about making sure people and communities don't get effectively thrown out of their homes by rapid rent increases. It's a valuable policy that makes a real positive difference in the lives of people in areas with fast rising rents. It doesn't speak to the housing supply issue, which I agree is at least as important, one way or another. Rent control has it's place protecting vulnerable tenants, and pro-development policies have their place in creating an adequate housing supply. There's no conflict or competition between the two policies, they're both something anyone who cares about the housing crisis should strongly support. And as we saw in Oregon that really does seem to be how it works - support for one is correlated with support for the other because they're both smart ways of attacking different parts of a larger problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. "Reasoning from a price change" means getting the causality wrong - thinking "wow this lower price will lead to more purchases than ever before" rather than "the price is lower because people are buying less than before." An example of that in the rent world would be noticing that rents have gone way down in a city, and thinking "Oh, good times in that city, people are going to have so much money for other things!" not realizing that rents going down is almost always a result of people being *short* on money and unable to pay the existing rent. None of it applies to the rent control debate. Reasoning from a price change means you're at risk of misunderstanding why that price change happened in the first place, while implementing rent control is taking an action that directly effects prices.</TEXT>

The question is what artificially limiting increases on the prices of some units does to the demand and thus the price for non-controlled units.

    <TEXT>Yeah exactly - she has so much outrage at the concept of rent control is interferes with whatever good sense she might have. We need to eliminate existing rent control... so that developers working on buildings it won't apply to don't worry that it will apply to them? And remember, this is in a piece where she is elsewhere claiming that the rents developers will be able to charge for those new buildings are actually *higher* than they would be in the absence of any rent control law. And then her next line - supposedly rent control is going to stop the buildings those units are in from being torn down and replaced by larger buildings, yet elsewhere in the article she argues that rent control is going to cause those units to be taken out of the rental market altogether. Any one of these arguments could potentially have some validity, but the way she tosses together mutually contradictory ones for the same position demonstrates that many of them don't, and that she's either not that bright or not arguing in good faith.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First one: She claims eliminating rent control laws that don't apply to new construction, and which even increase the rent new construction can charge, will encourage new construction. Her argument seems to be that developers will worry more about future rent control and thus build less in cities that have existing rent control laws on the books - again a bizarre mix-up since the more people who are protected by an existing rent control law the less of a constituency there is for implementing a whole new one to cover additional buildings. Second one: One argument is saying rent controlled units will be taken out of circulation and reduce housing supply, the other complains that it won't be possible to blow up the buildings rental units are in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Where ? This is like the 4th time you've asked me to pinpoint something in the article for you. Go read it rather than asking me to spoonfeed it to you paragraph by paragraph.  gt;You don't think rent control already being in place for a privileged part of the population will encourage newcomers who don't get the privilege of being in a rent-controlled apartment to also want rent control ? Classic Schelling fence. Who knows? As you see above I can just as easily tell a just so story where existing rent control reduces the demand for further rent control. But clearly we can see that McArdle does not have any actual backing for her argument - it's just one more piece of mud to throw at rent control.  gt;Again, what's the contradiction ? Rent-controlled units aren't in the market anymore, that doesn't mean they were blown up, that means they're rented by people who are highly discouraged from leaving. I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Rent controlled units are obviously still part of the housing supply even if they have long term tenants.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Rent control being implemented means those who now live in rent-controlled units won't fight for rent control anymore... because they achieved it... but it also means the people who don't will be invigorated to fight for it to be extended to them now - partly out of equity, partly because the earlier rent control law set a precedent. The "just so stories" aren't contradictory. They're not contradictory in the sense that they couldn't both be happening, but my point is there are a million more just so stories like this we could tell with additional theories about what effect existing rent control laws will have on people's propensity to implement more of the same. McArdle spinning one out without any evidence to back it up is lousy reasoning.  gt;As McArdle argues, that's not true. Rent control creates a two-tier market: one "market" where everybody stay in their rent-controlled apartment, and another market without rent control, and thus with less supply (the rent-controlled units) with still ever growing demand. What we care about is the housing supply as far as the people who live in the city are concerned, which clearly does include the rent controlled units. I don't think even McArdle is describing a unit becoming rent controlled as that unit being taken out of the housing supply. The two tiered market is closer to the mark - rent control reduces supply in the non-rent controlled market, but it also proportionately reduces demand, since all the people in the rent controlled units are no longer on the other market.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think what brings it back to more conventional economics is that the existence of a "dependent" class is predicated on *somebody* in those family groups making good enough money to support the dependents. What you're describing seems to be mostly about downward mobility - people not seeing the point of working rather than mooching off their parents when the lifestyle they'll be able to afford from labor income won't measure up to the one they are tagging along with thanks to their parents. The big issue is that compensation for labor, in terms of how many hours are needed to afford a decent lifestyle, has gone way down. Some are lucky enough to have the force of that blow blunted by their parents who are still working jobs from an earlier and kinder era, most just have to find a way to support themselves in difficult circumstances.</TEXT>

He looks at this situation where Trump was elected president with a minority of the vote and has a chance of winning based almost entirely on winning with a minority of the vote again, and is backed up by the least majoritarian institutions in the federal government (the senate and the courts) and his conclusion is... maybe democracy has gone too far? Concerns about mob rule and "tyranny of the majority" feel very off when we're in the middle of an effort to ward off the tyranny of the minority.</TEXT>

On the other hand I'm very concerned about the possibility that he and his allies in state governments steal the election by blocking a full ballot count and are backed up by our hard-right courts. It would look more like the 2000 election than a military coup, but the result would be the same.</TEXT>

A key thing separating the DSA from most American socialist groups is that they ARE Democrats - generally running candidates on the Democratic ballot line rather than as their own independent third party. It's a tactic that has seen huge success - they only started running any candidates in 2018 and now they're already going to have 5 state legislators! Even with the current number of members they're already a major force in New York politics, and the sky is the limit for future growth in membership and power.</TEXT>

That would be the greatest subversion of all - the universe really is full of DMT entity style avatars of cosmic peace and harmony, but then parochial racists encountered them and saw their agenda as one of corruption and insanity. Cthulu isn't evil, he (she?) is just misunderstood!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This terminological issue is so messy since the original social democrats were much closer to what you describe as democratic socialism, but then gradually lost interest in even a long term transition to socialism as they gained and held power. So now we use "social democracy" to refer to those same parties, even though they now have a different ideology from when they initially adopted that label.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In that context it's hard to say what "more economically free" means besides "has a higher score on this metric." The way Heritage does that kind of ranking is combining a bunch of right-wing economic policies and a bunch of general good government policies into one metric. So their rankings are sort of an average between how far right a country is and how prosperous they are. That way they get to create the illusion that right wing policy correlates with prosperity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's impossible to overemphasize how little most Americans engage with or understand politics:  gt;In 2016, for example, 45 percent of Black Americans identified as liberal and 43 percent identified as conservative.1 This is a far cry from the near-uniformity of Black partisanship.  gt;In fact, this ideological variation has led some scholars and other analysts of American politics to wonder why conservative-identifying Black Americans remain so loyal to the Democratic Party.  gt;The problem is that this ideological split is an illusion. It turns out, a large subset of Black Americans simply don #8217;t make use of the terms  #8220;liberal #8221; and  #8220;conservative #8221; when discussing politics. That is, these terms  #8212; which are familiar to those who participate in certain types of elite political discourse  #8212; are often just unfamiliar to many Black Americans for whom these terms are not part of their political lexicon, as one of the authors of this piece, Jefferson, found in his research.  gt;In the 2012 ANES, for example, 44 percent of Black Americans categorized Barack Obama as conservative. A similar share categorized Mitt Romney as liberal. And 35 percent of Black Americans said the Democratic Party was more conservative than the Republican Party. In other words, ideological identification actually tells us very little about Black people #8217;s politics because standard ideological terms are not commonplace in Black Americans #8217; political discourse.</TEXT>

Armao typically joins corporate lobbyists in supporting candidates committed to limiting taxes on the very wealthy and blocking things like paid family leave. For example, she backed Brandon Todd against Janeese Lewis George in the 2020 primary, and Dionne Reeder over Elissa Silverman in 2018. In both instances she supported the corporate candidate over the progressive one. Armao also declined to endorse incumbents DC Council candidates Mary Cheh in 2018 and Robert White this year, despite their solid work on a range of issues. Her candidates lost by large margins, indicating that she is out of step with DC voters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm definitely pro-civility - and as you can see I was not the one to start any conflict here. Not sure what to make of this second part - this is what keeps me engaging over here I guess, the idea that there are people out there who not only still believe there was electoral fraud sufficient to swing the election, not only believe that justified the coup (non-coup midterm removal of an incumbent president?) but are outraged to hear otherwise. It seems like you're saying a lot of that is about having already committed to that worldview by attending protests and such so they're now too committed to back down in the face of new evidence? If that's it, or whatever the explanation is, I really urge you to look at the facts and not just angrily defend your prior assumptions.</TEXT>

There are a ton of accusations floating around and being repeated uncritically, none of which have held up under scrutiny. I'm sorry if my saying this sort of thing is offensive, I promise I am just trying to engage with the facts in good faith here. It can get frustrating when instead of counterarguments the response to that is a bunch of insults and tone policing.

    <TEXT>So I see in your response below that you say you are leaving because you're a Muslim and India is increasingly intolerant of Muslims. Seems like a good enough reason to get out to me! You don't really have anything to worry about in terms of 'getting cancelled' - you may turn people off in your personal life if you get in their face about your political differences but as a non-famous person unless you get filmed doing something extravagantly outrageous you don't need to worry about internet mobs effecting your everyday life. Is there any particular type of injustice you see yourself calling out that you're concerned would get you cancelled? Usually it's the 'woke' side who spend a lot of time calling out injustice (your mileage may vary on whether you agree that it's injustice) so by default I think that personality trait is not anything you need to worry about.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Additionally, the idea that poor high schools hold kids back, but then they #8217;d do well in college is... well insane. Does this man know nothing about the human brain? Isn't he agreeing with you on that one? See below:  gt;If minorities were academically better than their test scores predicted - ie they were being held back by bad high schools, but once they got into college they would perform really well - then I would agree we should have affirmative action, on the grounds mentioned above. AFAIK this isn't true, and high school success predicts future achievement for minorities according to the same prediction rules as for everyone else, but if I'm wrong about this let me know. He's basically saying we should send the kids to college who we expect to perform best academically, without concern for what racial or other identity breakdown that produces.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I understand both Scott and /u/codemuncher to be saying is sort of the opposite - if you don't get a good high school education it hurts your ability to do well in college, so we shouldn't expect students who did poorly at bad high schools to suddenly do as well as kids who did well at good high schools when they're put in the same college environment. Could be wrong about either though. Personally I am somewhat skeptical of the role of school quality in all this. To me it looks more like growing up in poverty really fucks people up in a variety of ways, one of which is that they tend to do worse in school. So the solution isn't to somehow get schools to produce the same outcomes for poor students, but to end poverty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if this makes as much of a distinction as you want it to. You give some anecdotes about minorities being annoyed at whites moving into their neighborhood, but of course there are plenty of similar anecdotes about whites being annoyed at minorities moving into their neighborhoods - that's a lot of what ultimately produced the white flight to the suburbs that caused all these urban neighborhoods to be majority-minority in the first place. New arrivals can be dicks to natives, natives can be dicks to new arrivals... and the solution is to not be a dick, not to prevent new arrivals from showing up.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The exact ways different groups bother each vary, but obviously you could have endless white people complaining about street crime or declining property values or whatever to put against stories of gentrification or cops being called. The details of what your problem is with another race aren't that significant in whether you're racist or not. I'd say moving to wherever you want to move is indeed something that everybody is doing, and isn't bad in the slightest. Anybody that makes political hay out of rallying up locals to blame their problems on outsiders is an asshole, regardless of the race or relative incomes of the two groups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I wouldn't be shocked at your views considering you call yourself a libertarian. Huh? No I don't. Well, [left libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism) sometimes, but that's pretty different. Are you confusing me with someone else you were talking to?  gt;This is classic libertarian thinking. Create the problem and then don't want to be blamed or face the consequences of the problem you created. Racism from white people created declining property values in black neighborhoods because companies allowed white people to think that and then took advantage of it. So now when it happens you as a Libertarian believes that you have a right to run away from the problem you're racism created. I'm not sure what to make of this tangent. You're acting like my point was that those white people complaining about minorities moving into their neighborhoods were in the right, but I'm using them as an example of that kind of racism and xenophobia being wrong. The message I would want Eric Adams to hear is that he is getting too close to imitating that shameful chapter in the country's history for comfort and should stop it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a weird take - if anything nuclear weapons promote multi-polarity. It's a lot easier to build enough nukes to deter the dominant power than it is to build a strong enough conventional military to do so. Plus just on the facts - more than half the nuclear age so far was taken up by the Cold War, when we had two superpowers not one. There can't really be any argument that the existence of nukes necessitates there being a single dominant power.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're not really making any sense here. Your whole argument is:  gt;The country with the biggest arsenal combined with the ability to wield its soft and hard power is going to be the dominant global force. That #8217;s just the way it is. But why would having that arsenal be nuclear rather than conventional make it more likely that there would be a single dominant power? You don't even give an argument. Russia has had the most nuclear weapons of any country for decades, does that make them the dominant global power? Obviously not. Far from encouraging unipolarity, nukes make it a lot more difficult. In a nuclear armed world the strongest military power has much less of an advantage over the next strongest than in a world with only conventional weapons, since if a country has nukes it can do an unacceptable level of damage to any attacker no matter how overmatched they are militarily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Remember what I'm taking issue with here is your saying "That status quo [of multipolarity] ended the second we developed world ending weapons" Saying that nuclear weapons don't make a difference and there is just always a dominant power is a totally different claim. Of course I also don't agree with that one, which seems at least as easy to debunk - obviously in any situation you can say "this is the top power" but equally obviously it's very common for the #1 power to not be a dominant hegemon in the way the US has been for the past few decades.</TEXT>
