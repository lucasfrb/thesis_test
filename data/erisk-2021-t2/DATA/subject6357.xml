    <TITLE>EK steals Lego pieces and minifigures from me and my friends</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-21 20:50:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>OK first of all I'm on mobile, english isn't my first language yadda yadda yadda let's move onto the story. This happened when I was in 4th grade: in those years I was in a group formed my me and three other friends, and we were always together playing and talking about shit. One of them (I'll call him Mark) was always really nice and I really liked him as a friend, but then he started stealing from us. The first things he stole were Emmet's head and hair pieces back in 2014, when The Lego Movie came out and we all wanted TLG Lego sets: one day we all went to watch it and then, when we got back home, he stole them before going away and my other friend (I'll call him Matthew) noticed that they were missing. The day after, that idiot Mark brought them to school! Matthew suddendly recognized them and got them back, but that didn't stop him: one day I invited him to my house and, when he went back home, I noticed that my Doc Ock minifigure was missing AND that he ALSO stole my Steve microfigure (I was a HUGE Minecraft fan back then and I had two Lego Minecraft sets (the Micro Worlds ones))! He also stole a black 1x1 piece with the little "hand" attached to and a little golden Lego knife (I used both for a modified Iron Armour Steve Microfigure). After I told my mother that he might have stolen them, she obviously didn't believe me and so I had to get a replace for Steve, but some time later Mark got near to me and said "Here's a gift, I heard you lost your Steve": it was a Lego Steve Microfigure with a black 1x1 "hand" piece and a golden knife. I recognized the scratch on the blade: it was MY knife, I was right all along! The sad thing is that I never saw Doc Ock again, but at least I customised Old Steve a bit and turned it into Herobrine (I used to believe in him back then).</TEXT>

When I posted this I was like "Eh, it's just a FNaF related meme about an old theory that was debunked a long time ago, I don't see what's wrong here, I don't think I need to read the rules because I don't think there's anything wrong. I hope people will like this". Didn't mean to guilt trip you, didn't mean to break the rules, didn't mean anything. Again, I'm sorry. I really needed to write this because, being the idiot I am, I just can't live with my own errors, and when I realise I made the tiniest of mistakes I do, well, that. Really hope you'll forgive me, but I you won't, that's all right. End of communication.</TEXT>

I didn't even bother to read the rules because I was like "Come on, it's just a FNaF related meme, it'll be all right". Again, I'm sorry. If you're wondering why I waited, like, two days to reply it's because my dumb ass can't bear to live with his errors. I'm sorry. End of communication.</TEXT>

'06 was actually going to be cool, even in terms of the story, but the development was terribly rushed. Lost World is good in terms of gameplay, but the story was just bland and mostly stupid (seriously, I bought the 3DS version and I'm skipping all the cutscenes).

It's exactly like Fortnite, Minecraft, Xbox Live Arcade, Instagram and God knows what else: they are actually good (or for me, in Fortnite's case, at least decent), but the toxic and cringey community makes them cringe and hated by a lot of people (with the exception of Minecraft, of course).

Tons of people went there. Some of them, I'd say a 15%, came there to actually do something after that, while the remaining people went there just to skip school. When they got back, they were like they've never been there, they didn't fucking CARE about it, and that's why I went to school both times, while my older brother told me about how everyone was smoking and definitely not doing anything against pollution and Global Warming there.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What should I buy, and how should I start reading Archie Sonic?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-20 05:48:08</DATE>
    <TEXT>A couple of years ago I started noticing Archie Sonic and I think it's a very good comic series that I really want to read. So my question is this: how should I start reading it? I'm mostly interested in the Pre-Genesis Wave saga, since I didn't like the reboot as far as I read it (online, illegally-I was still young and unexperienced, okay?) I know there are still 500+ issues to read including spin offs, specials and Universe, and that Archie Comics doesn't sell them anymore both physical and digital, but what and how should I buy them? I'm not a big fan of scans, so, again, what and how should I buy? Thanks in advance! Oh, and anyway I'm buying the Archie Sonic Complete Encyclopedia, just to make sure I understand everything. Again, thanks in advance!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This kinda reminds me of the italian song "Hanno ucciso l'Uomo Ragno" (Someone killed the Spider Man). The song is a metaphor of our young selves being killed by adulthood, but the lyrics are literally about Spider Man being killed by someone and crime taking over New York because he's dead. Ever since I heard it I was like "What the fuck? There are like a fuckton of superheroes in New York! Why aren't they doing anything? It's not like just because one guy died you can't do anything to stop criminals!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah yes, because he smart. There's always this thing I don't understand about Tails. I mean, Tails can fly. Ok. He's an aviator by nature. He can also pilot a plane. Ok, nothing wrong there. Since he can fly normally, why can't he learn how to pilot a plane? Since he's the one who uses the plane the most, he's the one who has to take care of it. Ok. He could've learned about planes during the time with Sonic and became a bit of a grease monkey. Ok, no problem there. Then he suddendly became a genius with a 300 IQ who can apparently do basically impossible things (like building a FUCKING CHAOS EMERALD OUT OF NOWHERE) because "he's smart". I honestly don't see the link. In my view, Tails should have been the flying sidekick who always relies on his big brother Sonic, but that since he believes in himself he can do things a kick Eggman's ass even without his help. Who also happens to know how to fly and fix planes. Of course, this is just my personal and questionable opinion. Hope you have a good day.</TEXT>

In the middle of the night, Sherlock wakes Watson up and asks: "Watson, what do you see?". Watson replies: "I'm seeing countless stars right now". Sherlock: "So, what do you deduce from it?". Watson replies: "Well, from the astronomic point of view I can say that today there's full Moon. From the religious point of view I can only say that God is almighty and we are His sons. From the meteorological point of view I can say that tomorrow it won't rain... What do you deduce from it, Sherlock?", And Sherlock: "Watson, someone stole our tent.".</TEXT>

No polyester hawaiian floral shirt and eating shrimp for you! OP here. Yeah, I believe that the Leviticus today is just bullshit.

    <TEXT>Kinda reminds me of a video that went everywhere in Italy. There was a teacher in a class that was calling all the students to see if they were in class (no idea of how you say that in english). At one point she keeps repeating "Bassano, are you here?" and the student named Bassano keeps repeating "Yes, I'm here!", she's like "Ok, you're here" and then she does that again. And again. For two fucking minutes. The video, since someone was filming everything with their phone, went all over Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. So Fanpage, the Italian version of Buzzfeed, decided to repost the video on their website. The title was "Teacher humiliated by students".

    <TEXT>No, no. I'm referring to when they say the name or other appellatives like senpai or brother but they write in the surname in the subtitles. Like in Dororo (the 2019 reboot), where Dororo calls Hyakkimaru "Bro" but he never does in the subtitles, or when Tsuyu in MHA always puts the suffix -chan after a name and thus wants to be called "Tsuyu-chan", but in the subs she doesn't and wants to be called "Tsu", or when Midoriya calls Mirio "senpai" and in the subs he calls him "Lemillion".</TEXT>

At one point I see a toddler crying very loudly, and his mother telling him to shut up. His left eye was dangling out of the eye socket and the skin around was livid. And then, he grabs the eye with his hand and, still crying, HE FUCKING RIPS IT OUT IN A VERY REALISTIC WAY. And his mother is like "look at what you've done!". I woke up moments after.</TEXT>

Our teacher had a lot of movies and for the last weeks we only watched DVDs on the Virtual Whiteboard. At one point there were just two movies left: Intouchables (a french movie about the bizarre friendship between a poor black guy and a rich but paralysed guy) and Schindler's List. I wanted Intouchables, but they all wanted Schindler's List because I was the only one who had never seen it. And then when the movie started they all started to speak loudly and scream at the top of their lungs, and when I told them to shut up they just asked "Wait, you mean you're actually paying attention?". In the end, I didn't understand a single shit about the movie.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Steel Ball Run] What is the President after in the other parallel universes</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-29 08:00:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>Disclaimer: this theory is partly inspired by the video "Debunking Araki Forgot, part 7" by Hamon Beat, so it's not entirely original, but I came up with it right after watching the video. I hope you like it. As JoJo manga fans know well in Steel Ball Run the main villain, President of the USA Funny Valentine, is after the Holy Corpse, the corpse of who is heavily implied to be Jesus Christ, divided in pieces scattered across the States. They have the power of granting Stand Powers to people with talent who "absorb" at least one part. The Steel Ball Run horserace is but a facade to hide his plan to collect all of them: if united, the Corpse can redirect all misfortune and attract fortune (Ticket to Ride, Love Train), and Valentine wants to bury it underground to "make America great again". As we find out later thanks to the Stand D4C, the Corpse only exists in the Base Universe and so D4C, that can be transferred to other Valentines: as explained in one panel, in other universes the characters are after other precious things, like diamonds. However, it is shown that Stands, who are heavily connected to the Corpse, still exist in other universes (like an alternate Johnny with ACT 2, Valentine stealing Cream Starter from an alternate Hot Pants or an alternate Diego with The World). My theory is that in other universes the President is after other mediums able to grant Stands: for example, a shattered Stand Arrow whose shards awaken Stands as long as they are stuck in your body, mystical Diamonds or Stones, pieces of Stone Masks that instead of giving immortality awaken Stands, pieces of Red Stones of Aja who awaken Hamon-like Stands... There are endless possibilities. I hope you liked it, even if it wasn't that original. Let me know what do you think in the comments.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't watch Evangelion. I know I should watch it, but don't know when. But just looking at THAT scene from The End of Evangelion hurt me. I barely had an idea of what was going on, bu it was utterly depressing. The music, Shinji saying that everyone should just die, all the souls reuniting into one... I barely have any idea of what Evangelion is about, but I don't think it will be fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I liked trying to draw manga when I was in 9th grade. I was always trying to learn how to draw heads, eyes, bodies etc. There are actually 3 different things that made me unable to draw like then: 1)I tried drawing Link from the Twilight Princess manga adaption (I had the first volume in italian), thought I did a pretty nice job and even glued it in the jacker cover thingy of the volume. I showed it to one of my friend. He laughed. I thought he was just being mean, so I continued drawing. 2)I tried drawing a scene of the school parking lot where we spend recess. It had a lot of trees and a gate all around the perimeter. One guy behind me kept saying that my drawing was shit over and over again. I continued drawing because I thought it was decent for a beginner. 3)I went to a sort of one-lesson manga course. That. THAT made me question my skills and my will to continue. I couldn't do a single thing they "thaught" us. Everyone else did pretty good jobs while I was there, with my fifth sheet of paper, trying to draw a fucking head. When I got out my parents asked me what's wrong and I told them that all of that made me realize I still suck at drawing. When I got home I couldn't draw a single thing anymore. I felt like shit, like someone destroyed my self esteem with a sledgehammer and kept stepping on the pieces. Everyone around me, my parents, even my psychologist kept telling me that I was good, but I knew that I wasn't. I still can't draw. I want to, but I have no idea of where to start, when to start and how to start.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>~~The JoJo fan light novel I will probably never write where an alternate version of me is the protagonist in a world where JoJo is just a manga series but Stands are real. The Stand Users are separated from society and are trained by a SPW like organisation for military uses. My Stand is Brick in the Wall, a 3 Act Stand that allows me to manipulate matter and with a separate consciousness that represents the positive sides of my personality, and a nameless parasitic power that slowly kills me every time I feel that something is just a burden. Other Stands include Jigsaw Puzzle (making puzzle-like bombs that explode after being solved), La Guerra di Piero (grants its user almost absolute immortality), Roundabout (stops time in a way that is too difficult to explain), Hanno Ucciso l'Uomo Ragno (people in its range are unable to trust each other) and many more~~ Absolutely nothing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's more of a JoJo fan novel. Stands from JoJo exist, but are more a physical manifestations of mental traumas (like Wounds in JORGE JOESTAR). Stand users are isolated from society and live in a city they're not allowed to leave where they are trained to control their powers. The protagonist is very similar to me, is frustrated and susceptible, and has a 3-Act Stand called Brick in the Wall that allows him to manipulate matter. The Stand itself has a separated personality, and is positive and easygoing (he actually represents parts of the protagonist's personality that he tries to repress). There are a lot of other Stand users and bizarre Stands (Jigsaw Puzzle creates puzzles that explode after being solved, The Power of Love prevents its user from dying in any way, Crystal Dolphin manipulates liquids). At one point they find out that they can't leave the city because the city itself is a Stand (We built this city) and they're trained just to kill normal humans and take over the world. Not that I wrote this down I feel like it's a very dumb and bad idea and people are gonna hate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For clarification: Brick in the Wall: humanoid Stand, It manipulates matter of anything its hands touch in different ways depending on the Act (3 like the parts of the song). It has a separated conscience and personality and also has an automatic parasytic power that makes the User weaker everytime he feels like something is just a burden. Its Stand Cry is "OVEROVEROVEROVER... DRIVE!" The Wall: BitW's ultimate form, an emotionless humanoid Stand that can almost completely control the matter it touches. Crystal Dolphin: a Zora-like humanoid Stand, it can manipulate liquids and breath underwater. It has a personality similar to BitW's. We Built This City: automatic Stand, it's a giant-ass city. Whoever is inside can't get out of the city because it can change its morphology and turn into an exitless labyrinth. Jigsaw Puzzle: shapeshifting Stand, it takes the form of a puzzle of User's choice. The puzzle can be used as a bomb with different properties after being solved: the more it's difficult, the more it's powerful. Hanno Ucciso l'Uomo Ragno: humanoid Stand with no destructive power. It makes people in its range diffident and they will not be able to trust anyone. Who Do You Want To Be: laptop-like Stand. It can temporarily erase someone's memories and replace them with an input: the person afflicted Will have to follow that input until its memories come back. The Invisible Man: Humanoid Stand, my friend's idea. It can block other Stands' physical attack, but not their abilities. Its Stand Cry is "MAMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMA!"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's, like, part of my novel. You see, my protagonist is literally a projection of my persona in a world where Stand Users are real, but are separated from society and forced to live in what looks like a normal city (but is actually the automatic Stand We Built This City). He is a pessimistic and frustrated guy who doesn't want to remember the past for all the cringe stuff and mistakes he made, he is never truly happy but is not depressed or anything. His Stand, Brick in the Wall, is basically a mirrored version of him: he is joyful and carefree, likes playing videogames and generally enjoying life. His name is Brick in the Wall because of his secondary, uncontrollable ability: creating intangible bricks every time the User does, thinks or remembers something that is like a burden to him. The bricks end up accumulating on his back, making the User weaker in no time. At one point I have a mini story arc where the Stand Who Do You Want To Be is introduced: WDYWTB is a laptop-like Stand that can temporarily erase memories and replace them with an input. The target will follow the input until its memories are restored. My character at one point decides to replace all his past memories with a simple input, like when Koichi saves his mother from The Rock: the input is "Be proud of yourself". Shortly after he realizes that WDYWTB's User, a minor villain, accepted the thing because Brick in the Wall literally represents his past memories, and when they are deleted BitW literally doesn't exist and his User is powerless. When he gets his memories back, though, the protagonist beats the shit out of him. Did you like this concept?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks! I thought about my Stands more like as Wounds from Jorge Joestar, that are powers generated from past traumas. Most of my Stands are like this, like Crystal Dolphin is the desire of its User (literally an extremely intelligent dolphin) to live with humans and explore the world and Jigsaw Puzzle's User, as the song says, "has been an outcast all her life" and wants to be distant from anyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Neat. My Jigsaw Puzzle (named after the Rolling Stones' song) is instead a shapeshifting Stand taking the form of a puzzle of User's choice: when the puzzle is solved, it turns into a bomb. Each puzzle has different properties (a jigsaw, if laid on the ground, becomes a sort of landmine, a Rubik's cube becomes a grenade etc), and the more it's difficult the more the bomb is powerful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lo Spacciatore di Fumetti (it's italian only I think, literally The Comic Book Dealer) and Fahrenheit 451. The first one is a nice little story about four hungarian boys who sell and buy comic books, that are not well accepted in their society (it's set in the 1980s), while the second one is a memorable classic of dystopian literature about a world where books are illegal, so that there cannot be people smarter than others and everyone can be happy.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>No idea if this is pertinent, but does anyone have the YuGiOh Dungeon Dice Monsters tiled board template?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-05 11:57:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I was going to ask on r/yugioh, but then I realized there's this sub. I don't know if I can even ask these kind of question or if they must be pertinent to TCG, so I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules. Anyway, the thing is that I like Dungeon Dice Monsters but, as many of us know, it's pretty rare right now and the sets cost A LOT (also I don't care really much of the GBA game, since I don't own a GBA rn). It may sound pretty stupid, but I actually want to "recreate" it myself: I can find and print the cards and some of the game pieces on the Internet and can easily replace some of them (no idea of what to do with the figurines though), but I can't seem to find the board. So, by any chance, does anyone of you have a template of it? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What I think is that all the books after The Long Haul are a different universe. In DOAWK Greg was in 6th grade, in Rodrick Rules and The Last Straw he was in 7th grade, in Dog Days it was the Summer between 7th and 8th grade and from The Hard Truth to Hard Luck Greg was in 8th grade, and that's where the original universe ends, without us knowing whether he finally goes to High school or not. The Long Haul is instead set in an alternate universe where the events of the first book happened, but Greg doesn't spend the entire Summer between 6th and 7th grade doing swimming lessons because of his mother suggesting to go on the road trip. So in all the other books he's still in middle school, but all the events from Rodrick Rules to Hard Luck didn't happen, and the same thing could be applied to the movies.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think I ruined religion to myself. A couple of years ago at one point I decided I would have been a better Christian boi for the rest of my life. Result: I became a bigoted 13 year old who respected other religions, but hated to death any kind of sinners/sins/non religious people/any kind of religious satire. Then during the first year of High School (14 years old) I calmed down and became a lot more respectful and tolerant, I even started making some atheist friends and one of them is my best friend rn, but I still went to church and practised my religion. Then I became paranoid and anxious because I didn't feel like I was a good Christian, I failed to focus in Church, I would consider doing "sinful" stuff, I read about people not seeing anything after being clinically dead, people at my school didn't exactly respect my beliefs etc. Then at 15 at one point I started masturbating. I felt bad because I always swore I'd stop, but I'd never keep the promise. At that point I thought that if everything I'm doing for my religion is just feeling bad for myself, I might as well stop. And so I stopped caring. I'm agnostic now and I masturbate like every sane person does. I've told a couple of my friends I don't care about what to believe in and they told me I've done it right, but still haven't told my family. Sometimes I still get pissed if someone openly insults other religions, but that's just because I feel everyone should believe in whatever makes them happy with their lives. Except bigots.</TEXT>

Since in part 4 of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure we find out that Joseph Joestar (protagonist of part 2 and main ally of part 3) had an affair 16 years before with a japanese college student even though he was already married and had a daughter and a grandson (Jotaro Kujo, protagonist of part 3) and that all descendants of the Joestar family have a star birthmark on their neck the guy just assumed that JoJoseph had another affair with an orange Also, the other guy sees a Dragon Ball</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was trying to defend Friend from getting his ass whooped by our common Nemesis. We were on a field trip at a castle and we were doing some games. Anyway, one game was about drawings. Nemesis made a really crude drawing of a knight. Friend laughed because (his words) it reminded him of the Sanic meme (CuMoN sTeP iT uP). Nemesis starts marching towards him to kick his ass. Me and Other Friend start to block him (nothing serious, just standing in front of him). Teachers yell only at Me, Friend who was gonna get his ass beaten and Nemesis (Other Friend was like "Cool, I'm not in trouble) and threaten to get us all suspended and to never allow us to speak to each other again. Then they told our parents about the entire thing. Except for having my day ruined and a bad mark on the school register, I didn't get into much trouble. My mother understood my reasons and just didn't let me watch TV for the day and warned me about being friends with Friend (Who was a guy who would get in trouble often)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sonic 06 and Sonic Boom. 06 had the potential of being the REAL Adventure 2 sequel, but the rushed development didn't help. The plot revolving around time travel and the human world could've been cool, but the real one is a joke. Same thing for Sonic Synergy: a nice experiment to implement multiplayer battles and beat-em up gameplay into a series only known for platformers and mediocre spin offs, but (Guess what?) It was rushed and now it's known as Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric, one of the worst Sonic games in existance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't speak on a very personal level (I've yet to play both games), but here's what I think: 06 had a shitton of potential. It's bad because of the rushed development. The story, the gameplay, the idea behind it could've potentially been cool, but sadly it isn't. We could've had a Sonic Adventure 3, but all we got was the reason why Sonic Haters are still a thing; On the other hand I think Colors/Colours is a good game gameplay-wise, but because of the aiming at a new, younger audience, it really lacks story-wise. I clearly understand the motives behind Baldy McNoseHair and the other bad jokes, but that's not how I really like it. In the end both games have great potential, just Colors seems better because at least it's playable and people don't seem to bash it like everything else in the franchise (the old design, the movie in general, the 3d games, 06, Sonic Boom etc)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your  #8216;left #8217;? Or the one on your  #8216;right #8217;? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is  #8216;correct #8217; too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute  #8216;society #8217; with the  #8216;Universe #8217;. The correct answer is that  #8216;It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first. #8217;  #8230;Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there #8217;s no choice but for others to also take the  #8216;right #8217; napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is  #8216;society #8217; #8230; Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of  #8216;right or left? #8217;! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who  #8216;takes the napkin first #8217; must be someone who is respected by all. It #8217;s not that anyone can fulfill this role #8230; Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the  #8216;losers #8217;. In the case of this table, the  #8216;eldest #8217; or the  #8216;Master of the party #8217; will take the napkin first #8230; Because everyone  #8216;respects #8217; those individuals. I'm very sorry for all non JoJo fans, but I had to do it</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Diavolo sees what happens in the next 10 seconds with Epitaph. He doesn't like it. Therefore he activates KC. In the 10 seconds KC is active everyone will keep on doing what they would normally do except Diavolo. Diavolo can freely move himself and any extension of himself (like his blood) and "escape" the prediction of Epitaph, but cannot interact with anything. That's the reason why he mostly uses KC to avoid attacks and reposition himself in a strategical place. At the end of that 10 second period, no one except Diavolo will remember what happened. Anything that happened during those 10 seconds will be erased from existance, and only the results of those actions will last. Time will seem to "jump" 10 seconds forward, but only Diavolo experienced those 10 seconds. Essentially, watch a YouTube video and skip 10 seconds forward. To you, it will seem like time has jumped forward. You won't experience what happened in the 10 seconds you skipped, but their result will be seen in the scene you skipped to. It's pretty fuckin' easy to understand</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Simple, those actions were fated to happen. Without using KC, Diavolo would have still cut Trish's hand and impale Narancia, but people would have seen him, so he skips time to reposition himself to not be seen. The thing is that when he skips time not only everyone will keep on doing what they were fated to do, every action accomplished by Diavolo that was predicted by Epitaph would still play out as normal. Even if he skipped time Trish's hand would have still be cut by him and so he would impale Narancia, and since he changed position those actions would still happen, but apparently by themselves. Essentially, only the position of Diavolo and strictly connected parts of his body can change during a skip, while others' and his actions cannot change if predicted by Epitaph.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>FF Crystal Chronicles (GC) won't link more than 2 VBAs for multiplayer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-08 14:13:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm fairly new to Dolphin and emulation in general so I'll explain it the best I can. I'm currently using: *VBA-M 2.1.4 for GBA emulation* *Dolphin 5.0-12247 for GC emulation* I'm mainly interested in using both emulators to play games that strictly use GBA and GC connectivity for multiplayer, that is, Four Swords Adventures and Crystal Chronicles. So I set up both emulators following tutorial online (toggled Pause when inactive off, installed the GBA bios, toggled Local Mode and Link at boot, selected GBAs as all controllers) and tried it on FSA and, as expected, the whole thing works fairly well: first I tried only one GBA in single player, then 2 and at the end 4 in multiplayer and, well, it works as a GBA would work on real hardware. Then I tried the same thing on Crystal Chronicles and, for some reason, it doesn't work. Here, cases are three: 1) If I open the bios on VBA AFTER opening Crystal Chronicles, most times it won't link. 2) If I open the bios on VBA BEFORE opening Crystal Chronicles and boot the game up, it connects for a while (the shining NINTENDO logo appears on VBA's screen), but then it resets and won't link. 3) If I open the bios on VBA AFTER opening Crystal Chronicles AND it works, when I try to link another GBA it won't link. Can anyone tell me if this a common problem and, if yes, how to fix it? Am I doing something wrong? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Josuke Higashikata (from part 4, Gappy is a good boi). I honestly think he's a very uninteresting and boring character. I mean his stand and backstory are all cool and shit but he just comes off as this guy who kicks whoever slightly disrespects his hair's ass, just stands there being like "I'm the protagonist so I can't be boring" and acts like a bored asshole the entire time. If every JoJo has something that makes him unique from the other JoJos (Jonathan is the most good-hearted and noble, Joseph is a jerkass who almost never takes things outside of battles seriously, Jotaro is violent and rude but moved by noble feelings, Giorno is essentially a chaotic good version of DIO, Jolyne is a female and more troubled and rebel version of Jotaro, Johnny is egotistical and the least noble of the Joestars and Gappy is this awkward and weird boi), I feel like Josuke just doesn't have anything original to offer. Hell, Koichi feels more protagonist than Josuke feels IN THE PART WHERE HE IS THE FUCKING PROTAGONIST FOR GOD'S SAKE. But everyone loves him and he's Araki's favourite character.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So, I was having a normal day and then these tall and menacing guys from the ghetto get into the drive in section with their car and start ordering. The first 3 guys all order a normal amount of stuff. Then this other guy starts saying "I #8217;ll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda". And I had to cook all that stuff and give it to him. I don't even know how and if he managed to eat all that shit. I work at a Cluckin' Bell in Los Santos btw</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, the only reason I still haven't turned into an atheist (I'm turning agnostic rn) is because a LOT of self-declared atheists I've come across online act like close-minded, racist and intollerant motherfuckers who think anyone who believes in any form of religion should be publicly impaled on burning stakes, that every Church and religious place and text should be destroyed to "save the world from the religious plague" and ironically have the balls to call out religious people as "close-minded, racist and intollerant motherfuckers". I KNOW a lot bigoted and annoying believers exist and that a lot of atheists are tollerant and nice to everyone like you and everyone who replied are (hell, my current best friend is an atheist, but never brings the thing up and I liked him even when I was religious), but the fact that a lot of atheists won't even let religious people LIVE just ruins atheism to me</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Theseus' ship will always be my favourite. Essentially, you have a wooden ship and every time a piece rots or breaks, you replace it with a new one. You reach one point where you replace the last remaining original piece. Now that the boat is completely made of new wood, the question is: Is it the same ship? It's still the original ship with new pieces or it's a completely different ship? And if someone finds a way to treat the rotten wood and completely rebuild the ship with the original pieces?</TEXT>
