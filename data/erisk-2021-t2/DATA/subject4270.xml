    <TEXT>What kind of manager would Wenger be if he didn't put faith in his players? I don't think Wenger expects much, but he thinks long-term for both his players and his team. Honestly don't know what you mean by recover. Does he have anything to recover from? He's obviously not good enough to carry our team. He probably isn't even good enough to be the main starter of any team in Premier League, but he could improve drastically, and he's got the talent to do so.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No they don't really have a good record. Last time they won was first time in 7 years. I think it's a decent bet considering what I said about Stoke away and the fact that Stoke are 9 points ahead of Leicester. Ofc Leicester won 2 out of their last 3 games, but not very convincingly and those were against pretty bad sides (Hull and Aston Villa). Stoke don't have very bad form either apart from the hammering against Arsenal (Win vs Everton, West Brom, Tie vs Man U).</TEXT>

He has great awareness and is very technically gifted. I'm almost certain he'll make it far. Apparently Norbert Elgert (might have been some other schalke u19 couch) said to Rubio that if he joins he will become an Schalke 04 a-team player within time. That's why Rubio wanted to join.

    <TEXT>I think Ramsey, Welbeck, Bellerin and Cazorla were guilty of not being able to keep the ball within our team, and they didn't do much individually going forward during our counter-attacks either. Tottenham did a good job with their pressure play and most of our players looked stressed. Rosicky should've started cause he's excellent at keeping the ball in a counter-attacking strategy and he's very calm, consistent and experienced.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You've gotta be real fucking intelligent to be at the top in football, I'll tell you that. They may not be super wise, but they're not trying to be, and the rapid thinking, creativity and decision-making is really impressive of most footballers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Doesn't that still make him intelligent though? I mean it's not like he's just seeing stuff and passing with his feet. His subconcious mind is constantly doing multiple calculations that someone with an average mind couldn't do. I'm pretty sure that genius doesn't only apply to his football. It's not really that impressive to become a business guru, brilliant mathematician or a great engineer compared to what  #214;zil's doing. I think most people, if they try hard enough, can become those things. Most people that are imo considered intelligent, are trying really hard to be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's definitely doing calculations, and very very qucikly. Almost in an instant. For example, measuring the weight of his passes at the same time as having to know where the player he passes to is going to be, and he always does it perfectly. I don't see how his minds capacity doesn't apply to other things than just football. I'm sure that if he'd choosen another career that involves subconcious thinking, he'd be a genius at that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, I genuinely thought you weren't serious because I couldn't make any sense of your comment, and when you tried to explain I had to point out that it's just a gif and it's nothing to get angry about. Ever since we bought  #214;zil he's been a starter and we're now close to our 2nd FA-cup title in a row. He starts week in week out. Do you think Arsene just says "yeah, fuck it, let's play him even though he's been shit". If you can't see what  #214;zil does for the team I suggest you look closer. In this gif he created a chance that very few players in the world are capable of, that's what  #214;zil does, and you say "Whenever he does something cool (like the gif in the OP) he fails to actually deliver a final ball" when it clearly looked like walcott should've got on the end of it. You even go on about "his shooting is absolutely dire" when he barely even shoots. That's delusional to me.</TEXT>

His task is to drift around the pitch and pass the ball into areas and he does it perfectly and I can't make it sound much more glorified. That's just how it is.</TEXT>

AIK is usually a very strong derby team. Goitom is also back from suspension. If this was just an away game for AIK against any other team as good as Hammarby, AIK would be valued below 1.7.</TEXT>
