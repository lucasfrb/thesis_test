    <DATE>2020-03-19 20:52:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got an axolotl from a pet super mart when it was just a baby . It had marks on it but I got it anyways because it was the most active out of the axolotls available and I thought they would go away . It #8217;s been a year or two since getting it and it still has weird short gills and ugly white spots as well as a weird lumpy spot on its back . Anything I can do or is my axolotl always going to be an ugly little water turd ? It #8217;s a wild variety if anyone was wondering</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Diy/cheap aquarium chiller???</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-25 22:10:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have 3 silly little axolotls that I keep in a 30 gallon aquarium and though my room does stay relatively cold I think but they #8217;d be happier if their tank was colder . My room stays at about 70-72 degrees f , and sometimes a little hotter in the summer . I #8217;m looking to spend no more than $50 on a chiller but I can #8217;t find anything that #8217;s affordable for me . Any way to make a diy chiller or does anyone know of any super cheap chillers that work well ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the past 8 or so years my mom #8217;s boyfriend has been living with us . At first he was somewhat nice but now he #8217;s absolutely unbearable to be around . I #8217;ve recorded him calling me disgusting names someone should never call a a child and shown my mom and she accuses me of bringing that out of him . He #8217;s cussed me out and threatened to hit me in front of my mom several times out of the blue and she still says it #8217;s my fault . I #8217;ve asked him to leave and I told my mom I #8217;m going to move out to live with my abusive father (whom which lost custody of me after physical abusing me for years ) if her boytoy kept his crap up and she said  #8220;good luck #8221; . Obviously I won #8217;t move out to live with him , I just wanted to see what she #8217;d say . What can I do ? I can #8217;t move out for another 2 years because I am 16 and my mom won #8217;t kick him out .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand the pain you #8217;re going through with this . I #8217;ve felt the same way . Don #8217;t try to fight the pain or make it go away . Resisting it only makes it worse . Let me give you a little insight on my story : I was in a relationship for almost a year (yeah I know , not very long) but I #8217;m that year I fell very in love with my ex . Unfortunately, my ex had a very bad drug habit and although he possessed many qualities I really liked about them , I couldn #8217;t accept it and he wasn #8217;t willing to change for me . He #8217;d do hard drugs on a regular basis . I at first I felt like I #8217;d just made a horrible mistake and begged for a second chance , but he #8217;d declined and replaced me almost immediately. I felt worthless and unloveable . My feelings for him only grew stronger after it was all over . I tried fighting my feelings and pushing them out of my head but that only made it way worse . The only way I began to get over him was by not caring about the feelings I had for him . I didn #8217;t fight them . They were just there . Every time I thought about him I just found something to distract myself . At first it was hard because the very thought of him flooded my consciousness , but soon it began to work . I would binge watch tv , play video games , play around with my fish tanks , or hang out with friends to clear my head . I unfortunately still think about him on occasion and I still posses those feelings but they have definitely weakened a lot . I #8217;d try to find a hobby that really requires some brain power to get your mind off things if I was you . Also another thing I #8217;d recommend you is to try psychedelics. I know you might shake your head at me for saying that and I know it sort of contradicts what I #8217;ve said previously, but it really helped me a lot along with the combination of my coping strategy previously listed . It really helps you understand what to really value in life and what to let go of . I wish you the best of luck and I hope my advise was helpful to you .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The tie dye phase . Everyday for the entire first semester of my 6th grade year I #8217;d wear tie dye shirts , knee length shorts and .99 cent flip flops from Walmart , and spent more time watching anime than I did going to school and socialising . I didn #8217;t stop wearing tie dye until my history teacher told me I looked like a retarded , poor hippie wearing the same stuff everyday . I have not worn a tie dye shirt in years because of him . I still spent my days mindlessly watching hours of anime but slowly began to stop because his criticism made me rethink everything I did at the time because I have horrible anxiety issues , and started doing things a little more socially acceptable. I know it might not sound that bad compared to everyone else #8217;s story #8217;s here , but that #8217;s really my worst phase I #8217;ve experienced so far and hopefully that doesn #8217;t change in the future .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have to correct you and tell you that your belief that this is bullshit is ... well bullshit . Truly ambidextrous people are born with the ability to use both hands interchangeably - it cannot be learned , as given in your example of your father . People that are truly ambidextrous often do experience learning difficulties . People that have a single dominate hand or learn to effectively use their non-dominant hand exhibit asymmetry within the two hemispheres of the brain ; basically meaning complex areas of the brain can be present in only one hemisphere of the brain , allowing for more effective thinking and language abilities . People that are ambidextrous have very symmetrical brains , which makes speech and language comprehension very difficult , and is commonly associated with some mental disorders , such as ADHD and bipolar depression . I only know all this because I'm very linguistically challenged most likely because I'm ambidextrous , according to my doctors .</TEXT>

It's horrible that Floyd was killed , but people don't have to act like complete animals and blow up gas stations or kill people . People are just using this as an excuse to steal stuff and destroy property . They're not really hurting the government ; they're destroying innocent people's properties and families , just like those cops destroyed an innocent man's life . Every single one of those violently protesting should be ashamed of themselves for associating such horrid behaviour with Floyd's name .</TEXT>

She was in her very own car since correction officers are not issued cop cars . She is a honest working cop and treats inmates respectfully as they should be . She did nothing wrong , and just because a few rotten eggs spoil the bunch she deals with crap like this . I know this isn't really violent like what a lot of cops are dealing with , but still this behaviour isn't acceptable at all .</TEXT>

They #8217;ve also been incredibly embarrassed to be around me whilst around other friends of theirs . I like to go out and do things with all my friends so it really bothered me that they didn #8217;t . I #8217;ve made several attempts to ask this friend to hang out and they denied . Because of this I #8217;ve told them I no longer want to be friends ,but rather just acquaintances . They said it was incredibly rude to do that to them and I #8217;m a horrible friend . Was it wrong of me to do this ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Grow thick skin . That #8217;s what I did . My parents are kind of the same . Overprotective, judgemental , manipulative . Shield yourself from the insults by just not caring . It #8217;s an easy skill to acquire when you #8217;re surrounded by negativity constantly . Sorry if this sounds silly and blunt , but not caring helped me and I think it could help you too .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My neighbor is a very nice man , but very odd . He has autism and often does very weird things and asks us vet weird questions . I could write an endless list about my weird experiences with him , but I #8217;ll only say some of the notable : he invited my step dad to a  #8220;mind opening drum session #8221; and asked if he wanted to have  #8220;mind expanding tea #8221; with him . I can only imagine what that means ._. He also leaves various grocery goods at our door for no reason . We have a door camera and have him recorded dropping off the goods and he never admits to it . He left an entire milk fish at our door one night and we didn #8217;t find it till the day after because he didn #8217;t ring the bell . He ran up to my family once while doing yard work with his dog and paper work and said that he has a passport for his dog and to please not report the dog so it doesn #8217;t get deported ......... again super nice guy , just a little weird .</TEXT>

I #8217;ve met several people with autism through my club and none of them are super geniuses or super humans . Autism is a burden , not a gift in most situations, but that #8217;s how it #8217;s always shown in media . I #8217;ve had autistic kids tell me they #8217;re ashamed of themselves and feel like failures because they #8217;re not incredibly gifted like almost every single autistic person in every single show and movie . It really makes me sad . I really liked the movie Temple Grandin for showing its audience how difficult it is to be autistic .</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Some tips that could help you overcome your depression</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-25 02:34:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had issues with my depression for a few years now and unfortunately I still do , but I #8217;ve found some things that have helped me out when things got really bad that I #8217;d like to share with anyone else dealing with this : 1. Shower everyday - it feels really good and refreshing and it helps you keep tract of time . It #8217;s good to maintain other forms of hygiene as well obviously 2. Sleeping normally - create a sleeping schedule and stick to it . Try to not take some sort of sleep aid if possible. 3. Spend some time outside - doesn #8217;t have to be a crazy amount of time . Go take a walk on a sunny day or garden in your yard . 4. Find something very engaging to occupy your time - this keeps you from overthinking . Could be video games , jobs , hobbies . 5. Try to avoid people , places or things that cause you emotional stress- toxic friends and family , things you have associated to traumatic memories , etc . I #8217;m definitely not a professional and would recommend seeking help if your depression is really bad . Hope this advice could help .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My cat got neutered a few weeks back supposedly. When i got him home from the vet I didn #8217;t check his stitches right away because I didn #8217;t want to freak him out . I didn #8217;t check until about a week and a half to two weeks later and he didn #8217;t appear to have any stitching or healing . Just looked like nothing ever happened. He still has what appears to be balls . Was he not neutered?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I , like many of my fellow teens , needed some cash to buy stuff and was having a hard time finding a job . I made the wretched mistake of going on Craigslist to put up an ad for work because I had no idea how creepy it was . Within less than an hour I got a message from a random number , as I had put my number down as contact information in the ad ..... this creep was calling me all sorts of weird kinky names . I told him he was making me uncomfortable , that I was not interested in whatever job he had to offer ,and to have a good day . He then told me stuff like  #8220;YoU #8217;Re a WhOrE #8221; and  #8220;I #8217;Ll gIVe YoU mOnEY! #8221;..... I called him and chewed his a*s out on the phone for talking to me like that and saying that to someone that he knew was underaged (In my state labour laws enforce mandatory breaks every 4 hours for minors so I thought including that I was underaged was crucial) .... and then he told me I was a pretty princess and I proceeded to block him . Delete all my messages and call history from him and now I #8217;m here typing on reddit . I would recommend this cite to anyone wishing to waste their time talking to nasty old perverts online .</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Can I do an engine swap on a 04 cavalier with a Corolla ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-05 00:27:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have a 2004 cavalier that is very important to me . It was my Grandfathers car that he drove for a very long time . It has no problems right now and I just swapped out a few parts in it . When the engine stops functioning later on can I do an engine swap with a Corolla ? Cavaliers aren #8217;t too common where I live . I #8217;m aware that replacing the engine would exceed the value of the car . All helpful comments will be greatly appreciated ! Edit : thanks everyone for the advice ! I #8217;ll stick to cavalier parts !</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know how hard it can be to lose a friend , especially at this age . One of my closest friends passed away from suicide 1 and a half years ago . It was so sudden and surprising . She was so upbeat , sweet , and never ever seemed sad . It happened over a weekend and I had not heard about her passing until the Monday after when a school counsellor informed us . I thought the counsellor was lying . I texted and called her after I heard that because I couldn #8217;t believe it and I never got a response . I was so shocked and sad that I ran out of 1st period , left the school and ran home . I couldn #8217;t handle it . One of the most painful parts about her passing is that I never learned why . Her parents and the school counsellors wouldn #8217;t tell me anything . I never found out if it was accidental or on purpose . To this day I still feel guilty because I feel like I didn #8217;t do enough for her . Anything I see or hear that I associate with her brings me to tears even to this day . I hope you don #8217;t feel even half the pain I felt and I hope you #8217;re able to healthily cope with the loss of your friend . Move on but don #8217;t ever forget him . Keep his memories alive .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got diagnosed with bipolar , adhd , depression , extreme ocd and anxiety , and tics at the age of 15 . My mom for years accused me of being a bad kid out of my own self will and refused to take me to a psychiatrist . She didn #8217;t want to get me checked out because she didn #8217;t believe in mental disorders and also she was so sick of taking me to appointments for physical problems I suffered from .I didn #8217;t see one until I had an appointment with my regular paediatrician and told her I literally cannot control myself , physically and emotionally , and that I have a very very very difficult time in school and she told my mom I have to see a psych . At first when I got diagnosed my mom said she #8217;s not going to have me taking  #8220;ret**d pills #8221; ...... oh boy did my psychiatrist looooooovvveeeee her . Long story short , despite my mom thinking I don #8217;t need meds and I #8217;ll grow out of my problems , my psych was able to convince her to let me have meds (by threatening her and telling her it #8217;s borderline child abuse). My mom is just so amazing ! I #8217;m sorry to anyone else that has this problem . Nobody in the world deserves to suffer from treatable illnesses .</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-08 23:09:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I suffer from bipolar 1 , very bad adhd , ocd , PTSD , and bad anxiety . My parents and sister are absolutely disgusting people and don #8217;t treat me as if I #8217;m equal to them . I am currently on vacation with just my mom and sister at my relatives #8217; house . My sister left her shoes by where I was sleeping and I put them on to give to her . I walked over and took them off and saw her using my blanket and my mom ,as a punishment for putting my sister #8217;s shoes on to bring to her ,told me that my sister has a very infectious fungal infection . It sounds stupid that I believed it now that I look back but I completely fell for it . I was completely distraught and panicking . I ran to the nearest bathroom , turned the shower on , and scrubbed my sunburnt body as hard as I could because I am extremely afraid of the thought of something living on me . I cried as I scrubbed because I was in excruciating pain , both physically and mentally . I found some hydrogen peroxide and rubbed it all over me to kill anything I might have gotten from her . I put clothes on and screamed at her for not telling me she had something sooner in front of my aunt , uncle , baby cousins , and grandpa . I completely forgot about everyone but her at the moment and didn #8217;t even see that they were there . My mom and sister laughed at me and told me it was a joke they told so I wouldn #8217;t touch her stuff again . I started to hysterically cry in front of my mom , sister , and family members I hardly knew . I felt so embarrassed so I hid and I #8217;m still hiding now . I hate being around them so much . Every day is living hell if they #8217;re in it . Not only do they call me nasty names and make fun of me for everything that #8217;s wrong with me , they also toy with me as a form of self enjoyment . It #8217;s hard enough dealing with my mental problems and it #8217;s even harder because of them .</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I got my first car to finally work !</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-09 01:37:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got a free cavalier from my grandpa that he had left exposed to the elements with the windows open for a few years ..... the car smelled like a mix of death , gasoline , burnt something , and poop . When I first got the car the seats were a nice rustic old brown and the carpets were a dark brown ....... I thought they were supposed to be that colour . I took the seats out to shampoo and pressure wash them because they had a very pungent aroma ....... they #8217;re blue . Then I started cleaning the carpet and that ended up actually being black . I #8217;m still grossed out by the fact that I sat in that thing before it was cleaned . After taking all the seats out I found random cut up cords in the trunk of the car that had burnt the car Somehow ?I don #8217;t know why they were there and I have yet to get an answer . I replaced a few interior plastic pieces in the car because they were sunburnt and cracked if you even poked them . Had to get a new windshield because the first one was covered in goat hoof marks . The goats also partially ate a mirror as well and I got a replacement at a junkyard for free . Replaced the battery and a few other parts under the hood . Everything works now except for the radio ! Just need to possibly do a paint job on it , though I likely won #8217;t because it #8217;s just not worth the price . It runs great , though it still smells odd . Thought I #8217;d share since it was a really big accomplishment for me .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Instead of spending the the whole day melting to my bed and wasting away in my dark bedroom I decided to hang out with a friend at a local community neighbourhood park today . I saw a lady there that I had a problematic encounter with in the past , but I decided to just ignore her and try to enjoy the beautiful and sunny weather . I sat at a bench with my friend after counting all the pp #8217;s etched and drawn into the playground and attempting to climb on the monkey bars with my weak little lady spaghetti arms . We pulled out our phones and this is where the problem began ....... I heard someone yelling at me to stop recording the and realised it was the problematic lady mentioned before . She specifically targeted me . I told her neither of us were recording her . She demanded to go through my gallery . I said no for obvious reasons. She cursed at me , called me a sheep for wearing a mask , said she #8217;d break my phone , and threatened calling the cops . I just decided that it was time to go and that was the end of the ordeal . Moral of the story : stay inside glued to screens to avoid all the crazies outside .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was taking a walk one day when I saw a female mallard with a freaking arrow on its side . The poor thing looked like it was so uncomfortable . The arrow was cut in half and only the pointed half remained . It looked as if someone tried to remove it and failed . I grabbed the duck , which was quiet easy to do since it was in so much pain , and walked her home (got a few looks from joggers) . I got hydrogen peroxide , flour , and wipes and got right to business . The arrow wasn #8217;t in too deep and didn #8217;t cause much bleeding . I patched the hole with a little bit of flour to stop the bleeding which I later gently washed off . Scrubbed her well to avoid infection . I kept her in my tub while my parents were at work and released her in the morning . I now see her every so often on my walks and I know it #8217;s her because she has a slight limp . It #8217;s been 3 months since the removal .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just recently gotten a 60 gallon tank for my 3 axies . I have a fantastic canister filter thats meant for a 200 gallon tank that does wonders and keeps the water crystal clear . I modded the filter so that when water left it to go back in the tank it wouldn #8217;t move the water too much and make the axies stressed . I have diagnosed ocd and clean any poop or extra food up immediately because the idea of my little babies being near that makes me feel uncomfortable . I was planning on getting one more . Out of nowhere this this morning a friend of my previous teacher called asking if I #8217;d take 4 axolotls for free since she #8217;s moving . She has tanks in her classrooms that she keeps them in , but she #8217;s moving and the tanks belong to the school so she has nowhere to keep them . How many axolotls could I keep in a 60 that I clean very often with a lot of hides ?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-17 17:52:35</DATE>
    <TEXT>My axolotl is 4 years old and for the past few months she has been very skinny and has small gills. I separate her while feeding and make sure the eats plenty and leave her in a container after feeding for a few hours to see if she throws up but she never does . Her 2 tank mates are fat and happy . She doesn #8217;t act unhealthy but she looks really gross . I #8217;ve tried treating her for parasites and fungal infections to no avail . What do I do ??? Is it possibly an autoimmune disease ? I knew from the time I got her she #8217;d be problematic . I got her from a pet land for half off because she was not well . Edit : Her diet consists of Earth worms I raise myself , salmon pellets , occasionally egg whites and tiny pieces of chicken . Also I don #8217;t know how to upload pictures via a link or comment or whatever so I will private message pictures if you want to see her .</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-07-22 19:25:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>My dog hasn #8217;t been feeling it too well lately . This morning she decided to come in my room and projectile poop on my carpet . I started to clean this brown sludge off my floor while my mom walked by . She started screaming and literally crying when she saw it and said I #8217;m so disrespectful for having such a messy room . I had a laundry basket to unload and the partially cleaned dog crap but otherwise my room was spotless . She screamed at me to clean the dog crap WHILE I WAS CLEANING IT ! She then pulled our shampoo vacuum out of the garage and started to shampoo my carpet while crying . I have no idea why she was crying . After she finished she told me I #8217;m disgusting and she #8217;s embarrassed to have someone so dirty live in her house . I CANNOT CONTROL MY DOG #8217;S FREAKING ASSHOLE !!! HOW WAS I BEING DISGUSTING ?!?! I told her if the sight of dog crap is going to cause her to have a panic attack then she needs to get checked out . She called me a  #8220;bitch #8221; for apparently saying she was insane . Never said that . Just said she needed help (though she probably is insane) . Only one year and one month of living with her to go !  #128522;</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My government has failed me .(not a cliche edgy boring teen rant)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-26 02:59:50</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know a lot of stuff on this sub is pretty silly and in the long run very irrelevant , but I have something very serious I need to say : The US Government has failed myself , my family , and every other citizen in this  #8220;free #8221; country . I am free . My mother and father are free . My sisters and brother are free . My aunts , uncles and cousins are free . Do you know who else is free ? Abusive parents , pedophiles , murderous cops , and most unfortunately in this situation , rapists . Someone very close to me was drugged and touched in ways nobody should ever be touched without consent and when legal action was taken against the rapist , nothing happened . Because the rapist was also a minor whom which lied about the victim supposedly giving consent whilst knocked out , little could be done . The case has not been officially ended , but at this point it might as well . This horrible person is still free , and so is my friend , but she isn #8217;t . Every day she feels dirty and scrubs herself raw , and feels wh0r #238;sh revealing any skin . She blames herself for what happened . She blames herself for being drugged , slowly undressed , sprawled out on a bed , and used like a tool . She lives in fear and horror knowing he #8217;s out living his life ; she is afraid that he will do this to yet another innocent little girl . He was able to walk free because the US government is a piece of crap and and doesn #8217;t give a rat #8217;s butt about who suffers . I know a lot of people won #8217;t see this , but to those that do that live in the US , I am truly sorry and I hope if anything like this happens to you or someone you know that the government won #8217;t fail you , because it definitely did for my beloved friend . I want everyone to know that if anything every happens to any of you , you have family and friends that love you and will care for you even when you legally cannot be protected . I really do not wish this hell on anyone and please be safe and be strong . Peace guys !</TEXT>

Most table salt has iodine in it which can react with your axolotls and make them unnaturally morph into a land dwelling axolotl.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Before you jump to conclusions , no I #8217;m not a vegan . I #8217;ve been trying to avoid dairy as much as possible because it makes my bad acne worse . Since completely stopping diary , my acne is much better . I have allergies to all nuts , sunflowers , sesame , and soy .... is there any dairy free cheeses ? All the vegan cheeses I could find were made from nuts and soy . Would eating dairy free cheese cause my acne to return ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I got a rescue about 2 weeks ago and he was very skinny . He was eating well and started putting on some mass BUT he stopped eating a few days ago and he #8217;s losing weight fast ! How can I get him to eat ? I #8217;ve separated him in a tub and the other 3 i rescued with him are doing great . Getting nice and fat and are finally eating worms from my hands . They have bad gills from ammonia burn from the previous owners but otherwise good . My little guy that decided to stop eating looks sickly thin and I #8217;m afraid I #8217;m going to lose him . I tried worm , pellets , bloodworms , egg whites . He won #8217;t take any of them . Any ideas on what I can do ? He doesn #8217;t appear to have a fungal infection and I #8217;ve used a dewormer without iodine in it designed for aquariums in case he does have intestinal parasites .</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve been having a problem lately . I feel like I have to urinate even though I don #8217;t have to , especially at night .

I #8217;ve had this problem for about a month now . Is it a result of stress or anxiety ? I don #8217;t really experience the feeling of having to urinate unless I think about it , especially at night .

    <TEXT>God bless every single one of you guys ! I can only imagine how crumby and aggravating it must be for you to work and teach during these dire times . I #8217;m so proud of every single one of you guys for doing your best to keep students educated and safe . We will get through this ! Also I #8217;d like to just say I am horribly sorry for elective teachers ; many have lost their jobs , especially where I #8217;m from due to being deemed non essential . I think every teacher and topic is incredibly important and I really hope all teacher who have lost their jobs are able to cope with this and find employment soon ! I wish every one of you the best of luck ! Have a fantastic day and school year !</TEXT>

Just think of all the things you would miss . Yeah , things are shitty at times , and I understand how hard it can be to have ocd ; I #8217;ve been struggling with mental issues since I was a young kid , but you just have to fight all your problems to be able to see the beauty of life . I #8217;ve been molested by my father , I #8217;ve lost my best friend to suicide , I #8217;ve been in and out of the hospital because my bones and organs being deformed by my connective tissue disorder and the tissue holding my organs together is slowly wearing away , and I #8217;ve been dealing with mental issues caused by both crappy genetics and trauma ,but I still fight because I know some day all this fighting will pay off ! I want to see the world change and see my family grow up in front of my eyes . I want to find love and live to be an old wrinkly grandma and reminisce about all the good times I had when I was younger . You should want all these things to ! Ending this will only satisfy your twisted relative . Be a pain in the ass and live your life to spite them . Be an amazing and beautiful person and fight your obsessive compulsive disorder ! If your family and friends now don #8217;t care much for you find people that do ! Find people that love you , don #8217;t let your compulsion get the best of you , and live life for as long as possible .</TEXT>

The behaviouralist recommended I see a psychologist since many of my issues correlated with bipolar disorder . Since being diagnosed and treated with various medications my life has bettered , though the medications I take does hinder my ability to think clearly . I still experience minor depressive and manic episodes but it #8217;s not as extreme because the medications help with depression and stabilising my neurotransmitters . I still have some problems with my sleep and need to take medication to aid me to sleep , but for the most part my sleep is good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m so sick of people saying stuff like  #8220;omg I keep all my pencils organised because Im so ocd about my writing utensils . Im so quirky!!! #8221; and stuff like that . If you don #8217;t have it don #8217;t say you do . Don #8217;t even mutter the word ocd unless you #8217;re using it correctly . It #8217;s so annoying . It stands for obsessive compulsive disorder , not oohhhhhh so quirky organised c**t disorder . Do you know what it means to those suffering from it ? It means showering 3 times a day and scrubbing yourself almost raw because you feel dirty . It means rearranging your entire room to even feel comfortable enough to sit down and watch tv . It means sanitising every surface of your house several times a day because you literally cannot stop thinking about the possibility of germs growing and living in your house . It #8217;s completely losing your shit and having a mental break down if something on your desk is angled incorrectly . Checking on things dozens of times a day to make sure everything is ok even though you know it is but part of you says otherwise . Do you know who else I #8217;m sick of ??? People that claim to have depression when their perfect lives are ever so slightly bad . Just because your step dad walked out on your mom , or your family dog died doesn #8217;t mean you have depression . Depression is caused by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in your brain . It comes in waves . It isn #8217;t a one time thing . You can be depressed but that doesn #8217;t mean you have depression . I #8217;ve had problems my entire life because of my mental issues . I have OCD , Bipolar type 1 , ADHD , anxiety disorders , and PTSD . My life is living heck at times because of my problems . Hearing people claim to have issues they clearly don #8217;t is literally heart breaking . I #8217;ve been stuck on meds for years and spent countless hours in therapy . I #8217;ve been too sad to eat at times or even get up because of my issues . Every single person that claims to have issues they don #8217;t need to grow the heck up , stop mooching off the suffering of those inflicted with such issues , and get a gosh dang life !</TEXT>

Dentures , canes , mobility scooters , 2 inch thick glasses , fake baseball bats , sports balls , ropes , you name it ! As long as it #8217;s not too deadly it #8217;s good . Winners would be paid part of the profit made off the show and a pair of snazzy golden dentures . It would be named the retirement ring for obvious reasons . Anything to add on to it or removes?

    <TITLE>Hairstyle to cover thinning patches for females?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-14 17:52:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm 16 and I've started to experience the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Many people in my family have problems with their thyroid glands, but didn't develop issues until later in life. I got bloodwork done yesterday and sure enough I have it. One of the problems I'm having with it is hair loss. The hair especially around my hairline is thinning. Is there any braids or other hairdos I can try that can help cover it up some? I'm going back to school in a little less than 3 weeks and I really don't want people at my school to see it. Teenagers can be jerks. My hair is blonde, the back part of my hair goes about an inch or two past my collar bone and the front of my hair is 2-3 inches shorter. It's very thick and sort of fuzzy. The back measures 15 inches from the top of the back of my end to the tips, and the shortest part from my crown to the tips is 13 inches. My forehead is already big and my hair thinning is making it look bigger. It's especially thin where a widows peak would be; it's basically seethrough in those spots . It has made my hair uneven too to the point where I can't middle part it without looking dumb. I don't want to cut it or anything yet because I don't know if the other side will thin out. I would include a picture of my hair situation, but all my phones in my house are older and take very low quality pictures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My family has a history of thyroid gland problems. I started noticing my hair was thinning about a month ago. My mom thought I was seeing things at first, but when it started getting worse I got a blood test done that would tell me if I had a thyroid gland disorder, which are known to cause hair loss, and sure enough I did. My hair is really thinning around my hairline and makes my forehead look even bigger than it was before. I feel so sick to my stomach and all I want to do is cry because I think everyone who doesn't know what's wrong will bully me for it. I don't want to be known as that balding chick at school or something. I don't even want to go back to school because of it. Do you think I'll get bullied by other teens? I'm going back to school in 3 weeks. My start date was pushed back and my school is doing eLearning for a week. I'm literally terrified to go back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean no offence to this but if you're looking to cheat in an AP class before you're even starting it I highly doubt you're going to do well in it. AP classes online are very difficult. They take up a ton of time. You'd save time doing it in class. Also, if you take it in class, you can ask questions and get answers on the spot instead of waiting a long butt time. Any sort of AP math class is something you shouldn't mess with unless you feel very confident about your math skills and understand previous topics you've learned thoroughly.</TEXT>

Order pizzas to their address and request to pay in person, go online and sign them up for stuff using their number, go on [tellyourpartner.org](https://tellyourpartner.org). That last one is a real pain in the butt. It anonymously texts people that a previous sexual partner of theirs has an std. The website isn't secure and leaks numbers to insurance companies so he'll get called around the clock. Don't do anything very malicious. Don't leak his address and numbers online for the general public to see. There's a difference between having a laugh for tormenting an a$$hole and making a person genuinely fearful.

    <TEXT>Could you please include a picture? i'm a pretty avid gardener and have a ton of experience with identifying plants, despite my younger age. Depending on where you live, a controlled fire could be an option. You could also apply lye to your affected area depending on the plant. Lye will make the soil more alkaline and make it inhospitable for the nasty weeds, though you may need to plant new plants there that tolerate a high pH. Also, as stupid as this sounds, you could rent goats to eat it as long as it's not poisonous. It's actually pretty common around me for people to rent goats to eat an invasive plant from Asia called Kudzu. It's important to find an option that will cause the least amount of long term damage to your yard and local ecosystem.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can I get yellow stains off a white chicken?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-23 20:56:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have two splash silkies. They both have a good diet, clean bedding that is changed every other week, and are bathed to keep them looking fluffy and to avoid any infections to their feet since their feet are poop magnets, but I don't keep their coop entirely shaded so they get lots of sun. I think all the sunlight is the problem, but they love sun bathing so much so I'm not covering their coop all the way. I show my silkies and in the past I've used vinegar and dish soap to remove the yellowing, but it doesn't get all the yellow out. What else could I use?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Context: White chickens easily yellow when going about their regular ole chicken lives. I show this hen, along with a few others. I need to have them nice and perfect for shows so I bathe them often to get out some of the staining. In this picture I'm just using dish soap which is why the chicken looks a little yellow. Before shows I use dish soap and vinegar to get more of the yellow out, but I don't do that often because vinegar can be harsh on their skin. This chicken in the picture is a splash silkie. She has blue earlobes, black skin and meat, an extra toe, and a loving personality. In shows, I keep my chickens in a cage most of the time until it's time for a judge to inspect them.</TEXT>

I had a hard time getting him to eat at first, but now he #8217;s doing better and finally putting weight on. The one on the right is my Tobi. She was actually my first axolotl. I got her from a petstore that kept her in a nasty tank with cichlids because they thought she #8217;d eat any other fish. She has really bad scaring and her gills have never grown and I #8217;ve had her for about 4 years now, but she seems to healthy aside from that. She eats plenty and loves to bite my fingers. Almost all my axolotls are rescues.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I #8217;m in high school and today I had a zoom meeting for one of my classes. One of my teachers REALLY likes aquariums and saw mine behind me. My mic decided to just not want to work today and so every time he asked a question about my tank I had to type out everything. I had my light on because I turn my light on for about 30 minutes after I put pellets in the water to condition them to know to look for food when the light is on, and he saw one swim up and take a gulp of water and almost shat his pants with excitement and yelled  #8220;ITS AN OCELOTY #8221;, which scared the crap out of me. He proceeded to ask questions for like 10-15 minutes, all whilst not including the rest of the class and it was so incredibly awkward. I feel like everyone was watching me and I was so fricken embarrassed. I cant wait to start that class............ ._.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone! I own a few pet axolotls. I #8217;ve had a small clutches of eggs in the past and I #8217;m expecting to get more in the future. Would any teachers be interested in having some? Free of charge. You #8217;d only have to pay for shipping. The reason that I #8217;m wanting to do this is because I would love to help educators and also more likely than not, I will have way more axolotls than I #8217;ll be able to sell locally. They require 10 to 20 gallons per axolotl, need a temperature of 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit, and eat worms, salmon pellets, bloodworms, etc. US only. Feel free to message on this thread or private message me. I should have some babies ready to go by next spring. The colours I should have available are : golden albino, albino, wild, and melanistic.</TEXT>

I #8217;ve been having horrible pressure and pain in my joints because of physical disorders that I #8217;d rather specify later if anyone cares about that, tons of school work because my stupid self decided to take 6 AP classes, my parents and I have not been getting along because I lash out of them because my temper is shot due to all the stress, and now my baby boy is leaving me.

    <TEXT>He will not. He has an untreatable heart problem that developed months ago. It #8217;s likely because of his genetics and age. He #8217;s a puggle- half beagle and half pug, and he #8217;s almost 15. Pugs can have a ton of problems. Could also just be bad luck. He #8217;s still alive now, but he is no longer very responsive. I #8217;ve been by his side for the past two days straight aside from when I make trips to get him water, feed my axolotls, use the bathroom, and get food. I haven #8217;t even slept because I #8217;m afraid something bad will happen if i do. His head is in my lap and I #8217;m just chilling on my bed with him. I don #8217;t want him to go alone so I #8217;m not going to leave him. He doesn #8217;t respond when I say his name anymore. It makes me so sad. I cry every time I look down at him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, it #8217;s true. I don #8217;t have a way to prove the age and ownership of the blanket with physical evidence; I just have the word of several relatives. Apparently, she had it as a child and it was really soothing for her to have because her cancer spread all over her body, including her brain, and the chemo was also destroying her brain. She was having a hard time comprehending what was happening in the moment towards the end, but had memories of her childhood and teen years, so having the blanket helped her and she spent all her time when she was suffering the end stages of cancer with it because even though she couldn #8217;t understand what was happening, she could try to talk to love ones and use the blanket to remind her of who she was and try to remember who they are. She passed away in her at home hospital bed with her blanket. I know it #8217;s silly, but I sleep with it almost every night because even though I never met her, it feels like I do through the blanket. I #8217;ve had my dog for about 14 years and he #8217;s been a very good and loyal boy all those years. He started coughing really bad and we took him to the vet a few months back and discovered he had a heart problem that couldn #8217;t be fixed and he wouldn #8217;t likely have only a few months left. He suddenly got really worse about a week ago; he was having difficulties using the bathroom, eating, walking, ectetera. He really started to get bad these past two days. We put him on doggie pain meds so he isn #8217;t in pain. He hasn #8217;t moved much at all these past two days. I #8217;ve spent every bit of time I can with him these last two days because I don #8217;t know what minute with him will be my last. I think he #8217;s almost ready. Maybe just a few more hours. I wrapped him up in the blanket so not only would I feel connected to my grandmother through it, but also my baby. Also, he really likes that blanket in particular for whatever reason. When he was healthier, he #8217;d jump up on my bed and try to snatch it with little success. Please don #8217;t judge me for my choices. I know I do weird stuff. It #8217;s my way of coping. Everyone deals with things differently. Also, he has weird episodes similar to this where his health has dramatically declined, but he always got better, but I think he #8217;s all out of luck this time. He #8217;s never been this bad. That #8217;s why my family hasn #8217;t put him down yet. We are ensuring that he is not in any pain with the aid of medicine.</TEXT>

He is sleeping a lot. :( Update 2: 17:00 - I left him alone on his favourite doggie bed for a while so I could take a shower and he fell asleep so I will leave him be for now. Update 3: 21:00 - my sister is now watching him. He just just laying down and not moving much. Update 4: 22:00 of the next day - still kicking. Hasn #8217;t gotten worse, but hasn #8217;t gotten better either. Update 5: I know nobody will probably see this and I #8217;ve been forgetting to update. it #8217;s the 20th of September now. He actually started getting better out of nowhere a few days ago. He has an odd cough caused by his heart being weak due to his age and genetics, but aside from that he seems fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Rescued a skinny golden albino axolotl with dwarfism and who #8217;s age was unknown from someone planning on releasing her, along with 3 others about 2 months. Her and one of the other ones I got have been a challenge to care for ever since I got them and the poor girl passed away while I was at school. She hasn #8217;t been eating well and had a hard time with her tankmates when I had her in my main axolotl tank for like a day or two because she was very small and slow. She was 4 inches when I measured her and I was told she was at least 5 years old. Came home to find her in her tub floating and not moving. It was one of the worst things I #8217;ve seen in my life. I #8217;ve never seen a dead axolotl before and I had to cover my eyes while putting her in a paper towel to burry her in because it was so hard to see what used to be a cute, yet sort of ugly salamander completely drained of all life. I can #8217;t figure out why she passed. I #8217;ve had axolotls for almost 5 years now and have never lost one until now. I tried so hard to keep her alive. I don #8217;t know if the previous owner made a slip up before I got them or what. It #8217;s really weird and it makes me sad to know that precious little baby is gone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Large Male rooster with bantam hens?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-16 11:36:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>I got 4 chicks at tractor supply- 3 bantams and an  #8220;Americana pullet #8221;. One of the bantam chicks had to be euthanised because it had an extremely bad cross beak to the point that I felt it cruel to keep her alive. The other 2 got snatched by a weasel. The Americana pullet looks nothing like an Americana and..... isn #8217;t a girl. I currently have him with my Japanese bantam and silkie hens, and my one Japanese bantam rooster. Could he hurt the bantam hens trying to .... do the do #8217;s or just picking on them. He #8217;s already twice their size an he #8217;s still growing. Should I rehome him? People where I live only want roosters to fight and eat and I really don #8217;t want to part ways with the silly guy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not exactly. Basset hounds and most dogs are bred over generations to have short legs. That characteristic is always present in short legged dog breeds. In this breed of chicken, the Japanese bantam, their short legs comes from a gene expression that does not always create short legged chickens. About half of eggs hatched have short legs, a quarter have normal legs, and the remaining corner receives a fatal expression of the gene that results in it never fully developing. It #8217;s more like a munchkin(the nickname given to mutated cats with short legs) chicken.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ive been getting really bad head aches lately. There #8217;s an aching pain in the lower back half of my brain and sharp pains through out my brain that make me forget what was currently happening sometimes . Some other issues I have been having are stinging pains throughout my back, frequent uncontrollable eye movement, I can #8217;t keep or put on weight easily, my legs give out randomly, I #8217;ve been throwing up and constantly nauseous for about a month now, and can #8217;t sleep almost at all. I #8217;ve also had a really hard time speaking. I repeat the first part of words over and over if I mess up the pronunciation until I get them right and I #8217;ve been having a really hard time reading the letters of words in the correct order.I have a few diagnosed mental disorders and for some reason my parents and doctors are telling me my issues are because of my mental problems and that I #8217;m being overdramatic. I have bipolar disorder, adhd, anxiety problems, and ocd. I have mixed connective tissue disorder, deformities in my sternum and ribs that I #8217;ve had to have surgery on once. and my ears are slightly underdeveloped causing me mild hearing issues. I currently take medication for my bipolar disorder, anti depressants, and stuff for my adhd. I don #8217;t really know what to do. I feel like something is terribly wrong and that nobody is listening to me. What can I do to get help if I need it?(Female, 16 yoa, 115 lbs, 5 #8217;8 #8221;)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey you got the vegetable oil part wrong. The other things listen appear to be correct. Vegetable oil is made from rapeseed and soybeans. Palm oil comes from a fruit, not vegetable. Edit: Holy crap! I #8217;m the one who #8217;s wrong! Thanks for informing me! I should #8217;ve known this ..... Also other edit: I did some more research online. From what I can tell, rapeseed oil, or canola oil, seems to be better at preserving and preventing more land from being destroyed, but is just as bad! It #8217;s harvested with heavy machinery that produced crazy gas emissions, and fertiliser is used on it extensively which can cause fertiliser runoff. Why do people have to be so horrible??? We can #8217;t just trash earth like our childhood bedrooms and leave it in shambles when running off the college!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Don #8217;t give this guy such hate. Technically, he is correct. The ad was banned because it was deemed too politically charged according to many sources. It was made for a grocery store company called  #8220;Iceland #8221; to spread the word of the removal of palm oil products from their stores. When looking at content released from other companies, negative ads could be released and not deemed too political if they didn #8217;t impact the sales of products commonly purchased and produced, such as ivory or blood diamonds. Banning it for being too political was obviously an excuse to get it off tv. u/roxylius simply misinterpreted the information he saw and didn #8217;t look too much into it, which is perfectly fine. It happens to everyone at one point or another.</TEXT>

In the past I #8217;ve ordered fertile chicken eggs to hatch to show for my ffa and 4h clubs(school agriculture clubs). I ordered a dozen and half of them hatched. Can parrot eggs be purchased online and hatched? Is there any cruelty free and reliable dealers that ship in the United States? I raised my super friendly lovebird that I currently have that I purchased from a sketchy guy on Craigslist for $5 from when he hardly had any feathers and I found that experience to be very cool since I could watch him grow right before my eyes, and I want to have that same experience with a large bird in the future.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My teacher gave me a zero on my essay presentation because I cried and refused to continue reading it.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-05 06:26:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>I wrote an essay based on a very tender topic for me: the loss of my friend to suicide and how it changed me more than anything else in my life had. The prompt was to write about something eventful that has made me the person I am. Most people talked about their family or sports or pets. I was one of the last people chosen and despite my essay abiding by the prompt, it was nothing like everyone else #8217;s essays. It made me feel really embarrassed to make something so deviated from my classmates #8217; work. I already had immense anxiety before even entering that dreaded classroom before hearing everyone else present. When it was my turn I could almost not make myself get out of my wiggly, cheap chair. Every one of those 9 steps I took to stand up in front of a crowd strangers I hardly knew whom which would know about parts of me that I wouldn #8217;t even reveal to my closest of friends made me more and more nauseous with fear. I started my speech reading every line carefully while my legs trembled. It started off okay. I said how my my life was changed- I opened my eyes to the possibility of an unseeable pain residing in the hearts and minds of others. Then I said what changed it. Just the sight of what I wrote after my introduction, all the passion and heart wrenching emotion I put on that piece of thin, bland paper made me cry. I tried to fight through the tears and continue but after reading of how my friend passed, I simply couldn #8217;t speak. I began to cry profoundly like a little baby despite almost being an adult. My teacher told me to keep reading. I tried and I told her I can #8217;t make myself do this and yet she told me again to continue. I told her no, walked to her desk, and gave her my tear covered paper. I sat down in shame while being gazed at by eyes full of pity and yet also laughter. The rest of the day was ruined. I couldn #8217;t sleep that night. The next day our assignments were already placed on our desks with grades on them. My table mates both got A #8217;s while I got a big, endlessly round red  #8220;0 #8221;on my paper distorted in spots from my dry tears. My grade plummeted. The content of our essays only mattered if we could convey them well, but I had not done that. I am now at a low C which I will not be able to bring up. My report card usually inked will all A #8217;s would be poisoned with that dreaded grade. Though my grades mean very much to me, the disappointment I felt for not being able to finish that essay was worse. I feel like a failure for once again letting my friend down and this time I had knowingly done so. I have let her down. I have let myself down. I have let everyone close to me down since my despair will carry over into their lives and I will not have the courage to share what burdens me. I thought I #8217;d share here since I can remain anonymous online and maybe seek comfort from those willing to give it. I have great sympathy for anyone else whom has dealt with similar troubles. I hope my dismay doesn #8217;t pollute the days of those that see this, but rather open your eyes to what I could only see after losing a friend.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve had no luck growing cuttings outside. They always get bugs or rot. I want to try to grow cuttings inside. I have an aquarium light I used to use for my fish tank but I #8217;ve since upgraded my tank and gotten a new light. This is the light I have: https://www.amazon.com/Aquaneat-Aquarium-Spectrum-Multi-Color-Marine/dp/B07G91L6FV . I have the 30 inch one. How far away do I need to keep this to prevent burning cuttings? I #8217;m trying to grow crotons, Bougainvilleas, nephritis, and maybe some other plants. I don #8217;t really have a lot of ways to make money and I thought growing plants may make me a little extra cash. I #8217;m a teen and right now a lot of business want as few as possible people working due to covid. Nobody is hiring. People around where I live love to support local businesses and buy plants. I have grown cuttings inside before next to my window but I don #8217;t want a cluttered mess of plants laying all over my floor. I have a shed that I #8217;d like to grow the cuttings in that is hot, clean, and ventilated so it should be okay to grow cuttings in.</TEXT>
