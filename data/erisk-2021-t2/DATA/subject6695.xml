    <TITLE>Let's Talk about Bounties</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-08-07 19:42:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>After finishing the latest arc (Whole Cake) I began to ask myself some questions; after discovering Jack's billion, i was astonished like everybody, at that time Ace's bounty was considered by myself to be something unfathomable, and I said to myself that WB and the other Yonkous should somewhere around 1.9 Billions, with Rayleigh being around 1 Billion, Dragon overthrowing all Pirates woth 3 Billions, because it seemed stupid for me that a organism like the world government could Pay for these bounties. Then Oda presented Jack's, who is in the same category in wich Ace falls, and reward his hunter with a Billion Berries, a billion that while being a good indicator, tends to discourage Bounty Hunter more than attract them, the wanted system turning the pirates from criminal status to devil status, also marking their epithet in the paper is counterproductive, it distinguish them from the common and gives them a Legendary dimension, making them and their life style appealing. So after meeting Jack we tought he would be an exception, perhaps he has done horrible things and have been killing people like Kid, but then we are introduced the Charlotte Family whose Commander all have more than 800 millions berries, and their strongest member surpassing Jack's by 57 million berries. But unlike Jack, who is a blood-thirsty monster, Katakuri is a fighter with "honour" who seeks to *defends* his mother's dream, so why a so high bounty, why the Commanders and members of The Charlotte family have bounties so high ? Why Kaidous calamities seems to have higher bounties (if the card-theme of his crew is anything to go by, Jack is then the weakest) ? And most importantly, why Sabo has only 602 millions on his head if he's the number 2 of the revolutionary army (and if he is this well known, how comes it that Ace never knew about him ?) ? To answer these questions we will analyse the closest experiences we've got starting with Luffy's adventure. _On the East Blue Saga :_ Luffy confront himself with stronger and stronger opponents, ending his adventure their by crushing Arlong, he get his first Bounty 30 millions, the reason of a bounty 6 times higher than the average is that he has beaten Don Krieg and an old member of the Sun's Pirates, but also the humiliation that he inflicted to Nezumi by Nami so the criteria for putting a Bounty on someone's Head at the time are : -The strength. -The degree of animosity towards the government's structures. Then he goes to Loguetown and escape from Smoker without having his bounty increased, because to the governments it's big enough to attract Bounty Hunters, as we discover in whiskey Peaks, 30 millions is a doable Bounty for Grand Line's Bounty Hunters. The next updates comes after the Alabasta arc, Luffy gets 100 millions Berries : -His defiance toward the governments (he attacks and Beats one of their members. -His strength. Nothing happens then until Enies Lobby, where his value is tripled because of : -His openly hostile attitude towards the governments. -The beating of an official Branch (The CP 9) -The defeat he inflicted to their best agents. -Hiding a Very dangerous criminal. -Being the cause (for the WG), of the Buster Call and escaping it. 300 millions is his last updates pre timeskip, we will learn after that the governments hid the news of Moria's defeat, because increasing Luffy's Bounty at this point would put him in a dangerous position, and could make him a model, so we learn that Bounties increase pace can be slowed. After Marineford War, he gets another 100 millions added to him, and Jinbei poikts out afterthe time skip that it's rare for pirates to reach these sums. So the total worth of Luffy's affiliations and "alliances" was 100 million berries, pretty low when we think about it, No ? For all the times he was presented as the dangerous brother of Ace, Son of Dragon, Grandson of Garp, Pupil of Rayleigh, Allie of Crocodile and Baggy, that only gives him another 100 millions increase, that partially due to the war. Tommorow next Part.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>What kind of magic could be institutionalized ?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-27 20:41:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>For example, you want magical units in an army, what kinds of magics could be taught. Or if you have a knight's order, what would they teach to the newcomers. In short, what branch of magic could make disciplines with multiple ramifications ? I have imagined a kind of chivalry order, but I can't come up with a good magic system that doesn't collide with the concept of order. Edit : I'm gonna summarize you the idea so you can understand more : Basically, I had ten guys receive divine knowledge in different areas, and go and establish a military organisation that will act both as an arbitrator of human politics *(avoiding devastating conflict that could ruin humanity)* **and** a dissuasive force against other parts *(the non-human actors)*, because let's be honest, apocalyptic force of evil or not, humans would hardly let their squabbling to unite durably. My biggest problem while writing this order was : Since people aren't born with an ability to use magic (the same way humans irl can't control gravity) but need something to use it *(in my case I thought, for this particular order, of a sort of living tattoos that would act as gatherer of energy but also converter)*, well that means that the I won't be having a wide variety of abilities within the Order, since all what is tought is ultimately derived from what the ten first guys knew, **and** if they are going to form a coherent force, they can't have one bazillion of abilities. Well, believe it or not, I haven't been able to found ten big disciplines, way or whatever it can be called that don't intermingle, for example : If you have. But there came another limitation : They won't be that strong. The most destructive member would at the very best obliterates a surface of roughly 600 m2 before exhausting himself. So what I want to say with "institutionalize" is "make it's passation systematic, and methodical". I need ten disciplines that are reasonably large to allow some flexibility, yet ordered enough for the master to teach the disciple rooted bases, like how science continue to branch out the more you dive in.</TEXT>

Or just the first ones ? **If** all the *Palantiri* were made by *Feanor*, how did they pass on to the *Eldar* of *Tol Eressa* who gave them to *Amandil*, and why does the line of *Amandil* have a right to them that others do not possess ? *(it's said that only his heirs could master them, not even Sauron could contest them this right)*. It's doubtful that they were mass-produced, and if they were, it's strange that the *know-how* to make them vanished.

    <TITLE>Dagor Dagorath (not a what-if question)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-24 21:16:25</DATE>
    <TEXT>So *Dagor Dagorath* is a concept that appeared in the earliest versions down to the last version of *the Silmarillion*. But Christopher Tolkien said that it was apparently abandoned by his father in favor of it becoming Mannish Legends. The Elves had apparently no tradition, idea or anything like that concerning the End of the World. Yet, in Morgoth's Ring it is said *"It did not repent, or turn finally away from its obsession, but retained still relics of wisdom, so that it could still seek its object indirectly, and not merely blindly.* ***It would rest****, seek to* ***heal itself****, distract itself by other thoughts and desires and devices -* ***but all simply to recover enough strength to return to the attack on the Valar, and to its old obsession.*** *As it grew again it would become, as it were, a dark shadow, brooding on the confines of Arda, and yearning towards it."* So Morgoth *(or whatever rump-being, mindless thing he has become)* would assumingly return ? Is this supposed to be the new *Dagor Dagorath* ? If so, what does it actually achieve thematically ? This "thing" was already weaker than second age Sauron, ending it was more of a merciful act than anything else. So, what were actually Tolkien's latest ideas on the Apocalypse of his world ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**Disclaimer :** I translated it to English, and I am a bad translator. So sorry if it's badly-written, but feel free to tear me apart. *\[...\]* Finally, at the end of the harvests, the fleet of the Apostles came. Tens of great vessels carrying hundreds of soldiers. Their black ships contrasted heavily with their silver robes, yet their host was Majestic, so mighty and powerful it seemed as an army of Angels. The 10 stood out of the group, and the Chief immediately recognized them. Orderly, the Ships emptied, until one figure remained. Clothed in Black from head to toe, veiled to the eyes of others, he had no need to show his face in order to assert his power. *He* was the one in charge. Slowly, he walked over the pontoon. His steps were felt well into the city, the dreaded echo resounding into the hearts of the citizen. As he descended, the sky thickened, and when he finally set foot on the dock, it burst under the horrified gaze of all save the Apostles. He advanced toward the Chief of the City, eyeing him scornfully, or so it seemed to him, he couldn't see his face. The Chief felt a profound reverence for this foreign, unknown man, and bowed quickly : "We, inhabitants of *Apadna*, are honored to host you, O great savior." He lifted his head, waiting. No reaction. He continued : "We are the last Great free colony in these lands, if you go southward, you will find but small forts held by a handful of Djinn." He stopped again, thinking about what he said. Looking toward the sea, he sawlights falling from the sky. Terrified, he gathered his strength and pursued : "These rats have revolted against our benevolent rule, they have spilled the blood of our kin in quantities untold. Against the peril of the Fall, we chose to call for the Mother-Realms intervention. I must admit I am pleasantly surprised by their choice. We are again honored by your presence and will assist you on whatever way we can. May th..." He could not finish his sentence, for the Faceless Apostle grabbed him by the neck and brought him to his face. When the poor Chief looked, his eyes widened and his whole body shook uncontrollably : "Do not pray for my success, stenched dog. I leave the tidings of fortune to barbarians of your kin. I did not come here to wage war upon these insects. Nay, it will not be a war that I will bring them. I come to them with a precious lesson.". He stopped, contemplating the city before him, and the forest beyond, it, set ablaze. With a wicked, terrifying smile, he concluded : "No, I will not wage war, I will instruct them. They will learn their place, and suffering will be their teacher." P-S : Originally, the veiled character speaks in a more archaic style, but since my English is definitely not capable of mimicking such style, I wrote it normally.</TEXT>

But then again, Muslims should entitle themselves to a dress-code, you can't go out in boxers and underwears even if you're a man. As a rule of thumb, I don't like engaging in fruitless endeavors.

Which speaks volumes about him. Feanor was as wrathful as you can be, and yet he doesn't get to be described like Orome.  gt;Feanor and Galadriel were more powerful. It's just Fingolfin was a better warrior. Feanor and Galadriel only were in 2 or 3 battles in FA. Fingolfin was a leader in wars for 400 years. Experience and practice makes perfect. Or you could just admit that some people are naturally more skilled at somethings than others. Fingolfin was a better leader than Feanor from day 1, remember that the Noldor chose him over Feanor. Feanor is good at some things, Fingolfin is good at others, Finarfin at others, their sons are different etc...  gt;He was no longer a Vala. By that time he was that weak that an Elf wounded him, even though he be the most powerful Elf in sword fighting, he is still an Elf. *"Vala he is, thou saist. Then thou hast sworn in vain, for none of the Valar canst thou overcome now or ever within the halls of E #228;, not though Eru whom thou namest had made thee thrice greater than thou art.

    <TEXT>In general, I would argue that you most likely need a villain in a plot-driven story, it's not mandatory, but since your characters are reactive and not proactive, you need somebody who sets the action in movement, and a villain is the best kind of characters because it merges the cause with the goal in one character *Why are we going on a quest ? Because the villain did something. What are we expected to do ? Defeat the Villain*. A mentor also can set up the action, but he doesn't provide a goal. In character driven story, you need only your characters and what they do. The story advance when they advance, and the conflicts are all tied to the character personally.  gt;*The Dragons committed atrocities to other ancient races in order to literally save the world and the Giants are seeking revenge on the Dragons and trying to be free from that prison.* Maybe I'm wrong, but the Dragons here are the Villains. Another candidate for morally faulty "character" is that Napoleonic Empire of yours. You could grey them a bit by saying they abolished previous unfair governments. I also don't think Good vs Good exist. It's Interest vs Interest. There cannot be two Good at one time, just diverging interests. You can take inspiration from WWI, where all of the nations had something to gain or lose, and they were willing to go to severe extremes in order to secure their goals. Since we're talking about InterestvsInterest, one possible idea would be showing the greatest sin of any leader : Failing to adapt the strategy. Again, one example is WWI, where by 1916, it was clear that no amount of gain made by the war would have been worth its continuance. Nonetheless, they continued.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nerdanel and Feanor romance is a really sad story. As Melkor's lies flowered in his head, he became more possessive and violent. The first time was when he refused Nerdanel name for the twins. But the worst was their parting : *" \[Nerdanel\] retired to her father #8217;s house; but when it became clear that F #235;anor and his sons would leave Valinor for ever, she came to him before the host started on its northward march, and* ***begged*** *that F #235;anor should leave her the two youngest, the twins, or at least one of them. He replied:  #8220;Were you a true wife, as you had been till cozened by Aul #235;, you would keep all of them, for you would come with us. If you desert me, you desert all of our children. For they are determined to go with their father. #8221; Then Nerdanel was angry, and she answered:  #8220;You will not keep all of them. One at least will never set foot on Middle-earth. #8221;  #8220;Take your evil omens to the Valar who will delight in them, #8221; said F #235;anor.  #8220;I defy them. #8221; So they parted. "* The guy was an absolute douche with his wife, and later his son will burn at Losgar. I'm pretty sure if they are reunited after the remaking of Arda she will peg him publicly.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Feanor fucked off to Middle-Earth. Finarfin had older sister(s), yet he became High-Kirkhar of the Noldoe in Aman, not his sister(s). Well Findis also fucked off to Valimar, so there is that.  gt;No more female rulers after Haleth died. And I don't think they trained female warriors anymore. Well, they didn't do war anymore. Maybe they should have stayed with Caranthir.  gt;Exactly. GRR Martin is better at making grey characters. Anyways Tolkien himself wrote Galadriel wanted to thwart Feanor with her anger. Even if Galadriel didn't attack them, she could at least kill them in her defence and her people's defense in the Second Kinslaying. GRR Martin is better at makin characters who evolve in an amoral world, there is a difference. You're comparing apple to oranges.  gt;She should've talked to them and tried to convince them, not to Fuckanor. Because they are old fashioned parents. Feanor is the Head of his house, not his sons, they will follow him wherever he goes. Nerdanel knew that. She wasn't just talking to her husband, she was talking to a Prince, a warlord.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel like I've been bamboozled, two weeks ago we were arguing about the exact same subject from the opposite point of view. Galadriel is the equal of Feanor because *Tolkien* said so. She is the equal of *Feanor* in pride, dignity and his superior in wisdom. I don't know if Galadriel was supposed to be the equal of Feanor in Valinor, but I think it's fair to say that by the time she depart from Middle-Earth, she has become his equal. She has led Elves eastward after hope was lost, helped founding numerous kingdom, though she desired a kingdom of her own, she was always careful not spiting rivalries between elves, hence why she quit Eregion with no resistance. As the lady of Lorien, she helped men countless times, keeping the darkness of Dol Guldur at bay, hastening the host of the Rohirrim etc... Tolkien never got to finish Galadriel, and maybe, after all she doesn't compare to other great lords, but for me, the fact that she was the subject of Tolkien last thought speaks volumes about how much he esteemed her as an artistic concept. I do think that Galadriel was for him a pendant of Tinuviel. If Luthien was supposed to be the woman he fell in love with, Galadriel is the one he was parted from.</TEXT>

I personally have came to like it. Tolkien tells us she is the greatest, but he doesn't tells us why.

    <TEXT>I have one thing to say : *The* ***Flair*** *is a lie*. More seriously, the Silmarillion is written like a historical chronicle. I can't relate with character who feel like something out of my History textbook *(don't get me wrong, I love History, but I never related much with any historical character)*. So the downside of this is that I treat these characters as historical subject, they are interesting, but not lovable. My feeling was further confirmed when I read Children of Hurin. The Turin Turambar section in the Silmarillion was frankly underwhelming to say the least, after meeting so much interesting characters and events, I'm stuck with a dude who is cursed. Great. But once you take this dude and make him a full fledged character, he gains my sympathy. Morgoth, Thingol, Melian, Fingon, Turgon etc... they felt much more compelling as characters there than they were in the Silmarillion.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-28 18:57:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>In the Tale of Adanel, we are given an account of what the Edain fled and what happened to the first Men. According to Adanel, Men were at first able to converse with what they called "*The Voice*", which is obviously Eru. The Voice would speak to them and tell them to go learn by themselves. But then comes a new character described as *" clad in raiment that shone like silver and gold, and he had a crown on his head, and gems in his hair. "*. So this is supposed to be Morgoth, and why not ? He is a maleficent figures, and order the Men to abjure the Voice and build him a House where they shall all bow to him. However, the first description of this character is that he was in their *"own form visible, but greater and more beautiful"*. This contradict the *Silmarillion*, where it is said that *"...he \[Melkor\] put on again the form that he had worn as the tyrant of Utumno: a dark Lord, tall and terrible.* ***In that form he remained ever after****"*. So Melkor could not take a fair form when he met men, unless the Dark Lord, Tall and Terrible is supposed to look like a man beautiful and great. So, did the last form he took on was a that of a beautiful man ? Did he use some magic to change his shape ? Was he not Mogoth, but one of his servant who was sent to corrupt men ? Maybe Sauron as the character describes himself as : *"the Giver of Gifts"*.</TEXT>

The Eldar acted as their guide, they didn't want to destroy Beleriand, they sent the Sun and the Moon etc... Here it seems that they just ignored them. Okey, in the published Silmarillion, Men are left to deal with Melkor, but their is a bit hope, if you go West, you meet the Elves. Here if you go West, you meet *Sauron and Angband*.</TEXT>

In other times, Zeus and Odin sparked theological reflexions that were worthy of being noted. But all of this has been lost. We only have the myths. The Zeus that was worshipped by the Greek had little to do with the Zeus of modern pop-culture. People nowadays don #8217;t have the theological background to efficiently use Gods as Gods.

    <TEXT> gt;I was disagreeing with your assertment that somehow the gods of ancient times were less theologically robust than "modern religions" Something that I have yet to claim, as I was discussing writing, not theology. *"* ***most people*** *lack the theological and philosophical background to use Gods efficiently as gods. "* The blame was on people who didn't take the time and ponder what does the existence of gods imply? what makes these characters gods ?, how do the non-gods react to these ? Instead they focus on superficiality, copying the surface of myths, and using gods as basically super-heroes or supervillain, thus stripping god from much of what makes them interesting. My problem isn't gods meddling with mortals or mortals rebelling against gods, my problem is always using gods as supermen *(there were gods who represented valors close to that of protector of the earth and champion)*, and no other way. With the plethora of different polytheistic traditions, there is plenty of room for thought provoking settings. But thank you nonetheless for straightly jumping to appeal to motive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Galadriel would have put Gandalf in charge of the White Council, which mean that he would have been the chief and they would have driven Sauron off Dol Guldur much earlier, before he was fully prepared. This would sent the Alarm to all the Free People that Sauron has returned and they should be weary. Also, Gandalf was also hinted to be suspicious of Saruman, which means he would have distrusted him much earlier. This gives the Free-People a century to prepare and be weary, moreover, Gandalf being the chief would have spoken of Bilbo #8217;s Ring much earlier, which could mean they discover its nature and plan to destroy very early on. We can imagine a scenario where the Free-People lure a weakened and panicked Sauron while Bilbo or somebody else takes the Ring to Mt Doom. Obviously, with somebody she fully trust at the council, Galadriel would have been more useful and her advices more effective.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But they followed him out of duty. I would dare to say that had Feanor given them the choice, they would have chosen their mother. Remember that they all retained their mother-name, except Curufin but that's because his mother-name sucks. As for Amrod, I do think this was intended as his initial death-date, because it explains his mother name of Umbarto. If he was so paranoid, why did he marry the daughter of one of Aule students ? Feanor didn't have very much justifications for his actions, except his mother death and Melkor. Okey, he hated Indis because she married his father, that's immature but maybe he was a child. Why did he hate his brothers and sisters ? They didn't do anything to him. Just because they were Indis children ? And if he loved Finwe so much, maybe he could have pushed aside his prejudice to make his father happy. Feanor strikes me as a self-loving jealous person, one I wouldn't want to be friend with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The leaves were long, the grass was green, The hemlock-umbels tall and fair, And in the glade a light was seen Of stars in shadow shimmering. Tin #250;viel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen, And light of stars was in her hair, And in her raiment glimmering. There Beren came from mountains cold, And lost he wandered under leaves, And where the Elven-river rolled He walked alone and sorrowing. He peered between the hemlock-leaves And saw in wander flowers of gold Upon her mantle and her sleeves, And her hair like shadow following. Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam; And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods in Elvenhome She tightly fled on dancing feet, And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening. He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering. He sought her ever, wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted in the moon, As on a hill-top high and far She danced, and at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering. When winter passed, she came again, And her song released the sudden spring, Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling. Again she fled, but swift he came. Tin #250;viel! Tin #250;viel! He called her by her elvish name; And there she halted listening. One moment stood she, and a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came, And doom fell on Tin #250;viel That in his arms lay glistening. As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tin #250;viel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and grey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they met once more, And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;We don #8217;t know why they followed him, it could be duty, love, that they believed his cause and in general practically all of Noldor were leaving. I never claimed they were victims. But Tolkien wrote after studying a specific period of history, which he mimicked in his writings. Knowing who the seven sons of Feanor were and what they did, I do think they followed their father out of duty more than out of love, and this is the same reason why they jumped to swear with him his oath. Duty does not mean being a victim though.  gt; I don #8217;t think the names mean that much Tolkien made the Sindarin names first and later made the Quenya names and had Feanor our Finwe in all of the father names as a character trait I do think it says something, names are very important for elves. That Feanaro kept his mother-name is evidently the sign that he wanted to show his heritage and remind everybody that he was the son of Miriel. Likewise, Galadriel taking the name of her lover as a new name is a testament to their love.  gt; I think Umbarto name is from same timeline as the burning. Which is the later version no ?  gt;It #8217;s also noted he met her when travelling so it doesn #8217;t mean that he picked her due to any Aule connection. I never said that he picked her due to connections with Aule. But Feanr ought to have known that Mahtan had a daughter, and that Nerdanel was Mahtan daughter, who was a pupil and friend of Aule. Feanor became estrangled with Nerdanel when he had fully absorbed Melkor's lies.  gt;I didn #8217;t say Feanor was perfect so his relationship with his siblings isn #8217;t relevant here. I was discussing his relationship with his wife and sons. **I** was discussing Feanor's relationship with his wife and son. But understanding how Feanor may have been a heavy burden to carry needs to understand his relationships with his closest kin.</TEXT>

The Second kinslaying was premeditated, they planned their attack. It was more a war than a kinslaying. But I can found some redeeming qualities, it was a war of sort, there was battle, duels, honour soldiers, why not ? The Third kinslaying was a merciless massacre.

    <TEXT> gt;The point was it only later had his issues with Aule became so huge and that Nerdanel wasn #8217;t someone he picked due to connections. He didn't didn't pick Nerdanel, Nerdanel refused to follow him.  gt;I don #8217;t think Feanor being difficult with his half-siblings means he would be the same with everyone. Feanor isn't being difficult with his half-siblings, he's awful. He drew a sword at his own brother, and then left him to cross the Helcaraxe. That's not being difficult, that's being an a\*\*hole.  gt;And we know Feanor could be charming and that he was generally beloved in Aman before the big events which is why there is so much grief over what happened. We also know that when the Noldor got to chose, they followed his brother.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know, it seems to me that he was psychologically broken after the Unnumbered Tears. Remember that he spent 30 years in Angband. He was still a better leader than his father, but having sworn the oath, maybe he felt compelled to execute it no matter the odds. That #8217;s the problem with the Silmarillion, since it #8217;s not a story we can but guess what a character felt. I would argue for the dutiful son, that he took the mantle of his father reluctantly and he was still against everyone of his deeds while accomplishing them nonetheless. Which why I see them as the worst sons. Celegorm and Curufin didn #8217;t care about what they should could do to fulfill their oath, that they plotted against their own kin who saved them because of the oath shows that they would have gone to wathever end, and we #8217;re fine with this, it #8217;s in their character. Maedhros and Maglor on the other had ought to have understood that not even the Silmarils and the Oath are worth all of this evil, something that Maglor voices out, but he comply with Maedhros plan. Obviously, one can argue that the Oath was a driving force, Mandos Doom says it clearly that  #8220;their oath shall drive them #8221;, and yet we #8217;re led to believe that they fueled the Oath ad much as it drove them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my world, magic is what happens when you are in perfect harmony with an element. Humans, being short-lived and not very receptive to other creatures have a hard time harmonizing with simple things like water, sand or air, you can thus imagine how hard it would be for them to go on and harmonize with blood, muscles, tissues and organs. A human has more chances controlling the Sun than healing somebody. In other words, humans cannot heal. However, there exist a varieties of medicinal plants with magical properties which can be brewed into proper medicines, drugs or sirups.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It was mainly the Men who called him that way, due to the Downfall of Numenor and the forging of the Rings. Though the parallel with Satan is obvious, I don't think that make Morgoth less Satanic than he is. But it's true that Sauron was much more of a deceiver than Melkor. As Melkor started very strong, he was used to brute force. He deceived the elves in Aman because that was all he could actually do. However the moment he was again head of an army he dropped the act. Sauron went the opposite side, deceit was his main plan and violence his back-up. And Sauron is definitely a satanic figure. The World of Tolkien isn't a perfect allegory of our own, numerous characters can represent a same concept. Melkor and Feanor are both great maker conceived by jealousy and greed, who fell from grace. Melkor and Sauron are both demonic figures who represent a threat to the world and who corrupt even the most righteous. Not only that, but the Legendarium is full of echoes. Frodo and Earendil are both semi-christic figures in the sense that they will carry the burden of their respective world. Earendil is different though because he actually "redeem" Men and Elves, while Frodo is consumed by his quest. Anyway, this is stupid analysis, what I mean to say is that Melkor and Sauron are both satanic figures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Satan doesn't sit in a tower in Armenia creating orc armies What's your problem with Armenia ? It's a lovely country.  gt; In no way is Satan in the Bible anything like Melkor Sauron except in a vague thematic sense. So, let's see more in detail : * Satan : Fallen Angel, rebelled against God, incarnation of evil, deceived humanity into committing a sin *(Adam and Eve)*. * Melkor : Fallen Angel, rebelled against God, incarnation of Evil, deceived humanity into committing a sin *(Tale of Adanel)*. * Sauron : Fallen Angel, rebelled against God, incarnation of Evil, deceived humanity into committing a sin *(Numenor)*. And I was talking about thematic, I said it was not analogy or an allegory, and that Tolkien characters didn't mirror exactly our own religions, beliefs, values and world.  gt;I don't really see how Frodo or Earendil are Christ figures either, they aren't the literal incarnation of any deities, weren't sacrificed to save humanity and, in Frodo's case, is a more obvious instance of the triumph of everyman via very human qualities rather than the triumph of a holy incarnation of Eru. I said semi-christic, in that they carry the burden of Men and in the case of Earendil, plead for their redemption before the Valar. I didn't say they were the christ, but that they shared christic attributes. They are Christian heroes nonetheless, because the Christian hero is a martyr, and both of them are to a relative degree martyrs.  gt;Frodo's case, is a more obvious instance of the triumph of everyman via very human qualities rather than the triumph of a holy incarnation of Eru. In the book it's pretty clear that Frodo "failed" his quest to destroy the Ring, and triumph was granted through a subtle intervention of God *(Eru)*.  gt;Tolkien's christian influences are in his work but searching for one-to-one parallels to the Bible and calling the Legendarium 'Christian' is an exercise in confirmation bias. I didn't say the word Christian, I explicitly denied the existence of one-to-one parallels and I didn't claim the Legendarium to be a Christian world, though it shares most of Tolkien catholic beliefs. The Eldar are genetically coded to be sexually catholic. But nice strawman.  gt; If I wanted to I could find just as many (or more) animistic, Go on, I would like to see the animistic influences in Tolkien World. I'm sure they exist, but my knowledge of animism is quite limited.  gt;gnostic, greek Why not, Tolkien ought to have known about Greek philosophy and Gnosticism, be it only as a layman.  gt; and norse influences and call thdeLegendarium any one of those things. I mean, the guy took names and races from Norse mythology, what prompted all of this was the study of Germanic and anglo-saxon myths.  gt;Tolkien clearly expressed that the Legendarium is an invented mythology for England. He also one day dreamt of a having a shared universe, everybody makes mistakes. Seeing how Tolkien revised his map throughout his life, I doubt the idea of Middle-Earth being our own would have survived without drastic changes to the continents and the shape. England was a Christian country from day one, so I don't see how your point undermine mine. Not even that, but even though Tolkien said this, reading only his published material, there is no way to know it. You have to go to the HoME to find about Eriol, Aelfwine and these are in the earliest versions of the Legendarium *(I think)*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First, you should crosspost this to r/islam, this is a sub for academic questions.  gt;Women and men should share roles at home and women don #8217;t need to just do housework I mean this one is already an Islamic thing, we know that the Prophet helped his wives in their house chores.  gt;Sex workers and trafficking if you have a wife already and trading slaves (I think slaves should be freed and I think that #8217;s what the prophet did I #8217;m not completely sure) I'm sorry but I do not understand this sentence.  gt;Child marriages You see, what Islam considers as a child and what the West consider as a child varies. Though ultimately neither actually gives us a satisfying answer. But Islam considers that if the person has sexual pulsions, she is of age.  gt;You should be allowed to wear makeup I think this is already allowed. But then, remember that our religions is all about modesty. Flashy colors and dresses are unislamic by nature.  gt;Women should not be looked down upon if the husband wants to have sex but the wife doesn #8217;t and it shouldn #8217;t be a bad thing Well the Islamic marriage is a contract by which two person enter a legal sexual relation. Both parties have sexual duties toward their spouse, and failing to do so or being very reluctant can be a cause of divorce. So no, if we aren't made for each other, we need to separate. For talking I'm not sure where how one can nowadays avoid talking to a woman. And for the clothes, I believe everyone have the right to dress as they want as long as its not offensive, but that doesn't mean I believe it's Islamic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So... according to Merriam Webster : Murder is the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. According to this definition, killing Nazis wasn't murder, because it was lawful. Now let's go on the other side of the problem : Some societies actually tolerate certain forms of rape. So yes, rape can, was and still is justified. These people would probably have no problem to see a rape-scene in a setting which they would deem justified. All of this to say, admitting that there is nothing after death, murder is worse than rape. The raped person can actually live on and heal, the murdered person cannot. There is a reason why murderers are treated harsher than rapers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I feel that Tolkien would find the search for parallels (such as Earendil as Christ) to be abhorrent and that readers ought to regard the Legendarium as a fictitious mythology for England and not a Catholic tale. If we're going by that assumption, Tolkien would have found parallels between Sauron/Morgoth and Satan equally abhorrent, we can go one step further and assert that he would found the idea of Eru being the One Christian God being blasphemous *(I am sure there are people who did)*. That doesn't actually means that you cannot draw parallels between them, because at their core they are all "*Fallen Angels incarnating evil who rebelled against God and deceived humanity into committing an unforgivable sin"*. If Tolkien didn't want people to think about Satan, he shouldn't have wrote them like that. As for Earendil, I said a semi-christic figure, and I corrected later into a character with shared christic attributes, in other words, Earendil isn't the Christ, he has some attributes and moments that resemble that of the Christ. Was it conscious ? I don't know, I don't have the time and dedication to search through all of Tolkien writings, but it's here. Sharing christic attributes doesn't make your work proselytizing, it's just a remark.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Melkor as the Diabolus of the events in the Legendarium (i.e. a satanic archetype Which isn't my point, neither here nor there. I don't say that Melkor **is** Satan, I don't even say that he is meant to be Satan, what I say is that he shares similarities with Satan. Maybe I should have started my first comment in the other thread by clarifying that Sauron isn't an analogy, an allegory or an equivalent of Satan, but that he shares some of his attributes. My point was to say, that Sauron being a deceiver doesn't negate Morgoth's parallels and share attributes with Satan, I specifically denied the existence of such direct one-to-one parallels *" numerous characters can represent a same concept ".*  gt;but Earendil/Frodo etc were never described as christlike and the comparison is marginal compared to the adversary archetype of Melkor Maybe you're right, you've yet to show me how my propositions are wrong. I didn't claim Frodo was the Christ, but I said that his carrying of the ring is analogous to the carrying of the cross which makes him a character sharing christic attributes. Similarly I didn't say Earendil was the Christ, I said that from my uneducated in Christianity point of view, somebody who goes to plead the case of Men *(and Elves)* before Divine beings, in essence bringing salvation to Men *(and Elves)*, looks like a character with shared christic attributes.  gt;I just don't think that there is a Christ figure in the Legendarium but it is the searching for it that is the mistake, I feel - because if you want it to be there, of course you'll find one. Something that I share, there is no perfect equivalent to Jesus in the Legendarium, but there are numerous characters and concepts who take from the Biblical Jesus attributes, or share them with him.  gt;This is all just my opinion but I think if you are going to assert allegory in the Legendarium then you need a whole heap of evidence to back it up. I didn't. But even then, I disagree with you. Tolkien didn't write allegory as a genre of literature, a work that is solely dedicated to mimicking our world, but he did have allegories for a lot of things. The most obvious being the Ring.</TEXT>

But then, there ought to have been Edain who participatedin the war of Wrath and went to Numenor, so the knowledge of who was Morgoth should have been preserved. No the biggeest problem is how did they actually concile their anti-elvish bonkers with the fact that their Kings actively fought Sauron alongside Elves, and that Sauron was pretty much their ennemy number. But then again, Sauron is very persuasive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Your whole point was that the Moroccan sultan wore what peasants wore This is a lie. I said *"I always mused the Moroccan Sultans didn't have expensive and beautiful clothes ?"*. What the Moroccan Sultan is wearing here is what all Moroccan wore. That's strange because until very recently, nobility and peasantry didn't wear the same garments. [Here is what Louis XVI, King of France wore.](https://www.france-pittoresque.com/IMG/jpg/Louis-Dauphin.jpg) [And this is what his subject wore.](https://i0.wp.com/vincentians.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/11/LeNainPaysans.jpg) [This is what Mughal Emperor Akbar wore.](https://c8.alamy.com/compfr/ce6acd/l-empereur-moghol-shah-jahan-peinture-miniature-sur-ivoire-ce6acd.jpg) [This is what Indian British soldiers would wear 300 years later.](https://www.nam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/slice_sm/public/2017-06/19546_slice.jpg?itok=k0I_UNlS) [This is what Selim III, Padishah of the Ottoman Empire wore, he lived in the 18th century.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/f4/fa/3df4fa4f7b4e68110e88c9818f0ccdcb.jpg) [And this is what](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8KygTTXUAAsiRt.jpg) [his subjects wore](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/pc/ft896nb5pc/figures/ft896nb5pc_fig4.jpg).

    <TEXT> gt; Uh, from my understanding it was, after the collapse of the Roman Empire most of Western Europe's levels of literacy, agriculture, architecture, and military capabilities went greatly down. There was far less interconnectedness between the different nations Do you have sources for these claims ? Because I would wager and say that with monastic education widespread across Europe, people would have had access to educated people more easily. Not only that, but if the Roman agriculture was better than Medieval Western Europe agriculture, we would expect a population decrease. In reality, France doubled in size after the Roman Empire. In terms of military, we don't need to compare. The Roman empire endured well after the middle-ages, it's what we call the byzantine Empire, and this Empire switched from legions to another model, showing that the Roman legions proved now inadapted for the medieval warfare. The Almoravid dinar was a currency retrieved in London and used as a standard measure throughout the 11th century, we have found numerous european coins in the Middle-East and vice-versa. In terms of naval capabilities, the Italian Republics blasted the Roman Empire. And war was as much prevalent, if not more during the RE than during medieval Europe. Climactic wars between Rome and Carthage, Rome and Epyrus, Rome and the Persians, Rome and the Germans, raids etc... were common.  gt;Under Germanic rule culture and development in the Iberian peninsula greatly regressed, so your point doesn't really even work with Iberia. Of course it does, I wasn't talking about Germanic Iberia, but about the Iberia that followed it.</TEXT>

Wanna-be leaders shine during crisis, because that's when you can strike.  gt; puppeteers, pulling strings in the shadows. These kinds of characters are very calm, knowledgeable characters, their power derives from extended network they build and use constantly. They are very efficient, pragmatic persons, who know how to make themselves essential, and they keep everybody in check through blackmail. Politics and Politicians are fascinating, but the goal of the game is always to either destabilize or keep the status quo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You have to understand that the Quran is not a historical textbook, and it doesn't aim to be. It doesn't concern itself with temporality and rarely give out names for the characters, even Iblis, the alleged name for the Devil is actually a term related to the Arabic word "**b**a**l**a**ss**a" meaning despairing. So there is no problem with having the Creation of Adam from mud and clay being preceeded by the prostration of the Angels and Iblis to him. And remember that the Angel didn't submit to Adam, they did not submit to him, they bowed because Allah asked them so, as a sign of acknowledgement and respect for this new creature.  gt; Are the above two verses understood to imply that Adam was Gods' intended ruler in the Earth or someone yet to come? There are diverging opinions. Most think that this means Adam is God's Khalifa on Earth, but it could also be speaking about another thing. Considering how God is actually still the Master of the whole Universe, I think that it's meant as the successor of some people or something or somebody who Allah didn't want to mention.  gt;It is also not proven in the Quran that Adam was specifically the first man, only the receiver of names, correct? Well the Quran dubs human as the Children of Adam. Now obviously, this could mean the people of Adam, as in the Children of Israel, who were not all his actual children. But even if there were other "first men" they would all be younger than Adam, as else humanity wouldn't be Children of Adam. We can Also say that all of Humanity is related to Adam in one way or another, but that there were other humans at the time and that Adam was the miraculous creation alone. But the Musim Tafasseer all say that it's meant to be we're all descended from Adam and his spouse, and nobody else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Did you even watch the video? I'm not interested in a debate between three uneducated thugs. I'm mainly pointing out that these are not Mu'tazila. Calling themselves mu'tazila is like if somebody tried to revive Ancient Egyptian religion. Stop stupidities and read History. The Mu'tazilite is a medieval Islamic school of thought which thrived for three decades and descended into nothingness afterwards. Their beliefs were systematically disproven by the Ash'arriyah and everybody renounced. What we know about the Mu'tazilite comes ***exclusively*** from non-Mu'tazilite scholars who **criticized** Mu'tazilite doctrine. The Wassiliyyah **was** a branch of the Mu'tazila, however, just like all what is not Sunni and Maliki, it got exterminated by the Almohads, so don't say they exist in the Maghreb as if we are Wassiliyah, if some of them survived, they are an absolute minority which doesn't deserve to be cited, and even they use the Wassiliyah as an identity marker, much like the Ibadi berbers of Mzab.  gt;Amin Diyab Never heard of him. He's famous among neo-mu'tazilites.  gt;and it is starting to grow again It is not, this movement isn't the Mu'tazila, it's a movement that calls itself Mu'tazila. They are as much Mu'tazila as I am Christian. These guys are using sources published by anti-Mu'tazila thinkers as their basis ! That would be like somebody trying to reconstruct and revive Islam through this [skeptic tank](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Main_Page).  gt;Not everything exists in the West you know. The Mu'tazila revival movement started in the west, by westernized Muslims who are sick of being shit on by Kuffars and seek to appeal to them "look we aren't terrorist !". The real Mu'tazilites would probably put these neo-mu'tazilite on trial and execute them for heresy. People frame the Mu'tazila as the "rational and tolerant" because they never studied them. The Mu'tazila were a school of thought, in term of legal rulings they followed the hanafite jurisprudence, meaning everything that the West hate about us is still applied by the Mu'tazila. Also the guys were absolutely not peaceful, **these are the people responsible for the** ***only*** **inquisition in Islamic history**. Good riddance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You hate the Mu #8217;tazila because the Mu #8217;tazila make you non-Muslims feel like shit! That's exactly why Muslims dumped the Mu'tazilas, too much takfir.  gt; You fear the Mu #8217;tazila and the revival of Islamic dominance. The Khilafah will return soon. Why would I fear the dead ? The Khilafah isn't coming anytime soon, no actual contender for the title can hold it, and I will neither follow Erdogan, nor MBS, nor Khamenei nor MMBZ or Sissi. If the Khilafah is to happen, it will be later.  gt; The Mu #8217;tazila are the only people who can destroy Western secularism and hypocrisies and lies of Sunnism. The Wasiliyah still exist today in the Maghreb. You #8217;re not even a Mutazili and you think you can talk about the Mu #8217;tazila? You don't seem to understand the implication of having a movement dead. The real Mu"tazilites disappeared long ago, and they do not exist anymore, and most of their literature is irremediably lost. The Wassiliyah of today, a fringe group has nothing to do with the Mu'tazila. The Maghreb is Maliki, deal with it.  gt; You didn #8217;t even watch the video. Because I don't want to. I told you, I don't care about what three uneducated thugs say about Islam. when it comes to actual debate, the Mu'tazilas got destroyed by the Sunnis. The Mu'tazila only way to assert themselves was through violence and persecution.  gt;The Mutazilite is the one refutting both the Qur #8217;anist and Sunni, and he does a great job, which seems to terrify you. It doesn't terrify in the slightest. This is not a Mu'tazilite, this is a guy who learnt Mu'tazilism from what their opponent said about them. The actual Mu'tazilites were dealing with heavy subjects and profound philosophical and theological problems. And they got refuted with profound philosophical and theological reasoning. Don't call yourself Mu'tazilite, you aren't a Mu'tazila, that would be like somebody trying to revive the Hashashin, you can't, they're gone, and their documents are gone.  gt; As for terrorists, militant Mu #8217;tazilites are considered terrorists. The Mutazilite followers of Diyab are considered terrorists by the Zionist Israelis. All Muslims are called terrorists by the Hebrew state. And Mu'tazilite aren't doing anything, Sunnis always did the heavy-lifting.  gt;Are you retarded or something? You seem so desperate and insecure. Like I said, go back to school. You have no valid points. How rational and intelligent of you, you straightly jumped to ad hominem. Go away kid, keep dreaming about the Mu'tazilas, they are dead, and they will never come-back. You can cosplay as them if you want, but one or the other, reality is going to hit you back.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Caliph Al-Ma #8217;mun had your boy Ibn Hanbal beaten like a little bitch He tried and failed to force Ibn Hanbal to admit his stupid idea that the Quran was created. Hereby humiliating himself in front of the Muslims. Ibn Hanbal, flawed as his theology and jurisprudence may be, was a Chad compared to al Mamun.  gt;Al-Ma #8217;mun did more for Islam than you Sunnis have ever done in your entire bum existence. While al-Ma #8217;mun was conquering Sicily and other parts of the world Yeah, he destroyed the Abbassid Caliphate with his stupid inquisition. And the guys who did the conquest were the Umayyads, sunnis, and the Rashidun, also Sunnis. And the guys who conquered Sicily were the Aghlabids. Do not try and challenge me on History.  gt;What have you Sunnis ever accomplished for Islam? We allowed you to exist. From Abu Bakr all the way to the Ottoman Caliphate, Sunnis have been the shield and sword of the Islamic world for more than a thousand years.  gt;Under the Mu #8217;tazila Sicily was the most advanced place in the whole of Europe. Except it was not, Al Andalus, a sunni Emirate/Caliphate, was the most advanced place in Europe.  gt;You Sunnis are the biggest kuffar to ever roam this planet. And yet we're the major branch of Muslim.  gt;What have your clergy ever done for Islam? We don't have clergy, that's the thing. We're Muslims.  gt;We were responsible for the Islamic golden age, that is why you hate us. You, like your ancestors, have nothing to offer Islam. Whenever you Sunnis boast to the Kuffar about the Islamic golden age, who do you mention? You guys represented thirty years in the Islamic Golden Age. When we speak about it, we cite Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Ibn Tofail, Ibn Nafis, Ibn Al Haytham, Ibn Khaldun, Abu al Qassis, Al Ghazali, Al Idrissi, Al Biruni. Again, I'm not going to watch your stupid video. And I'm not going to debate against you, you know nothing about the Mu'tazila, you're a desperate fanboy. And just to remind, it was we, sunnis who named them as such. The Mu'tazila carry the name by which we mocked them, because they do not exist anymore. The Mu'tazilite are dead, never to return. And your pathetic fanboyism will also die in the next decades.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Ghazali was too stupid to refute his own kufr ideology, how then could he refute the Mu #8217;tazila, who are his MASTERS, and the masters of all of you Sunnis and Sufis? Go figure. Anyway he did it, and the Mu'tazilas don't exist anymore.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The Ottomans were  #8220;Sunnis #8221;? Prove it. [These guys were Sunni, Hanafite, Ash'arite. The Mu'tazila ruled for 30 pathetic years. And then they dwindled and their scholars repudiated the doctine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_Ottoman_Empire)  gt; Most of the Aghlabids were also Mu #8217;tazilites, and they supported the Mihna. Sicily under Al-Ma #8217;mun was more advanced than al-Andalus. That #8217;s a fact. Further, the conquest of Sicily was ordered by al-Ma #8217;mun yet the Ummayads and the Aghlabids also took part in the conquest under the authority of al-Ma #8217;mun, which proves that the Ummayads and the Mu #8217;tazila got along. What the freak are you talking about. The Aghlabids, who were Hanafite/Mu'tazilite as I told you, uneducated idiot, conquered sicily alone. Al Andalus was at the time, more powerful, populous and advanced than Sicily. The Umayyads never participated in the conquest, and they didn't get along with the Mu'tazilites, they hated the Abbassid you dumbass.  gt; Anyway, show us one Caliph among the Rashidun, Ummayads, and Ottomans who called themselves  #8220;Sunni #8221;. I'm going to show more than one. 36 - Osman I (1299 #8211;1324) - Orhan (1324 #8211;1361) - Murad I (1361 #8211;1389) - Bayezid I (1389 #8211;1402) - Emir S #252;leyman  #199;elebi (1402-1411) - Musa  #199;elebi (1411-1413) -  #304;sa  #199;elebi (?-1406) - Mehmed  #199;elebi (1403-1413) - Mehmed I (1413-1421) - Murad II (1421-1444) - Mehmed II (1444-1446) - Murad II (1446-1451) - Mehmed II (1451-1453) - Mehmed II The Conqueror (1453-1481) - Bayezid II (1481-1512) - Selim I The Stern (1512-1520) - S #252;leyman I The Magnificent (1520-1566) - Selim II (1566-1574) - Murad III (1574-1595) - Murad III (1574-1595) - Mehmed III (1595-1603) - Ahmed I (1603-1617) - Mustafa I (1617-1618) - Osman II (1618-1622) - Mustafa I (1622-1623) - Murad IV (1623-1640) - Ibrahim (1640-1648) - Mehmed IV (1648-1687) - Mehmed IV (1648-1687) - S #252;leyman II (1687-1691) - Ahmed II (1691-1695) - Mustafa II (1695-1703) - Ahmed III (1703-1730) - Ahmed III (1703-1730) - Mahmud I (1730-1754) - Osman III (1754-1757) - Mustafa III (1757-1774) - Abd #252;lhamid I (1774-1789) - Selim III (1789-1807) - Selim III (1789-1807) - Mustafa IV (1807-1808) - Mahmud II (1808-1839) - Mahmud I (1808-1839) - Abd #252;lmecid I (1839-1861) - Abd #252;laziz (1861-1876) - Mehmed Murad V (1876) - Abd #252;lhamid II (1876-1909) - Abd #252;lhamid II (1876-1909) - Mehmed V R #257;sh #226;d (1909-1918) - Mehmed VI Wahid-Ad-D #238;n (1918-1922) - Mehmed VI Wahid-Ad-D #238;n (1918-1922) - Abd #252;lmecid II (1922-1924). And you can add all the Sunni Abbassids, because their were only three Mu'tazilas, the four-guided and the Umayyad Sultans.  gt;The Sunni religion that we know of today was formed in the mid-Abbasid era. If you read the letters of al-Ma #8217;mun you wil realise that he refers to  #8220;Sunnis #8221; as a  #8220;new movement #8221;. That would be quite bizarre, since Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik were born and died before him. Sunnis are the Eldest. The Mu'tazilas were but a minor which was thrown in the garbage of history. Name me one single Islamic country which follow this heresy ? In the end, you have lied, you have insulted, and you have laughed like a pork. As I told you, the Mu'tazilas are dead, and if you're their heir, then they must roll in their tombs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You got destroyed by a Mutazilite on Reddit, just like the layman Mu #8217;tazilites destroyed Ghazali the kafir Sufi. Dude, History is a thing. You can dream. But you can't change facts. The Mu'tazilites are dead. And the dead do not return. Ghazali destroyed them, with facts, logic, and reason.  gt; Your time is finished. Your authority doesn #8217;t exist anymore. Nobody respects you. Just remember we Mu #8217;tazilites are your masters. Another Mihna is coming, inshAllah. Allah Akbar! How so ? Out of the forty-ish Muslim Nations, none are Mu'tazila. The Mu'tazila do not exist. You're a wanna-be Mu'tazila.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The Ottoman caliphs were influenced by ilm al-Kalam and had good relations which the Mu #8217;tazila. 'Ilm al Kalam predates the Mu'tazilas, the Mu'tazilas are one of many Firaq al Kalam, including the Ash'arites, the Maturidite, the Jahmites etc... The Ottomans were Ash'arites Hanafite. The Mu'tazila didn't exist at the time.  gt;The Aghlabids pledged allegiance to the Mutazilite Caliphs and continued being Mu #8217;tazilites for the most part And they got absolutely rekt by the Fatimids Shia and the Arab tribes, Sunni.  gt; Many of the Ottoman Caliphs had harems and drank alcohol, just like the Ummayad and Mutazilite Caliphs, all of which goes against the teachings of the  #8220;Sunnis #8221;. Drinking alcohol is against Islam. Not Sunni. If you drink Alcohol you're sinning. Well you're already going to Hell no doubt, but don't lie about the Quran. Quran who we, Sunni preserved. Like we named them, remember. We gave them the mocking name of Mu'tazila. And you, their disciple use the name we used to mock them. But also, harem were common among Sunnis. The Mamluk Sultanate, the Umayyads of Cordoba, the Moroccan Sultans etc... Again, we Sunnis are the Eldest branch. The Mu'tazilite were like Jahmites and Qadarites are sects that are now dead. And your pathetic revival will also die.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; You got wrecked by a Mutazilite! I will keep saying this because I know it irritates you LMAO E/veryone now knows you are a stupid Sunni. It doesn't, you're by far the biggest buffoon I've argued with in my whole life. You're worse than the worst atheist I ever met. You never brought up any evidence, just insults and lies. You don't anything about history. But I will leave the people judge.  gt; They also know you got destroyed by a Mutazilite, just like your ancestors got destroyed by the Mu #8217;tazila. You're not a Mu'tazilite, they are dead. My ancestors, like you say, destroyed them, they do not anymore. The name you call them is an insult we invented. If anyone here is the humiliated slave it's you. Also, I watched the video, the pathetic response of that guy was full of fallacies. But since this coward deactivated the commentaries, I will not answer this worm you take as master. Remember, Sunnis are 9/10 of all Muslims, all the Caliphates from the Rashidun to the Ottomans were sunni, the Islamic conquest was Sunni, the Islamic Golden Age was Sunni, and today, nearly all of the Muslim countries are Sunni. I fear not the dead, nor the Kuffar who worship the dead.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Funnily you are actually a heretic among the Sunnis since you are a Sufi. I am not a Sufi. And Sufi is just mysticism, there were Mu'tazilite mystics.  gt; As for the term Mu #8217;tazila, the term Mu #8217;tazila was first used by Saad ibn Waqqas, a Sahabi.  #1575; #1604; #1605; #1593; #1578; #1586; #1604; #1577;  #1603; #1575; #1606; #1608; #1575;  #1610; #1591; #1604; #1602; #1608; #1606;  #1593; #1604; #1609;  #1571; #1606; #1601; #1587; #1607; #1605;  #1571; #1607; #1604;  #1575; #1604; #1593; #1583; #1604;  #1608; #1575; #1604; #1578; #1608; #1581; #1610; #1583;  #1608; #1575; #1604; #1593; #1583; #1604; #1610; #1577; And Saa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas never called himself as such, liar.  gt;Like Al-Ma #8217;mun said you Sunnis appeared during the Abbasid period. Like all Historian said, the Mu'tazilites appeared in the Abbassid period. Malik and Hanifa preceed the Mu'tazilite by a long shot.  gt; Everyone can also see you provided no proof that the Rashidun, Ummayad, and Ottomans were Sunnis. I don't need to. The burden of proof lies on you, it was always on you, in everything. Provide evidence or keep your forked tongue behind your teeth, witless snake. Everybody will see who is right.</TEXT>

As for the refutation of your stupid belief : The belief of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama #8217;ah is that the committing of a sin, no matter how major, does not expel one from Islam.The Mu'tazila refuses, saying that a person committing a major sin was neither a believer nor a disbeliever. This concept, of being neither Muslim nor Kafir, is one of the most emblematic positions of the Mu #8217;tazilites and you #8217;ll find it referred to as al-manzilah baynal manzilatayn. The basis of Mu #8217;tazilism was a melding of Hellenistic thought with Islam. Some people like to tout Muta #8217;zilites as the  #8220;rationalists #8221; of Islam. This shows that person's ignorance of history as well as theology. It was not  #8220;rationalists #8221; vs  #8220;traditionalists. #8221; There were several different schools on the relationship between reason and revelation and the Mu #8217;tazilites were but one attempt. The Falsafa were one important group, putting even more weight on Greek thought. The Asha #8217;ira, which rose as a response to the Mu #8217;tazilites were yet another group. The Hanbalis (theological school, not fiqh) were yet another. Ok, as to why Mu #8217;tazilites are at the very least, ahl-Bid #8217;ah. I #8217;ll talk about two of their most important points but the entire movement can be summarized very succinctly: When a text of either the Qur #8217;an or Hadith contradicted with reason (and again, reason here is Greek thought), the Qur #8217;anic/Hadith text had to be rejected in favor of reason. Because of their Hellenistic framework, certain positions were taken that deviated completely from the normative tradition. The term Mu #8217;tazilites was actually given to them by their opponents (cue the flood of progressives saying we should stop using the term then). They called themselves Ahl al-Tawhid wal  #8216;Adl. The first is monotheism and the second is justice. I #8217;ll talk about their stance on these two: In their quest to have a  #8220;just #8221; religion, they also had deviant beliefs in regards to fate and free will. In this, they echoed the beliefs of the Qadariyyah. In fact, some historians argue that the Mu #8217;tazilites were the Qadariyyah; that they were simply an expansion of that group into broader issues. They believed that humans have total free will and that Allah is ignorant of the future. In fact, there #8217;s a famous narration of a Mu #8217;tazilite scholar on this issue where a hadith on the matter was spoken to him. He replied,  #8220;If I heard this narration straight from the sahabi, I would call him a liar. If I heard it from the Prophet, I would tell him he misunderstood Allah. And if I heard it from Allah, I would tell Him that this is not why He created us. #8221; So as you can see, there #8217;s plenty of ground to stand on for those who consider the Mu #8217;tazilites to be beyond ahl bid #8217;ah and to be kuffar. Monotheism in the Mu #8217;tazilite conception was a complete denial of the attributes of Allah  #65019; #8206;. This had to do with the way they rationalized the existence of Allah  #65019; #8206;. Their proof is detailed and there #8217;s little point in repeating it here. The proof bears striking similarity to Aristotle's argument for the existence of God in Metaphysics. Suffice it to say, that for their argument to work, Allah  #65019; #8206; had to be devoid of all attributes. Mercy, Wisdom, Knowledge, Power, etc. All the attributes we read in the Qur #8217;an, at the end of almost every other ayah? They dismissed them or reinterpreted them. Because for them, the need to maintain the internal consistency of their theology outweighed the very clear meaning of the Qur #8217;an. This reinterpretation of the attributes of Allah  #65019; #8206; then posed a problem about the Qur'an itself. "Speech" is an attribute. Per their proof for the existence of God, God is devoid of attributes. Therefore, God can not speak. And so the Qur'an can not be the speech of God. This became such a crucial concept in their theology that when they gained political ascendancy through Ma'mun and then Mu'tasim, they implemented a scourge of all scholars who did not hold their views. It was this scourge that catapulted Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal to fame and caused him to be remembered in history as "Imam Ahlus Sunnah", i.e. "The Imam of the people of Sunnah". When his peers caved in to the tremendous pressure and torture and paid lip service to the doctrine, he remained firm and refused to capitulate. In fiqh, his school is one of four. In aqeedah, all Sunnis align themselves with the aqeedah of Imam Ahmad (with Atharis and Ash'aris disagreeing as to what exactly the details of his aqeedah were). The doctrine of Ahlus Sunnah is that the Qur'an is the eternal, uncreated Speech Allah  #65019; #8206;. Now, with all that said, Mu #8217;tazilite beliefs did vary at different stages of Islamic history and even between groups during a certain era. Their condition straddles the line between kufr and bid #8217;ah. Because some of these issues are quite esoteric and it #8217;s possible for an honest person to get caught up and be sincerely convinced of the validity of the arguments, most scholars label them as ahl-bid #8217;ah and not kuffar. Allahu a #8217;lam which one is more accurate, but there #8217;s no denying that they are outside of mainstream Islam. Good night, and enjoy your stay in Hell.  #1586; #1606; #1583; #1610; #1602;  #1605; #1585; #1580; #1587;  #1575; #1576; #1606;  #1575; #1604; #1603; #1604; #1576; #1577;</TEXT>

We live in a world where there is a whole freaking society dedicating to "prove" that the world is flat. **Pseudoscience** consists of statements or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method. The word Pseudoscience gained tractation in the second half of the 19th Century. Pseudoscience appeared **because** there were better definition and criterias for science, not because there weren't. If we can't define what is scientific and what is it, we can't identify pseudoscience.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually, the Torah isn't corrupt according to the Qur'an, it's corrupt according to evey single historian in the World. But that's beside the point. First thing first, this dude is not a Muslim, he's a westernized progressive neo-mu'tazilite who doesn't want to debate and will just insult you, so don't engage with him, as he doesn't have the intellectual capability to sustaining an actual debate. Second thing : The Qur'an, that this uneducated idiot has never opened says the following : \-Surah Al Maida, Verse 13 : *"So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard.* ***They distort words from their \[proper\] usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded.*** *And you will still observe deceit among them, except a few of them. But pardon them and overlook \[their misdeeds\]. Indeed, Allah loves the doers of good."*. \-Surah Al Baqqarah Verse : *"Do you covet \[the hope, O believers\], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then* ***distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?****"* So before even engaging with this video *(which is by the way a non academic work, so it has zero intellectual value apart from wishful thinking)*, the Quran disprove this guy. Third thing : I'm not going to disprove the Jew or the guy he debates with, but just u/No-Tap5045.  gt;Throughout history, ALLAH has revealed only one deen that there were different Sharias. For example the Sharia of Prophet Mussa pbuh was not identical to the Sharia of Prophet Nuh pbuh, yet both preached the same So his first sentence is correct, what is strange is that yesterday, u/No-Tape5045 argued that saying the Alcohol is Haram *(which it is, with Quranic proof of it)* is heresy because it means that the ancient Prophet who drank Alcohol were sinners. But here he acknowledge that each Sharia has its own rulings. Jews, according to their corrupted Book, say that eating shrimp is prohibited, yet we Muslim have nothing of this nature in the Quran. Conversely, we Muslims are prohibited to drink Alcohol, it's part of the Sharia of the Prophet. So this person knows this information, yet act as if she doesn't as to not destroy her weak theological foundations, showing a dishonest individual. One thing that he also doesn't note is that the Sharia supercedes each other, so the Quran is superior to the Tawrat and the Injil even if they were still uncorrupted, which they aren't.  gt;This verse CLEARLY does not connect men who "write the book with their hands" with the Tawrat. It doesn't mention the Tawrat anywhere. As a result, its essential claim is to censure those who write false scriptures in the name of Allah ad neglect his true scripture Except that it does, the Kitab in Arabic is the corpus later referred to as the Bible, 10 verses later, Allah says *"And we gave Moses the Book"*, that Book is evidently the Scriptures. So you're wrong. And we actually have historical proofs that the Jews had multiple contradiction narrations within the same book. Professor Maurice Bucaille write : *"As Edmund Jacob says, in the 3rd century BC, there were* ***at least*** *3 versions of the Hebrew Bible circulating : the Masoretic text, an unnamed version which is the origin of the Septuagint and the Samaritan Bible (add to it the Qumran manuscripts). By the 1st Century BC we are tending to a unified text, but it won't be until the 1st Century AC that their will be a true canon."* As you can see, the damages done by the Jews to their book are still pretty visible, even though their were attempt to hide it. The corruption of the bible is factual and supported by history, with hundreds of divergences *(and not like our Qira'at)* but real divergences which change the meaning. So since these are the only two real argument, the other one being a stupid rant and misuse of verse to try and say that Allah accounted for the Tawrat to be reliable, which is not only stupid, as the Qur'an supersede the non-existent uncorrupted Tawrat, but it is later refuted by the verses which present the Injil as a reaffirmation of the Tawrat *(after the Israelites strayed from the right path)*, and then when the *Prophet* came, the Quran came as a reaffirmation of both the Tawrat and the Injil, and whoever does not judge by it is a wrongdoer, this phrase is repeated with each one of the Scripture. Later, when Allah speak to th Faithful, he excludes the Jews and Christians, and in the next verse calls them traitors and ennemies. Anyway, as the Verses I posted in the beginning prove it, the Quran defend the **historical valid** claim of the corrupt unauthentic Tawrat. As a bonus, this is again Maurice Bucaille on the Hebrew Bible : *"The Old Testament is a* ***collection*** *of works of very unequal length and of various genres, written during more than nine centuries in several languages, from oral traditions. Many of these works have been corrected and completed, according to events or according to particular needs, at times that are sometimes very distant from each other."* Another one : *" The birth of this abundant literature took place at the beginning of the Israelite monarchy, around the eleventh century BC, at the time when the body of the scribes, characters cultivated whose role is not limited to writing. From this period can date the first very partial writings , writings that there was a particular interest to fix by writing: some of the songs which were quoted above, the prophetic oracles of Jacob and Moses, the Decalogue and, more generally, the legislative texts which, before the formation of a law, established a religious tradition. All these texts constitute pieces scattered here and there in various collections of the Old Testament. It is a little later, perhaps during the tenth century BC that the so-called  #8220;Yahwist #8221; text of the Pentateuch which will form the framework of the first five books known as of Moses. Later, we will add to this text the version called " #233;lohiste" and the so-called " priestly version". The initial Yahwist text deals with the period of the origins of the world until Jacob died. It emanates from the southern kingdom (Judah)."* So there were three versions of the Pentateuch which coexisted at the same time, how can one claim that the Tawrat is uncorrupted, when you have three versions ? How can one claim the Tawrat is uncorrupted when it says that King David *(Samuel Book and the Books of Kings)* ruled from Jerusalem when it was actually a farm town ? Israel Finkelstein book "The Bible unveiled" completely destroys whatever semblance of authenticity the Bible had. Not only the Tawrat is bollocks according to the Quran, you ignorant Mubtadi', but it's bollocks according to History and Archeology. *In fine*, you're a stupid ignorant neo-mu'tazilite, who funnily base his heretical doctrines on what we Sunni, the Elder branch, recorded of the dead Mu'tazila school of philosophy. "  #1573; #1616; #1606; #1617; #1614;  #1575; #1604; #1604; #1617; #1614; #1607; #1614;  #1580; #1614; #1575; #1605; #1616; #1593; #1615; ** #1575; #1604; #1618; #1605; #1615; #1606; #1614; #1575; #1601; #1616; #1602; #1616; #1610; #1606; #1614;**  #1608; #1614; #1575; #1604; #1618; #1603; #1614; #1575; #1601; #1616; #1585; #1616; #1610; #1606; #1614;  #1601; #1616; #1610;  #1580; #1614; #1607; #1614; #1606; #1617; #1614; #1605; #1614;  #1580; #1614; #1605; #1616; #1610; #1593; #1611; #1575; " Ultimately, you ignorance of Arabic disqualifies you.

    <TEXT> gt; There's a lot of other old franchises that still get... Franchising. That's because the Tolkien Estate *was* allergic to franchising. And also the fanbase is very reluctant to accept canon-divergence, expansion and change. IMHO, a Tolkien adaptation should follow the general pattern of Middle-Earth, a world of hope and faith that there is still good, but a profoundly sad and depressive world were everything diminish nonetheless. It would be incredible to see the dwindling of the Elves between the beginning and the End of the Amazon series.</TEXT>

So today is a very special day for me, because it's the day of my entrance in Ea, the world yes. So I've decided to make myself a little gift, a small magical trinket, and I will show how to do.

Anyway, we're doing a new Ring, but this one is a bit special. So I brought a special kind of gold, of my own device, the forge is ready all the material is here, Let's start !"

    <TEXT>I'm not against writing genocides in novels, I find them interesting settings, or even just background, as its something very easy to want to implement. But the reasoning is what is bizarre. Multi-religious countries aren't unheard off, especially in polytheist setting where multiple Gods would be worshipped by multiple under different names or with different abilities. What is unheard of however is a group going from tiny population to 15% in 20 years. Such a massive change would alert the authorities and even without the whole sorcery and fantasy elements, there would probably be violence, persecution and restrictions. Because religions are independent socio-cultural entities which can operate as states within states, if your world is polytheist and all Gods are shared, then no problem for somebody to start worshipping another God as they change, a farmer who becomes a warrior will start praying to Ares and Athena more than Demeter. But this is at an individual level, if many people start dropping Demeter for Ares and Athena, this is a quick change that will result in civil unrest. But that's not even the case here, here you have an organized religion with a set of scriptures by which they abide, so my question is : *What does this religious group say of other faith ?* Even without your godlike entity coming in, this community will be severely watched by the government, and if problems arise *(and believe me, they will)*, massacres and forced conversions are going to happen.</TEXT>

There aren't that many legends concerning him. Granted, this was probably impossible for one man to do. But don't tell me Feanor is the chief matter of the Quenta Silmarillion when he dies at the very beginning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well not Galadriel for starters, she was at best a tertiary character during the War of the Jewels. Feanor could have been the chief matter, but he didn't live for long, as I said elsewhere, saying he is the chief matter of elven legends is like saying Dedalus is the chief matter of the myth of Perseus. Luthien can't be the chief matter of the first age. All her action spans a few years and then she fade away from the story, she is an important character of the Silmarillion, and the chief matter of her own tale, but certainly not of all the legends and histories of the Elves. Due to the Silmarillion unfinished and really vague nature, nobody can really be considered the chief matter of the Elven legends, but if I were to pick somebody. I would chose either Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe or Fingolfin. The first are the main character of the migration of the Elves, and the second was the High-King for 4 centuries in Middle-Earth, the regent of Tirion, he took his people through the Helcaraxe, worked with his nephew to avoid strife, participated in three of the five battles, brought peace and prosperity to his new empire and died fighting Morgoth. In terms of goal-achievment he surclass Feanor and Luthien.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Of course they was a good case scenario. Feanor take his responsibilities as King instead of fleeing like a little bitch, they cross the Helcaraxe with Fingolfin, thereby butterflying the Kinslayings, which means no doom of the Noldor, which means Finarfin comes with them, which means Thingol won't be such a dick toward the Noldor, which means more Sindar participate, which means they are much more successful in their war against Morgoth. If Luthien get the Silmaril, Feanor will ask for it, Melian won't object since he didn't do any evil for it, and the Noldor will follow him, that's one Silmaril in his pocket. After sometime, the Valar see Morgoth is sufficiently weakened and intervene, they capture Morgoth, and Feanor comes and claim his Silmarils. As he had now done nothing evil, the Silmarils will not burn him, and he either stays in Middle-Earth, or return.</TEXT>

Feanor died before any of the important events of Middle-Earth took place. If one was to adapt the Silmarillion, Feanor and his story would be analogue to Sauron and the forging of the rings, background.

I'm saying that in the text the Silmarillion, as fictional characters, these three aren't the chief matter of the Legend.

    <TEXT> gt; The problem here is the idea of equating the "Circles of the World" with "Arda." The problem here is actually the idea of equating Ea with Arda.  gt; Arda is **all** of the world created through the Music of the Ainur, regardless of its shape. That's just false, *Ea* is all the world created through the Music, Arda was but a small part of it.  gt;The "Circles" were a different thing before the Downfall, but they were still "the Circles," just a different kind of round. Now the Circles denote a boundary that mortals cannot pass during their mortal lifetimes. The Circles of the World was actually always vague in its meaning, but if it didn't mean Arda, it meant Arda + the Whole Universe. Maedhros refers to the Circles of the World as the boundary between them and Illuvatar. After the Downfall, it became restricted to Arda proper, the planet where everybody lives. All of this comes from your misunderstanding of the nature of the Elves. The Elves aren't tied to Arda in a physical sense, nothing stops them from building spaceships and going to other planets. They are spiritually tied to Arda, and exist while it does. You can say that since Aman was originally part of Arda, as a philosophical concept, but as a planet, they are two distinct heavenly bodies. And since Feanor spoke before the sundering of Aman, he was referring to Arda the planet, not Arda the concept.  gt;they just pass beyond the Circles onto the Straight Road, still in the world. So they pass beyond the Circles of the World, while still being in the World ?</TEXT>

Shouldn't the punishing be impactful to actually be effective ? If I just pinch him, he won't remember it. But if I spank him, he could develop ill feelings. Until I find a precise guideline, I will exhort in good faith and with patience and wisdom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;If you are providing everything for her and she is still under your roof then you are still responsible as you are still her guardian. Its not like as soon as they become baligh you let them do what they want as there is no sin on you for their actions. Of course it is. Prophet Nuh's son was a Kaffir, Nuh didn't kick him out of his house, he actually pleaded for him, and Allah told him it wasn't his burden to carry.  gt;So its not like Prophet Lut knew she was a kaafir and he was fine with it. He left her because it was the command of Allah. Prophet Lut definitely knew she was a kaffirah and was fine with it. But if you don't like it, Prophet Nuh also knew his wife was Kaffirah and she refused to follow him, but he didn't kick her out.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Is there much you discipline your children for that could be worse than not wearing hijab? Quite a few but that's beside the point. Again, if you just want me to force her wear it, I have no problem doing it. But you won't convince it's an effective method.  gt;The last part of your comment is just absurd. There are no "official Islamic institutions", we aren't Catholic, each scholar has to be considered on their own merits. Except that he doesn't, if all scholars agree on a matter, then they're legally right, by consensus. Remember : *"My community will never agree on an error"*.  gt;The government does not determine what is religiously right, this argument was already addressed in the time of the Minha. Actually it does, in a Caliphate, which everybody here dreams off, the government and the clergy are one. The Ottoman Caliphate for example implemented the devchirmeh, even though it broke the dhimmi status. Likewise, the Moroccan Sultanate enslaved black muslims, with the avail of all religious authority *(ie, an Ijmaa)* except one, who was executed. You see, there is a stark difference between what should be, and what is. And we Muslim generally imagine that the past was what it should have been, forgetting what it was.  gt;And the fact you consider the Saudi dogs of the Zionists opinion relevant really says a lot about where you are coming from. Not from saudi Arabia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is plain extrapolation, I've just swept through 5 tafasseer, none say that the  #1606; #1588; #1608; #1586; is related to abandoning religious duties. What it says though is that  #1606; #1588; #1608; #1586; lifts the burden of the financial contribution of the men. He is no more entitled to pay for her.</TEXT>

Held by practically all the Jinn-Kings since times immemorial. *Nerjinn* : Literally *"Light of the Jinn"*, is the title used by more "democratically" appointed rulers. Or just Kings who happen to be very popular. *Saarjagam* : Literally *"King of the Heaven"*. Is a title generally reserved to God, but it was used by another one, and it have never been used since, due to its blasphemous nature. *Saarjin* : Literally *"Exhalted/High Jinn"*, is the title of the Jinn equivalent of Ruler. It can be held by a King, an Elected ruler, a Warlord etc... Historically it would be more close to Caliph, as it was a custom title made a Jinn King which proclaimed his secular and spiritual preeminence. Holder of the Sceptre : The Heir Apparent of the throne of Fengaria. Atate : Leader of Istas Hari #234;. Adamihn : Father of the Nation, title of the President of *Nemor*.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you, I don't generally worldbuild ruling titles as I find them to be distracting. I'd rather make-up a title like *"Holder of the Sceptre"* instead of some greek gibberish that no one is going to understand. Since my characters have already original names, I don't want to annoy my reader. But in some cases, I find it interesting, like with the Jinns, it helps to instill the exotic and foreign feel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Well I mean, islamically speaking dissent against the khalifa isn't allowed. That was the position held by corrupt scholars who worked with the governments. And it was a stupid and irrational position at that. Muslims shouldn't rebel, but if they rebel and win, then they are rightful. Which basically means *"You're allowed to rebel, if you can win"*. And since nobody knows the Ghayb but Allah, that means everybody has the right to rebel.  gt; Only scholars / men of knowledge are allowed to take part in deciding leadership Yep, and that's why the Islamic civilization fell behind the Western civilization and now we're the doormat of the world. The reality is that if you don't allow the people to speak for themselves, they aren't going to fight for you. And if you're a corrupt kafir who works against his people, they're going to revolt. The Prophet commanded us to enjoin good and forbid wrong and he said : *"He from you who sees a wrong deed should repair it with his hand, if not with his tongue, if not with his speech and that is the lowest degree of Faith"*. If real scholars were like you, we would be Mu'tazilite now.  gt;Again, this is generally more applicable to a true khilafa, because that has systems built into the shura to ensure a corrupt leader is removed via the correct channels Except that its just false. Let's see the best of the Khilafat, the Rashidun, it ended after thirty years, why ? Because even if the Khalifa is a good person, there always going to be evil and corrupt persons. And if the Khalifa isn't going to protect my right, then he's no Khalifa. Even the Prophet Bay'ah wasn't eternally binding, you had the right to retreat and change your allegiance.  gt;Islam *also* says that if a khalifa is overthrown, the new leader is to be put in place and allowed to continue, once again until the shura decides to remove him, or not. Again, that's not what Islam says, that's what scholars said. The Sahaba when they butchered themselves didn't stop when Mu'awiya took power, the fitna continued until one of them emerged victorious. Islam doesn't have a juridiction of the rebellion, a rebellion starts when people are endangered, and it ends when someone assert his power and stabilize the country. If you want to avoid rebellion, you give the people the right to speak themselves, and to choose their leader, while having this leader being restrained by other powers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;If you give people the complete freedom to chose for themselves by something as brainless and arrogant as majority rules, you end up with the absolute disgusting societies that the west has given. Which are the most advanced societies in the World. You prefer to live in Germany or in Egypt ?  gt;Islamic civilization fell behind western civilization due to greed for money and power, not because the people were unhappy with the way the government was structured. And what does greed for money and power do exactly, tell me please ? What happens when a population is ruled through tyranny and exploited ? They are unhappy and unwilling to fight. Emir 'Abd al Qader, the famous algerian resistant didn't fight for the Ottoman Sultan, who abandoned him, nor for the Dey, who was a corrupt official, but for the Algerian people. Islamic civilization fell behind because the lower-class Muslims were oppressed and exploited by the higher class, that's why. When diplomats went to the West in the 19th century, they marveled at the fact that people were paying their taxes without needing massacres, that the citizens enlisted in army to die and defend their countries instead of relying on armies of slaves and tribal warlords whose allegiances was to whoever paid more. The Islamic world fell because whatever form of Caliphate they implemented, it wasn't the right one. Plain. Easy. Simple.  gt; Why should a random people without knowledge be allowed to vote and decide the fate of their whole nation? Look at the US! Look at Morocco ! Algeria ! Tunisia ! Lybia ! Egypt ! Syria ! Jordan ! Irak ! Saudi Arabia etc... These aren't random people, these are citizens of the state, the people who will work and live and pay taxes and defend the country. If you love to have *"councils of elders and scholars who rule the country"*, go anywhere to the Arab World, you'll know the value of what the Western system gives you. If the people don't consider you legitimate, it doesn't matter who you are or how good you pretend to be, you're going to get evicted.  gt; Men of wisdom, who have education and have taqwah of Allah are the only ones who will ever truly work in the interests of humanity. If Democracy is a garbage idea because it's attainable, then this is also a garbage idea. Men of wisdom who have education and Taqwah don't enter politics. People who enter politics are cunning and strategist who have ambition.  gt;Islam makes it so anyone can seek knowledge, and the knowledgeable work to decide upon leaders locally and federally that do good work. Yes but no, the knowledgeable won't rule unless the people accept it. Do you know that if people don't want an Imam, they can throw him out of the Masjid. In France, a lot of imposed Imams were boycotted and fired because they were corrupt.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; 2- She "escaped the Sack of Doriath" "and perhaps aided the escape of Elwing to the Havens of Sirion with the Silmaril" no more detail about her part in the Second Kinslaying. Galadriel aiding Elwing to escape to the Havens of Sirion with the Silmaril would be quite a stupid move on her behalf. Someone as wise as her ought to have understood that the Silmarils will always attract the sons of Feanor. Moreover, doesn't she say *verbatim* that she left Beleriend way before the fall of Doriath ?  gt;3- Fingolfin and ~~Galadriel~~ Finrod and their host crossed Helcaraxe, they were very tired and broken, and as soon as they set their foot on ME, the host of Morgoth attacked them. Nothing is stated about Galadriel fighting there, but anyone who could fight there, fought.  #8203;  gt;4- The Attack of the White Council is obscure, the only thing that is explicitly stated is that Sauron fled as soon as the White Council arrived to Dol Guldur. To me it seems like Galadriel led the armies of Lorien with the aid of the White Council and attacked Dol Guldur. Reasons : Dol Guldur caused a lot of trouble and it must have been occupied with great armies. Gandalf feared that Sauron will soon attack Lorien. Dol Guldur is near Lorien. Its actually stated that Sauron fled because he had nothing to do there anymore. But I doubt Galadriel led the armies of Lorien, because else there would have been a big battle where the elves get kicked out of Dol Guldur of which Tolkien doesn't speak. Add to it, that it was **Saruman**'s devices which enabled the victory. It was more likely a duel of sorcery and will, like what happened with the Nazguls at Weathertop.  gt;6- Sauron sent a shadow and clouds of terror and he was going to slaughter Eorlingas, but Galadriel sent a magical mist that overcame the sorcery of Sauron and healed and protected Eorlingas. I think there was a Battle of Songs of Power going on there; Sauron and Galadriel fought in Songs of Power there. Galadriel overcame him. Are you sure this isn't just what Dol Guldur does normally ? I'm going to leave doubt here, but I lean toward *"Sauron wasn't ther"*. Because this seem strange, as elsewhere it is said that if Sauron dared to come himself, the defences of Lorien would break before him, just like Morgoth could overcome the Girdle if he wasn't such a baby.  gt;8- "In the Great Battle when at last Morgoth was overthrown and Thangorodrim was broken, the Edain alone of the kindreds of Men fought for the Valar, whereas many others fought for Morgoth. And after the victory of the Lords of the West those of the evil Men who were not destroyed fled back into the east," and a Balrog and many more servants of Morgoth fled and crossed the mountains (some of them fled even before Morgoth was overthrown). Galadriel was in Eriador with her group of Elves. I think some of servants of Morgoth encountered with Galadriel, Though this is nowhere stated. Why not.  gt;9- In FA Sauron killed Galadriel's brother, Finrod "the nearest to her heart". When Morgoth was overthrown "she refused the pardon of the Valar for all who had fought against him," and because of "her sense that it was her duty not to depart while he (the future Dark Lord/Sauron) was still finally unconquered." AND "she perceived from the beginning that Middle-earth could not be saved from "the residue of evil" that Morgoth had left behind him save by a union of all the peoples who were in their way and in their measure opposed to him." When Sauron met her "He perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle," But here is the mind blowing fact; there is no record of where Galadriel was during the Last Alliance. In reality she must have participated in the Last Alliance. I think she did, though it is not explicitly stated. I'm pretty sure because she was still proud, stubborn and ambitious. Though avenging your fallen sounds like a good excuse to not beg pardon.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;This is what she says in LotR. But in several versions she left Beleriand after War of Wrath. And in some versions she left after some time when she was in Sirion. Well, what is more canon than LoTR ? Unless senile-grandma Galadriel is a thing.  gt; Plans and strategies. Dee-viceeez  gt;Bro what? You seriously need to re-read the book  #1575; #1582; #1608; #1740;. I just did, and it says Magic of Dol Guldur, not Magic of Sauron. Angband and Minas Morgul were still places of dread and terror even after their owners passed beyond the circles of this world.  gt;Great, in other post you say Galadriel was changed. In here you disagree with yourself. Just like Tolkien himself, my opinion on characters change. Just kidding, I remember it changed her, but that doesn't she has repented, if all it took to change somebody was an earth-bending event, then Sauron and Melkor would be good. Nah better, Fir'aun and the People of Nuh, Lut and Shu'ayb would have repented.  gt;Yes her main reason was pride but there was other reasons as Tolkien several times mentioned. One of those was love of Celeborn. Okey, pride, stubbornness, ambition and that sweet, juicy silver haired mast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;What's the evidence in the Quran and Sunnah that supports the form of governance you're advocating for? I'm not advocating for any form of government. I have no problem following a King if said King rules by what Allah said, and I have no problem following an elected council of elders if said council rules by what Allah said, the problem is that what Allah said, and what these guys understand generally doesn't coincide. And I will not support or advocate for a ruler who is corrupt and tyrannical. The scholar work done during the Middle-Ages which gave us these disgusting opinions is the same one which gives us corrupt and sold out leaders.  gt;And I don't understand your argument that the masses have the power to throw out their leaders, and therefore their preferences should rule. My argument is pretty simple, you see how the early Caliphs were ruling from a Masjid were everybody and their mother could come, complain and propose ? That's what Islam should be like. The Islamic World has a lot of reasons behind its pathetic failure as a civilization, the least of them being not the oppression of lower classes. If your ruler doesn't listen to you, doesn't represent you, and does nothing in your advantage, you aren't going to follow him, that's quite simple. He can hide behind the clutches of scholars, that won't save him. It baffles me how you guys are full of comptent against yourselves. You do realize that you're part of the mass ? Wouldn't you want to have a say in how the State spend your taxes ? How it plans to implement laws and who actually gets to rule ? You're the Muslims ? The backbone of the Ummah and you don't want to be an active member in protecting the Ummah and implementing God's law ?  gt;Does that make them justified, and make the prophet a bad leader for not following the preferences of the majority? But that's a bad example, the Prophet wasn't the leader of the Quraysh, and he wasn't planning on overthrowing the Quraysh, he was calling people to Islam, if the Quraysh **nobles** had converted and ruled according to Allah's will then there wouldn't have been problems. The Prophet didn't become a political leader until he came to Yathrib, at which point he ruled fairly and with justice, avoiding strife and internal problems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Qevas :  gt;1-How is it learnt ? It's a three part learning. First, you learn how to use Magic in the Human fashion. Then you learn *qevian* script and language. Then you use this language to write a long-ass multi-facet spell that describe your power. And poof, you have a power.  gt;How is it executed ?  #8203;  gt;Does it have a will of its own ? Nope. You can do whatever it is said that you can do.  gt;Is it restricted in time and space Yes, it's restricted in space, according to your communion with whatever you're controlling, you can impact more or less area, and it's here where the differences between *qevists* show.  gt;What does available magic do ? Essentially military tasks.  gt;How does it relate to the character, to the plot and the theme ? It relates to the same character in the same way your specialty would relate to you, it's something they have chosen because it fascinates them, it pleases them or because that's the power of their master. How it relates to the plot ? It's a tool like a sword or a gun. How does it relate to the theme ? When the first characters obtained Qevas, it was through an angelic act of pity so...  gt;What is the cost of magic *and does it have drawbacks* The cost for getting it is pretty simple, you're a damned soul. There is no cost for using it, as long as you're in communion with whatever you're controlling. It's drawbacks is that you aren't immune to your own magic, so if you wield a dangerous magic, try not to overuse it.  gt;What can it not do ? It can't control living matters, you can hurt them, but you can't use them.  gt;How long does it last ? As long as you re willing to sustain it, or when it achieve its purpose, or when its effect naturally dies out.  gt;Why doesn't people with this power taken over the world ? They don't have the luxury of antagonizing their fellow humans and engaging in a pointless and costly war.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Who will be the judge of whether or not a King or council of elders is ruling by what Allah said? Islamic Jurists, selected due to their knowledge, competence and honesty. At least two of these requirements are quantifiable.  gt;and any Muslim citizen who feels the King or council of elders is not ruling by what Allah said should take arms against their Muslim leaders and brothers? No, and that's why it is important to give the Muslims the opportunity to voice their opinion.  gt;That's the issue with saying you will only follow a Muslim leader if they lead "correctly." If leading by what Allah said is interpreted as leading by what the masses consider to be what Allah said, it is impossible to have a stable Muslim state. Leading by what Allah said is interpreted according to independent and large bodies of scholars. I can put my faith in the consensus of a hundred Jurists, but not in one appointed State-Mufti.  gt;In democracy, the leader follows the majority, even if he knows or believes them to be wrong. If he does not, he is voted out. The thing is I didn't advocated for advocate, I advocate for not repeating the same errors, the Muslim doesn't getting by the serpent twice. We already tested the feudal method, time to return to actual Islamic governing.  gt;Part of being a Muslim is submission, to Allah, but also to His prophets, and also to the people of wisdom and knowledge. You do realize that *"people of wisdom and knowledge"* is a meaningless term do you ? You do realize that your *"people of wisdom and knwoledge"* will bow like dogs before whichever strong man of the moment is there ? Tamerlane was certainly courted by many "*people of wisdom and knowledge"*, that didn't stop him from being a murderous tyrant who killed 5% of humanity. Am I supposed to be like you and say : *"Well he is with people of wisdom and knowledge, there is certainly some Islamic ruling on why one should kill 17 million people"*. Let's just be clear : The Prophet is dead, with him faded the last truly good ruler, now we only have ambitious and cunning people whom if we don't check, will eat us.  gt;I think the ummah should be protected by people being aware of their limitations and their role, and not by each individual taking matters into their own hands and deciding they should be the ones to dictate which rulers are ruling by what Allah said and which are not. You're idealist, I'm not. People in power won't know their limitations and role, rather they will quickly get high on power and want to become earthly king. It happened once, it will happen again. And what is funny, there will always be na #239;ve people like you to defend them. At some point, you need to open your eyes, and understand that Jurists, Imams and Theologians, Kings, Caliphs and Presidents are Humans, they have their failings, they commit errors, and they commit crimes. The Sahaba butchered themselves over politics, and you want to me trust simple humans ?  gt;The same rhetoric and reasoning was used by the Khawarij, and it is what shattered and weakened the Ummah, not united or strengthened it. The Khawarij were a consequence of the problems of the Caliphate, which started all the way with 'Umar excluding some of the Ansar from the council of Shura, not its cause.  gt;He didn't do that by ruling in accordance with the preferences of the masses Because he was a Prophet, whatever he told you was the word of Allah, you don't discuss the world of Allah, if the Prophet tells you to kill yourself, you don't balbutiate, you execute his order. Now, our hypothetic caliph and scholars on the other hand aren't Prophets, they are normal men subject to the same failings as all men. And the reality is that he had the accord of the masses. Allah says it in the Quran, people follow him not only because he says he is a Prophet, but because he has the qualities that come with such a title. If the Prophet was harsh and ruthless, people wouldn't have followed him ** #1601; #1614; #1576; #1616; #1605; #1614; #1575;  #1585; #1614; #1581; #1618; #1605; #1614; #1577; #1613;  #1605; #1617; #1616; #1606; #1614;  #1575; #1604; #1604; #1617; #1614; #1607; #1616;  #1604; #1616; #1606; #1578; #1614;  #1604; #1614; #1607; #1615; #1605; #1618;  #1750;** *** #1608; #1614; #1604; #1614; #1608; #1618;  #1603; #1615; #1606; #1578; #1614;  #1601; #1614; #1592; #1617; #1611; #1575;  #1594; #1614; #1604; #1616; #1610; #1592; #1614;  #1575; #1604; #1618; #1602; #1614; #1604; #1618; #1576; #1616;  #1604; #1614; #1575; #1606; #1601; #1614; #1590; #1617; #1615; #1608; #1575;  #1605; #1616; #1606; #1618;  #1581; #1614; #1608; #1618; #1604; #1616; #1603; #1614;*** ** #1750;  #1601; #1614; #1575; #1593; #1618; #1601; #1615;  #1593; #1614; #1606; #1618; #1607; #1615; #1605; #1618;  #1608; #1614; #1575; #1587; #1618; #1578; #1614; #1594; #1618; #1601; #1616; #1585; #1618;  #1604; #1614; #1607; #1615; #1605; #1618;  #1608; #1614; #1588; #1614; #1575; #1608; #1616; #1585; #1618; #1607; #1615; #1605; #1618;  #1601; #1616; #1610;  #1575; #1604; #1618; #1571; #1614; #1605; #1618; #1585; #1616;  #1750;  #1601; #1614; #1573; #1616; #1584; #1614; #1575;  #1593; #1614; #1586; #1614; #1605; #1618; #1578; #1614;  #1601; #1614; #1578; #1614; #1608; #1614; #1603; #1617; #1614; #1604; #1618;  #1593; #1614; #1604; #1614; #1609;  #1575; #1604; #1604; #1617; #1614; #1607; #1616;  #1754;  #1573; #1616; #1606; #1617; #1614;  #1575; #1604; #1604; #1617; #1614; #1607; #1614;  #1610; #1615; #1581; #1616; #1576; #1617; #1615;  #1575; #1604; #1618; #1605; #1615; #1578; #1614; #1608; #1614; #1603; #1617; #1616; #1604; #1616; #1610; #1606; #1614; (159)** A stable government is one where all components of society balance each other.

    <TEXT> gt;and it seems like we're more in agreement than I realized, but there's still points I'm not quite clear on. We're bound to disagree over something, as long as it is a respectful debate and a constructive one, we can disagree.  gt;You seem to think that I'm speaking in defense of and in favor of dictators and tyrants, by saying we can not rebel against them. There's a difference between saying it's our obligation to endure, and saying they are righteous and just. I don't think you're in favor of dictators and tyrants. I'm not opposing you, I'm opposing a wide-spread opinion born in scholarly-circles which were actually the obedient servants of their lords, and thus they crafted an alternative to divine right. I believe that this opinion is not only wrong, it is dangerous. Because if we allow a Fassiq to rule under the pretext that the Fitnah is worse, we're going to trade a short-term stability for an unislamic state, and that's simply impossible in my point of view.  gt;In my understanding/opinion, as worthless as it is, government, as far as Islam is concerned, is similar to the relationship between a parent and a child. Except that a child has the right, nay, the obligation to disobey if his parents force him to do something unislamic. Likewise, the Ummah has the duty to raise up against a Fassiq.  gt; Similarly, the fact that leaders today are not perfecting the role of leadership does not mean we have no obligations to them as citizens. You see, here is the difference between both our understanding. As an hypothetical citizen of a Caliphate, I don't consider myself as beholden to any ruler, rather I see myself as in a contractual association with him, he applies the rule of Islam and I follow him, he doesn't apply the rules of Islam and I'm not beholden to him anymore. There are many fish in the sea. And again, there is a difference between a bad ruler, a ruler who makes errors and a Fassiq. I don't hold grudges against a ruler who makes errors, I can tolerate a bad ruler, but I won't tolerate a Fassiq.  gt; As for what it is you're advocating for, I'm not quite sure. I'm not advocating for anything, I'm demonstrating how hard it is to imagine a functioning political system. I used the example of Germany and Egypt to say that maybe, just maybe, we need to rethink our political conception, not in light of the west obviously, though we can learn from their mistakes and their success, but through our own literary tradition and most importantly how the Prophet ruled, and how his successor *tried* to follow him. And when I am saying Islamic Jurists selected based on knowledge and competence, I mean they aren't appointed by whoever rules the Caliphate, but rather, this is the entity which shall check him from becoming a Fassiq or a Taghut.  gt;What exactly are you trying to say we should do, as Muslim citizens? We as Muslim citizens in a Caliphate ? I don't know. ~~I don't think a western democracy is useful, since those we elect won't actually benefit us, since those we elect aren't in charge of putting legislation. But then, there are matters which must be discussed and can't be decided by jurists, so there must be people who will take "secular decisions", and these people must represent the people~~. You see, for me to give you how the Muslim citizen should do in a Caliphate, I need to first imagine a functioning Caliphate. For now, I'm mainly saying we should drop the idea that *any* ruler is better than *no* ruler.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The question now is only, where is the limit when it comes to leaders? I never said any leader is better than no leader, I said there was a limit. And that limit is when the leader not only does something unislamic, but wants to force it.  gt;For example, if you would consider Erdogan a Fasiq that should not be followed and should be rebelled against, have the body of Islamic jurists declared him to be such? I don't consider Erdogan a Fasiq that should not be followed. He isn't perfect, but he isn't the devil either. And as I conceive it, the BIJ isn't here to be judge, plaignant and executor, but rather they are here  gt;Also, is the PM of Germany a Fasiq? Or the president of the US? Does that mean a Muslim living in western countries has even more cause than those living in Muslim countries to revolt and refuse to live in obedience to the government? These are Kuffar, so they fall under a different legislation. We're talking about a conceptual Caliphate where  gt;And as far as I know, so do scholars There is a wide array of scholars, and they changed opinion with time. The earliest scholars were more strict on the limit set for a ruler, as long as he did not contradict *Shari'ah*, or in other words, as long as the executive power and the legislative weren't merged, he was a Good Ruler and you should always follow him. In later times, scholars drifted from this strict position to a more lenient one, where an unjust ruler should be obeyed but not condoned *(Al Ghazali)*, to the late medieval position of *any ruler is better than no ruler*. As you can see, the leniency of scholars correlate with how weak the Islamic World is. In the early days, when we were still in the midst of conquest, Muslim weren't compromising in anything. Later, as the Abbassid fell in decay but retained a shadow of power, their was more tolerance to their sins and deviations and when the Caliphate was gone and instability roaming, we passed into the territory of *any ruler is better than no ruler*.  gt;I said people of wisdom and knowledge If said people of wisdom and knowledge have no power, they can't use their wisdom and knowledge efficiently.  gt;So what is the limit that you believe makes a leader go from one that should be followed to one that should not? The Hadiths you mentioned contradict each-other, one says *any ruler should be obeyed*, the other say *any Muslim ruler should be obeyed*. Anyway, IMUO, the limit is when the ruler command you to go against the word of God.  gt;Also, is the PM of Germany a Fasiq? Or the president of the US? These aren't Muslims though, and we're talking about how the Muslim citizen should be involved in the preservation and protection of the Islamity of the Caliphate. As a citizen of the US, I suppose scholar consider you an off-shoot or a reenactment of the first hijra to Abyssinia.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As part of our thought process, one must remember that at times, Jurist borrowed from Kuffar for their laws. The classical example being how the 'Ulama decreed that a blinded Caliph couldn't rule, which is just a copy of the Rum canon, and that led to Caliphs blinding their rivals or getting blinded etc... As such, the 'Ulamas had relinquished their power to the Caliph, and he was effectively the law-giver and the executer of the law. This lead to bizarre opinions such the 'Ulamas *retroactively* declaring Al Muttawakkil a Taghut, then when his successor died they withdrew their claim. Another thing is that the power of the 'Ulamas as law interpreters derive from the vagueness of the law-texts. In other word, if one is to try and codify the Shar'iah, the 'Ulamas will lose power. But if they lose power, the balance is lost, and the Caliph becomes again more powerful than the 'Ulama.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Oh yes, this one I was waiting for. I hope non-human female characters count : ***Saarjin Arlan*** ***:*** **Bringer of Misery.** * She is a *Jinn*, one of the Twelve Apostles, made to endure as long as their King, she and *Maarin* are the only Apostles who share a bond of friendship. A master of magic, she is the Queen of frost and cold, having bested *Fendhal*, spirit of Frost himself. She participated and waged many war, earning her the Title *Bringer of Misery**.* * She participated in the first Battle against humans, but after humiliating their defeat, she alongside her colleagues returned to the West, harboring a profound hatred to the Humans in general and the ten and their disciples in particular, where she managed her realm, strengthening and forging many alliances. * Once *Bel'al* was destroyed, strife arose between her and *Nayzuk*, another Apostle. Their conflict lasted half a century, culminating in a climactic duel where *Nayzuk* fled before the might of *Arlan* and her host into the depths of the Earth. With *Nayzuk* out of the picture, and *Nerlaen* lost, she unites all the realms, pressuring *Zahar* to follow her, but also gathering to her a great host from all the corners of their World, greatest since the days of the *Kings* and never to be surpassed until **War** itself came from its slumber. * In *60th* Century, Humanity has greatly advanced, we're on the brink of what could be dubbed as an industrial revolution. Sadly, men won't be able to profit from it. South of the Menrealm, in the Isle of *Salemoth*, the Order prepare for a war such as it has never experienced before. In the Summer of the 5965, the Great Fleet of *Arlan*, composed of ice-ships sustained by her, are spotted by the westernmost kingdoms of Men. The first battle is a resounding for *Arlan*, and with that she sets foot on the Men realm, first *Jinn* since 6 millenias to meet men. Humans were caught unprepared and thus are slaughtered. For more than two decades she will wage rampage on the Westernmost continent. It is at this that she meets the first member of the Order, but without support they cannot throw her back at the sea. Having securized her prizes, she move onto *Tiontju*. Alarmed the Order merge a great army, called the *White Ost*, and sent it to *Tiontju*. There, they unite with Men and thus start the *Battle of Tiontju.* For five years Humans will put a brave resistance, but the *White Ost* is broken, but she cannot cross the Ocean to Tarangea, blocked by the Order and the combined fleet of *Aramul*, *Istas Hari #234;, Urun* and various other kingdoms. Furious at the resistance of humans, *Arlan* will unleash her tremendous power on the World. For 26 years she will ravage the newly conquered territories razing cities to the ground and salting fields. In the end, she manage to break through and enter *Tarangea*, but here Men have prepared for her arrival, and her advances are slow. for a decade she will advance eastward but since her arrival, her plans have changed, her allies are growing tired and she needs to know where the Order hides. It is during the Great Siege of *Istas Hari #234;*, were at last she learns the emplacement of *Kalatihr*, the fortress of the Order. With a company of trusted followers, she goes to break the Order. * The Magisters, warned about her coming and the fall of *Istas Hari #234;*, have a heated debate on the what to do, they ultimately find themselves forced to confront her. Relinquishing their titles to other members and sending these to *Tarangea*, where they can fight, they expect to kill behead the army of *Jinns*. *Arlan* arrives in 6037, where she first meet the owner of the land, *Fendhal*, who defeat her retinue before fleeing before her. Advancing toward the mighty fortress, she is barred by the ex-Magisters. Ten on one, Men against *Jinn*, the landscape still bears the scars of the battle. Here *Arlan* meets her end, at the hand of the Magister *Nesret* who dies with her. Thus the rule of the army defer to *Maarin*. ***Maarin : The Winged Apostle*** * *Jinn*, one of the Twelve Apostles, of great power. She followed *Arlan* and acted as her second-in-hand. * During the *Verdhath*, the war wrought by *Arlan* unto Humans, she was her chief ally, she is notably the one who supervised the crossing of the sea toward *Tarangea*. While *Arlan* boarded *North*, she attacked from the South. After *Arlan* left for *Salemoth*, *Maarin* was left commander of the *Jinns*, she carries the conquest of *Urun*. The news of *Arlan* demise sundered the army, giving humans rest and time to prepare for the final assault. * Having ultimately prevailed and united the *Djinn* against the coming onslaught, she marched North toward *Abelkatt*, strongest of the Kingdom of Men. But she is hindered in her advances by rebellions and ambushes, most importantly by *En #249;il*, who she kills nonetheless. Banned from crossing the sea, she passes through the desert and through the mountain. She is slain by *Stena #236;a* and *Verdhen* in 6042. Her death and the loss of the Battle prompts the end the *Verdhath*, in the year 6044, the last *Djinn* retreat West. But is a bitter sweet victory, *Cupros* has been permanently ravaged, and Humanity is set back by millenias. Following this war, the Order will isolate itself, and societies across the World collapses. ***Aerynn*** ***:*** **The Empress** * Member of the last generation of the Order, she escape the *Kalatihr's Massacre* alongside 6 other friends. Abandoning the fortress they set forth to the World of Men, searching for a renegade who could teach them and help them. * After developing her *Qeva* she goes with two other friends to *Fengaria*, where they are welcomed by the *Holder of the Sceptre*, who will become their greatest ally. Few years pass before two other members alert them of something strange beyond the North sea, in the lunar quadrant. Exploring the region, they discover that a new Apostle, *Nerlaen* has shown. * Returning from the lunar quadrant, they alert Men, and prepare for his future incoming. Like all her brethren, she is an estimated councilor and an extremely capable fighter. The disappearance of her friends propelled into a leading position. She led the rest of her brethren and Humanity against the legions of *Nerlaen*. There she defeated one of the generals of *Nerlaen*. After the demise of the *Devil*, she was left with two of her other friends to rebuild the Order on new basis.</TEXT>

The gist of the thesis is that the moment she the Hijab is compulsory for her, it's not your problem anymore, as she's now an Adult you aren't held accountable for her sins. It's an answer to the *"if you don't force onto her you're condemned"* claim not the *"you have the right to force it onto her"* claim. And you're here speaking of guardianship as if we're Christians. In Islam, Wilaya isn't perpetual minority, the money of your wife is hers, not yours. Wilaya refers to an authorized agent of the bride in concluding a marriage contract (Islamic Law).

    <TEXT> gt;I would generally agree with that description, but do you have evidence for the limit you've set? The Sahaba and the Tabi'in and the both didn't seem to mind revolting, if the ruler doesn't respect the principle of the Shura.  gt;Which scholars said this, in the late medieval period? Erm... I'm a bit embarrassed, the quote I read specify that late medieval jurists where all against the revolt against a dhalim ruler, but when I searched, everybody quotes only Ibn Tamiyyah, so : Ibn Taymiyyah : "The Best of the Muslims forbid revolting against a ruler or participating in the fitna." "The Way of the People of the Sunnah is to not revolt against the unjust ruler and be patient." "Sixty years with an unjust Imam is better than one night without rule". This contrast with Al Ghazali who says : *"*one must not, through obedience, condone their injustice. The devout Muslim should avoid the court and company of the unjust ruler, and should rebuke him: by words if he can safely do so, by silence if words might encourage rebellion" Basically, you don't revolt against an injust ruler, but you avoid him, which obviously is absurd. Silence is the sign of approbation. And this in turn contrast with the early Islamic thinkers, like Ibn Hajr, who gives the right to the Muslims to fight against the Jair, and Ibn Hazm who refutes the scholars who forbid the revolt against the Dhalim.  gt;So do you mean they should be state appointed? Won't that corrupt them, as you were saying earlier? The corruption happens when the Qadis are unable to judge the ruler. If the Ruler answer to no one, then your only guarantee for his good faith is his word, which isn't worth much.  gt;They're both Sahih, so if you think they contradict, you'll have to take that up with Bukhari and Muslim. A Hadith can be Sahih for one compiler and not Sahih for another, but that doesn't change the fact that these two stress two opposite idea, one says never revolt, one says revolt. But even worse, we have another Hadith in the Sahihayn which goes like this : "*Ali reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said,  #8220;****There is no obedience to anyone if it is disobedience to Allah. Verily, obedience is only in good conduct****. #8221;* *In another narration, the Prophet said,  #8220;****There is no obedience to a created being if it is disobedience to Allah Almighty****. #8221;* *Source: S #803;ah #803;i #772;h #803; al-Bukha #772;ri #772; 6830, S #803;ah #803;i #772;h #803; Muslim 1840"*  gt; The issue arises when each uneducated person has a different opinion for what makes a leader good, as well as for what makes a leader Fasiq. The thing is, in a Caliphate, nobody who can choose should be uneducated. And I don't think a universel suffrage is possible or even working, rather there should be degrees of representation, from the district, to the city, to the region, to the state, to the region etc... Until you get finally to something more digest, a Majlis composed of some 30 people. Because the only difference between the Majlis al Shura and a Parliament is that a Majlis a Shura denoted clanic/tribal affiliation whereas a parliament denotes partisan affiliation.  gt;So if people should each make their own decision regarding who to support and who to rebel against, there would be no way to unify the Ummah under a leader. And this is why I say to give the people the right to voice their discontentment. To avoid revolts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Once again I'm not doubting you, but is there evidence in which they discuss the specific reasons and limits they were willing to revolt in response to? Actually they didn't want to revolt, they wanted to seize power for themselves because they believed the others to be incompetent, so... I have the source in Arabic, do you read Arabic ? If you don't I'll try to translate.  gt;Silence was advised in times were it was the only safe option, to be fair. Justifying the error doesn't make it any more acceptable. Muslims are known to have done concessions, but that doesn't this is right.  gt; One source, for example, claims Ibn Hajar wrote: There two scholars who bears the name Ibn Hajar however, did you verify that the one you quoted is also the one I quoted. And if these scholars disagree on what they say, then why should we follow them ?  gt;They may *stress* opposite ideas because the context, but they're not necessarily contradictory or mutually exclusive. I'm not sure which context you're talking about. The first Hadith is pretty clear, and the language used is also clear. *Never* revolt. The second says, *revolt if*.  gt;Disobedience is not the same as revolting. + the Hadith you quote. Disobedience will lead to revolting. You should stop taking each matter in isolation and see the big picture instead. If a faction stops paying its taxes and criticize strongly the ruler, the ruler **will** intervene. Either he accepts to negotiate and the matter settles peacefully, or he doesn't and then there is fitna. The discontent faction won't back down, and neither will the government, so fitna and strife are inevitable. And that's why Al Ghazali say, don't even criticize. You can't give the populace the right to civilly disobey and count on human nature to avoid bloodshed.  gt; I personally still don't know where I stand on the matter My own point of view is far from settled, I recognize that the World isn't perfect, and that however hard we try, we will always have Corrupt, Unjust and Disbeliever rulers, and these flows will plague all the system, not just the head of state. I'm not categorically opposed to letting things go, but from what I searched, I believe if one is in position to overthrow a Jair, a Fassiq, a Dhalim or a Kaffir ruler, he must. Because what we don't account for is that these persons don't simply oppress their subject, they will, generations following, slowly stray us from the right path. A body cannot function correctly if its head is corrupt. Many times the Prophet compare the Ummah to a human body, can you live correctly with a damaged brain ? I think not.  gt;If someone voices their discontentment, for example, against a leader taxing non Muslims with jizya, because in their opinion it is oppressive and not ruling in accordance with the will of Allah, but the ruler, after hearing their opinion, disagrees and continues taxing the Jizya, should they revolt against him? This is a very good question, but I have yet to set my mind on the Jizya. On the one-hand, it is undoubtedly an Islamic practice, and minorities would enjoy much more rights if this system is correctly implemented. On the other hand, we have proofs that the early Caliphate made use of Jewish arab tribes and christian ones who didn't pay the Jizya, so I don't know if it is a fardh to implement, and the verse talking about Jizya is strangely explained. Moreover, I've done a ton of conceptual thinking about an Islamic Caliphate, and I've never managed to make a functionning religiously segregated system. But back to your question, someone voicing discontent against the Shar'ia is different than someone voicing discontent because the ruler steals the money of the Zakat, sells the country to foreign multi-nationals and engage in pointless wars. If you want to argue within Shari'a, you need to have sources and a thesis to defend.  #8203; The official doctrine that I found held that : The Muslims need to submit to their Amir whatever he does, revolt is Haram. **But**, if someone revolts and succeed, then now Muslims need to submit to their Amir whatever he does. So basically, the ruler is rightful until he isn't. Doesn't that sound like the kind of mental gymnastics somebody would do to avoid answering the question ? *~~(This doesn't speak about the real actor of all this, the Ummah, because the Ummah is the one picking sides, and whoever they join will have the bigger army, win the battle and become the new Amir)~~*~~.~~ Well I would propose to apply this principle in a more civil manner. If somebody feels himself to be more worthy than the actual ruler, he gather people and can start a legal procedure where the Ummah will get to chose, old Amir or new Amir ? Exactly the same procedure, without a single drop of blood spilled.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; I can read it, in sha Allah, if you don't mind sharing it. [Here is how Five Companions reacted to what they viewed as usurpation of power, not injustice, not disbelief, not tyranny nor oppression](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQMN52CnAVhZ8qH7j015GR6s0ivYONBch5-duFZptnA/edit)  gt;I thought you were naming those two scholars as scholars that support your position and that you agree with, No, I was naming scholars of the early centuries who held different views from the modern view.  gt;Disobeying an order that is against the command of Allah doesn't necessarily mean you stop paying taxes or strongly criticize the ruler, I'm not sure where you're making that jump. So, from Wikipedia, since you're the one who brought up *Civil Disobedience* : *"* ***Civil disobedience*** *is the active, professed refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws, demands, orders or commands of a government. "*. Widespread Protests, Refusing to pay taxes, refusing to obey certain laws, speaking of taboo subjects, refusing to fight in the war, all of this enters the field of Civil Disobedience. Civil Disobedience, if the ruler doesn't compromise, will lead to armed conflict. So if you say it's okay to disobey, then by implication you give the people the right to revolt. Try to see the consequences.  gt;What does it mean to...saying "if one is in position" must, aren't you saying "everyone" must? There is a crucial difference between my position and that of the scholars I mentioned. My logic is, *if you have the means to try and depose or overthrow a Jair, Fassiq, Dhalim or a Kafir ruler, you should do it, for the sake of the Ummah.* The scholars say : *Even if you have the means to depose or overthrow a Jair, Fassiq, Dhalim or a Kafir ruler, you shouldn't, but if you do and succeed, we will obey you*. My position is ideological, with the principle that the rectitude of the faith takes precedence everything else. Theirs is pragmatic, *"we follow the ruler of the moment"*. From an individual point of view, their position is better, they keep their status and wealth. As for "what does it mean to be in position of overthrowing", people don't have the same means to do so. A bathroom cleaner doesn't have the means to overthrow the ruler, a shrewd minister, politician, scholar, judge or general can. A talented and charismatic leader can attract to himself the people.My position is people have the right to revolt against the Ruler they deem injust. Their position is that you don't have the right to revolt because it can lead to strife, even if the ruler is genociding your people, suffer in silence so that the other Muslims don't participate.  gt;Okay, so let's say a portion of scholars and the populace have sources that back their position, and defend their thesis, and their mind is not changed, which, of course, happens all the time, because the Shari'a is a matter in which there can be difference of opinion, and they disagree with the leader, and therefore believe he is not ruling in accordance with the will of Allah. Should they consider him a Fasiq? Well, in Fiqh, a Fassiq is a Judge who rules with something other than what Allah brought because he want to favor somebody. A Dhalim is a Judge who rules with something other than what Allah brought because he want to disfavor somebody. Unless these people manage to prove that the Jizya is a bid'a or Haram, then they aren't in position to call him either Fassiq nor Dhalim. They can call him Jair though if the Jizya paid is unbelievably high and a tiring burden upon the Dhimmis. Don't forget that though the Shari'a tries to cover everything, it can't, and their will always be room for playing. Like Sultan Suleyman al Qanuni, with his Qanun.  gt;I think you're confusing the fact that they say they should follow the new leaders that take power by force with them saying the leader was justified in taking power by force. You see, whether or not they think he was justified doesn't matter, since they will follow him, they agree with him. As I said, silence is the sign of approbation, and it is the least degree of faith. Ironically, it's a very pragmatic and secular position. I'm with whoever wins, I don't care if he is Good, Bad, Competent, nah if he got the chair I'll follow him.And we aren't children. Stop with this comparison please. This is disrespectful to me and you.  gt;And if the old Amir refuses to hand over power without bloodshed? It seems like you're the one being idealist now. The same that will happen if Trump refuse to get out of the White House. Why did no American President ever try to stay after his mandate ended ? Like all legal subjects, this isn't</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I didn't mean civil disobedience should be used as a broad strategy to undermine the ruler, I meant that in the matters in which they are commanding you to disobey Allah, you practice civil disobedience. So if the leader commands you to bow to an idol, or take the wealth of your neighbor, or kill an innocent man, you disobey, but if they command you to pay taxes, the paying of taxes is not disobedience to Allah, so you obey. But with the taxes, he will build the idols to which he asks you to bow. Paying the taxes is implicit approval of the ruler. Maybe you don't feel it, but that's what it is. Why do you think all people who disagree with the government and want to topple it stop paying taxes. You must understand that there is no middle-ground, if you don't stand up against the Kafir *(because the ruler you're describing is a Kafir)*, you're accepting his rule as legitimate. And in an optic of changing the Amir, this is exactly the kind of strategy I would adopt. Civil disobedience to either bring him on the table of negotiation or force him to fire first.  gt;As for whether the leader will respond to your disobedience with violence, that's in their hands and not yours, and as the Messenger said, you can just endure, even if they seize you and your property or flog you. If you don't fight back, it doesn't become a revolt. So no, one is not the necessary consequence of the other. Well too bad, History has proven that humans will fight back. And this Hadith of not fighting back is incoherent with the principle of  #1575; #1604; #1571; #1605; #1585;  #1576; #1575; #1604; #1605; #1593; #1585; #1608; #1601;  #1608;  #1575; #1604; #1606; #1607; #1610;  #1593; #1606;  #1575; #1604; #1605; #1606; #1603; #1585;. I'm not gonna lie in saying that since my knowledge of the science of the Hadith and how the Imams compiled and studied them, so I hate using Hadiths, as they don't always make sense between one and another.  gt;The problem is you can have your opinion on whether they've proven the matter, and they can have their own. Would you still advise them, even if you did not feel that they have the right to rule the leader a Fassiq or Dhalim, for them to revolt, if they believe they do? I don't know, because I'm doubting the necessity of the Jizya. It isn't Haram, but I don't know if it is a Fardh. When I make up my mind, I will answer you. You've chosen the subject which I can't answer on. I don't have any clue of how to reimplement Jizya and the Dhimma in the modern World.  gt;Silence was only instructed in times when speaking is not safe. In all other cases, he says to not agree with them and to rebuke them. You might as well say that a scholar who says to eat pork when under threat of starvation is condoning and encouraging the eating of pork. There is a big difference between *"Don't revolt or speak up, it's* ***dangerous****"* and *"Don't revolt or speak up, it's* ***Haram****"*.  gt; To be honest I feel like there's a political element to the discussion Well we're discussing the right to revolt, the legitimacy of a ruler and the truthfulness of the Scholars, all of them political matters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The same argument can be used to say it's Haram to buy bread from a non Muslim. The difference being that the Non-Muslim won't use the money to build an idol and compulse you to bow to it. Money is the jugular of the state, if you're paying taxes to an unjust government, you're participating in the injustice.  gt;So the same applies in Western societies, for any Muslim that pays taxes to Kafir leaders? If not, what's the difference? Well there are scholars who advise against living in non-Muslim lands.  gt;History has also proven that most humans will disbelieve, that doesn't mean we should. You don't understand the argument. It's not a matter of what should be, it's a matter of what will be. Nobody will ever endure unjust seizing property and flogging, that's just Human nature, just like you can't ask from a Father to kill his son. People will revolt if somebody is an unjust ruler, even the Prophet fled Mecca and fought against the Pagans.  gt;The specific example is irrelevant, and in fact my whole point was that a leader and the entirety of his subjects will never be able to agree on what it means to rule in accordance with the command of Allah. The conclusion of this kind of reasoning was secularism and laicity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if I'm understanding : First there was Tevildo, but Tolkien found the idea stupid and dropped the character in favor of Thu. Then Thu evolved into Gorthu etc... Until he became Sauron. So Sauron was first conceived as a character of Beren and Luthien ? Parrallely, Tolkien was writing the first versions of what would become the Akallab #234;th, and he had a character who was a sorcerer and who ensnared the Humans ? In the 30's, Tolkien wrote the Hobbit, and he introduced the Necromancer, an excuse for having Gandalf abandon Thorin's company ? In the 50's, before writing LoTR, Tolkien revises his mythology. As he had grown dissatisfied by the concept of Valarindi, he invents the category of Maiar. Kosmoko becomes lord of the Balrogs and the Balrogs themselves are promoted from the Status of Super-Orcs to the status of angelic beings and their numbers reduced, Fionwe becomes Eonwe herald of Manwe, same for Ilmarie, Melian becomes a fay and Thu becomes Sauron ?</TEXT>

There are parent who refuse to scold a kid, and would call you an abuser if you did. You're literally making them fear you in order to control them. If you're going to say stupidities and pull lies into my mouth, keep your own shut. I said hitting, and hitting has a very specific meaning and purpose, it conveys messages that the tongue and the eye can't. I s  gt;That's not healthy in any way.

    <TEXT>My friend, you aren't lost, you just have doubts about the History of Islam. But this isn't really a thological matter, this is a mere question of who should have succeeded the Prophet, and it has been settled, so we shouldn't bother with these things. The Companion are certainly victims of excessive romanticizing and dare I say... flanderization, where they appear as this solid block of friends and brothers. The reality was darker and grimmer, companions had rivalries and disagreements between them, there is a reason why the Rashidun lasted a mere 30 years, political tensions were too high. In the end we got a disaster, the Fitnah, where the Companion of the Prophet, those who believed in him where no one else would, those who followed him through thin and thick, butchered each other for earthly gains.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;For the record, yes, any method of instilling fear in order to control someone is abusive. So we open prisons ? We disband armies ? We ban teacher from highering their voices ? We forbid managers from scolding their employees ? We don't live in the world of sunshine and rainbows, there are situations where using your power is the only peaceful solution.  gt;It relies on an unjustifiably unequal power dynamic and gives one party uncontrolled power over the other. After lies and appeal to motive, tautology ? You're giving me the entire sophistry syllabus ? Every interaction, in which one party seeks to convince or push the other to do something relies on an unequal power dynamic, be it through violence, speech, threats etc...  gt;Do you think that hitting or scolding a romantic partner would be justified in any way? The difference being that I get a choice on who my romantic partner will be. I don't get to chose whether my kid will be a little angel or a sociopath, so I adapt. Unlike you, I am not dogmatic in my principles, I value pragmaticism.  gt;Unless a punishment is non-violent and relates directly to an infraction, it's going to cause fear. So if your kid kill blind his brother ? How do you react ? I tell him *"you're doing the dishes all the month ?"*, that's not gonna work, he already make his bed and clean his chamber. In order to put some ideas in the mind of a kid, you need to use your superiority. ~~God~~ Nature made you stronger for a reason.  gt;If a child is too young to understand words and specific consequences related to what they do then they are too young to be held responsible for their actions. Appeal to motive ? Again ? Be original please. We are talking about aged kids, pre-adolescents and adolescents.  gt;People have the right to feel safe. Strawman ? Daring, aren't we ? Where did I say that I don't want people to feel safe ? You seem to think that if you hit your child one time in his whole childhood, he's gonna become eternally scared of speaking.  gt;It's harder to feel safe in an environment where you at the risk of being verbally or physically assaulted. I propose to you then that you hide yourself in your house and never go out because life in these earth is never devoid of risk of being verbally or physically assaulted.  gt;You significantly overestimate the mental health and wellbeing of the average person. The bizarre thing is that the countries with the highest rates of suicide are those who practices your view. I think you and the people who think like you highly underestimate the mental capacity of the human being, and cuddle them to much.  gt;And even if there are people who get out abusive households perfectly fine, it doesn't justify abuse when there are plenty of other ways to discipline children. The thing is, we aren't speaking about abusive households, we're speaking about households were the parents are parents and discipline their children, but you project your own definition of an abusive household into the discussion. Legally, if a hit doesn't leave a scar, it isn't physical abuse and the person can't be condemned. The law is by my side.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I can't really help you, but I think I can give an insight. In my world, Humans were entering industrial revolution when it was attacked by *Arlan*, Bringer of Misery. For more than 70 years she ravaged the world of Men with her hosts, to such a degree that by the time they manage to defeat her, most of the world is depopulated and Humanity is but a few tens of millions. Following this catastrophic event, societies collapses, famines, and instability crept in and further destabilized the world for centuries. As knowledge was lost, Humans had to start over again. The thing is I don't really concentrate on this period, but rather on when the World has recovered, only to be attacked by a colleague of *Arlan*, *Nerlaen*. The Big difference would be for your character, if he lived through the Apocalypse and the post-Apocalypse he would have many psychological problems and habits that would be alien to this post-post-apocalypse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**\[Name\]** Little is known about this ancient people. The Order's archives tells us that they were first of the Creatures on Earth, preceding Djinns, with whom they coexisted before being driven to extinction by them. A dwindling people, nonetheless dangerous creatures, who lived in the cold lands south of the World. According to reports of djinn loremaster *Abkar*, they were much more long-lived and powerful than *Djinns*, whom he says were subjected by them for a time. Yet, their slow development hindered them, they didn't reach their maturity until their third century. Later, *Naqil ibn Salim*, an erudite of *Abelkatt*, brought back from his travels numerous djinnic reports, compilations and histories about these ancient people. Nonetheless his discoveries were meager, for all Djinns copied from a unique source, now lost and they greatly embellished the history. Yet their were new informations, amongst them names, like *Ebragheluz*, a Lord of these ancient race.</TEXT>

Yes and no, it happens to me a lot to be scrolling through reddit, reading a book, listening to an audio or being out and I see, read, hear something that strike, I will generally write it down, and not pay attention to it until it grow *naturally* in my mind. When I devise my world and my stories, I try to do it organically. So I don't know exactly where did this idea or prompt came from, but I'm aware of the effect my lectures and the everyday life has on me. The there is another factor : My friend with whom I create this world. By injecting his own thoughts and opinions in this, we are sure to never be drawing for a single source, he has a more *'simple'* view of fantasy, with dragons, anime-magic etc... And it generally with my own vision, but it makes the World more interesting and compelling to work on. Though it can be hard sometimes to conciliate the two views, but hey, I'm writing, I get the final word.  gt; *in terms of writing style?* In terms of writing styles I can't escape Western influences, but I tend to avoid them. I mimick the rules of classical Arabic literatures, Poetry, rhymed Prose, pseudo-Quranic rhymed prose *(the Islamic equivalent of biblical writing, or at the very least what resembles it the most, mimicking Quranic style is just frustrating, so I settled down with a more ominous and solemn rhymed prose)*, but also in the genres, my first writing being about a traveler, I dug through the Rihla subgenres, and assimilated the style and the canons of the authors, but also the travelers. I worldbuild because of my friend, but I write mainly for my own pleasure, so I do whatever I want. sometimes I just write a debate between two characters because I've had an internal reflexion etc...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I can't tell if you're a poor soul who never got out of his house, or if the Western sphere is fully lobotomized or if you're just trolling, but I'm going to answer. People think that when two humans have sex and date together they are exclusive because of an institution called *marriage* and another thing called a couple, this institution created the family, the basic unit of a society, by which all the things you can enjoy today are possible. With the marriage, the Man stops to be worried about having children, and the Woman stops to be worried about raising their children. also, by not putting your wrinkled cock in every hole you see, you avoid STDs. The prerequisites of forming a couple *(in functionning societies)* is something called fidelity, which means that you vow yourself to this person, till you want to break the marriage *(unless you're christian)*.  gt;When did this presumption arise? This isn't a presumption, this is an anthropological reality. Calling a presumption is like calling agriculture a presumption. after all, Humans don't spontaneously think about growing crops.  gt;Human anatomy suggests that having numerous partners at once was the norm--women have concealed ovulation so no partner can tell when she's fertile, and penises are shaped to scoop out the semen of a woman's previous partner, prioritizing their own. Source please ?  gt;And when was the most recent time when this was not the case? You mean the last time when people where like wild animals having sex with everybody ? Probably before humans settled down. Sexual communism is not a viable strategy. Though polygamy has been practiced. As the Man was the bread-winner, marrying a man, even if he was already married was a good strategy to secure *your* and *your* children a good life.  gt;When some of them learned that I was not exclusive to them, they grew upset and either left or "forgave" me. It's their right, they don't want to catch diseases, and they expect a certain level of dignity.  gt;I didn't apologize because I'd done nothing wrong--at no point did I hide anything from anyone, and there'd been no conversation about exclusivity. You're lying. Your previous sentence clearly implied that you never told them, and that they *"learnt"* it, not from you. In fact, the end of your sentence reiterates the idea. In this case, YATA for not setting the conditions before the relationship started. You are the anomaly here, not them, if you want to be deviant, you must clarify that you wish to be so.  gt;I'm confused when someone I'm just screwing around with presumes that we're together. I'm confused about your mental state, you don't sound like someone emotionally and mentally stable enough to have sex.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How do I feel about imagining it or about reading it ? Unless there is a narrative reason to *mention* sexuality of non-human races, don't do it. It's just distracting, and alienporn isn't something I want to read. But I think you need to imagine how you non-human races reproduce. Reproduction is a defining part of our culture, if your baby eats the womb of his mother to get out, chances are the females of your specie aren't really into sex that much, or that lesbianism and bisexuality are more spread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;First: Owning a piece of art does make you it's owner, if you want to draw a mustache on it, that's your perrogative. People may not like it but they don't own that piece of art. Owning a piece of art doesn't make you it's owner ? What is that even supposed to mean. And don't use smart word of which you don't know the meaning. Prerogative, not perrogative.  gt;Second: A narrative story is not the same as a singular piece of art. The Lord of the Rings, like every book and story in existance, morphs and changes from telling to telling. That would have been the case if we were leaving in the paleolithic, fortunately there is a little something called paper. The Lord of the Rings have a single telling which is written in paper, and it won't change. Everything else is trying to be the lord of the rings, but it isn't the lord of the rings.  gt;Tolkien does not own the rights to our imaginations nor to how we choose to carry own the world he built for us. His work however belongs to him. I don't know why you are struggling with this simple idea, if you jerk on to angbang, ***~~you're mentally ill but that's another problem~~***, that's your view, but you don't own Morgoth and Sauron, they are Tolkien characters, what you're doing is simply applying your incomplete and whishful views on these characters. You don't own Middle-Earth, neither legally nor artistically.  gt;We can agree to disagree, but time has already proven what I'm saying to be right Time didn't prove what you said to be right. Tolkien's own views about LoTR will remain, Amazon will just be another adaptation and interpretation of said world, not the World itself, and nobody *(except some idiots)* will ever say : *"Lord of the Rings ? Ah yes, that shwo created by Amazon, great times"*.  gt;and when Amazon releases whatever they are about to release, good or bad, it will change LOTR. It won't change LoTR, it will shape perhaps a new vision of LoTR, but the text remains. When the movies got out, people didn't forget that Sauron wasn't a big flaming eye, or that Aragorn was indeed eager to be king. Unless you have the mental capacity of a beetle, you can differentiate between the Legendarium and its adaptations.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So let's see. Argon : Dies heroically in the Battle of Lammoth. Aredhel : Doesn't do anything bad, but nothing good. Maeglin : Is a bitch. Turgon : Build Gondolin, welcome Huor and Hurin, fight in the Battle of Unnumbered tears, dies heroically defending his city. Fingon : Helps the Noldor against the Teleri *(Yes, Feanor started it first, but Fingon didn't know, his intentions were pure)*. After seeing Feanor and *supposedly* Maedhros abandoning them, he still saves him. Defeat legions of Orcs in the Dagor Aglareb. Makes Glaurung run back to Angband like a little bitch. Unites the Elves, Men and Dwarves against Morgoth in the Dagor Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and is slain by Gothmog attacking him from behind. Fingolfin : Support his brothers mockery and humiliation. Forgive him and vow to follow him. Leads his people across the Helcaraxe. When he arrives, he saves the Sindar. When Maedhros comes trying to appease tensions, he gladly accept. Under his rule, the Elves of Beleriand enjoy peace and prosperity. He accepts to assimilate with the local culture. And when everything is lost, instead of drinking poison like some craven, he goes on with the chaddest way possible, a suicide-by-morgoth. He was so chadly that even when crushed and broken, he found the way to wound morgoth. Feanor : He pushed the Noldor to go to Middle-Earth, saving the Elves and Men who would be under Morgoth's boots if not for him. Maedhros : Is a dutiful son. Doesn't burn the Ships, relinquish the crown, recover from Morgoth's tortures, take his brothers east to avoid problems, protect his people from Morgoth after the fourth battle *(not like some golden-haired dude who hide in caves)*. form the Union of Maedhros, fight his oath until he can't anymore, and has the second most badass suicide in the legendarium. Maglor : Tries to convince Maedhros to drop the oath. Celegorm : Fuck him. Curufin : Fuck him too. Celebrimbor : Abandon his father when he is clearly wrong **unlike Maedhros**. Atone for the sins of his house, create super-rings that help the Elves avoid fading. Is captured by Sauron but won't snitch away *(unlike uncle Angrod and cousin Maeglin)*. Caranthir : Is super open-minded, trades with dwarves and respects them, saves Haleth from Orcs and propose her to settle in his lands. Amrod  amp; Amras : One of them die burnt, so like Aredhel. The other is friendly with silvan elves. Let's see the other side of the picture : Finarfin : Is wise enough to cower back to the Valr, but not wise enough to appease the feud between his brothers. Finrod : Objectively best character in the whole legendarium. Still take a stupid oath. Aegnor  amp; Angrod : One of them is a snitch, the other is a coward who doesn't return Andreth her love *"BuT sUcH uNiOn ArE sPeCiAl AnD rArE !"* bitch please, Imrazor and Mithrellas are laughing at you. Galadriel : Wisest of the Elves. Still goes to Middle-Earth. That's all. Ah yes, doesn't save Celebrimbor from Sauron's deceit, doesn't push Gandalf to the head of the White Council etc...</TEXT>

None however among the great Djinn calls him by this title anymore, and verily none in *Abraxia* ever referred to him as such, instead he is the *Abhorred*, who brought damnation and curse upon his people. Strongest and most talented of the Djinn to have ever walked upon this earth, his origins remain obscure, but he enters history eons ago, as leader of a small kingdom in the Northeast of their world. From their he would go on conquering and adding territories until all of the Eastern side would come under his sway, safe for the *temanes*, the southern kingdoms. His army defeated in Battle against the Middle-Empire, he saved them by raising the *Semek Jagam*, Heavens Mounts. Yet it was far from his last attempt. In the following centuries, he would go on to conquer the vast majority of the World of the Djinns. In his arrogance, madness and dellusion, he claims for himself the title of God, *Saarjagam*, and seeks to establish his dominance over the whole World. Aided by his faithful Apostles, he wrecks havoc in the natural order, to such an extent that *Ziryal*, chief of the Angels, descends on Earth to stop. Abandoned by all save one, he fight the Angel nonetheless, and lose. Chained, he's brought back by *Ziryal*, and from there none would ever hear of him again. Yet, among some skeptics and tinfoil-hat theorists, it is speculated that the *Heart of Sins* is of his doing, and that he shall at last come back to exact revenge on the World.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't necessarily agree with you. Your first raid is in 1444, and depending on where you started, you have access to more or less raiding prizes. I think Tunis is the one with the most opportunities, being near Genoa trade. But you aren't alone, Fezzan, Tlemcen, Morocco, Sus and Marrakech will all compete with you, so you lose a lot of *potential income*. Then you'll start conquering, managing wars, rebellions and vassals if you're Morocco, you don't have the time to check if the raiding is available, and if you do, maybe you have other things to do, like a naval battle. Too bas, the other Berber countries won't let you do it. Once you unify Maghreb, you can raid whenever ten years pass, but you would much more richer if you just conquered these areas.</TEXT>

Within 20 years you're also invested in much more interesting things, like wars with the Iberians, the Sudanese or the Africans or even colonization. Raiding is a subgameplay for these nations when it should be a "path" to chose in its own right. Building your state around raiding should be a possibility. And remember that not all countries engaged in raiding. Morocco, the Kingdom, didn't raid, it had lost its naval power by the 14th century, it relied instead on independent corsairs in Rabat or Tetouan, who would pay the fifth of the booty to the Ruler. Your paragraph is very convincing, raiding has the possibility of becoming a viable strategy, but it won't a fun one. I expect raider-states like Tunis to base their whole strategy on this, a kind of mirror-Venice. Where they would conquer rich trade nodes to be able to exert power and raid.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;So your argument more or less boils down to "I don't like raiding and don't use it, so no one else does either". No, that's what your atrophied brain understood. My argument is that raiding isn't a fun mechanic. Assimilation mechanic isn't the same, you get a warning for when you can enact one, and it's permanent, you don't need to renew every year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't see how the first Hadith and third shows virtue and honor. Daughters aren't a protection from hell-fire, well-raised daughters are. And that's not showing the virtue of daughters, but of parents. And it's not Mother's virtue which is praised, but the child's. If anything, this would be an argument used by Islamophobes *"look at these muzz ! they dehumanize women"*. As for the second Hadith, it applies for Man and Woman. A husband also help his wife complete half of her religion. The person who made this should have done their research right.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not going to teach you the Subject-Object difference. The Mother is the object here, not the subject. She doesn't do anything worthy of praise, it's the obedient child who is praised, not the Mother. If the Hadith put emphasis on a mother's hardships and merits *(and there is such Hadith)*, then yes we could say Islam put the emphasis on the Mother as a human being.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now, my argument was always related to how fun it is. That was my point from the beginning. As evidenced by my other conversations with other redditors. And what would be the other argument be anyway ? A mechanic in a *game* is related to how much it is fun, and how well it relates with the other mechanics. Raiding is completely independent from the other aspects of the Gameplay, from the point of view of the player who does the raiding, it's a boring mechanic where you just bring your ships from tile to tile collecting money, and from the opposite point of view it's a nuisance, and a bad nuisance at that. Why should France completely besiege Tunis to cripple their navies ? It goes on with the fact that **every** war in EU4 devolves into a total war.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Are you being voluntary stupid ?  gt;Her being the mother is praiseworthy. That's not what the Hadith is about. The Hadith is using the mother as a way to showing how much virtuous obedient child are. It's not the Mother's hardships that are praised. Language composition exist, and it exist for a reason. If he wanted to how much the mother does for her son and why she is praiseworthy, there are more pertinent Hadith. ** #1581; #1614; #1583; #1617; #1614; #1579; #1614; #1606; #1614; #1575;  #1593; #1614;

Good to see that you guys are still good at sophistry.  gt; Also, subject / object here is irrelevant. Okay, if you aren't going to give the Science of Exegis and the interpretation of Hadiths the intellectual investments it requires, keep your tongue behind your teeth.  gt;Even if you were to push that strawman argument then it can easily be beaten by many verses where Allah praises the ones who #8217;re striving for his cause no matter of gender. Are you selectively blind ? The Strawman was used purposefully, it doesn't represent my own views.  gt;So, by that criteria, would you be settled then? I'm already settled, there are Hadith which praise Mothers better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;If you #8217;re presenting their view then you had your reasons for that, you didn #8217;t just put there dehumanisation for no absolute reason. I asked for an explanation. You don't need to ask for an explanation when the whole argument isn't *"Islam dehumanize women"*, but *"these Hadiths are off topic"*, unless of couse you aren't here to bring useful comment but just lies.  gt;The guy Which guy ? Are you talking about yourself in the third person ? Get down off your white horse and go back to school.  gt;explained to you without object / subject as it was not irrelevant, you then proceeded to push that object / subject as if it was relevant and you then proceeded to explain your point through it. So I don #8217;t see how it #8217;s not your own views. You #8217;re all over the place. Yeah, and I told you that if you aren't going to respect the exegesis, keep silent. The difference subject/object is always relevant. I ate an apple is not the same phrase as An apple ate me. More so in Arabic where you can freely play with the VSO SVO forms.  gt;Still, it doesn #8217;t make the Hadith OC posted regarding Paradise being beneath mother #8217;s feet wrong in terms of high status of women in Islam. But that's not the point. The point was that this Hadith doesn't stress the Mother virtue, but the Child. And that there are better hadith to show the virtue of the Mother, and the Woman in general.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Adibists have a special condition that makes all their offspring still-born. Most of the djinn are premature, that's due to the fact that baby djinns develop teeth while still inside the mother and will start munching their way out if she doesn't give birth rapidly. The reason why human and djinn lands are sundered is because of an attack by an alien specie which struck earth eons ago, provoking a continental shift.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you, playing the Umayyads is way too easy, but I disagree about the opposite. The Reconquista wasn't a linear systematic advancement, their were back and forth, treason from both sides, there should be harsher penalties for the Umayyads, it shouldn't be clear cut. By 1100, half of Spain was still Muslim. And it wouldn't be until Las Navas de Tolosa that the Muslim spine would be broken, but even then it wasn't set in stone. The game starts 20 years before Toledo was taken. Or you can start it 9th Century, at the height of the Umayyads.</TEXT>

Against what the popular opinion here says, I think that Denethor and Faramir had a precise, although probably flawed and incomplete idea of who the Istari were and what was their purpose. Aragorn probably also suspected something, and had a clearer understanding. As a Numenorean himself, he probably excluded the idea of Gandalf being a Man. As someone brought up with elves, he also would have known that he was no elf. I won't say that he thought of him as a Maiar, but perhaps an anomaly.</TEXT>

The Men of Dale didn't seem phased by the presence of Silvan Elves. The last time Dunedain would have had dealings with the Elves would be during the fall of Arthedain, it's said that the guy who was sent to ask the Eotheod for help knew that the mist was the deed of Galadriel, and that Galadriel was their ally.  gt;I'm sure his father saw deeper, but his view would have been tainted by his paranoia. Could he have assimilated the Istari with Sauron ? Maybe with Sauron's help, to instill conflict between Denethor and Gandalf.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I doubt you're an anthro major, since an anthro major would know that I'm saying marriage is a social condition not a biological, but more so, an anthro major would never say that marriage is a religious institution, because we have no proof.  gt;There exist and have existed societies in which people shared many partners, Mainly polygyny.  gt;and in which child bearing was seen not as the result of 2 people comitting to one another, but rather as a consequence of many people sleeping with one another. Well you can leave with these societies. I mean these societies model must be so much better than the society which paid for you to be an anthro major and use Internet. More seriously, you're right, in societies where the family, the right of children and the marriage are defunct institutions, all kind of sexual fantasies should be authorized.  gt;Also, I am not lying. But there's no way for me to prove you wrong so that's it. Please  gt;I didn't apologize because I'd done nothing wrong--**at no point did I hide anything from anyone**, and **there'd been no conversation about exclusivity.** I assume that you live in the West, a society where monogamy is the norm. Your sexual deviance is the anomaly, not the norm. You're entitled to tell them that you're infidel, the same way in the Islamic world, the wife is entitled to specify in her marriage contract that she doesn't want the husband taking another wife, because in these society polygyny is accepted. Thus hiding the fact that you're polyamorous was your fault, and claiming that you didn't hide it, when you say the opposite in the next phrase is a lie.</TEXT>

Actually, you could make a strong case for the Prophet being a gerontophile, since he married many widows and previously married women. I think Aisha is the only wife which was his first wife.

For much of their History they were an unnoticable group, a dwarf living among the giants that were the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Persians, the greek, the Romans etc... Islam elevated Arabic and Arabs, but Arabic isn't a special language. If Allah wished so, the Quran would have been composed in latin, persian, english, hindi, chinese, french or even esperanto.

    <TEXT>Nice lie. Kuffar is a **nuanced** term not a polysemic one. The Kaffir is someone who denies Allah existence while having the message. In our day and age, the Message is Islam, if you don't believe in Islam, you're by definition a Kaffir. Allah calls the Jews and the Christians Kuffars, he calls the Qurayshite polytheists Kuffars, he calls the ancient people to whome Prophet were sent Kuffars.  gt;A kaafir is someone who is aware of God (believes) but willingly rejects God. That's Murtad, and Apostate, not a Kaffir, a disbeliever. I reccomend to you to open the Lisan al 'Arab, or the Tafaseer if you cant to know who the Kuffar are. So low we have fallen, that we now seek to disguise our teachings to appeal to our ennemies. I've got news for you, Hindus, Christians, Atheists etc... will oppose your religion whatever you do, and they won't accept you until you become like them. And the article you posted, while academically sound, is intellectually dishonest. A word meaning is defined not by its root but by the meaning ascribed to it by the People and the Text. For example Khamr, alcohol comes from the root Kh-m-r which means hide/conceal, yet Khamr means wine. Instead on relying on dishonest academics, please go educate yourself through actual sources.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Tawassul is when you ask Allah to convey your message to a beloved of God like the Prophet (saw) who then prays to Allah to grant you your Dua. You got it backward, tawassul is when you ask the Prophet *(or some companion or "good man")* to intercede between you and Allah. And that's stepping into shirk territory, as Allah is the Sami'e, he can hear your Du'a on his own. The dead cannot intercede in favor of the living. I have to agree on the Salafis on this one, the tawassul is a dubious practice, and more often than not, it has given rise to grave worship. In the Maghreb, this practice, inherited also from the Berber pagan practices, has led to Sufi shrines spreading across the region.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;he was still a monotheist, you literally said he was like prophet Abraham... He was a monotheist, but he wasn't yet a Muslim, he didn't pray lke us, fast like us, pay zakat he didn't have the Quran. He was a Muslim in the sense that he naturally felt inclined to submit to Allah, but he wasn't a Muslim as in someone who practices the religion of Islam.  gt;which was, technically, a muslim, considering there is no religion but Islam, and there hasn't been any religion but Islam, and that was the religion of all the prophet's before rasulullah saas, There is no true religion but Islam. Hinduism, Paganism, Jainism, Pastafirsm are all religions, even the Quran recognize these religions. And no, stop guys with this "Islam has always been here etc..." Submitting to Allah and his will has always been the way of the Prophets, Islam is something distinct. You're just playing with words, lying and confusing people. Words have a meaning, learn their meaning and use them well.  gt;which means he followed it, and it wouldn't make sense for him not to follow Islam after that, him not declaring his Islam could've been just an act of taqiyya you know that right? Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah  #65018; said to his uncle at the time of his death,  #8216;say there is none worthy of worship but Allah and I will bear testimony for you on the Day of Reckoning #8217;.

    <TEXT>Finwe is specifically forbidden from returning until either Indis or Miriel die again. Feanor is still philosophizing there until Melkor get bored of the Void. As for Fingolfin : "*your houseless spirits shall come then to Mandos. There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies"*. He was most probably there for a long time. Less than Feanor or Maedhros, but long enough. Also don't forget that there are spirits among the Exiles who will simply refuse to get reincarnated, my headcanon is that Thingol stayed with his bro Finwe, as he lost his daughter and his wife can come visit him because she is a Maia, they tag along, and sometimes they prank Feanor. So in conclusion, Eol got beaten to a sad pulp for defiling the Daughter of They-who-bitchslapped-the-mightiest-dweller-in-ea. Only Finrod the Loved was allowed to get reincarnated fastly, ~~because everybody pleaded for him.~~</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree, I think the popular dating is the right one, the Golden of Islam was from the rise of the Abbasids to the destruction of Baghdad. Also, Islam never expanded as much as it has under the Rashidun and the Umayyads.  gt;but if we are talking about number of people converting, I don't necessarily agree with you, by the time of the OE, there were no more new big additions of Muslim lands, the Balkans didn't convert as far as I know, neither did the Russian territories and India. The highdays of conversions were in the 7th century, and in the 11th to 13th century, when the first Muslim turkic dynasties appeared.  gt;decline I personally wouldn't call it decline, but we can't deny that there was a recession. The absolute worst period in my opinion *(excluding today when we are living doormats for everybody)*, I would say the 13th and 14th centuries were bad time to live. Reconquista, Mongols, Crusades, Black Death, Tamerlane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's a very interesting interpretation, I can totally see Celegorm doing this. Add to it that Luthien, with her Dark hari and prettiest face, seemed like a valid replacement. The Sons of Feanor are generally the least friendly towards Doriathrim, so it wouldn't be a stretch. On the other hand, Celegorm and Curufin also had ulterior political motives, were they in this kind of racial superiority ? I dunno.</TEXT>

Well one could also argue that it was just because she was Luthien, and Luthien is particularly good-looking.  gt;They are the first to insult wether Vanyar and Teleri for being too close to Valar and not doing much else or for Falmari being stuck in the coast solely for singing and kissing Ulmo/Osse boot while living in the tents I don't have remembrance of this in the Silmarillion. Feanor wasn't particularly spitful towards the Falmari. And his dislike of the Vanyar was more due to how he viewed Indis, a usurper of his mother's role.</TEXT>

I mean, I don't expect a brilliant theological reasoning from an atheist, but here we are talking about lexicography, if you are unable to understand words, do us all a favor and don't speak.  gt;"We're peaceful"..."apostates must die" Yes, peaceful, not pacifist. We don't like war, but we crucify transgressors, cut the hand of thieves, whip the adulterers and execute the criminals, sorry if we have a sense of justice. Obviously it's much more better to have convicted pedophiles running around. And the apostates must die is one of many opinions, there are people who believe the opposite, there are Islamic countries which don't kill the apostates, but they are which jail them or have them paying a fine. Each country has the right to administrate itself the way it sees fit, if you don't like it, don't come.  gt;"We don't discriminate or make excuses for discrimination, and you shouldn't discriminate against us!"..."we can have your women, but you can't have ours!" Actually, it is strongly advised to not marry a disbeliever, and you can only marry Christian or Jewish women, considering that the vast majority of the West is composed of non-religious people, the pool of available Christian and Jewish women who are willing to marry outside of their religious community is severely shrunken down. And nobody ever said we don't discriminate. We are all equals between ourselves, but I certainly don't consider you and a Muslim the same way.  gt;"We want human rights"..."homosexuality should be illegal" We want Islamic law, not Human right. And under the Islamic law, sodomy is illegal so by transitivity homosexuality is also illegal.  gt;Any criticism...."but christianity. We don't like to admit it but we hide behind christians and get our morality from them. If they can do x, so can we!" That's the most ludicrous straw-man I've ever seen. Muslim never hid behind Christians. If anything, last year it was to us to whom Christians turned when they wanted allies. Shall I remind which community is feared ? Aren't we the big baddies who *terrorize* you ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;By 1258 the Iranian plateau was most probably majority Muslim, but Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Spain were still majority non-Muslim. Syria Iraq and Egypt were definitely Muslims by 1258, Iraq and Syria were thoroughly arabized by the Umayyads, and subsequently Islamized by the Abbassids. By the time the Abbassids lost their power, Muslims were present in sufficient numbers to see local Muslim dynasties rise. The Maghreb was cleansed of all non Maliki presence by the 12th century. We don't talk about Spain, we talk about Iberia and Al Andalus. Spain didn't exist at the time. In Iberia, there were three religious groups, Muslims, Christians and Jews, and Muslims were the majority in many areas in Al Andalus Proper *(everything south of Toledo)*, but they also had been the majority in cities like Valencia.  gt;Doesn't matter though, because there are FAR more Muslims in the global "South", and across Central Asia. What's the Global South ? Last time I checked, Arabs and Persians would make up a third of the Global Muslim population. And that's not an argument. Conversions in India started as early as the 7th century, in Afghanistan by the 12th century Islam was everywhere, the Turks started converting in the 10th Century. And this is quite a stupid argument. The Ottomans didn't introduce Islam to these regions, they conquered areas that had been under Muslim control for century, they don't have a claim in the Islamization of these regions. What were the regions that the Ottomans and the Mughals conquered which became and stayed Muslim ? Few. The Middle East, Pakistan and Northern India were already Islamizing centuries before the Gunpowder Empires made their appearance. And las time I looked, the Balkans and Deccan are still predominantly non-muslims.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do we have strong evidences of their being sex scenes and nude scenes ? Because until now all I see is r/lotrmemes karmawhoring and people speaking about this. But even then, I don't understand the argument of the writer. Tolkien was inspired William Morris, why not, but how does this give us anything about Tolkien's own relation to nudity. Tolkien drew inspiration from a lot of sources without always having to follow their own sensibilities and morals. And the examples given don't convince *(not that* *I am opposed to whatever they will do with "mature" scenes)*. Different mediums have different impacts. We don't burn people alive to show how atrocious the pyre is. Saying *"And Morgoth crushed Fingolfin under his boot"* has a vastly different effect than actually showing Fingolfin getting crushed to death. The same way speaking of the tortures of Celebrimbor is not the same as showing his mutilated body. If Tolkien wanted us to feel the horror, he would have neatly described the torture process and the end result. I'm not one to justify decisions by appealing to the author non-existent opinion in the subject, but these arguments aren't very convincing.</TEXT>

Gods started as simply incarnations of elements which were anthropomorphized over time with successive generations of people, shamans and priests.

And Yahweh *(according to modern history, not the Torah and certainly not what I believe)* started as **a** God of the Israelites which gained importance and became the Chief God of the Jews.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the mannish origin isn't anymore satisfying, though it's probably more convincing. At least for me. We know that Men were ready to fight for their Dark Lords, and that they were better fighter than orcs *(in LotR, a great Orc is man-high, and in CoH, Hurin slays 70 Orcs)*, with more discipline and cohesion. During the Battle of Morannon, when Sauron is defeated, note. that no Orc stand his grounds, but there are man who resist. Add to it that Orcs only make up a good cannon-fooder, but they have no cavalry. So that begs the question : *Why have Orcs at all ?* Why not just take men under your command. They are taller, stronger, more determinate, more faithful etc... Men as Orcs are a possibility, but they are a stupid choice from a strategical point of view. Now I don't think the Elven origin is any better, because Orcs are way too weak to be descended from elves. Unless I'm missing something. Finally the pre sun awakening make the Valar sound like absolute douches, Men shouldn't be confident of them at all. Because if we take the timeline, the Awakening of Men and the creation of orcs happens between that of the Elves and the Great March. So Valar ought to have known about Men, and they still did nothing for them. At the very least, in the published Silmarillion, one can say that the Calaquendi were there to educate and elevate them. But here, if the Edain migrates, who they will find ? If they are lucky, they will find Laiquendi with whom they can war on even terms, if they are less lucky they find Thingol who tells them to fuck back to the East, and if we are realistic, they meet with fucking Sauron and Angband !</TEXT>

Finarfin was a coward, if he was wise, he would have continued with his brother to council him. Instead he returned and humiliated himself.  gt;Finarfin became a great King. He became the King of cowards.  gt;The Noldor in exile became foolish kings under pain and torment. Who brought beauty unknown and deeds still sung about to this day. Who now sings about Finarfin ?  gt;They were the reason why the Valar didn't help Middle-earth earlier. That's false, in notes on motives in the Silmarillion, it is said that the Valar didn't intervene because they feared a War that would destroy Middle-Earth. In other terms, if Feanor didn't rouse the Noldor and Fingolfin followed him, Morgoth would have conquered Beleriand and the Valar would destroy Middle-Earth to undo his work.  gt;Finarfin kicked Ainur asses in War of Wrath as both the leader and warrior. With the help of Ainur such as Eonwe. Feanor also battled against the Balrogs. And shall I remind what Fingolfin did ? He rode on and challenged Morgoth to a single duel. *"Vala he is, they saith. None of the Valar I can overcome in Ea, yet I shall fight them nonetheless."* Conclusion : Finrod  gt; Finarfin.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Who said he didn't went to the Teleri ? What I say is that there are no proof of him being born in alqualonde, and Women living in their husband house is more common than men living in their wive's. Thus, it is much more likely that Finrod grew in Tirion, with his beloved cousin Turgon, and they grew to be friend. The only ones who are specifically said to have traveled a lot were Feanor and his son. So if anything, you have much more chances for Curufin to have grown in Alqualonde than Finrod.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Absolutely not. None of these are commandment for which the character are punished. Melkor isn't sentenced to Hell after making discord, Eru just remind him that he can't overcome him. Same with Turgon, Ulmo doesn't drown him when he refuses to leave Gondolin, it's just an advice. Even when Numenor transgress the ban of the valar, the valar don't actually do anything and ask Eru to intervene. Feanor is mainly punished for making an unfulfillable oath and his crimes, not some sacred commandment. There are no laws, nor commandments in the Silmarillion, it is much more nearer to the Hesiodic Theogonia than it is to the Bible. And that doesn't actually answer my question. Did Tolkien refer to the Silm as his own Bible ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Note that this is actually a different issue from arguing that Tolkien didn #8217;t write sex\*, therefore the series shouldn #8217;t have sex. But this point is also bad. People don't want to hear about the economics of the halieutic sector in Pelargir because it's not the point of the story. Sex is the thing that shines the most because it is the easiest aspect you can introduce. You have a romance ? You can do a sex scene. Is it really needed though ? I don't know, it depends on the adaptation and the public. I'm not the public target for this because the romance aspect of the legendarium was never my favorite, but there are people who are here to see Celeborn and Galadriel, Elrond and Celebrian, Aldarion and Erendis etc... And they have the right to expect romance stuff. The whole debate is stupid, because this isn't Tolkien, this is an adaptation of Tolkien. If Tolkien wanted his spirit to be respected he wouldn't have sold the rights in the first place. But the argument on both are flawed. Sex can be a part of Tolkien in an adaptation without being a literal blasphemy, but sex isn't required to make a good Tolkien adaptation. What I personally see here is a fight between the libertine and the conservative brought in high-fantasy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I'm talking about conversion. Then you're basing your entire argumentation on a baseless claim, there are no conversion register counting the conversions of people to Islam from the 6th to the 21st century. Add to it that there would be many methods of determining which period has the most conversions. In absolute numbers though, the Majority of the Islamic World was Muslim by the fall of Baghdad, with the addition of Al Andalus, Southern Russia, Central Asia and China. Add to it that the Islamization of these regions was a process started way before the appearance of the Ottomans. As I said, the Ottomans didn't islamize new territories. And there are no records of an explosion of conversions after the fall of Baghdad. There was a religious purge of everything non-maliki in the Maghreb by the almoravids and the almohads, but that was in the 12th century, so in the middle of the Golden Age. Your only argument is absolute numbers, which is a flawed argument, since by absolute numbers the 21st century of the Islamic World is the Best. The Golden Age of Islam and the Islamic civilization is a nebulous notion that is nonetheless tied to the Abbassid dynasty.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know that Academics don't use the word Golden Age, that's why I said classical age, *you* were the one who spoke about the Golden Age, so don't try and flip the argument against me. If Academics don't use the Golden Age anymore, it's because Academics nowadays work from cultural relativism perspective, for them everything is the same, there is no Golden Age, there is no Dark Age, there is no nothing. But the facts speak. The 4 schools of Jurisprudence all appeared in the Classical Age, the vast majority of the intellectual production of the Islamic World comes from said Classical Age, the Military height of the Islamic world was the Umayyads and the Rashidun, the biggest wave of expansion was in the Classical Age, with all of the Machreq and the Maghreb + Persia, Sindh/India and Iberia falling in Muslim hands. The biggest recorded waves of conversions were those of the Berbers and the Turks in the 10th century. While many historian nowadays tend to be suspicious of the term Golden Age, no one denies that the high-days of the Islamic Civilization were in said Golden Age. Your argument also doesn't make sense from a theological point of view, as it is assumed that the best generation of Muslims was that of the Prophet, so even from the point of view of Islam, this is a wrong measure. And again, unless you have proofs of an explosion of conversions, like what happened in Arabia, the Maghreb and Central Asia, then your argument boils down to absolute numbers, which is a flawed metric as by it, the Modern Islamic world is the true Golden Age.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;You said golden age in the post just before this one, being "tied to Abbasid Empire". Not sure what you're on about. Because that's the term you used. This was my first comment *"Am I the only one who is fascinated by the early-modern Islamic World more so than with the Classical Islamic World ?"*. And this was your first comment *"The Golden Age of Islam is the early-modern world. Islam expanded more AFTER the thirteenth century, than before."*. Thus I retook your own terminology. Again, don't try and flip this. You are the one who used a layman term, I just followed you. I myself spoke about a Classical Islamic World.  gt;And yes, plenty of academics do. I know about Academics who are trying to rehabilitate the Gunpowder ages, with the rejection of the Ottoman decline Paradigm. I never heard of an academic who claimed that the real "Golden Age" of the Islamic civilization was the Gunpowder age.  gt;Again Religion =/= Empire. You don't read what I write. But I'm going to break it down. The gist of your own argument is that "supposedly" more people converted during the Gunpowder Age than during the Classical age. A baseless claim because the first census in the Ottoman Empire was in the 19th century, so any claim about conversions would be at best a guess, at worst a lie. What is known however and cited by many sources is that in the 10th century there was a massive conversion movement by the Turkic and Berber tribes and much religious turmoil associated with the Shu'ubiyya movement. So if there was an explosion, it's during the 10th century. Add to it that as I said from the beginning, the Islamization was a slow process. Your argument, devoid of any proof of "islam boom", boils down to "the Gunpowder age had more people".</TEXT>

A long time ago, Galadriel's Uncle did a lot of bad things, among them insulting the Valar *(Angels who rules the Word)*, killing other elves etc... For that, he and all that followed him, who made up a race of elves called Noldor, were exiled from the land of the Valar. This Ban lasted until the end of the first Age, then it was lifted on those who wanted to return and beg pardon. Galadriel at that time was still young and stubborn, so the Ban still laid on her. By defeating the temptation of the Ring, she redeemed herself and was allowed to return to the West.</TEXT>

Child abandonment is never justified, whatever you guys choose to disguise it.

I'm going to step first and say they were panicked, young or whatever *(they're still garbage)*.

    <TEXT>You are stuck in this impossibly dumb view that the parents wanted a child, gave birth, and then just went "nah". That's your straw-mannish view of my point, which is that they are garbage parents who abandoned their child.  gt;I mean Jesus fucking wept, you really think it's better if adoption is banned and kids are forced to grow up in poverty, in unsafe conditions? So you ran out of argument and started lying ? Nowhere did I say I am against adoption. The people who took care of him are worthy of respect, not like the cowards who abandoned him.  gt;And check the BBC article about him - he says that it all must have been the most difficult descision of their lives. And refusing to see him again was also the most difficult decision of their lives I guess ? Fuck off please, if you don't have a sense of dignity, why bother speaking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Unlike Finrod, Galadriel didn't lose in Songs of Power against Sauron. Well Sauron was weaker that time but still it was remarkable. Finrod lost because he was too kind. Galadriel would have probably not given a shit about those who died. Also, she beat Sauron while he was in incorporeal form, but when he regained his body, it's made clear that he was orders of magnitude superior to her.  gt;Melkor had mastery over Fingolfin, and Sauron over Finrod as well. Exatly you idiot. I'm talking about the third theme. During the first theme, Melkor started the discord and Eru thought it was funny but stopped it. Then during the second theme, Melkor's discord was more powerful than that of all the Good Ainur combined, even if Manw #235; tried to rally them to him. Then in the third theme, Eru himself stood up and did a battle song against Melkor, and Melkor fucking held his own ! Whether you like him or hate him, you can't deny that Melkor had some huge balls.  gt;At least Fingolfin and Nienna 'wounded' Melkor.

    <TEXT> gt; And that was the version where Galadriel was 'sinful'. Going by the version where Galadriel was 'unstained' she could kick Sauron's ass much easier in Ride of Eorl. I suspect she could even singlehandedly overcome Sauron during the time of the Hobbit, like exactly what she did in the Hobbit movies, (but with actual songs, not just badass commanding words). Going by the latest version of her; only the fully powered WotR Sauron could hardly overcome her in a battle of magic or Songs of Power. By Tolkien words himself, the only being who had a chance against Sauron was Gandalf the White. You can be as wise as you wish, against Mr.IGotBeatenByAGirlAndHerDogAndThenProceededToBecomeArPharazon'sBitch there is no Galadriel. Sauron was way more powerful than Galadriel by the time of the WoR. And remember that during the Ride of Eorl, she merely contain his powers she can't actually overthrow him.  gt;She wounded his discord (or better say the goals of his discord) by singing sorrow and pity into existence of the world. Just look at the history and see how many of times sorrow and pity that were in good ways (like how Nienna sang it) saved the world. I'm pretty sure Nienna was a spirit of sorrow and grief even before Melkor.  gt;He actually did. And still lost. Melkor had the mastsery, and if not for Eru's third theme he would have won, as he should rightfully have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;To me it seems like being pure really helps in such a duel. Are you insinuating that Finrod Felagund wasn't pure ? The guy who was so kind that he is the only named Finwian to be known to have reincarnated Anyway, I disagree with you as the published texts and Tolkien say clearly that WoR Sauron  gt; Galadriel. And by the tale of the Eorlingas we can suppose that by that time he and Galadriel were roughly equal, remember : She doesn't banish him, she merely stops his power from creeping. Also, the banishing in the book was done by Saruman's devices, and the fall of Dol Guldur happened after that of Sauron. Finally, if we're taking the echo theory, Galadriel is the Melian and Sauron the Morgoth of the Third Age, Morgoth  gt; Melian. By the time of the WoR Sauron was but a shadow of what Mairon, Gorthaur and Tar Mairon had been. And this shadow was able to scare the shit out of everybody, Galadriel included.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Idril survived the Doom of Mandos That's not sure. And I mean a lot of Noldor survived the Doom and returned to Aman to the War of Wrath, does that make Mandos doom null and void ? Absolutely not.  gt;"Tears unnumbered ye shall shed; and the Valar will fence Valinor against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over the mountains. " You're being purposefully dishonnest. The Noldor were no more under the Wrath of the Valar, the proof is that the Valar sent the Istari and Glorfindel to help with Sauron. So no, her lamentation didn't pass. The only one whose lamentation pass that I can think of is Fingon the Valliant.  gt;"slain ye shall be: by weapon and by torment and by grief;" So was Maglor and probably Irim #235;, but also many of the Noldor who survived through the entire first age and returned into Aman. Again, the Doom was heavily lifted upon the Capture of Morgoth.  gt;Still Galadriel comforted herself with many things. Just like me. I have a deep underlying depression, but I ease it. First, eat chocolate. Second, Galadriel grew weary nonetheless, and desired to return tp Aman.  #8203; In conclusion, your argument is pointless, because if Galadriel defeated the doom, so did countless of Noldor who returned to Aman, and thus the doom is no doom at all. Galadriel still shed Unnumbered tears for the horrors she lived and while during the first age, none of her complaints were heard. Finally, why did Galadriel fall under the doom in the first place, she didn't kill anybody.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;THEY WERE NOT LEADERS IN FLIGHT OF THE NOLDOR. DUMB. The Doom of Mandos says all of thos who followed them.  gt;"The Exiles were allowed to return - save for a few chief actors in the rebellion , of whom at the time of The Lord of the Rings only Galadriel remained. At the time of her Lament in L #243;rien she believed this to be perennial, as long as the Earth endured. Hence she concludes her lament with a wish or prayer that Frodo may as a special grace be granted a purgatorial (but not penal) sojourn in Eress #235;a, the solitary isle in sight of Aman, though for her the way is closed. Her prayer was granted - but also her personal ban was lifted, in reward for her services against Sauron, and above all for her rejection of the temptation to take the Ring when offered to her. So at the end we see her taking ship." Yep dummy, Galadriel doesn't defeat the Doom, the Valar lift their ban over her. Galadriel still complain and when she fall into despair, she wish for Frodo to go in her stead. Due to her bravery, the Valar say : *"Okay, you can come back"*. The Doom was never binding. Finarfin also escaped the Doom, because he redeemed himself immediately. So did Finrod.  gt;She killed the Noldor in many versions, latest versions. The versions when she flees alone with Teleporno ?  gt;FA and SA Galadriel didn't give a single fuck if the Valar hear her or not. Well so did all other Noldor then, I haven't heard of any of them complaining, does that mean all of them defeated the Doom ?  gt;Galadriel singlehandedly actually defeated the Doom of Mandos. "The Exiles were allowed to return - save for a few chief actors in the rebellion, of whom at the time of The Lord of the Rings only Galadriel remained." She survived it for 7000 years and eventually defeated it. Wait a minute. her being a leader of the Noldor doesn't reconcile with her going alone with Teleporno. Stick with one narrative, else we aren't getting out. There are 10 different Galadriels. Also, what happened to Maglor ? He got killed ? If not then he is still there. And Idril wasn't a leader of the Noldor she a kid. A Kid. Like Celebrimbor. Also, it's very funny how the two characters who "defeat" the Doom, Galadriel and Finarfin, do so by not playing. If the only way to defeat the Doom, is to not do anything, then I don't call this a victory.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Sauron didn't even know who the fuck was that Elf. But Sauron well perceived all the fucking works Aragorn had done against him, when it was too late. Still he didn't shit his pants, but it was a nice fear for him! Sauron actually feared Galadriel worse. And yet that Elf came close of beating him, if only he wasn't overcome by grief, remember, it was a lenghty duel, and if not for Mando's cruel judgement, he would have won. Finrod died for the sins of the Elves and the Men.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Wow I forgot when Gandalf the White drew back the shadows of Sauron upon Minas Tirith! Wow where is that from?! I don't remember! That's a strawman. Gandalf the White said himself that he was the most dangerous being beside Sauron, and Tolkien reiterate that he would have been the only one to be able to master truly the Ring. Galadriel could use it, but she would be ultimately its slave.  gt; If Galadriel was there she could easily clear the sky off Sauron's magic shadows. That's a baseless statement, Galadriel couldn't destroy Dol Guldur while Sauron stood. As I told you, Galadriel was concealing Sauron creepiness without hope of overcoming him, against WoR Sauron, Galadriel would have been blasted away. Tolkien himself say that if it came to personnal confrontation, Sauron would prevail. If Galadriel so powerful, Sauron would have sent the Witch-King against her, not Khamul. By the TA, the Elves were a dwindling race, and Galadriel was, for Sauron, a secondary threat.  gt;The same for FA Sauron vs TA Sauron. Dude, read Morgoth Ring, TA Sauron  lt; FA Sauron. TA Sauron was to FA Sauron what Morgoth was to Melkor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;There is no reference to any Nazg #251;l returning to Dol Guldur thereafter however, nor joining its attacks. Many on the web seems to presume that some wraiths did go to Dol Guldur again, but these persons fail to provide anything JRR wrote to prove it (as I know of no such source I would be interested if they did provide any source or quote, but not found anyone sharing it yet). That's even better, Galadriel was of such non-concern for Sauron that he didn't even bother to send a Nazgul to direct the attack against her. Contrast that with Minas Tirith.  gt;"[Sauron] perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle" So I have a question. What do we do when Tolkien contradict himself ? Because I can accept that Galadriel was greatest of the Elves back in Valinor when she had no role or importance to the story whatsoever, I have no problem believing she was the mightiest of the remaining Eldar after Gil-Galad's fall. But here, Tolkien is contradicting the given of the Books. If Galadriel was to be his chief adversary, why send his biggest against Minas Tirith ? If She was to be his chief adversary and obstacle, how come he didn't send even *1* Nazgul against her ? Here Tolkien is telling us something, while giving us the evidences for the opposite. And that's why I dislike speaking about Galadriel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Also Sauron was desperately trying to see Lothlorien and Galadriel's mind but "still the door closed!" - Galadriel While equally fixing his eyes onto every corner of Middle-Earth looking for his ring, leading armies through the Nazguls etc... Conversely, what did Galadriel do aside from closing her mind ?  gt;That was the plan for conquering middle-earth. Or maybe Sauron would still not put all of his force to attack Lothlorien, not until everywhere else in Middle-earth was conquered. That means that Lothlorien isn't worth the trouble. I mean your sentence is self explanatory. Sauron attacked Lothlorien to prevent them from aiding the actual important realm, Gondor. Rohan and Gondor were stronger kingdoms and defeated stronger adversaries than Lothlorien. They needed to be put out before continuing. If Lothlorien was the most dangerous place, you would expect Sauron to truly empty Mordor against her.  gt;Even had there been one or a few Nazg #251;l attacking L #243;rien it would not been that impressive of a duel. Even the WK with all his eight companions at his side knew not to try and dare to get inside L #243;rien where Galadriel and her White Ring were (Unfinished Tales; IV; The Hunt for the Ring). Okey, you're trolling ? I'm not talking about the Nazgul coming alone, I'm speaking about the Nazgul coming with their armies. Like it or not, the Witch-King of Angmar was a real threat, he and his brethren had been serving Sauron for century. Was he stronger than Galadriel ? Nope. Would his presence tip the balance, yes.  gt;Also Gandalf quote about the Wise fear blah blah only apply to Cirdan and Elrond and some other of the Wise who have never seen the Light. That's a baseless claim. Gandalf is clear that even the Wise wouldn't want to fight the Nine when they are all there, Glorfindel isn't among the Wise mind you. So Galadriel was concerned as much as the rest. You're trying to wank Galadriel when textual evidences support the opposite.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\ gt;RotK suggests when it comes to a very important thing, Sauron fixes his mind only in one thing at a time. For example he fixed all of his mind upon the Lords of the West against the Black Gate. So when Sauron really wanted to penetrate the mind of his chief problem, he would focus all his mind. And yet he failed each time he tried. ROTK doesn't suggest this, that's your wrong interpretation. ROTK says that Sauron was squandering his forces and dispersing his mind against everybody, Gandalf, Glorfindel, Galadriel, Elrond, Celeborn, Cirdan and Aragorn, his eyes was everywhere. BUT. When Sauron had to chose who was the biggest threat, he chose Gondor and Rohan. Gondor and Rohan are populous realms with many cities. When he wanted to beat his hammer, he smacked it upon men. It to Men to whom he sent his most dreaded servants, not Galadriel. \ gt;God you are so stupid! Why Sauron should empty his lands to fight Lothlorien! whereas Gondor and Aragorn are in his footsteps. For fuck sake Aragorn challenged Sauron, leading him to believe he has the Ring. God I hope you're never a general. Sauron doesn't attack Gondor and Rohan because they are at his doorstep, but because they are the only real threat to himself. Elrond says it plainly and clearly that the Elves can't do shit against Sauron if Sauron decides to concentrate against them. Lothlorien is a shadow of Doriath, and all her protections would be overcome if Sauron himself comes. And truly, if I was Sauron, I would never think about the Elves. In terms of warfare, Elves have a worse pedigree than Orcs. Elves are the OG damsels in distress. They needed to be saved against Morgoth, **2 times !** Against Sauron, they needed Numenor to survive, and in the Third, they were counting again on two Hobbits to save them. Yes, to go die stupidly *(but badassly)* against a Dark Lord, everybody is present, but to actually win a war... And also, Sauron didn't knew Aragorn had the Ring until after the Pelennor fields and the assault on Lothlorien. \ gt;Lol no. Galadhrim have all sorts of magical tools and weapons. They have fought in battles. Many of Gondorians and Rohirrim never were in such intense battles. There are Silvan older than Galadriel herself in Lorien. Yeah, they are Sindar, not exactly the strongest of the Elves, and as I told you, elves don't really have a good record of winning wars. "Three times #160;L #243;rien #160;had been assailed from #160;Dol Guldur, but besides the valour of the #160;elven #160;people of that land, the #160;power #160;that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless #160;Sauron #160;had come there himself. #160;" \ gt;How about Gondor? Witch-King was fucking the shit out of everyone. Gondor barely won the battle with thousands of miracles and reinforcements. Also thanks to Galadriel who sent Aragorn to Paths of the Dead. Exactly, Sauron sent his most powerful assets against Men, not Elves. Because the big threat was Men. And it didn't need a ton of miracles, Sauron was defeated thanks to good tactics. Everything was weaved to come exactly as it came. And it was Elrond who guided Aragorn, not Galadriel. If I let you speak, you're going to tell me that Galadriel was the one who killed Gothmog. \ gt;Even if Sauron comes to Lothlorien he can only weaken Galadriel's magic over Elves and Lorien. Then there should be enough armies to overtake Lothlorien. And then after every Galadhrim is defeated and Galadriel is standing fighting alone, Sauron would come to kill her. But Tolkien said if there was someone who could aid Galadriel or Elrond (for example if there was Celeborn or Glorfindel at their side) they could kill Sauron. Tolkien said killing Sauron was only possible if 2 of very strong fight Sauron at the same time. That's absolutely false. If Sauron himself comes, the defenses of the Lorien falls, and the Orcs can roam there. Sauron doesn't have to fight himself, the Elves can't hold on forever, and against unending armies of Orcs, they are going to fall, just like they fell during the Second Age. \ gt;This also answers your other question : \ gt;Glorfindel is in TA, yet Tolkien says Galadriel is mightiest of the Elves of TA. Glorfindel was imbued by Maia-like powers, he is not fully elf. \ gt;Gildor says High-Elves, especially the strongest of them, do not fear the Nazgul. Actually the Nazgul fear them. And Gandalf, the wisest of all Maiar, who have personally encountered them, says the opposite. Sorry, but I believe a demiurgic being over the bastard of Finrod. \ gt;And who is Galadriel? "the equal if unlike endowments of F #235;anor" "Galadriel was the greatest of the Noldor, except F #235;anor maybe" "These two kinsfolk (F #235;anor and Galadriel), the greatest of the Eldar in Valinor, were unfriends for ever." "Galadriel, the greatest of the Eldar surviving in Middle-earth, was potent mainly in wisdom and goodness, as a director or counsellor in the struggle, unconquerable in #160;resistance #160;(especially in mind and spirit) #160;" "Galadriel, the only woman of Noldor to stand that day tall and valiant among the contending princes." Idril and Aredhel were also valiant. But they were not near as tall and as valiant as Galadriel and their cousins. Idril fought in Fall of Gondolin "\[Galadriel\] was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats." "Her mother-name was Nerwen ("man-maiden"), and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the Noldor; she was strong of body, mind, and will, a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth." "Nor were the 'loremasters' a seperate guild of gentle scribes, soon burned by the Orks of Angband upon pyres of books. They were mostly even as F #235;anor, the greatest, kings, princes and warriors, such as the valiant captains of Gondolin, or Finrod of Nargothrond and Rodothir his kinsman and steward." Okay, so we're coming back to the argument : "If Galadriel is so awesome, why didn't anything worthy of note in her life before the Second Age ?" Bringing up later wanks of Galadriel as a point concerning LoTR Galadriel is dishonnest. Galadriel in the LoTR, and as described in the Letter 238, is simply below Gandalf the White and Sauron and roughly equal to Sauron. \ gt;It is very clear, Galadriel could make Witch-King shit in his pants just with mere sight of her. It's very clear that's not the point. Because if the Witch-King shits his pants just with the mere sight of her, what does the anonymous general do ? Sauron clearly didn't think Galadriel was worthy of his Nazguls. \ gt;Aredhel crossed one of the deadliest places of ME. Many awesome warriors died by hands orcs in Fall of Gondolin. Even Glorfindel and his friends couldn't cross that place. Aredhel crossed the area **between** Ered Gorgoroth and Doriath, the only person to have crossed the Ered Gorgoroth was Beren. \ gt;What's wrong with you? I don't know if I am more dumb to answer your dumb questions that takes a minute to figure them out by yourself, or you are more dumb for keep playing an ignorant. Nothing, I want you to admit that according to the LoTR, Galadriel wasn't considered that much of a problem compared to the World of Men, and that she was matched by Sauron. Also, I want some Finrod fanart ? It's for... scientific purpose. Elven genetics and all that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>***Rhaz #232;s II Philotekos 9292-9334 :*** Aged 33 when he takes the throne, his country is going through a period of instability. Since the deposition of the *Deokides* in *Nemor*, revolutionnary movements have spawned sporadically in Tarangea, some successful, some less so. And in 9294, contestations started, in the first days mostly pacific, they will rapidly devolve into fighting, pressured by the army. In the first stages of the war, *Rhaz #232;s* will follow the advices of the councilmen inherited from his father. But everything will change in the Autumn 9302, when the Agros of *Kosmina Hydor* will secede from the Kingdom, cutting Dassia *(an anciently subjugated country)* from the core of the Kingdom, and threatening to allow it to declare independence. Wisely, during the Winter *Rhaz #232;s* calls back the Stratia, the royalists and all of the faithful Agros to the Capital. He plans carefully his counterattack and during the Spring he launches a lightning complain against a divided revolutionaries. Yet he understood that these will refuse to come back to the status-quo. Thus, he will play nobly, he stops his campaign after capturing the most dangerous leaders, and calls the rest to the negotiation table. There he proposes real reforms and more political implication of the population. As a gesture of kindness, he doesn't execute any of the leaders, opting instead for exhiles or mandatory residence, as for the minor chiefs, he grants them the opportunity to be deciders in this new realm. In the Summer of 9306, after the Ritual Festival to *Mahar-Fengar*, he proclaim a speech, where he announces the change, and first of his dynasty, he takes a fengarian regnal name : *Philotekos*, the Protector of the People. While he didn't in a particularly supernatural era, he was the only King to manage to secure his throne while acceding to his people demands.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Feanor wouldn #8217;t know that Morgoth could catch him either. And I don #8217;t buy you argument, Feanor is a character best known for being the first Orphan in the Legendarium, and an incredibly intelligent and keen person, if he didn #8217;t knew what the Fea experience, he most likely suspect the Valar for keeping elves to be rehoused. From a character point of view, ut just doesn #8217;t make sense to return to the Valar after having forsaken them, insulted them and exiled yourself from their lands. Especially if like Feanor, you already bear mistrust and near hate to them. On the opposite side, what would he know about Sauron or Melkor #8217;s powers ? Nothing. And if he fears to be taken by them, then he woudn #8217;t have left Aman in the first place. Feanor probably knew he could get captured alive by Morgoth and that wouldn #8217;t be a better fate.</TEXT>

The two kingdoms who do the heavy-liftings are Hithlum *(when two High-Kings lived)*, and the March of Maedhros, with Dorthonion who acts mostly as a buffer between Morgoth and Doriath. In the end though, all of these three great kingdoms are broken by one *(two for Doriath)* single attack. Nargothrond is sacked by Glaurung, Gondolin is destroyed by Gothmog and Doriath by the dwarves and then the Feanorians.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Oh come on..... how long did melkor have to enslave elves turn them into orcs breed balrogs and build not one but two giant indestructible fortresses??  gt;  gt;It took them three fucking wars to get it right, and we're supposed to THANK them for destroying half of middle earth? After an entire age of needless suffering and death? What lazy and incompetent "(demi) gods" When you're battling against the strongest being in the universe whose sole purpose is to destroy everything, you need to be careful.  gt;"For the sake of the elves" for the sake of the hundreds of thousands that died in melkors pits without ever seeing Valinor or a Vala? Tolkien says that Melkor only captured small groups who wandered off, and the Valar quickly discovered elf, went to war against Melkor and then brought those elves who wished back in Valinor.  gt;Or the tens of thousands who died on the battlefield while the Valar diddled each other? *"When you're battling against the strongest being in the universe whose sole purpose is to destroy everything, you need to be careful."*  gt;Or the hundreds of thousands that died on beleriand beneath the waves? They died specifically because they refused to stay in Valinor.  gt;If I was an elf, I'd be so fucking insulted if someone told me beleriand was sunk "for my sake" Well it was, would you rather that the Valar keep secluded from the World and leave you with Morgoth  gt;Yes it is. Yes it fuckin is. They are Valar, and claim ownership and sovereignty over their lives and property. They have to take some fucking responsibility. They don't get to both a) ignore the vast majority of the original elves and b) sink beleriand. Those two things are not compatible in a moral being. Except that it wasn't the Valar who sank Beleriand, that was the work of the Host of the War of the War of Wrath, had the Valar intervened, Middle-Earth in its entirety would have been broken down. And the Valar are forbidden from hurting the Children or forcing them to do something, either by threat or by appearing in all of their majesty. Remember that when Numenor attacked, Ulmo could have sank the entire fleet with a single wave, but Manw #235; relinquished his custody and called upon Eru. Melkor and Sauron are evil **because** they refuse this restrictions and want to rule the Children since they are stronger. People don't get what these battles of the power look like. The Valar and Melkor aren't simply arranging armies of Maiar who will fight for them, they are in an endless and chaotic process of creation and destruction, the Valar are working the earth and Melkor is simultaneously destroying it. Before Tulkas arrived, Melkor and the Valar were evened, but with somebody capable of actually striking Melkor, the balance was shifted.  gt;....... Letting Morgoth back out into the world was the right thing to do?? Respecting his word was the right to do. Tolkien says that had Manw #235; refused to set Melkor free, he would have taken the same path as his brother, ultimately becoming like him. The Valar, and especially Manw #235; are pure beings who don't understand evil. Manw #235; coudn't even process the fact that *maybe* Melkor was lying.  gt; "fuck eru for his laziness and incompetence; all who commit genocide are my enemy" Eru is God, the Children as his creatures, he disposes of them as he wishes. Removing Valinor, sinking Numenor *(which was an error, as Eru himself had taken the lifespan of the Edain for their treason)* was his right as God. From your point of view it's genocide, from his point it's a call, he brings back the Numenorean to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>High divorce rates indicates that either couples are getting more violent, that the spouses are getting less patient or that people are getting married without getting to know themselves. Divorce itself as a concept isn't bad, for some cases it's the only viable solution, especially when staying will bring hate or can harm one of the partners. But if we have 80% divorce rate I would be worried. Not all divorces are done for good reasons, there are reasons why it takes time and needs to be resolved in a court. I frankly don't get what advantages marriage has over concubinage now. Also, divorce is bad for the child.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Fucking and drinking during the spring of Valinor isn't being careful, it's being negligent. It's being euphoric that your worst enemy went away. We could say the exact same thing about how the Eldar behaved during the siege of Angband.  gt;Leaving most of the elves behind and not bringing it hem to Valinor isn't careful, it's lazy and cruel. Except that the Elves refused to leave.  gt;That's not what my copy of the silmarillion says. My copy has a whole tree of the different types of elves, most of whom NEVER saw Valinor. Because they didn't want to.  gt;My copy also says that Orome didn't bother finding all the elves, and many of the elves abandoned the journey. Orom #235; looked for the main settlemens, took three ambassadors of the three kindreds, showed them Valinor and then brought them back to convince their own to come. It's not like Orom #235; could threaten the Elves to come.  gt;Where did Morgoth get his countless armies of orcs from then? From a dozen elves? And let all the other elves who were abandoned by the Valar just chill in peace?? Who told you that Orcs were used during the War for the sake of the Elves ? Orcs are fooder for Men, let alone Valar. This was a battle which shaped Middle-Earth again.  gt;Leaving a SINGLE elf to be tortured by Morgoth is wrong for Valar who have claimed dominion and sovereignty over the elves. And they left thousands. That's bullshit, the Valar wanted to build a world for the Elves and Men to live in, which they did, at the best of their capabilities when you have Mini-God wrecking havoc in all your works. They never intended to govern the Elves. Many of the Valar were against meeting with Elves at all. Had it been for Ulmo or Mandos, the Elves would have stayed in Middle-Earth.  gt;Oh so the fuckers had the audacity to be autonomous, and make their own decisions. Wellp, guess we have to kill them all, and erase any trace of their history and culture from the earth! Darn shame that they couldn't be as obedient as Morgoth's orcs are. No you idiot, the Elves chose to return, the Valar didn't hinder them, but it is hypocritical to expect the help from thos whom you insulted and left behind. Same thing for the Avari and the Sindar, it was their own choice to not go to Valinor, now they take on their responsibilities.  gt;How dare you!! How dare you say the sinking of beleriand was for the elves sake!! The Valar didn't participate in the War of the Wrath, it was the Elves who sank Beleriand.  gt;I would rather the Valar get off their asses and fight Morgoth before the awakening. I'd prefer they didn't murder hundreds of thousands of my brothers and sisters, and I'd prefer they don't destroy literally my entire culture and history. But they did fight Morgoth, they got up and battled against Morgoth in the War for the Sake of the Elves. And they didn't kill Numenor, they asked the Dad of the Numenoreans to take the Numenoreans.  gt;Yeah, sinking a few boats, while still fucked up, is MUCH MUCH better than genocide. Okay, either you're a troll or you don't understand how the world work. When super Hitler comes to your Island to kill people and claim it, you have to do something. If the Valar were like Melkor or Sauron, they would have sunken the Island themselves, but instead, they resorted to the Highest Power in the Existence. And the highest power in existence chose to remove Numenor from the map.  gt;....... I mean it's better than genocide but letting hitler back to an unconquered berlin is NOT the right thing to do. That was an error, but had Feanor not been a dick and obeyed the Valar, they would have assaulted Morgoth again. Remember that Men were going to rise, so there needed to be something done. When the Noldor exiled themselves, they served as a buffer for Morgoth, until he was weakenened enough to be able to beat him without much damage.  gt;That's SO fucked up!!! If there's a god that disposes of my brothers and sisters on a whim, that god is my enemy. Full stop. Well that's God. God killed all the firstborn of Egypt, he brought the deluge upon Noah's people, he wrought destruction on Sodom and Gomorrhe. God doesn't answer to you, you're his creation, his slave and if he deems that you need to be reunited with him, he will take you, whether you like it or not.  gt;GENOCIDE IS NEVER ANYONES RIGHT. EVER. genocide is always wrong, regardless of how the murderers have managed to rationalize it. Except that Eru isn't a person, the whole universe is his, if he willed it, all would cease to exist, the Ainur, the Children, the dwarves, all. They all exist because Eru **allows** them to. Eru had decided that the time of the Numenorean was up, he himself says that "Men shall return to him and meet their maker". He never specified they will return in a pleasant manner though. The Numenorean had fucked up big. They were attacking the first children of Eru, delluded and drunken in arrogance. And the Valar, instead of pettily retaliating, called upon their father. Eru doesn't want the Children (*Men and Elves)* to be controlled by the Ainur, he wouldn't suffer the Children to attack the Ainur.  gt;Could you imagine what the world would be if genocide was excusable just bc you thought a higher power demanded it? Can you imagine how much wanton death and suffering there would be, if no one was brave enough to say "no fuck you and your imaginary friend, genocide is never okay" That's beyond the subject. Eru isn't imaginary. Eru didn't say to the Valar "Kill the fuckers !". He took upon himself to destroy Numenor. If God destroyed I don't know... Tadjikistan, we would all shut the fuck up and say okay.  gt;Just imagine for a second what life in the middle east would be like if Islam demanded the deaths of free women, homosexuals, apostates and infidels. Imagine how much progress, prosperity, culture, a joy would be lost to the world. Imagine how much worse life would be in the part of the world, if I could commit genocide just bc my religion told me to. What does Islam have to do with all of this ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If there was an 80% rate of divorce but a happier set of people after divorce, I #8217;d support it all the way regardless of the reason. That's because you're using fallacious reasoning to justify high rates of divorce. In this case you're taking high rates of divorce and making the assumptions that people who divorce immediately get better, while also forgetting the children and excluding the possibility of people experiencing mental breakdowns due to the abuse, having to spend years of therapy or simply being unable to make ends meet and living in misery. But divorce isn't something that pops on one day, nobody wakes up a morning and say "fuck it ! I don't want to live with this person anymore", unless they're mentally unstable in which case they should abstain from entering relationship with normal people. No, divorce is rooted in many problems which can start very early, some are very benign and could have been resolved by honesty, some are more hard to justify and some are downright unacceptable. Starting from the unproved assumption that the majority of human beings *at least in the modern, rich and developped Western World* are educated, civic and peaceful, if t80% percents of couples started to ask divorce, that leaves us with two interpretations : 1. These civic, educated people suddenly turned into abusive people or spiteful untrusty people. 2. These couples are ironically formed too early, without planning, nor complicity, nor agreements and thus ended at the first crack in the shell. Which means that we have ourselves a pair of irresponsible adults.  gt;By the way, I disagree that it means there is more domestic violence proportionally. That's because you're stawmaning my argument, which isn't that there is more domestic violence. Though since the Co-Vid crisis the rates of domestic violence have exploded world-wide. No my argument is much simpler. Higher rates of divorce means that people are more extreme, less patient and irresponsible. Simple. You sound like you're divorced and you're taking my points personally. I'm not speaking about case by case, but about large trends. There are situations in which divorce is the only logical solution. But divorce should *(generally)* be the last solution.  gt; That #8217;s because you put a faulty degree of importance on marriage. That's because I don't understand why people marry now. Bastards don't exist, out-of marriage sex isn't something unthinkable and concubinage is perfectly legal. So why marry ?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\ gt;ically NOT being careful, like you said they were..... I'm awaiting your conceit here. You aren't getting any, because I was speaking about carefulness in relation to not destroying middle-earth. Something that your brain cannot comprehend. The Valar are all walking thermonuclear bombs, Melkor moreso than the others, and he won't hesitate to destroy everything. The Valar don't have an easy choice, either fight carefully and people will die, or fight recklessly and everyone will die. If you can't wrap your mind about this then you don't understand what Tolkien's world is about. \ gt;Well shucks if only there were demigods that with their magic could very easily and plainly make it clear they would suffer and die if they stayed. Again, that's just lazy on the Valar. \ gt;They either are responsible for the elves welfare, or they are not. What they have chosen is some half assed middle ground. But the Valar aren't entitled to the Elves, they didn't descend in E #228; to govern the Elves, they descended to shape the world and make their music reality. Actually, the Valar shouldn't have meddled with the Elves at all, they shouldn't have met them or taken them to Valinor, Elves were made for Middle-Earth. But Melkor ruined everything. \ gt;You think the only way for a Valar to convince an elf to do something is by a threat? These elves have seen morgoths evil creatures. More God had already enslaved and murdered elves. I'm pretty sure I could convince them to leave, even without any Valar magic. They didn't want to. That's what you don't understand. The Elves **refused** after hearing not only what Orom #235; had to say, but what Finw #235;, Ingw #235; and Elw #235; saw. At that point the Valar won't take them by force. That's not the right thing to do. \ gt;Galadriel has a mirror that can see the future and past. If galadriel can possess something like that, the Valar can too. The Valar are prohibited from using their powers to force the Children to do something. Actually, we have an example of a Vala doing exactly this, and it didn't workd. Mandos came and recited his prophecy, yet the Noldor continued.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>\ gt;You could just send three of manwes eagles out, fly the elf ambassadors around middle earth, show them the destruction, and they'll be begging to go to Valinor. That's what they did, and the Ambassadors couldn't convince them. \ gt;You call me an idiot and also say the Valar didn't fight in the war of Wrath. Hmmmmmm  #129300; The Valar didn't fight in the War of Wrath, go to r/tolkienfans and ask the question, people way more qualified than I am will prove it to you. They sent Eonw #235; and some Maiar to Helpr the Elves, but the War was carried by Finarfin and Ingwion. \ gt;Imagine how much better middle earth would be if Numenor had been saved by an intervention, and not thru genocide and destruction of culture. It's culture survived, it became Arnor and Gondor, the Faithful were saved and stood up to Sauron, ultimately defeating him. Numenor itself was an error from the very beginning, just like Elves were meant to live in Middle-Earth, Men where needed in Arda Marred, not in an Island of eternal bliss. That's not the purpose of Men in this World, nor is it that of Elves. The biggest error of the Valar was trying to save the Elves and the Men. \ gt;I'd use christianity but there's a pretty good chance you're a Christian and I don't want cognitive dissonance to get in the way of my point. I'm not, I'm a Muslim. And you're ? \ gt;Simply incorrect, and again how dare you say that murdering hundreds of thousands of innocent elves, and destroying any trace of their culture and history was for their own sake. Because the alternative was getting ruled by Morgoth. You can't overthrow Morgoth without bringing significant damages to Earth, thus the sanking of Beleriand was the lesser of the two evils. \ gt;And that was really fucked up and if he exists he's my enemy for that and many many many other atrocities he's both committed and specifically called for, as well as every other attrocitiy he's allowed to happen. He's my enemy for putting my sex hole so goddamn close to my shit hole, let alone what he did to anne frank. You aren't the first person to think so, and you won't be the last. But calling yourself God's enemy is quite arrogant, because from the point of view of God, you're one of many creations, and not his greatest. Eventually, God will call you to him and just like the Numenoreans, you will meet the one who made you. \ gt;Again, anyone that keeps slaves or kills on a whim is evil and my enemy. Well you're his slave by default, since you can't really be free of him, God sent you to this Earth, and will call back, and will judge you and send you to Hell. As for the kills, he doesn't kill on a whim, he punishes wrongdoers, from our mortal and earthly point of view, it may be killing, but from the divine perception, he simply takes back what he has given. \ gt;And that was an evil decision and the decision maker is our enemy. Your ennemy, I'm not the enemy of the Valar, first because they don't exist, and second because I frankly don't care. \ gt;If Sauron is super hitler than one Valar is the entire justice league to the power of 10. Gimme a break, Manwe could have SO easily just appeared and said "that guy's is evil now stop killing each other" Which he did, he sent messengers, explained to Men etc.. But they refused, time after time. In one sense, the Akallab #234;th is a synthesis of the classical prophet journey *(at least in the Quran)*. Prophet comes to people  gt; He calls them to the right path and the worship of God, enjoining the Right and Forbidding the Wrong  gt; the People refuses to heed his call, safe for a minority, generally *(but not always)* comprised of the poorest and most defavorized  gt; Ultimately the People become blasphemous, arrogant and dangerous.  gt; Good smite them.  gt; And a new people take their place. Repeat. That's similar to what happened to Numenor. Valar send Messenger to Numenor, begging them to tur away from their folly.  gt; Numenor doesn't answer, except for a minority  gt; Numenor attack Valinor  gt; Eru smite Numenor and change the World. \ gt;Eru could have too, genocide is never the answer. The notion of genocide is quite stupid from the point of view of a God. We see genocide horrible because it ends lives. God didn't annihilate Numenoreans, he simply took their souls to him. Again, Numenoreans were going to die sooner or later, they just happened to have a very bad end. \ gt;This is the difference between you and I. I think genocide is always wrong, you think it's okay as long as your imaginary friend told you it was. I don't see why we're bringing my beliefs in this. Even though you're an atheist, you can't deny that within the Legendarium, Eru exist. The implication of his existence nullify your whole argument, because Eru is the Morale. What is morally wrong is to go against his will, you are doing exactly the same things melkor did, and look where that brought him. Numenor didn't fell because another faction attacked them and genocided them due to dubious religious justifications, but they were destroyed by the God of that Universe. It was his will and none can overcome it. Maybe in your deluded vision, claiming yourself to be the enemy of Eru is sound, but in the end, you can't do anything against him, so your claim is useless. You imagine yourself enemy of God, just like Melkor opposed Eru, only to find out you can't overcome him. And again, from Eru's point of view he isn't genociding, he's calling back the Numenoreans. What I agree on on a meta-textual level is Tolkien double-standards. Why Eru destroyed the Numenorean and not Sauron or Melkor ? Tolkien will answer that Eru's intervention is derived from the abandon of the Valar their custody over Arda. Which begs another question, why did the Valar abandon their custody ? Because they can't attack the children ? Well there are elves there who could have pushed the Numenoreans back to the sea. It would have been a massacre ? Well that's exactly what Feanor did. If the Valar felt that they should lay their custody because of the risk of massacres in Valinor, then they should have called upon Eru when Feanor attacked the Teleri. Perhaps Eru would have drowned the Noldor. I don't blame Eru for his action, I blame Tolkien for making double-standards between Men and Elves. If Men challenging the Valar necessitate Eru's intervention, then so does Elves. Here I will bring my theology, but contrary to the modern Christian doctrine, we Muslims don't believe ourselves to be in the manner of God or even some special creature. We're but one among many servants he has created, and if you go by the Quran, he doesn't even need us, he basically created everything to have people who will live, enjoy their lives, worship him and reunite with him in the Paradis. Count yourself lucky to exist. The Deal is simple : You worship God, and you get Paradise, you don't, and you get Hell. Of course, you get yourself this earthly life that you can enjoy to some extant, but this isn't its purpose. Similarly, Eru didn't create the Children for them to enjoy life and play and love each other, he made them for a specific purpose. They are tool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Now please, don't make yourself more stupid than you are. My sentence is quite clear in that one does not need to be a giant to make gigantic buildings. As early as the 14th century, Ibn Khaldoun was already casting doubt on the idea that the 'Ad were giants. It is mentionned nowhere in the Quran, and verily, it comes from the brutishness of ancient Arabs, much like how the Anglo-Saxons marveled at the Romans structures left in England, thinking they were the work of some mighty race, whereas they are but human deeds. I would expect from somebody who lives in the era when we can send Men flying beyond Earth to be more down to Earth. If 'Ad were giant for makin big houses, what are we then ? Sorcerers ?

    <TEXT> gt;Never denied that. Yet the buildings of Aad were big as mountain. Do we have any structure at such scale? Burj khalifa was the closest but it is more like tower. The building of 'Ad where not as Big as mountains. The Quran, Chapter 89 says : " #1573; #1616; #1585; #1614; #1605; #1614;  #1584; #1614; #1575; #1578; #1616;  #1575; #1604; #1618; #1593; #1616; #1605; #1614; #1575; #1583; #1616;". Iram of the Pillars, a city with Pillars, such as many were knowns to Man. Add to it the fact that Iram, the city of 'Ad, was mentionned by the Eblaites, who we know where not giants. Eblaites are contemporaries of Moses who wasn't a giant. And your Hadiths speaks about Adam, not 'Ad. 'Ad happened a long time after Adam. Again, there are no proof whether in the Quran or the Hadith that supports that 'Ad *(or Thamud for that matters)*, were giants, except later additions of legends and myths of the Arabs. Ibn Khaldoun is denying the Past scholars because maybe... just maybe, these past scholars weren't Allah and could get wrong. Tabari himself in his Tarikh warn the reader that he compiled **everything** without questioning sources, authenticity, veracity or simply logic. He just took all he heard and put in a book. Ibn Khaldoun, much like Bukhari or Muslim, said "no" and copied the criterias of the muhaddithin while adding some of his own because History isn't the same as Hadiths, and doesn't have the same objectives.</TEXT>

Because oppressed and abused people are more likely to develop negative feeling and fall into depression, which rises suicide rates. My point isn't that Women aren't oppressed, though you may have believed so due to the thread you're in, neither is it that lowest suicide rate stems from lower oppression, no it's simpler. My point, that you failed to understand, is that in general oppression (and abuses in general) induces higher suicide rates.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No, and I have no idea where you got this. Evolution is a very slow process. A hadith makes mention of Aisha playing with dolls and her friends. The prophet was still considered a ghulam when he was her age. Arabic poetry often sang about little boys, who would be just a little bit older than Aisha. If we look at the european nobilities, they specifically arranged married for their **kids** at an early age. You can also read about how Persian, Chinese or Byzantine viewed the transition between child an adult. I've actually heard this affirmation of people tended to mature faster only here, and used once by a man who was justifying marrying little girl if they were mature. Obviously though, and as anyone here who is a parent can attest, physiological and psychological maturity are unrelated. You can find a 12 year old who's extremely seasoned and mature, while being sexually immature, and you can find 17 year old who's sexually active without me counting on him to live alone. This argument is pointless though, because the people who bring up Aisha age don't have a problem with the fact that she *may* have been sexually inactive, nor even the fact that she was mentally immature, but that she was 9. In this argument, there are only two position : \-Either you deny that Aisha was 9 year old, and bring the demonstration that she would have been in her late teens by the time she married. \-You embrace that 'Aisha was 9 year old, and either you find weird justifications, or you're morally sound and say : "It's the Prophet, the Prophet obey the Word of God, we don't question him".  #8203; From what I know though, people were very bad at keeping track of birth date. Bedouin tribes before modern days could miss the mark by a few year. The Prophet himself is said to have been died at 62, 63 or 64. If you look at the Sahaba and read the many biographies made on them, you will find that many have numerous birth dates. Obviously, the Hadith explicitly says that she was nine. But the Hadith is narrated by her, unless you believe her to be divinely inspired, you can cast doubt on her age, she may have been older, or younger.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope, that makes you less just than Allah himself.

If the Prophet wanted to marry a man, none has the right to speak about him. It's the Prophet.  gt; If she really was 9, it doesn't matter for the reason I've stated. It doesn't because you didn't bring proof that people used to mature faster. The Hadith said that the Prophet had sex with her at 9, but we infer that she was sexually mature. She may have just wanted it.  gt; If you can tell me what is weird about the justification, please do The weird justification is what you give, that people tended to mature faster, something that is unsupported by any data except nebulous Islamic scholars who couldn't tell the kidney from the liver. All of this because these scholars want to permit boning little girls. What is morally and islamically sound is to say that it was the Prophet, and the Prophet did things that we can't do.

The Achaemenids aren't Pharaohs either, but that's beside the point, because Persians don't claim Egypt as theirs, european orientalists in the 19th century and dubious pseudo-historians frustrated not to find Thule do. Much like afrocentrists, and for exactly the same reasons. Also, the title and the meme is as bad as what they are denouncing. Why should Great Zimbabwe, Aksum, Ghana, Mali and Songhai all have to be affiliated to a same group ? Do Indian and Chinese claim each other civilisations as their own ? The Afrocentrists are mimicking the academic works of 19th century orientalists. They didn't invent anything, Anta Diop took the arguments of Ernst Renan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They were, stop lying dude. I'm a semite, semitic is a language group, ethiopians and arabs are both semites. Just because in your head africa = people of black complexion doesn't mean that I'm not an African. And Egyptians spoke a chamitic language, closely related to Berber languages who were African. Egyptians were African. Funny how nobody ever claims the greeks weren't europeans, when they meddled much more with middle easterners than they did with northern european people. And yet now all of Europe wants Ancient Greece to be its matrice. Ancient egypt is an African civilization. They aren't the matrice of Western Africa or Kenya, but they are African.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry because I'm too stupid for my own good, but I didn't quite get everything you said.  gt;with the perspective you have, it can be challenging as a reader to understand the alien nature of the POV character. Do you mean it takes time to get that *Arhab* isn't human ? Yes that's a flaw that I don't really know how to fix. I have another text detailing the events preceding this text, which is more apersonal and would fix the issue as you would be acquainted to the character, but it breaks the limit and I had to cut.  gt;Consider single-sentence paragraphs for some of the more emotional impacts in what he says/thinks. The "ridiculous hats" bit is a great example here. This one I didn't get. You mean I should write long sentences where he speaks his mind, instead of a series of small ones ?  gt;this scene is an atrocity. People are being raped and killed. The human soldier is panicked, watching his world come crashing down. We don't get a lot of the visceral emotion here - which i know is the point due to the nature of the POV character, but I think drawing a first juxtaposition of the ongoing atrocity and his general lack of care/interest will help sell the reality of the scene. Taking a few lines to point out the fear and desperation of the humans, the sound and smell and experience of the carnage of the scene, all while the POV character looks on in disinterest, will help sell the banality of the darkness on the page. This I didn't think about, but it makes sense, I feared to drown too much into monologue and bore the reader, I will see what I can do. Thank you for taking the time to review a poorly-translated text.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I'm well aware those groups are semitic. Idk where you're from but here African = sub-Saharan Africa. I'm North-African, I don't know where **you** are from, but I mildly appreciate that you take it upon you to decide who is african or not.  gt;Berbers aren't African either. When people say African they are generally referring to cultures related to Sub-Saharan Africa, which North Africa generally isn't. Okey, so you're just a racist champ ? Berbers are African, they have been inhabiting Africa since the Paleolithic, just because in your skewed mind, Africa = Black doesn't mean it's real. When ~~people~~ racists say Africa they are generally referring to cultures related to Sub-saharan Africa. But that's because racists aren't interested in truth, just political agenda. Educate yourself about Berbers and the continuous exchange between North Africa and Sub-saharan Africa. The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty, where from modern-day Senegal.  gt;Culturally, it's an extension of the Middle East. North Africa has been an extension of Middle-East with Islam and the Arabs, but that didn't severe the ties they had with Africa. If you're bringing Islam in here. We Muslim do not buy into the racial division of 19th century orientalists made up to justify their superiority complex. We have our understanding of what our cultural sphere should look like. So don't come in with your nefarious views and cram them upon us.  gt;People calling Egypt African are almost always implying a cultural connection to greater Africa, not a geographic one. Because whether you like it or not, Pharaonic Egypt had a lot of ties with the Nubians, the Kushites, the Getules, the Lybians, all of these were African people. And stop bringing people, that's sophism and lies and I hate both. Now I'm the one arguing. And Egypt is African, by its history, by its people and by its cultural ties to other African cultures. Nobody came and stopped Swedes, French and British from appropriating Ancient Greece **for themselves and themselves only**, which as a civilization, had little to no ties with the Celtic and Germanic world, but much more connections, with the Persians, Anatolians, Egyptians and Phoenicians, while on the same time viewing their contemporary Greeks with disdain and racism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Saying they should be stopped legally is tricky. Because Muslims living in Western countries most likely accept the status quo, while those living in the IW will say yes, they need to be stopped legally because the law protects against these kind of infractions. Add to it that legal pursuit means arrestation and process, which implies some sort of force of violence. A better phrasings would have been : * They should have the right to draw. * There should be laws that ban them from drawing this. * They should be stopped by all means possible. In your original poll, 1 amp;2 aren't very different. If you believe it is their right, then you're condoning their actions. If I say, people should have the right to have sex outside of marriage, then whether or not I myself will do it, I'm endorsing a position.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Frankly idk what you're getting so angry about. I'm angry about White Europeans and Black Africans playing a game of ping-pong with North Africa to see who got it. North Africa has ties both to the ME, SA and Mediterranean.  gt;Also you seem to have it backwards - it's afrocentrists who think African = Black and thus try to claim Egypt and Carthage as black. No, you have it backwards. It was 19th century orientalists like Ernst Renan who white washed all of the ancient Mediterranean and Near-eastern civilisations and claimed them as their own, pretexting that Arabs genetically marred the south shore of the Mediterranean. You can read Ernst Renan "De l'Apport des S #233;mites  #224; l'Histoire", where he specifically considers only Arabs and Jews to be Semites, and calls Egyptians, Assyrians, Phoenicians etc... their somewhat long lost brothers. This method was then taken by afrocentrists who applied it with the same bullshit to prove that all of Africa was black, only to be genetically marred by Arabs.  gt;As for cultural ties, Egypt has few to sub-Saharan africa. That's because in your own racist conception of Africa, Africa si everything that is below Ethiopia. An you fail to understand that there are Black people in North africa, who have been there since before Indo-Europeans invaded Europe, there are Black berbers.  gt;Egypt in fact had few cultural ties to anywhere and viewed basically all foreign civilizations with contempt. That's just a lie. Egypt had many ties with the Lybians to whom it gave their alphabet, to Kushites with whom they traded, and obviously with the ME.  gt;Nubia for Egypt was just a cotlony - it had about as much cultural ties as Britain had to Kenya. That's the biggest bullshit I've read so far. And it serves to show your mindset. Egypt and Nubia where trade partners between whom there was much cultural exchange. Their relation was more akin to that of Egypt with all of its other neighbours. Black =/= colonizable people. Uppeer Egypt people were heavily mixed with what you would consider blacks.  gt;Libyans were semitic incidentally as well, Lybians weren't semitic, they spoke a chamitic language, not a semitic one. Dude the more I read, the more I feel you aren't here for truth. Berbers aren't semites. And even if they were, the A**ncient Semitic-speaking peoples** or **Proto-Semitic people** lived throughout the ancient Near East, including the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Horn of Africa from the third millennium BC until the end of antiquity.  gt; And North Africa has been an extension of the middle east long before the Arabs What's your argument for that ?  #8203; As for the last part, I know afrocentrists do this, but it's not a reason to deny all and any ties between Egypt and Africa. Framing it as this island in the desert who is more invested in the Middle-East and the Mediterranean is what racist academicians in the 19th century did in order to claim egypt as their own. I'm from Morocco, but I never claim the Numidian kingdoms to be my direct ancestors, yet I don't deny that the Numidian Kingdoms are a part of my History. Just because I don't speak numidian and dress like them doesn't mean that I should ignore the traditions which moroccans have been practicing since their days.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope, I'm rambling about you claiming that Ancient Egypt had 0 connection whatsoever with what you would deem as Black Africa. Referring to Africa as simply the continent of Black People is already leaning heavily toward their side. Let me give you a more simple example. Many people here bring out Mali or Songhai as example of African empires. And that's true, but they weren'tjust that, they were also belonging to the greater family of Muslim Empires, and Mali and Songhai had numerous trade relations, cultural exchanges and mutual influences between them and North Africa and the broader Islamic World. Does that make Songhai and Mali non-african civilisations ? No. Another example, Cordoba's Caliphate, the Emirate of Sicily were both european states with an Islamic and Arabic culture, but both of them had also numerous ties with christian Europe. The Caliph married daughters of Christian Kings in the North, Sicily participated in Italian conflicts etc... They are both.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>In my World, monsters is a special category of creatures, though not a biological one. All monsters are dangerous creatures to Humans, but unlike lions, hyenas, wolves, dogs and mosquitoes, monsters have massive strength and one of them can be mortal for more than 10 hardened hunters or warriors. Monsters aren't sentient, or more exactly, monsters don't make good companions for human, and are dangerous, they aren't part of the general population, though they can be hunted for some of their organs. Each and every area in the World has some monsters in it, but sometimes, these monsters can concentrate to such rates that they make no-man's land, areas whithin or at the border of states that no state lays claim on. The biggest of these no-man's land is the Forest of Abasya, an immense and dense jungle the size of France populated by several species of monsters. There are many kind of monsters, the three most famous are Wagz, a human-shaped beast, with big nostrils in place of eyes and toothed lips, and the Tafur, a cannibalistic which consumes metal and blood to strengthen its skin. Gannes, who fit in the category without being animals at all, are powerful spirits who fell to evil eons ago. Though not overtly antagonistic to humans, indeed they can lend their powers to Humans, they are still dangerous creatures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Now I'm just curious about different people's interpretations of demons(what's your interpretation). Do you mean as an archetype in my culture or as a archetype in my works ? In my culture demons are simply spirits that wish ill fate for humans. It's a term englobing all kind of things going from small annoying creatures to monsters. People use amulets to protect themselves from them. In my work, demon is simply a very very powerful nefarious entity. It can be a human, it can a non-human entity. But it has no racial or special meaning. There isn't a group of people genetically related whom I can call demons. It's like bad guys. That's because the term demon is way too much connoted with absolute pure evil and I don't like to have entire "races" of Devil McDark. And if you mean in the general consciousness of the Western audience. Demons are then a category of beings spiritually related, maybe ancient angels, who strayed off the right path and engages in evil deeds and plans.</TEXT>
