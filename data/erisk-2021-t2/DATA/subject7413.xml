    <TEXT>Well, if your parents tell you that its probably because they don't fully understand what you're going through. Depression is a bitch, it makes everything harder, and it doesn't mean you're soft or weak. Even if you *were* "soft", it doesn't change much. Your struggles are still valid. I consider myself pretty soft/sensitive, and it sucks sometimes but its okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The worm moved into a new city just a few months ago to start university. They have to work to support themselves. The worm is on the verge of a breakdown, they can't take it anymore. The worm releases a primal scream. They scream and scream and scream until they have no voice. The worm is now at peace. They call in sick to work, and just relax all day. They are at peace - everything will be okay.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I understand why you're upset, but try not to worry about it. Technically every cut is a styro, as you're penetrating the dermis. It won't scar necessarily.

    <DATE>2020-08-07 04:55:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>I haven't cut in like a month and a half but it doesn't feel like an achievement. I still self harm on a daily basis, mainly by punching things and myself, and other methods I won't discuss. It feels like self harm is a part of me, a tumor that cant be removed. I started cutting when I was 13 and curious about what a razor would do to me, but I've been self harming since I was a kid. I still remember hitting and scratching myself. You know whats the worst part? I don't really have a reason to cut. I just like it, and I guess I'm kind of addicted to it, but thats it. I was kind of fucked up mentally as a kid but not anymore. The only fucked up thing about me is how much I fucking love to hurt myself. I feel so lonely, just like in basically every other aspect of my life I'm the odd one out, or at least it feels like it. I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but it feels like everyone has a valid reason for doing it except for me, I basically just do it for fun. It be like that sometimes... anyways, I hope everyone is having a nice day. Take care.</TEXT>

And nerves aren't the only thing there, you should worry about tendons and all that. You can get chronic pain and other stuff. Thats why doing it in places with more fat reserves is safer.

    <TEXT>Strenght is relatively objective. If you can lift/push whatever amount, you are stronger than the majority, therefore you are strong. Intelligence is much more complex. Not only are there different types of intelligence, its also very hard to prove you're intelligent. A lot of people suffer from the Dunning-Krueger effect too. Just because you say you're intelligent and have a high IQ or whatever doesn't mean you're smart. And, in my experience, people love to learn new things, and love in depth discussions, even people that aren't "nerds". Its just that there's a time for everything, and not everyone is interested in the same topics.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, yeah. Being stupid is bad. People don't like feeling stupid just like they don't like feeling ugly, or useless. But I get what you're saying. Many people think they're smarter than they are and don't want to learn new things.</TEXT>
