    <TITLE>random kicks due to "bad connection"</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-29 16:15:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>for seemingly no reason over the recent couple of weeks ive often been kicked from multiple casual and ranked matches due to a "bad connection" yet my game always runs smoothly when it isn't busy removing me from matches, i have no lag nor frame issues at all. the reason i put the quotation marks over the words bad connection, is because i have a ethernet cord which, in every game, guarentees me no lag whatsoever, i usually am connected to rainbow six servers with 6-19 ping and i cant see how on earth my connection is bad in any way. so what can i do to stop these unecessary connection issues? tl;dr i have an ethernet cord, regular 6-19 ping yet still kicked from almost every game i play in r6 due to "bad connection", how do i stop this?</TEXT>

I guess the issue is just parents who lack the ability to understand the normality of possible oddities in their children and that a lot of it is just growing up. To that i say, if theres no reason or suspicion to investigate one's actions which may violate their privacy, then theres no need to put a spotlight on it, but thats not always the case and i have no clue how it could be fixed</TEXT>

    <TEXT>oh reddit messed up for me when you sent this ig, i only see it now so sorry for the late response. I dont know how i got tinnitus but it was at first random rings that would fade out until i thought it went away. I later noticed a ringing in the absence of noise and just assumed it was the sound of silence, only when i worry about it or focus on it does it get worse, but otherwise im thankful for being easily slid into it through ignorance as its definently no where near what some of these people suffer through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>futas are possible, theres actually an old porno that i saw once before losing it to the internet, that had two natural hermaphrodites with breasts fucking. Also one of my friends is a hermaphrodite, the only result of being one is that usually one part may be underdeveloped or one sex's genetalia dont work (arent fertile). Now unrealistic dick size? theres actually a man longer than that flaccid, however a futa may not be able to pull it off due to the amount of hormones needed for both breasts and a penis.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>sorry buddy but i watched through the interview or w/e that trump said to inject bleach. Trump said exactly this: "and then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, is there a way we can do the same thing like that uh like injection inside". Where disinfectant's only prior definition was "readily available bleach, isopropal alcohol". Trump later claiming he was being sarcastic can only mean he was making a joke at the expense of Mr. Bryan, a person who trump had just claimed was intelligent in the subject of how to quickly kill covid 19. So those "Rational people" arent very rational.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're the one not keeping up. He used to be anti gay marriage and stated so during elections, afterwards he listened to the lgbt community, convinced obama to join him, and made 36 federal actions to support the lgbt community. Thats called change, character development. Meanwhile biden has been actively talking with bernie and plans to talk to yang about their plans and he has already talked interest in combatting the climate crisis after talking with bernie. It may not be the full cake but its gonna be a nice good slice of each by *minimum* which is better than the nothing but denial that trump offers.</TEXT>

I already came out to my close family who was supportive of me and helped me be more feminine around the house, but my mother wants me to talk to my grandpa more about the subject to help him understand. She already told him the generalities of it but i feel really bad talking to him about it because my grandpa has been surrounded by women his whole life and to think i was his false prophet of an escape makes me cry. He was already catching on beforehand but still said he wants the best for me and for me to be happy, I know im still essentially the same person just now more open and outwardly feminine but i think thats the issue that worries my grandfather, how do i deal with this? what do i say to him? im just so saddened by this reality that he must face, no close male family members to share boyish stuff with :,(</TEXT>

I have met african americans who dislike the n word, i have met some who dont care, but it should still be something you at most only share between close friends. Just like how the t word can be used by trans individuals who arent affected in close circles, and avoided around those who are.

Biden and obama were against gay marriage and both openly stated it 2009 elections, after elected biden talked to the lgbt community and learned that they needed his support, because of this biden convinced obama to help the lgbt community and throughout the entire obama presidency, they did a total of 36 federal actions for the lgbt community.

    <TEXT>he left out the part where the t word has been used to justify trans violence and that its been wrongfully used as an umbrella term among the wrong targets. Although the anime community may mean well it doesnt change the fact that real life trans people get called traps, i have been called a trap, i have a friend who's partner's mother calls her a trap. People for some reason cant just move on and use femboy for fucks sake its so much easier to reply to being called a femboy with "...im not a boy" than being called a sexual deviant seeking to corrupt heterosexual men with the t word.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You people are supporting the ongoing use of a term that has been so generally misused that it has been a tool of trans violence justification. Whether or not the characters being called the t slur are trans or not doesnt matter and doesnt change the fact that its become an umbrella term for all men by sex who dress femininely. I as a trans girl have been called the t slur by members of the anime community years before this civil war and its very degrading. A trans friend of mine who's in a relationship, her partner's mother calls her the t word to this day. Stop supporting misused terms that harm others and justify violence instead of just calling people and characters what they are, crossdressers, femboys, and trans people.

    <TEXT>Imagine thinking the arguement is whether the characters being called traps are trans when really the ban is for the general misuse of the word that has made it an umbrella term to defend trans violence. Why are you guys so desperate to use such an umbrella term to describe femboys, crossdressers, and trans people when you can just call them what they are? Also no the anime community isnt as innocent as you guys try to say, i as a trans person was called a trap by people like you guys back in like 2015 and generally sexualized for the "exotic effect" of being trans. A trans friend of mine is still called a trap to this day by her partner's mother, and people often use the word to justify trans violence. Fuck you guys for defending it, sincerely a trans woman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>to say one should still use trap because they dont use it against the group that is still targeted with said word is to believe its ok to call straights f #9734; #9734;got and whites n #9734; #9734; #9734; #9734;r. All three are slurs used to attack groups of people, and i dont see people spamming the n word or f word after its ban because banning it truly removes it. Of course one can still say mouse trap, bear trap, etc etc, but theres no need to use a misused umbrella term to identify people who already have an identity of crossdresser/femboy. Btw i have been called a trap by an anime enthusiast back in the day and was sexualized for finding myself, it was so fucking degrading. A trans friend of mine is still called a trap to this day by her partner's mother. Cis woman have even been accused of being traps for being slightly masculine in ways and attacked for it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;POC have taken back the N-word and use the "-a" ending, in this same case its ok for trans people to use trap as they have become the target of said word so they have freedom to dictate its use.  gt;Crossdresser and femboy both have negative connotations too. thats true but its so much easier for me to defend myself if im called a crossdresser or femboy than a sex deviant trap seeking to corrupt any heterosexual male i can find.  gt;Once you ban one word because it might be used to attack a group of people, another word will take its place. thats the whole point, if a new word takes its place it could hopefully become less of an umbrella term and generally less harmful.  gt;I am sorry for you, your friend, and anyone else that may be called that, none of you deserve that. Ultimately I want you and everyone else to feel welcome here and like the queens and kings you are. i appreciate the support but please show it, a whole bunch of the trans community wants the word banned for its misuse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Literally anyone can say that about any word. I could say that about weeb but is any word being used as a successful defense against trans violence? i mean i dont see people using the word weeb to justify violence against those classified as that type of person.  gt;trap has been used for over a decade in "the anime community"...you aren't necessarily going to be able to change minds overnight and some may not be changed at all. so what? you think we should keep using this term despite it clearly is used to justify trans violence and greatly disgusts a majority of the trans community that the word has evolved to target in society?  gt;Pretty sure trans individuals among the anime community are a minority. then let me rephrase that, shouldnt we make the majority of targets of a slur happy?*  gt;I think you may be surprised at how little I use that word. Obviously more because this drama starting, and to some degree amongst my close friends who also watch anime, but I tend to not say it very much. I am skeptical of banning words without context then why are you here if you dont even use it? the mods already specified you can use it within context.  gt;I do, however, believe that the context for Astolfo being a trap and someone mislabeling you or even a character like Lily from Zombieland Saga (who is clearly trans, that's her character arc) is completely different. (sorry for getting out of order here and forward) astolfo isnt even technically a trap by (urban dictionary) [definition](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Trap), "A #160;crossdresser, usually a fictional character in an anime, who dresses up in the opposite #160;gender's #160;clothing to trick people into thinking that they're the opposite gender. Term comes from the anime trope of a character dressing up in drag to trick people into thinking that they're the opposite gender." yet astolfo is [described as](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Rider_of_Black) "He purposefully dresses "as a girl" because he likes cute things". A trap is trying to trick people, but astolfo just likes cute things and thats all, no mentioned intention of tricking anyone whether he ends up accidentally doing so or not.  gt;Shitty people will always find slurs. the issue here is one can say a word has ill intent while there can be a word that has actually be used with ill intent, aka trans violence justification doesnt really use the words "crossdresser" or "femboy" to describe how the 'victim' thinks he was being tricked.  gt;You are saying that any use outside of "a device used to catch animals" is a wrong. I am saying that mislabeling someone who is trans or a character who is trans is wrong and any other use is not. the main misuse i meant was the whole trans violence justification thing, im not saying the anime community does that though, but like if we're punishing people in the community how do you suspect we stop it in public. and i do believe the presence of "traps" has lead to trans sexualization in the anime community (i say this as the victim of it)</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;A slur isn't bad unless it is linked to violence? I thought all discrimination was bad. a slur isnt bad if its being used on those which arent normally targeted negatively by it? i thought all discrimination was bad, because thats what the people here are literally defending.  gt;I want to believe most of us weebs are used to being treated negatively and want to be inclusive. then why cant they understand the negative connotations of trap?  gt;but most of us weebs have fallen into the "trap" of thinking they are girls. That's it thats the problem, you guys are defining "trap" as men dressing femininely which (purposefully or not) causes you to believe they are females. Making the term that simple is how you cause misuse because trans women are *physically* male people dressing as females (until srs, which takes a while sadly).  gt;Why would we have a mascot of a trope we hate?! its the obssessiveness over the trope thats the issue for the anime community imo  gt;Again, a slur isn't bad unless it is linked to violence? again, a slur isnt bad if its used for different people than the typical targets? you know this isnt true for other slurs so why does trap get a pass? yes i understand you dont use it dont worry you've made that point clear, but you've still asserted it isnt bad to use havnt you?  gt;In general though, most of us know that "trap" =/= "trans". Our "trap" trope is not the same as the "trapping" defense. i appreciate that but the word still has the negative connotation with the words use like that :(  gt;Changing general public opinions on social issues takes a long time. i feel it wouldnt have been as much of a problem if people generalized the word trap to a physical male who dresses feminine though.  gt;they would probably be creepy without an anime trope to grasp at. well people have said traps have brought more 'acceptance' and recognition of those people by the public due to their presence and im quite sure its sparked the fetishization too</TEXT>

    <TEXT>you're pointing out how obama is bad for "not deporting, but locking them in cages" but trump is literally at the same ground if this is still going on and the republicans arent saying shit about that, thus both political parties are at fault here. Except there's more, the republican senate actively stated desire to stop everything obama tries to do, so he had to make a shitton of compromises, so he is already at a disadvantage to fix this issue of locking the kids up. But i have yet to see the republican majority oppose trump, so why hasnt he dont anything? They're at the same place but one had a clear disadvantage, so why is that same person worse than the one with the greater ability to fix the issue? It sounds to me as if the republicans would be worse for yelling at obama for doing it while the senate blocked him and saying nothing about a trump with a senate in his favor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[first is out of context](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/29/viral-image/biden-said-without-orderly-integration-his-childre/) my defense for the "if you dont vote for me you're not black" is his clear struggle to even get the words out and his pre-existing medically diagnosed gaffe that caused him to miss a word (such as "supportive of" etc), but im sure all presidents are perfect in every way shape and form without a single mistake. [and even anita hill is able to put that issue behind her in support of biden](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/anita-hill-says-that-she-could-vote-for-biden-1364590)</TEXT>

We never knew when she was gonna die but that she lived 3 years longer than the doctor expected, my mom was hoping for 20 more years but she still made sure someone was with our grandmother in the hospital.

    <TEXT>cool, lets say there was a family memeber there, give him the benefit of the doubt. That means no neglect and disrespect for robert's passing which is good. But trump didnt respect the passing of john* (typo) lewis did he? did he respect the passing of 170k+ americans and the families that were impacted? (his fault or not doesnt matter). No, so he does not have my condolences or respect. I dont think robert should have died, which most who support #wrongtrump agree about (there are some deranged ones who think its good robert died and fuck them), and am sorry for his passing, but trump gets no respect from me for his past actions.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no, i want him to show empathy for the fallen, not bring them fucking back. That is the way it is today but its disrespectful to his citizens to just say "their deaths are just a reality" and nothing else. we know its a fucking reality. This is like a president saying "it is what it is" to a fallen soldier because the soldier wasnt killed by hos hands. By this comparison i dont expect him to hold hundreds of funerals though, i expect him to say "im sorry for your loss" to the 170k+ impacted families. Just like how i'd be expected to say the same to him for the loss of his brother.</TEXT>

I feel an equal response would be "How dare trump still oppose protections and preventative measures to stop covid, what ignorant scum to support such idiotic views" "to all family and friends of robert trump, i want to extend my heartfelt sympathy and love for everything that robert stood for and represent. God be with you!" "why didnt the senate impeach failure trump?! they are all just bootlickers to the idiot in chief and deserve to be kicked out immediately for letting their partisan views take over such a critical decision" Doesnt sound legit when i put it like trump does, does it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>oh boy you jumped straight to the problem with the use of the word trap in the anime community, thank you for cutting out the middle-man! You see, by that logic, since im physically a male and i look female (even when i dont do anything to change my appearance tbh), i would be a trap. But im not, im a transwoman. This generalization of your community is whats lead to the misuse of the word to harm other people. I dont see how hard it is for you guys to not just use the words under the umbrella term "trap" that has spread to sexualize trans people and justify violence. Even if you say "well dont use it on an irl person", that wont stop people on the edges of the community from using it and spreading it to be misused irl. Just use femboy and crossdresser because calling someone a trap is that on top of calling them someone who is predatory against others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i appreciate the support but keeping it around the way this community here wants it to remain still keeps very open misuse and honestly i think only victims of the word should be allowed to use it or permit it's use, just like the n word and people of color. You may say it wasnt made with this intention but the n word was used to just refer to a black person when it was only "negro", like how crossdresser and femboy were meant to be. And then slang developed and people started to say the hard R, this is when the misuse began and it was morally banned to be said by anyone but the victimizes minority (unless permitted by the victims). Just like how trap became misused slang to attack another minority, trans people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) you're fucking stupid he showed you the head trans subreddit talking about how trap is a slur 2) you're also fucking stupid because im a transwoman who has been fetishized as a trap by people of the anime community and i wholly agree the word has become a slur 3) you're also very dumb because the t word has had an evolution similar to that of the n word. negro (means black in spanish) was used by african americans to refer to themselves and im sure peacefully used in the white communities that werent racist. Later on slang developed where people started using n****r to refer to black people with no ill intent. After that this term became a weapon by racists to target people of color and attack them. As a result it as been banned for use by everyone but the targeted minority. Crossdresser and Femboy was used to refer to physical males who dress in feminine attire and was peacefully used (for the most part). Later on slang developed and people started using trap to refer to of crossdressers and femboys, but this was quickly picked up by people with ill intent to throw trans woman under this term's umbrella. Not only that but it was used to justify the trans panic reaction too and has even been successful. As a result it SHOULD be morally banned by all but the minority it refers to, and you can grow a fucking braincell and call the characters femboy and crossdresser. 3) astolfo isnt a trap according to it's definition and his lore. ["He purposefully dresses "as a girl" because he likes cute things."](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Rider_of_Black) it never states he has intention to trick people into thinking he's a woman.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>no of course i dont believe radical leftist communists are destroying the country and trump is the savior lmao, because i know they're crazy to think thats so. But when they *go out of the ordinary* (of batshit crazy) is when they deserve investigation on the integrity of what they're saying. And here that thing is a pattern in trumps behavior against militants of the US they have nothing to gain from straying away from their status quo of sucking trumps dick for 90% of the trump party that watches them</TEXT>

    <TEXT>let me give you a perfect example of where this arguement fails though, currently in california proposition 209 enforces the state to focus on income rather than race, although that sounds good one must remember that [minorities such as american indians, alaskan natives, and blacks make up a majority of the poor in america](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.html#:~:text=By%20race%2C%20the%20highest%20national,poverty%20rate%20of%2017.6%20percent.) and it is historically evident that through a facade of good intentions, removing affirmative action has [done more harm than good](https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/06/21/affirmative-action-ban-at-uc-15-years-later/amp/) . btw remember this is % of applicants accepted, why should it ever be inequal across races if we are supposed to be equal? this is the part where i get downvoted to oblivion and back</TEXT>

    <TEXT>im not stating they're on the same level, you're the one trying to enforce that. I am saying the people should have a voice, right or wrong, about *public monuments* of historic figures. The only thing i see done wrong is just smashing museum windows, which isnt rlly much. You shouldnt let your emotions get in the way of what should be equivocal views, hold them wholly or forfeit your credibility.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>i support freedom of speech, im sorry that you dont. Maybe you should look into ensuring an educated public to know for sure that they are aware of what they're fighting against, it has failed many minorities. Ps: if you think them "silencing" opposers at protests is a threat, how about you look at the actually violent groups against their opposers, [read page 17 of the pdf of the first link by the official department of homeland security](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/10/06/department-homeland-security-releases-homeland-threat-assessment)</TEXT>

There are some really great doctors though that have performed surgeries that look literally identical to a cis person's genetalia and the recipient still can recieve pleasure.

Would this be economic progressivism social conservatism? is there any ideology that fits that?</TEXT>
