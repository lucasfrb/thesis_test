    <TEXT>Currently doing a Viitorul CM and loving it. Never touched the Romanian league before but it #8217;s turned out to be a little bit of a challenge with the limited budget at the start of each season, a lot of fun overall though. Also made it so I can only sign south-eastern european for realism and simming all the games. Re-signed Hagi in S5 and in the R32 in the Europa League for the first time. Life is good</TEXT>
