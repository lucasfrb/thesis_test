    <TITLE>Questions about Intimidation (RAW)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-10-12 07:19:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'd like to discover why Intimidation is ever picked over Persuasion (a skill that doesn't leave NPCs with negative feelings toward the character). The Charisma (Intimidation) skill is a social interaction skill that players often try to use in combat to Frighten creatures. As far as I can tell this is based on DM fiat rather than any RAW rule that permit that use of Intimidation. The only rules I see related to it are based on getting creatures to change behaviours out of combat. The questions: 1. What can you do, RAW, with Intimidation, in a combat situation (if anything)? 2. What racial features work with Intimidation (e.g. Kalashtar in Eberron can get Advantage on Intimidate checks)? 3. What class features work with Intimidation? 4. What feats make use of Intimidation (e.g. Dragon Fear from Xanathar's)? 5. I know that Friendship and Enhance Ability can give Advantage on Charisma checks (including Intimidation) but do any spells interact with Intimidation at all?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>iPad as monitor for Linux?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-15 15:21:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just searched the subreddit and didn #8217;t find a recent duplicate, apologies if I #8217;ve missed one. I have an Intel NUC running Ubuntu and I don #8217;t want to set up SSH for it. At the moment I just log in via a normal setup with it plugged in to a monitor. However I #8217;m downsizing and ideally I #8217;d like to use my iPad Pro as the monitor. The Ubuntu server runs a few websites so latency isn #8217;t an issue, so I could VNC into it with TeamViewer or something (presumably). However I #8217;d rather use my iPad Pro as a monitor if I can. I #8217;m concerned that when I reboot the server I won #8217;t be able to VNC in automatically without leaving it as very insecure. Is this possible at all? I #8217;ve looked at Duet Display but it doesn #8217;t mention anything about running on Wine. I don #8217;t mind apps with one off payments, I don #8217;t want to pay a subscription though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>GUI access to Ubuntu</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-06 08:30:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>I run Ubuntu on an Intel NUC to act as a web server. I'm about to get rid of my desktop monitor, which I currently use to access the Ubuntu GUI environment (it's the default for 18.04). I want to avoid SSH access for a number of reasons - I only locally access my server at the moment. I have a laptop and an iPad Pro. What are the most elegant ways to connect to my Ubuntu device, that are robust to power outages (I'm a bit worried about relying on RDP in case there's a problem I need to fix). My question could easily be phrased as "how can I use a laptop or an iPad Pro as an external monitor for Ubuntu" but I figure someone here may have dealt with a similar issue and have a good resolution. My backup position is buying a small external portable monitor, but I'd like to have less stuff than more stuff.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The article is much more thoughtful than the headline, unsurprisingly. Brexit *has* revealed an utter failure of British politicians to think ahead (Cameron), to get to grips with a problem (May), to be honest (Hammond), and it has culminated in Johnson. Throughout it all it has exposed the gulf in social differences and participation between those who benefit from the status quo and those who do not. And it could only have happened this way during a period when the Opposition is an utter shambles. I don't think Britain is weak and helpless, certainly not as weak as many other Remainers say, but we do very much need to work out what we want to do with our country and get a (sizeable) majority to agree on it. Maybe the world's business centre is what we want. Maybe we do need to lower immigration and revisit the benefits and flaws of multiculturalism. Maybe we need to accept that greydawn is coming and increase immigration but put more effort into assimilation. I don't know the answer, but it's clear that we as a country need to work through schisms far larger than Brexit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, but the actual position the EU needs to agree on is: Do the lives of Kurds outweigh our strategic relationship with Turkey and 4% of our EU foreign trade, with the knock on effects on our voters? It becomes a harder position to get unanimous agreement on if you assume that EU trade to Turkey is not evenly split amongst all EU members, but that certain members benefit more from it (therefore suffer more from reducing it) than others, so will be less willing to adopt a position to restrict trade with Turkey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agree with a lot of other posts, particularly that it's about power gaming. My experience of it is that it is often shaped by people watching TV or reading books, and wanting to play *the* hero instead of *a hero*. D amp;D is a game where every player should be on an level playing field. Often these "my theme is X" aren't even intentionally power gaming, they are trying to find a way to replicate the power of the character they imagine (sometimes but not always lifted off something else) in a way that fulfils their narrative expectations. When they see the barbarian with full Eldritch Knight casting rules whilst raging on plate, they don't think "that's ridiculous", they think "that's so awesome, it's like X from my favourite show ... my character will be so cool!" What they don't realise is that other players who take normal characters can easily come to resent the overpowered homebrew, and have no interest in picking a janky class from D amp;Dwiki.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not in any way a relevant comparison. The EU has grand strategic goals (in as much as that's possible for an organisation with so many stakeholder groups) that require it to not give ground to the UK. Key amongst these are deterring other organisations from leaving the EU, showing solidarity with constituent EU nations, and maintaining the costs and benefits of the Single Market and Customs Union. It's also not suggesting it will close borders to the UK - no-one anywhere has said that *they* will build any kind of physical block for trade. Meanwhile, the issue with Turkey is about whether the EU will permit Turkey to ethnically cleanse non-EU people without a struggle, or risk blocking the borders, blocking trade, and having Turkey funnel millions of refugees into the EU at a time when that's politically difficult. The situations are only analogous in the sense that they involve the EU and a third party.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This. Encounter balance assumes full heal ups between encounters in the DMG. You don't even need all of the 4-6 encounters of 8 to be fights: they can be skill tests where the players get to use resources for a benefit of some kind. You also don't need the PCs to feel at risk of death every fight. Healing Spirit helps the pace of the game, and ultimately lets players keep on doing active hero stuff rather than spend hours messing around with Goodberry. There's also a strong argument that a highly efficient out-of-combat heal is more of a spell slot tax on a class than it is a benefit: the caster is obliged to do use level 2 spell slots on it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At this point, it barely matters. The UK and our fractured politics has meant we have negotiated poorly. The price has been driven up by the incompetence of our own politicians. And make no mistake, we will pay a price either way. If we leave the EU it will be an economic price. If we remain, the price will be a growth of populism that will far overshadow the benefits of remaining in the EU. A likely Johnson victory and a generational retreat for progressivism, as all parties rush to the bottom. Still, in ten years I'd rather be in the EU and see the end of the Labour Party, than be out of the EU.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're absolutely right - it should not be beyond the wit of man (or even government) to create a system that lets you enter relevant data and then tell you which routes are available to you for staying in the UK and the costs and implications of those routes (e.g. "you will need to travel outside the borders of the UK for three weeks per year" or "you will need to be resident and pay taxes in the UK for at least nine months in every year for ten years"). Building up the scenarios for that would take a fortune in expert legal advice and you'd want to test it thoroughly ... but it would probably pay for itself within a decade and let the HO focus on verifying the data entered.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mainly the foreign policy section which is less sovereignty than we have now. If you're a Brexiteer wanting to know why the deal is bad, you can read about it on the Eurosceptic Bruges Group website instead of the Grauniad. Quote follows. https://www.brugesgroup.com/blog/the-revised-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration-a-briefing-note 5. and 6. Prevents independent military action The Treaty permanently restricts the UK's sovereignty by preventing the UK from taking "any action likely to conflict with or impede" EU foreign policy (Article 129(6)). It is instructive that this contrasts with almost all the other sub-sections of Article 129 - each of which include language limiting them to the duration of the transition period. It is also very revealing in the Political Declaration that critical parts of the section on foreign policy and security are not reciprocal. For example, para 99 confirms that the future relationship will not "prejudice the decision-making autonomy of the EU" but no such language is afforded to the UK - we are merely permitted to "maintain the right to determine how [to respond] to any invitation to participate in operations or missions". Additionally, in the Political Declaration the parties "agree to consider" security collaboration in the European Defence Agency, the European Defence Fund and PESCO "to the extent possible under [EU law]" (para 102(c)) which is a prescriptive obligation and not merely a permissive option. Despite making payments to the European Defence Agency during the transition period, British troops in EU battlegroups will not be led by British staff officers (Articles 129(7) and 156-157).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've read the plans for it and the forecasts, which is as much as anyone can really have an idea of it. The point isn't that No Deal is good, or acceptable, or anything like that. The point is that more years of paralysis will destroy our political system. Labour can't pretend they care about the poor if they don't try to get rid of the Conservatives - there are only so many speeches about the bloody swathe cut by austerity that can be made, before people will say "well you don't care enough to risk an election". The Conservatives will likewise lose their legitimacy. The next election will quite possibly have one of the lowest voter turnouts in years, due to distrust and disgust with politicians, creating ripe ground for the Brexit Party to win enough seats to have a say in policy. The longer this affair drags on, unless politicians discover some previously untapped backbone to go for Revoke, the more likely we will get No Deal by accident and extremist politicians of both wings in Parliament. No Deal is very bad, but there are many things that are far worse. And only someone completely unable to see the bigger picture, and with a crippling lack of imagination, could think otherwise.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's sad, but true. New Labour elicited votes from authoritarians (the kind of people who'd vote Leave, by most analysis) and social progressives. That was a powerful electoral grouping that Tony Blair was able to keep together. Subsequent leaders have been less authoritarian (to their credit, in my eyes) but it's left the party with just social progressives. And both the Lib Dems and the Tories also try to attract social progressives, because by and large those people are financially comfortable and interested only in small changes to the status quo. This has left the poorer authoritarian voters with no party to represent them (rich authoritarians had a natural home in Theresa May's Tory party, she loved her authoritarian legislation). TBP offer a home for these voters, and I suspect the Tories will suffer less than Labour from the party standing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This book is a level of power creep unseen even by Hexblade Warlocks, it will need to be excluded from the +1 rule. Some parts of it seem reasonable. Some parts, such as letting Bards and Sorcerers pick new spells on a Long Rest, beggar belief. That substantially negates the value of being a Wizard, simply because you won't often need X utility spell, so the once-per-day limit is not important. In particular it seems to me that it removes the downside of the Divine Sorcerer, which is limited spell slots. I'm also distinctly disappointed that Champion got no love, and Battle Master - the most played type - got more love.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Obviously. However, Sorcerers have some great features, and don't forget they can get spells back on an action, not on a short rest. At 20, they also get four sorcery points back per short rest: so really they aren't losing that much. Let's look at Divine Soul. As well as metamagic and sorcery points and a spell list to kill for, they get +2d4 on a failed save or attack roll once/short rest, permaflight, and bonus action to return half their lost hit points once/long rest. I'll ignore Empowered Healing because it's weak, and contests sorcery point usage. That's not "no class features"Plus, and this is the kicker, they base off Charisma which means they can win at the social pillar as well as the combat pillar, and also multi class effectively. Those things are almost as good as Wizard features (and better than the weak Wizard archetypes), plus metamagic is amazing for action economy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Undoubtedly, but Concentration is the limit on caster power that was badly needed to balance this edition. That said, in its current form it is weak. But if it wasn't Concentration, it would be too powerful at higher levels. There isn't a good mechanic for squaring this circle in 5E. If I could add one, I'd rather like there to be two Concentration slots, one for self-only buffs and one for any buff that can't affect the caster (or use them both for multiple target spells that include the caster). Then casters couldn't be doubly selfish, but also we would see more use of spells that simply can not justify their Concentration slot in the current game. Alas ...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If any multi class is grim with new Ranger 1, it's Monk. Wisdom modifier, Concentration-free Hunter's Mark and Flurry of Blows. That's a regular 1d6 extra damage per attack with three regular attacks from level 5. Four attacks at the cost of a Ki. Plus you can add in hilarious things like the use of the Whip as a martial arts weapon that scales up in damage and has Finesse and Reach. I'd guess overall you'd want Fighter 1 for Duelling and Ranger 1 for Hunter's Mark. At level 17 Monk you may as well swap the Longsword out for a Whip to get Reach. Alternatively do Cleric or Druid 1 for cantrips and spells, and wield your Longsword in two hands for d10 damage (Versatile). One point of damage less than Fighter 1's Duelling style, but I would probably go Forge Cleric 1 because you can make your Longsword a +1 Longsword (makes up for loss of Duelling entirely, in fact gets you a +1 overall) and cast your choice of Bless, Protection from Evil and Good, or Shield of Faith (since Hunter's Mark doesn't take your Concentration). Kensai gives you a sweet +2 AC boost and you can't dip two levels into Diviner for Portent Quivering Palm because you're Ranger, so may as well do Kensai. Overall this gets you a great set of stats and even with early dips (probably going Monk 1-5, Ranger 1, Cleric 1, Monk X) you'll get all your defining bits and bobs early. It's just as MAD as a normal monk with one less ASI (that ASI hurts, but oh well) since every class needs either DEX or WIS.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Going to have to disagree with the basic contention here: power creep is throughout this document, and it doesn't fix some of the biggest issues. It also makes the huge mistake Wizards of the Coast made with Hexblades: the changes are far too front loaded (including Ranger) which means they're making more attractive dips instead of more attractive classes. This is a better Ranger, but Favoured Foe needs to scale with Ranger level somehow. As, probably, does Beast Master.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your thesis: the UA is not merely power creep, and it offers value by making classes more attractive. My rebuttal: the UA is merely power creep, because it just makes class dips attractive. It doesn't make it more attractive to stay in the traditional "dip" classes, like Champion, but makes Ranger attractive as a dip rather than an ongoing choice. So yes: I believe it's just power creep.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The only reason I didn't say "definitely" is because I haven't worked out yet what the value of a Bonus Action is in the new UA world. It seems like having it on a Beast Master pet is good, but plenty of the top tier DPS builds already rely on their Bonus Action - so this just may make Beast Master an attractive dip. It's also not clear whether that Bonus Action Maul attack counts as the Companion taking the Attack action (so it gets two attacks at level 11) or not. Unfortunately they've twisted themselves into such hilarious knots with their definitions of "attack", "Attack", etc that we will need to wait for clarity on whether this Bonus Action attack is like a Booming Blade attack (you make a lower class attack that isn't an Attack action) or whether it's an Attack action.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your post text is that your thesis is that we shouldn't dismiss the UA *just* because it's power creep. But alright: let's take your title thesis, as opposed to your post thesis. Is there anything inherently wrong with power creep? Yes. Yes there is. In your terms, this UA creates *party imbalance*. It does so by making multi-class more attractive. One of the joys of 5E when released (pre-Hexblade) was that there wasn't much of a power differential between single class builds and multi-class builds. Sorcadins and Diviner/x combos to force failed saves were there, but they didn't overshadow the plain old Battle Master. There were some weak archetypes, and archetypes that are best used for dips (Champions, Warlocks), but only original Ranger was truly gimped. XGTE increased Ranger spell support so they became less bad at high level, but it added Hexblade, increasing the power of Charisma based multi-class. And that's where party imbalance becomes a problem. A perfect system allows flavourful character customisation with straightforward characters not being far behind highly customised characters. The single class character should not be left in the shade by the multi-class dip monster. But that's exactly what this UA encourages. Avoiding this is usually achieved by spreading class benefits out across the levels, ensuring class benefits synergise with each other, and giving the class a solid capstone. Cleric is a perfect example of a good class: it has spells that scale well, and the capstone is guaranteed Divine Intervention. It's worth taking Cleric to 20. Rogue is another great class: decent combat damage output, good survivability, good utility. Druid is a much ropier class, and that's because of its capstone. Unlimited Wild Shape is very powerful for Moon Druids, but meaningless for any Druid archetype that doesn't get value from Wild Shape uses. Wizard is a good class, but the capstone is so bad that there's no value in taking the last two levels instead of a two level dip in some other class (a full spellcaster one, preferably, to keep slots). Warlock with Eldritch Blast invocations, Champion with increased crit range, etc just invite dips. This UA does not spread internally synergistic abilities across the levels: it front loads externally synergistic abilities. In the case of Ranger, it front loads them to a similar extent that Warlock does. Playing a standard published campaign? A Wood Elf Kensai 5, UA Ranger 1, Forge Cleric 1 will hit superpower at level 7 and cruise through for the last 3 to 5 levels of the campaign. It will certainly create massive party imbalance compared to a single classed Fighter, or Monk, that doesn't take those dips. This puts us back in the situation we had in 4E and 3E, where system knowledge and character planning are going to have a huge impact on in-game party balance. That's not one of the design goals of 5E - in fact I'm fairly sure it's something they want to avoid. This means the UA is power creep, and power creep *is* bad. If everyone is more powerful, you've just made bigger numbers: congratulations, you've recreated the 4E treadmill and feat taxes. If only people with great system knowledge are more powerful, you've just ruined party balance: congratulations, you've recreated the 3E splatbookocalypse. I do think this kind of activity (replacements for core class features) does need to happen. For sure there are classes that really lack things (Champions and stuff to do outside combat; Ranger Natural Explorer and Favoured Enemy features are too specific; etc). But this UA is going to reinforce existing problems, not fix them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe, but I don't think there is even that level of thought. Let's take the new Favoured Enemy. They could easily change this: you get two casts at level 1, and one additional cast at level 6 and level 10. That's going to be almost as good for most Rangers as the existing wording (most Rangers won't start with more than +2 Wis modifier) and it will reward them for staying with the class. It makes the ability less attractive for a dip. In a similar fashion, Hexblade should have given the +Cha mod for attack and damage at level 6.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not been my experience at all, which has been at all levels. Sorcerers are Cha based, so have an automatic leg up in social encounters over Wizards. Sensible spell choices mean that you'll always have the spells you need 90% of the time. Maybe they don't excel at the Exploration pillar, but most of the time they are just as good as Wizards, unless the Wizard has had time to Long Rest and the opportunity to buy the relevant niche spells. Not to mention the fact that the ability to twin Polymorph or Invisibility is actually a huge boost for non-combat encounters. So is Subtle Spell, plus that means they can't be Counterspelled. Sorcerers don't need love. They are absolutely where they should be, in the hands of a competent caster. All they lack is the ability to be flavourful with their spells picks (e.g. Storm Sorcerer is lacking) ... but mostly, so do Wizards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's ... that's not how objectivity or the truth works. It is more likely to mean that people don't pick their spells well or with sufficient flexibility. People will often want their characters to be *more* powerful. That's just the way people are. People who pick Sorcerers are *choosing* to not have flexibility of spell choice because they get power. The fact that they want to avoid paying the price of that choice does *not* mean that it's an unfair price. Put it this way: I already see far fewer Wizards than Sorcerers. In the discussions about the UA with the big player pool I play with, which is full of optimisers, people are already discussing retiring two of the three wizards in current campaigns and switching to Sorcerer, because there's *no point in being a Wizard*. The exception is the mid level Illusionist, because the player just got level 14 and wants to play around with that ability before deciding.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right - but that's the choice you made taking Sorcerer instead of Wizard. Most of the time as a Wizard you won't be using those niche spells either. Variety of Sorcerer spell is an issue with the class, but there has to be some cost to the sheer overwhelming power given by metamagic and the sorcery point system. This UA makes the choices basically irrelevant. That's not a good way to approach it. If the problem is that Sorcerers can't pick flavour spells, a way to address this is to adopt something similar to Domain spells for Clerics. Extra specific sets of spells they can know, based on a theme. Want to be Acid Sorcerer? You know some Acid spells, for free. However in almost every instance you'll find that people just want to pick *more* of the *best* spells, not a list of themed spells.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not valuable for damage. There's a relatively narrow window for attack rolls that make Sharpshooter's damage boost worth the -5 to hit, and the more base damage you do with an attack, the narrower that window becomes. This change makes the feat damage effect (virtually) always worse than not using the feat (exceptions being if you will still hit on a 2+ after the penalty, or if you only hit on a critical). At any other time you won't want to use the damage portion. You may still want it for hitting at long range and ignoring cover.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The fact that it's a Battle Master with Precise Shot makes this even worse. Firstly, remember that except against something with a very high or very low AC, the difference between hitting and missing is still going to be ~25% over him being a Battle Master and *not* using Sharpshooter (that just shifts the window by an amount dependent on level). Secondly remember, if you have to use Precision Attack to hit, then you're not able to do extra damage with the superiority dice. In this case, you're adding an average based of 4.5 to hit (less than the Sharpshooter penalty of -5) to gain an average of 4.5 damage with a Longbow. So in damage terms this feat is worthless until at least level 10, when your Superiority die adds an average of 5.5 to hit in exchange for 4.5 damage ... but wait! You could instead use the dice to add 5.5 damage with an extra effect using a different manoeuvre. OP has to be using a ranged weapon that does a higher damage dice than his superiority dice for it to ever be worth using this feat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Starting point: Porter's Value Chain, https://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/About-BMM/ , or whatever equivalent you already have. Identify the processes your senior management agree (or have signed off) as your most important processes (these will usually be the added value processes). Then: double check your processes with a sensible structure. The APQC has a great set of standard processes and a few industry versions (https://www.apqc.org/ ). These won't have the things that are very specific to your business, that's where the starting point comes in. Then work through as time and resource allows. One thing you need to think about upfront is *how are you going to model these* and capture information. You don't want to have to re-do this work, so you want to get the information into an accessible format and (ideally) one that supports measurements and quality control, so later on you can do business optimisation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That's not a progressive tax. There's no way to opt out of it, or insulate those on benefits from it. Progressive taxes are ones where we can ensure the wealthiest pay more, and the poorest pay less - which we can't achieve with this. There may be a case for nationalising infrastructure where there is no real competition (almost all transport comes under this banner, as does OpenReach although some cable companies deliver their own fibre). But don't pretend it's free, and don't pretend that this is a progressive way of paying for it.</TEXT>

My point is that this broadband tax is not a progressive income tax, because the companies funding it will recoup their losses by increasing advertising costs, and the companies paying for advertising will increase the cost of goods or services. Because goods and services are consumed by everyone, this is going to be regressive for the same reason that VAT is regressive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What?! "Could not say if it had an effect" and "not quantifiable" is ... meaningless, given you can never know if you've seen all the relevant information. That just tells us that the investigators took the time to look for an effect (presumably prioritising the most likely evidence first) and found nothing. I sincerely hope this is because they couldn't make a definitive statement about cause and effect, and not just that they realised social media reinforces bias rather than changing it. Bots on Twitter sharing propaganda is evidence of activity, but not evidence of impact. If this is it, Grieve is going to look like an idiot and so are No. 10.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's no evidence (that I've seen at all) that social media can change peoples' pre-existing biases. I've seen some evidence that it can reinforce them, but not change them. Logically it will be harder to change someone's politics than their choice of toothpaste. The only way to test this that I can think of would be to identify some areas of the UK with stable opinions about some issue, do a local sustained blitz on social media about that issue, and then measure the opinions again across the same group of people. Whilst all the while ensuring it's a blind study where the participants don't know what they are being studied for. There are similar efforts in brand loyalty but our choice of vote and politics are likely stable (they are parts of our identity). Whereas unless you're from Yorkshire and morally obliged to claim that literally everything from Yorkshire is better than anything created outside Yorkshire, your choice of specific consumer product won't key into your identity (although wealth demonstrations are part of our identity, I'd guess that millionaires could probably be swayed from a Rolls Royce to a Bentley or Aston Martin without being threatened).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I vote based on three things, and roughly in this order. Support for a free and independent press; reduction of inequality and promotion of equal opportunity; and otherwise a reduction in the number of laws related to social control (e.g. I'd like to end the war on drugs and focus on treatment and rehab). I'd also like to stop Brexit, though that's only because I think it makes the above more likely to happen. I can't vote Tory - Theresa May was one of the most authoritarian PMs I know of. I can't vote Labour - they think they can legislate human behaviour, and they're going to create more problems than they fix. I could vote Green - but they don't have a sensible policy for moving to environmental sustainment, it's too idealistic and not pragmatic. I can vote LibDem - despite their support for Leveson, they mostly support things I agree with. I'm not tribal, I'd move to Labour if it promoted policies I agree with. But under Corbyn it's about more state control, not less. Even though I probably have a lot in common with many Labour voters when it comes to ends, I absolutely don't agree with the means.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't have an explanation. Inaccurate polls? A gradual shift resulting in people who thought there was no purpose in voting, seeing that they could win? The strongest Leave trait correlate is authoritarianism: maybe authoritarians were more mobilised by the Leave campaigns than liberals were by the Remain ones? The trouble is simply that correlation does not indicate causation. Increased social media bot activity on Twitter or whatever may have motivated a bunch of old authoritarians to change their minds and vote Leave, but we aren't even sure how many of them use Twitter let alone how to work out how many of them changed their minds.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; If anybody should be believed here, perhaps it's the person who ran the successful Leave campaign, who credited (among other things) a strong social media campaign for the result. This sub tends to be emphatic about Cummings' limitations as a thinker, an organiser, and indeed any other positive quality. The NHS bus may have had a big impact. That doesn't mean Twitter bots changed peoples' minds. Too many people are buying blindly into the claims of social media advertisers - including Cambridge Analytica - about their capacity for changing hearts and minds. The onus is on those making the claim to provide **robust evidence**.  gt; We know Russia interfered in the referendum, and we cannot say with any certainty that they did not change the result by doing so. How does one prove a negative? I don't want to plough on, I want to revoke. However it is important that we own that revoke and not pretend we have cast-iron evidence that The Bad People Made Us Do It. We need to own, accept and understand that Britain in 2016 wasn't working for people. A lot of people. And then make the case that the best way to address their concerns - real or imaginary - is Revoke, because then we have political bandwidth to fix the massive problems we have.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just this. Sorcerers are already the most combat-useful casters by a country mile (Quicken, Twinned and Subtle spell guarantee this). Giving them what will effectively work out as access to more spells (I've never seen a game where the Wizard can buy even a quarter of their spells and learn them) is just ridiculous. Not to mention the benefit of being Charisma based (all social skills) instead of Intelligence based (a few knowledge skills, where the Rogue will already have Expertise in Investigation, and virtually no monsters force INT saves). This change just permits Sorcerers to escape all consequence of spell choice. As many others have said, the correct fix is to give each Sorcerer bloodline a set of free spells that they always know, to allow easier theming for characters. As for whether this is an optional rule: all that matters is whether it's AL legal. That's the point where the designers are meant to be doing the most to balance the game. If it is, congratulations on spawning yet more Hexblade 1/Paladin 2/Sorcerer X characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let me summarise the relevant part of your last two posts to my question: . Doesn't look good for you or your defence, does it? And I don't care whether you do, or do not, approve of the word "whataboutery". It's a recognised term. Just to make it super clear: I think all of the political parties are full of opportunistic con artists who will say anything for a taxpayer funded salary and gold plated pension. Most of their policies seem to have been designed without any kind of understanding of second order consequences. It is my unwanted task, when choosing between them, to pick the party I find least offensive and put a tick in their box. Amidst the constant political bleating coming from all sides, the only thing that is noticeably nausea-inducing is the rank and rotten stench of holier-than-thou self-righteousness. And that's what comes out when people say "oh, but Y just tea-bagged a goat on live TV, ignore the fact that candidate X was caught licking seats!" Instead of saying "oh but candidate X repented" and getting defensive when I ask if that was before or after it became convenient to repent (because, if he only repented after his views became public, it casts doubt on his credibility) ... just own it. Just say "yes, his views were abhorrent, I cannot defend him." I'm probably going to vote Lib Dem and you know what? Their case to be in the debates was a joke. Jo Swinson is not going to be PM, and I feel embarrassed when I watch her pretend she will. Some Lib Dem candidates are terrible, and I still remember Jenny Tonge and David Ward and Lord Rennard - all of whom should have been kicked out of the party (not that I'm a member of the Lib Dems). But I'm not pretending the Lib Dems are a good party, I'm just operating on the knowledge that they are the least awful one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You're being deliberately obtuse. If someone only recants their past statements when those past statements cause them problems, then the recanting is much less plausible. It looks like they have not changed their opinion because of some moral revelation, but because it was convenient to do so - which means that maybe they haven't changed their opinion at all. If Milani had recanted months before he was a candidate, I would have given him the benefit of the doubt - hence why I asked when he recanted. And out of the two of us, you're the one that has repeatedly refused to accept that the party you're going to vote for is flawed. You seem to be yet another Labour cultist.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That thread is somewhat negated by the fact that Spell Storing now requires the creature to use its Concentration. Edit: also Tiny Servants are INT 2. That's as intelligent as a hamster. Any DM that permits you to layer conditionals for a general action such as "if an enemy comes within five feet" or "push button and point rod at the target I somehow designate" is being exceptionally generous. Use of a mental command as a bonus action seems more likely for the offence spells, but I don't see "press button to Warding Bond if the servant to your left dies" as viable. Although since overflow damage goes onto the original item, a Tiny Servant made with an Adamantine Heart is a lot more robust than the 10hps it comes with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not just the porn thing: there are many other bills Theresa May has put forward. Why take just the one item out of the three to argue against? Why claim that legal aid is absent, instead of reduced or diminished? Besides, Theresa May was absent during the vote on LASPO to which you seem to be referring. Jo Swinson voted for it, but Theresa was busy being Home Secretary (possibly deporting someone at the time, who knows). There's certainly no indication that Theresa May would have voted against it, had she been present. The rest of her voting record doesn't indicate so: https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10426/theresa_may/maidenhead/divisions?policy=6707 So whilst you can choose and prioritise one facet of liberalism and arbitrarily decide that it's more important than all of the others ... even that isn't a convincing argument that Theresa May is more liberal, when your evidence is absence at a particular vote.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The big problem for theoretical Artificer 3/Wizard X is that the Wizard capstone is really at 18, and you don't get as much from Artificer 3 as you do Wizard 18. This more or less negates extended campaign Artificer multiclass. For example, you could go Tempest Cleric 2/Diviner X to make someone fail their save against a maximised Lightning Bolt whilst using heavy armour and a shield - far superior to Artificer. I'd be interested in working out a Battle Smith Artificer/Arcane Archer, because one of Arcane Archer's flaws is that it needs DEX plus CON plus INT plus feats. Battle Smith would just need INT plus CON. But I've not spotted much synergy so far.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No-one said they didn't have common ground, in fact I specifically said they correlated. That's a bad strawman even by the standards of this sub. The Tories also don't represent the working man, and I haven't claimed that they do, but they are more socially conservative and many working class people are socially conservative. This should be fairly obvious, even to an ideologue such as yourself, based on all of the sociological studies that show how higher education levels correlate with social progressiveness. This means that there are two parties, both competing to spend money, one of which has social values broadly more similar than the other. And there is absolutely no uncomfortable truth in the Labour pledges we have seen for this election: that's the biggest reach I've seen here in a while.</TEXT>

Even what you have dribbled into your comment is flawed. You talk about "net benefit" to which the obvious counterpoint is "okay, let's raise the net benefit by making sure we only let in people who don't need any kind of state support." There are any number of moral arguments about why that shouldn't be our stance as a nation (it's surely our responsibility to share rights as best we can with refugees) but by dodging that and weasel wording your point, you've already made yourself sound dishonest. Congratulations, that's why the Tories can chunter on about points based systems. Combine that with your utter inability to admit any kind of fault on Labour's part and your constant straw manning when you get called out, it's yet another example of why the Tories are ahead of Labour. They don't own many of their mistakes, but they at least own some - and with less self-righteousness.</TEXT>

I was condemning Labour's love of gesture attempts that focus more on their own ideals (the Red Badge reference), *not* engaging with different voter demographics. In this case: Grime4Labour is good, right? It engaged some voters. But then they abandoned it and didn't build links. And they're also not working on reconnecting with their traditional voters. The party appears obsessed with "the new shiny", things that play well to True Believers in Westminster (not so much the PLP, but the various other accreted staff brought in in Corbyn's wake). All these things take energy and focus, but they're not delivering or maintaining things. One particular weathervane for this is going to be the relationship between Labour and the Trades Unions. What happens there after the election I suspect will represent the battle for the soul of Labour, between social progressives and Labour's traditional voters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why do they need saving? It's already within a DM's power to say "of course you can trade out that spell that's never used". Or, indeed, "that spell sucks, but it's key to your background. You can have it without it counting against your spells known - pick another." Creating a set of rules that are wholly unnecessary doesn't benefit anyone. If your DM accepts optional variants, they would have accepted the change anyhow. What really matters is whether these are default accepted in Adventurers' League ... and they shouldn't be. They skew the game very heavily.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As my post made clear, the complaint is that they are unnecessary - unless they're planned for inclusion in Adventurers' League. AL is as close as the game gets to the concept of approximate balance between classes. If it's not going into AL, then it's up to any DM and the rules aren't needed at all. Just add a note somewhere reminding DMs that they can let characters change class feature choices (most DMs are probably happy to do this). If it is going into AL, then it's a terrible instance of game design because it won't address fundamental issues with the classes, and it further puts Charisma-based spellcasters ahead of the power curve. Ultimately it comes down to whether or not you think class balance is an important thing. If you don't think it matters, then of course Spell Versatility is great. It doesn't matter if your game becomes 95% Bards and Sorcerers with two level Warlock dips, because that's not what you care about. If you do think class balance is important, then this gives Bards and Sorcerers *more* access to spells than Wizards (no need to scribe scrolls), class features that are fantastic (as described above, action economy efficiency with metamagics, or the many Bard features). Wizards having flexibility over spells to prepare *was* their main class feature, and this gives that to all other classes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I disagree. Classes with proficiency in INT saves only use those against three monsters in the base Monster Manual. There's no inherent problem in adding INT based saves to the game: in balance terms, it needs it. However they definitely need to be in line with other spells, e.g. no SuperTasha's. Psionicist Blast is about right: smaller area of effect than Cone of Cold, less damage even if pumped up to be an equal spell level, but easier to land.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Great post. I agree with most of it (particularly the Hexblade mockery), but I am curious to know why you think the Wizard capstone is good. Two extra level 3 spell slots per short rest is okay (I would guess that in most cases these will be Counterspell plus Hypnotic Pattern), but is it as good as (for example) a two level dip in Cleric? Tempest Cleric 2, Diviner 18 is a favourite of mine and I'd trade Heavy Armour, maximised Lightning damage when I can use Portent to force a failed save, and access to Guidance for the Wizard capstone - plus you benefit from them for a lot longer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>5E is well balanced as long as you stick to its assumptions. Unfortunately, one of these assumptions is 6-8 resource draining encounters per long rest - and that becomes hard, tiring work as campaigns climb above level 5 (when casters get Plant Growth), again at 9 (Wall of Force) and all levels above 13 (shenanigans levels). Fighters do the best single target damage but only come into their own in long fights, where other classes can't blow all their resources with impunity. There's a tendency to only have a few, important fights at high levels - just so games aren't hour upon hour of combat - and that rewards Long Rest resource classes and hurts the others (particularly Champion). The way to balance the current game is to buff up the Social and Exploration pillars for no rest and Short Rest classes. It's not to give Charisma-based casters even more buffs and let them dominate the last pillar that they didn't already totally dominate (Exploration).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The build is primarily because Wizard has (or had) more options for Lightning damage than Tempest Cleric. Divine Intervention has a 100% chance at level 20, and a 19% chance at level 19. That's a big difference in terms of action economy - essentially it makes it usable in combat. Logically it seems odd, but nothing stops someone just repeatedly blowing actions out of combat to get Divine Intervention: presumably Clerics that hit level 10 often win the lottery, they just need to pray for an average of seven actions to get Divine Intervention.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's quite possible to address the issues in a more refined way. Let's be charitable, and assume the complaints about Sorcerer (objectively the best combat caster class) are not because people want to dodge meaningful choices, but because they can't have a themed spell list and still pick the best combat spells. This can be resolved by adding a small selection of appropriate utility spells and combat spells that aren't normally picked, to each Sorcerer Archetype. This completely addresses the inability to flavour Sorcerers complaint, without deeply changing class relationships. Of course, a player may pick a bad spell (Witch Bolt) ... but they can always discuss that with their DM. If the DM will permit the change, they'll do that regardless of optional rules. That's only a marginal increase in power, but a big increase in ability to customise and flavour Sorcerer. There are no losers, only winners.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no solution. Ultimately people are choosing to look at an ambiguous situation and interpreting it in different ways. The facts are confusing enough to mean there's no obvious "reality". Can surgery and the desire to be something different change our true nature (or reveal a true nature we had all along, even if it was limited to a part of the brain and every other part of our body expressed it differently)? Do we even have a true nature to change? Probably not. For some people, the idea that what people feel can take precedence over external physical reality is simply *baffling*. For others, the imperfect sex-based categorisation of people is less important than allowing people to believe what makes them less unhappy. I'd say this is a fundamental difference in understanding the world and trans issues will probably take longer to be accepted than homosexual relationships: it doesn't require changing a moral attitude, it requires changing the way you interpret reality. Until we get robots to replace every unwanted human interaction, we will continue to experience these clashes. In the meantime, hospital trusts are going to attempt to please everyone (in this case, acceding to the patient's request, telling trans patients they thought it was unacceptable, then apologising to everyone).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right. For the vast majority of the time, the character gets to add +1 to their checks for things that other characters are good at. At the giddy heights of level 9, this is a +2. At level 17, it becomes a +3. Since the Champion is likely proficient in Athletics or Acrobatics, this leaves you as reasonable at ... making arrows? Carving toys? That's hardly mastery of the Exploration pillar. In fact, it doesn't net you Survival or Nature so really there's no Exploration pillar support. It's okay in downtime, if you can't afford your own arrows. Meanwhile Battlemaster gets some unique abilities to size up opponents, with UA showing signs of additional support. The real tragedy of Champion is, of course, that it doesn't get any way to natively add damage dice to its weapon attacks and benefit from its own signature feature, meaning it gets dipped.</TEXT>

Go High Elf, take level 1 in Fighter (hit points and better saves) and the Booming Blade cantrip. Go Rogue 4 (Swashbuckler plus Dexterity ASI) then Fighter 3 Champion. Then just take more Rogue levels. You get the crit range of 19-20, the combat power, and everything.

    <TEXT>You said that I was essentially ignoring the Exploration pillar. That's a strawman, because I'm not doing so at all. I just think that opening doors and jumping is a tiny, uninteresting part of that. My main campaign focuses more on Exploration than anything else. I'm saying half proficiency in STR/DEX/CON checks is barely relevant since most Champions are going to be proficient in Athletics anyway, which covers pretty much every example you've given. Those that aren't will be proficient in Acrobatics, which will cover the rest. That leaves breathing underwater, and Initiative, which isn't an Exploration pillar thing. If it gave the bonus to things like Survival, Nature, Perception, History ... then sure, it would be great for Exploration. It's a terrible ribbon. It would have been better as Jack of All Trades - and that would be coherent with the idea of a Champion as a paragon of the pursuit of personal perfection.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because the truth is often not obvious, or the politician might say something that is technically true but misleading, or they may have been briefed incorrectly or genuinely mistaken. Politicians would start to never depart from the script, they would never speculate, they would never give personal opinions. The second order effect of this would be to totally distance all politicians from seeming like people or from uncontrolled engagement with the voting populace. Every time the Conservatives have been at their most authoritarian, they've ended up legislating the impossible and made an ass of the law (Psychoactive Substances bill springs to mind). There's no way to meaningfully enforce this around any issue that isn't totally clear cut, and it would not result in behaviour that you wanted.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The real trouble with Champion in combat is that, as levels go up, the motivation to run enough fights for a resourceless character to pull their weight reduces. A function of higher level fights taking longer, I guess. They need a way to tack on an extra weapon die. There's also the lack of stuff for it to do outside combat.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>We will see soon. If the Tories want to try to keep Scotland, they need to find a way to intervene in the schools with some kind of taught civics programme so the education system isn't stuffed full of SNP teachers indoctrinating children to think the Tories are evil and the English need to be shunned*. If they don't do that, they're probably happy that independence becomes more popular by the year and eager to get rid of it. * exaggerated for emphasis. I assume somewhere there are teachers who aren't SNP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It does take more than thousands of soldiers, yes. Look at the size of Northern Ireland and the terrain, then look at the size of Scotland and the terrain. It would be a nightmare and the RoE would be so restrictive that even deploying soldiers there would be a nightmare. And many soldiers are from the poorer parts of Scotland - even if they'd take orders to act against other Scots, it would be a horrendous tragedy to ask them to do so (similar to Northern Ireland). Please don't fantasise in any way about using the military in Scotland (or anywhere). Surely the best outcome is for most Scots to want to be in the Union and for Scottish nationalism to disappear. The way to do that is have reasonable social policies, support networks, and get political activists out of teaching jobs so they stop drip-feeding nationalism to the children they are teaching.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That doesn't answer my question about *why* a particular piece of the body is seen as trumping the rest of it. Development order is not as important as how/why we determine primacy. If there's a part of the brain that tells us things are as they are not, why do we treat that as the source of truth? And that makes sense - why change what we want, if we can sort of get what we want? I expect sex reassignment surgery will advance faster than brain re-wiring anyhow, but it would be helpful to provide options.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Physical reality *is* reality. Mental reality is our perception, which goes through whatever filters are in place and which may, or may not, be an accurate representation of reality. I did not say that you should change to make me more comfortable: I asked what the logical basis was for saying that part of a brain's wiring outweighed potentially every other part of a body. As far as I'm concerned, people should be free to live their lives however they want. You're also totally misrepresenting my second point. You essentially asked if I would object to having my personality changed, since I was suggesting that for others. My response is that I don't have an issue with my sexuality that requires changing so the analogy doesn't work. If I had a set of perceptions that was causing me distress, though, and you could change my personality so they didn't cause me distress - then absolutely I would go for that. Finding the world isn't as we want it is understood by many philosophies to be the root of suffering. Zen, Stoicism, etc all focus on accepting what is and changing our wants to match reality. Those are good rules to live by and to reduce suffering. If they came in pill form, I'd take it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Another strawman. Acceptance isn't acceptance of everything, it's accepting what we can control and focusing our energy on that. Allowing our children to die is a ridiculous extrapolation to make. People constantly change - *you* don't really exist at a fundamental level (nor do I). The only difference is the scale of the changes we go through. Chemicals being fired in neurons are just chemicals, they aren't magic.

Being gay doesn't inherently put you at odds with the way things are (excluding society). Being trans does seem to put you at odds with the way things are. I'm totally happy for trans people to pursue whatever path to happiness they see fit. You're right that brain death kills, but brain damage doesn't. Lacking other organs will also kill us though.

    <TEXT>It's hard to be sympathetic to an argument that describes Blair as "liberal": he was for identity cards, ruthless with the press, and had hecklers thrown out of his political meetings. I'd describe him as "authoritarian". Inclined to improving minority rights and reducing discrimination, sure, but there was no sign that he valued individual freedoms over anything else. That said, the decline in family ties (be that through politics, or the simple economic reality of families moving apart to find work); the increase in mental health problems (be that through fracturing support networks, or the filthy polluted cities many children are raised in); and the reduction in stable rewarding livelihoods are causing us woe. The article author could have been more explicit though and just said "Corbyn's Labour prioritised the causes of identity politics over the causes of the working classes" and then looked at polling data to try to make that point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Wars happen under all social systems that we have experienced - including socialism. Healthcare is available in large part because capitalism has enabled investment in medicine. Food has become cheaper and more plentiful under capitalism - to the point where it's causing us issues. But again you seem incapable of actually defending what you're calling for, you're just reversing questions - probably because you know as well as I do that Communism has been so brutal. Let me state it clearly and then I'll be done with this thread: Communism is a disaster, and that's what you're describing. It's just as inhumane as capitalism at capitalism's worst, just as dominated by an  #233;lite, but with the additional disadvantage of believing it's morally right instead of morally destitute.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm new to ChromeOS. Grabbed myself a Lenovo S345 in the sales. It has an A4 chip. I've got it to see if I can move my parents across from their aging Windows laptops to something cheap and cheerful. One does nothing other than emails and web browsing. Chromebook can easily do this if I can just get over the technical hurdle of it being slightly different to the existing Windows PC. The other does karaoke via SingSnap. I tried logging in to that benighted site via my Chromebook and although I could listen to recordings, it demanded installation of the Android app to make new recordings. I duly went to the Play Store app and didn't see Singsnap. I then tried browsing the Play Store via web browser, and it said that the Chromebook was incompatible with Singsnap. I've also found that Firefox Focus crashes on start up, and Firefox Preview has weird scrolling problems using the trackpad. Is the AMD chip on this Chromebook responsible for these oddities? It was cheap and did well in benchmarks but that's a lot of failure in a couple days of mild use cases (Firefox and Singsnap). Any ideas on what I could do to get them to work? It does seem I can do some kind of Linux compatibility.</TEXT>

There would be no point in Wizards at all if Sorcerers got all these buffs people are asking for.

But all those books are probably the same), made a spreadsheet of the fifteen most common questions and the fifteen most common competency questions, and a Word document of long form responses to each (as a memory jog). Each time I get an interview I assess the bullets from the job description, expand the master question list if necessary (usually around technical, rather than generic, skills) and just keep updating that. I add to it after an interview if I get blindsided. It's a load of work up front, but you soon start to see similarities in the questions and being able to match the job spec to existing answers saves a load of time. You can then focus on researching the company, writing the presentation or whatever they ask you to do, and the "why my experience is useful to you" pitch.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Coronavirus is forever, not just for Christmas. The messages from the medical professionals made sense to me - it is going to go through the population, if not now then later. The countries that locked down and prevented the spread are still going to get it later as it circulates the globe and comes back in a few month's time. The gamble is really whether safe and effective cures (hah) or vaccines will come out soon (in which case a lockdown would probably have been better, because it would minimise our casualties before treatment and prevention comes online) ... or whether they come out months down the line, in which case lockdown would be unsustainable and we would be just making sure we had multiple waves of this. I do think the government could be doing more for zero hours contractors etcetera to support self-isolation, but the medical advice seems logical and it seems like that is what they are following.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The hit point formula for Aberrant Spirit seems odd. As written, cast at eighth level it's Aberrant Con mod (2, doesn't scale); plus caster ability modifier (5, probably); and if you cast at eighth level for maximum spirit attacks, another (80). That's 87 hit points - very low for the level, and no scaling on the Con or cast stat modifier. I wonder if they meant (Con mod + casting mod + 10) * spell level.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>On further consideration, it's probably fine. At the moment it works out for the undead spell as (with AL stats): 3rd level. 2 + 3 + 30, or 35 hit points. 4th level. 2 + 4 + 40, or 46 hit points. 6th level. 2 + 4 + 60, or 66 hit points. 8th level. 2 + 5 + 80, or 87 hit points. In each case, the hit points is two or three attacks from the monsters you'll be fighting. E.g. to cast a third level spell you'll be at fifth level. An Easy encounter would be against a CR5 monster, such as a Bulette. The Bulette average damage is 28. A Barbed Devil with its multi-attack does 22 if each hits, as does a Cambion. By the time you can cast eighth level spells at level 15, an Easy encounter is a single CR 13 mob. A Nalfeshnee does 62 damage with its multi attack. A Storm Giant does 60. Whilst it's dubious that you want an eighth level spell slot to disappear in 1.5 multi-attacks from an enemy, if it could absorb two or three full rounds of attacks from an Easy solo it would probably be bringing too much to the table. Hit points on the lowish side also makes archetypes that give summons temporary hit points more attractive.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's start from the basics. Have you ever been outside a city? If people in a city observe social distancing, then why do you think those same people if they drive to the countryside will congregate simultaneously in public toilets? What do you think country dwellers do that means that a person from the city is going to be a highly effective spreader when they are outside? What particular region of the U.K. do you think is currently corona-free for this kind of transmission to matter? As a person who lives rurally, I am sure that city people going for a walk along the lanes or on the public footpath near me is going to be a microscopic increase in my risk compared to me just going to buy food once or twice a week since I'm not hoarding. In comparison, I am sure that those same city people if confined to their own densely-populated areas are more likely to spread the virus and overwhelm the hospital that serves the local area and which I share with those city people. Instead of the countryside wind widely dispersing these miasmic clouds of death that you seem to have imagined based on a report of viability time in lab conditions, those people staying in the city will be coughing onto the same surfaces over and over. The problem isn't even all cities, from the news it's basically people in London - although since London is a fixation for our media, it might be as bad in other places. Maybe they should lock down London and leave the rest of us to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you read the science, it discusses aerosolizing the strain and testing viability in a lab. Likewise, the surface tests are in lab conditions. Outside in the real world is not the same as lab conditions. And look at it this way: where are you going to encounter more metal and plastic touched by strangers - the city, or the country? Let's say a person drives out to the countryside. They park up, they get out, they go for a walk. They don't need to touch anything except a stile or a gate - and they can wear gloves for that and handle the gloves appropriately later, just as they would in the city. As long as they continue to observe social distancing of 2m (and that's easier where there is more space), and as long as they are following good hygiene protocols - as you think they will in the city - then there is no additional source of risk, outside of accidents on the journey/mechanical breakdown. Whereas there are many health benefits from being out in natural surroundings. Your point about exponential transmission misses the whole point of this - whether the risk of transmission is increased by people travelling to the countryside, over people walking around town. As I already pointed out, unless people are travelling vast distances they'll be in the same hospital catchment area anyhow. If someone transmits in the country, they'll transmit in the city. The impact is the same, the hospitals are the same. For what you say to be meaningful, there would need to be evidence that rural dwellers transmit the virus more easily than city dwellers and/or that transmission in a rural setting was more probable than in an urban one. I raised London specifically because there are reports that a substantial number of people are just ignoring social distancing there - not because it's further along the curve. And there's a difference between allowing people to drive out to the countryside for their daily exercise, to dispersing the population of two metropoli and Lombardy for an undefined time to an undefined place. Even your straw man is illogical.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; It's not, but then what are you basing your assessment of how long it will take then? I was responding to someone saying it would be gone in minutes... based on nothing. Are you telling me to look at the science so you can ignore the science and base your opinion on your own speculation?! The science tells us the worst case scenario, so we should base it on that. Let's take a look at the reports, in case you missed some important points in your ... interpretation. "In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed (i.e. endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation). In analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported. ... A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine has evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus.9 In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions. Further, the finding of COVID-19 virus in aerosol particles up to 3 hours does not reflect a clinical setting in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed #8212;that is, this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure." (Source: https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations ).  gt; It's about distance of transmission - moving from areas of high concentration to areas of much lower concentration. We're talking about people going for exercise not shopping - if they're just exercising within a few km of their local area, they're not going to be dealing with parking meters, styles, gates, public toilets, getting refreshments from corner shops etc. Why is it about that? Who's going to be checking Pay-and-Displays in the country right now? What corner shops are going to be open up in the hills? Probably very few. And there's no evidence that they are going to be more used than similar parking areas (more likely to be checked in urban areas) and corner shops (more likely to be open in urban areas) because there is more potential custom still in the urban areas.  gt; Gloves are not mandated, and can still spread infection. People can still sneeze or cough or sweat into their hands, Yes if people went to the countryside in hazmat suits you'd be fine, but that might not happen. Again, why take unnecessary risks? People are either going to be careful or they are not. There are two failures for you to pick up the virus - the person who had it for not wearing gloves and for coughing on stiles, and your own for touching the stile then wiping your face. The exact same could happen on benches in urban areas, opening a door to a block of flats, and so on. Wouldn't it be much simpler to just tell people they need to wear gloves?  gt; It increases the risk of people spreading from the town to the countryside. As I said, by your logic we should spread out all the people in London, Wuhan (a few months ago), Lombardy and NYC into the countryside, but that would be idiotic. That's not what I said. I said we could just lockdown London, which is the opposite of that. And I then explained why. You're just reaching to make an absurd point that is nothing to do with what I said.  gt; The controversial point was someone who travelled from Sheffield to Curbar Gap in the Peak District (which does have a car park with a parking meter) which would be served by hospitals in Chesterfield or Matlock, rather than the hospitals in Sheffield, and if it spreads to other people driving to the same area from other cities, then of course you would have transmission from cities to towns. Every hospital is going to have people with it. An isolated incident of people driving a very long distance isn't going to change that. Any hospitals in Chesterfield and Matlock are going to get patients with COVID anyhow.  gt; Well it is further along the curve. There's more people in London, that doesn't mean they're ignoring social distancing at a greater rate. People are also unable to travel to work (which is allowed) on the tube at peak times and follow social distancing - it's not about exercise/leisure which is what you're talking about. Popular tourist spots in central London are now empty - you seem to want people to be replacing them with popular tourist spots in the countryside, which is utterly nonsensical. If people stay close to their own homes, they'll be far more spread out than if they all congregate in the countryside's most beautiful tourist spots. That's not happening right now because most people are following guidelines - if we changed the guidelines as you seem to want, it would be happening in mass numbers and more than usual, because that would be the only allowable leisure activity. Popular tourist spots in London are small and, in many cases, indoors or in small areas. Going out to walk along South Downs is a very different matter.  gt; It is completely illogical - I'm just following your logic to it's natural conclusion. If you think there's a difference then which of your principles does it break? So long as we spread them out enough to the whole of the Italian countryside, by your logic, there should be no issue. But yes, it is completely illogical... If we did spread everyone out with a 2m gap and kept them there for three weeks and they didn't have to move then yes, we would probably stop the virus. However that's ridiculous and nothing like people going out to get the general health benefits of an isolated walk in natural surroundings (e.g. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180706102842.htm but there's no shortage of articles about mental health improvements from being outside).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Did dragons actually fight alongside the army? If so, here are some things they might do. 1. Leave space in their formations for a Huge sized monster, in the hope that a Dragon takes that space. If this happens the Dragon could extend its wings over the kobolds (or whoever), potentially providing them with Cover, including against Fireballs. 2. Train special Chosen Ones. These are kobolds who have been trained to run towards the enemy and take the Help action, to assist the Dragon with its attack rolls. They don't expect to live, so the rest of kobold society treats them well (honoured) whilst being glad not to be Chosen themselves. These kobolds are probably stuffed up, much like Berserkers. They may also have a level or two in mobile classes such as Monk, the Mobile feat, or similar. There may even be catapults for launching them towards aerial enemies if their Dragon has to fight another Dragon. That or the kobolds could be in a Howdah on its back. 3. Winged Kobold scouts would screen for the Dragon. They could load up with alchemical smoke and fly between the Dragon and the ground, providing cover from enemy archers and letting the Dragon swoop out of the smoke dramatically. 4. Healing machines. It's an action to interact with an object. However a Dragon has a very large mouth. Potentially many Kobolds could spend their actions hurling healing potions down its throat in nice digestible sacks - Healing Haggis. Or even Goodberries though that might result in Dragon stomach cramps since just one is enough to sustain a creature for a day. 5. Skirmishers. The Dragon is the equivalent of a flamethrower - good at clearing massed groups of enemies. The kobolds would therefore want to encourage the enemies to do that clustering and become vulnerable to the breath weapon. This means they would be shaping the battlefield to the best of their ability. Sneaking up to it in the night, laying traps, trying to funnel enemy forces into kill zones. A narrow gulley where the kobolds could hide caltrops and ball bearings would be ideal. 6. The kobolds would want to screen the Dragon from hostile magic, which would mean ensuring that any nearby casters had a steady stream of dispersed kobolds to worry about. Never more than three, because casters can trivially kill a group of kobolds - but at least one kobold to get in the caster's face. 7. That of course is what the Dragon would want. Kobolds are cowards and there would no doubt be hilarity as they volunteered each other for the suicidal roles and then ran before the battle, leaving the Dragon and a field full of traps.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going through Boundless. I'm simultaneously deeply sceptical of the number of supplements he recommends, and too lazy to manually check all of the references. I half expect that if I do, many turn out to be small n animal studies. In particular, stuff like shining light onto his testes; creating brown fat through cold exposure (which is governed by genetics, not by cold showers); and his references to known purveyors of hokum make me concerned. On the other hand, some sections do gel with what wider research tells us, such as diets being individual; the importance of stomach flora; etc.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like how they cite niche invasion as a reason to ditch the Mystic, but a Wood Elf Psi Knight appears to be able to jump 110' in a single move action at level 3 for no resource cost by Long Jumping with Psionic Talent. When long jumping they can roll their Psi die (1d6 at level 1) and extend the jump by (2*psi dice) + (2*Int modifier). Say they start with Str 12 Int 16, they run 10', jump for (12+(3.5*2)+(3*2)) but that costs them only 1' to go that 25' Repeat two more times and they actually go 75' in Psi-Powered Leap plus their base 35. 110' movement in a single Move action. Edit: amended "level 1" to "level 3".</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I submitted a sample mid February. Mid March I contacted them to see where it was, as it had no status on the app, and I got a stock response saying it would be monitored. I checked again this month and the Fedex details are showing that it's been held up as undeliverable because it doesn't have paperwork in some facility in Greenboro. I contacted 23andme support to ask them to resolve this (I expect the sample is long gone) but got the exact same response as before - they hadn't read my request which mentioned that it was stuck in Fedex. Obviously with Covid stuff is hard right now. I don't really mind that the sample is probably ruined, I got unlucky with timing. However I will need them to read enough of my email to actually send me a new kit which I can use when things are more calm - but they don't seem to be looking at the text of what I write. Has anyone had any joy with resolving this kind of issue? Is there a limit to the amount of time I have to ask for them to re-issue a kit?</TEXT>

Unfortunately his two use cases are email (fine) and karaoke (not fine). At the moment he uses Singsnap but I expect I could lure him to do his crooning on Smule or some other social karaoke site. My problem: he has poor sight. The setup would need to link the iPad to a monitor (I believe I can do this with a Lightning-to-USB adapter, or maybe Lightning-to-HDMI). That would leave no port for a microphone, however, and potentially cause charging issues. Which means I need to find a Bluetooth headset that is iOS compatible that has a good quality mic so he can sing into that. My questions: 1. Is there a sensible way to do karaoke apps on a basic iPad with the one port? I can't afford an iPad Pro for him, this setup would be a birthday/Christmas present. 2. Can I actually hook the basic iPad into a monitor without major issues? 3. Are there any Bluetooth headsets that work with the basic iPad and have a good/great mic? 4. Can the basic iPad use some kind of Lightning hub so I could connect a monitor and a Lightning port mic?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I loathe homebrew classes, I truly do. This one is the first one I've seen that I not only like, but will introduce to a game I run. Some comments: * the Undead bond seems much weaker than the others. I can't easily articulate why, but certainly compared to the Warrior of the Wild, the Aberration, and the Fey, its combat potential seems very poor. * there's a typo in the description of Blood Demon ("preformed" when you mean "performed"). Another in Conduit of Agony ("it's"). Blood Demon also looks like a juicy multiclass opportunity for anything that does burst damage (e.g. Paladin multiclass with Smite). Smite your Demon and do a lot of area effect damage. However it's governed by enemy Constitution saves, so I think it's balanced - just stronger than most of the other archetypes and with good synergistic opportunity. * Creation has a typo. "Deal and extra" not "an extra" with Blunt Fists. Stomp seems very powerful - 8d8 area effect damage is way higher than most of the other Edicts you have. I suspect this might be too generous, although much lower and it won't be worth taking. Definitely needs play testing given how often Edicts refresh and how this does damage (albeit in a smaller area) comparable to a 3rd level spell slot. Also ... Big Mouth synergy with the Enlarge spell and Soul Infused Giant is amazing. * Ooze. Engulf could stand to be re-written, the wording is odd in places. Also that this is a Medium or smaller target, rather than a target one size category smaller, seems a bit disappointing, because it doesn't synergise with Soul Infused Giant. Given Plant can grapple and restrain creatures of any size, I felt particularly sorry for Ooze. * Split Soul. This one seemed very flavourless compared to the others, in terms of the actual abilities rather than the concept. * Puppet. I really, really like the concept, but the bonuses for it don't seem as flavourful or cool as the other archetypes. Also the top ability is weaker than the Split Soul's top ability since the Soul Binder is encouraged not to act. * Soul Troll. I have so many players that abuse trolls, I couldn't help but laugh. I think the Infusions need to add extra damage. This does get a size increase for free, but the damage is the same as the Medium soul bound companions and the defences are good but not so good that this doesn't feel like a waste of a pet. * Imbued Strike. The opportunity cost of an action seems high. * Soul Punch. A Reaction spell that does damage? I suppose this is not a precedent, there is the Hellish Rebuke (edit) spell. * Companion Recall. I don't see why this is a third level spell when in most relevant occasions the Soul Binder can hide their companion in a pocket dimension. Congratulations! A class that seems balanced and works wonderfully for both a setting BBEG and also for the girlfriend (or boyfriend) in a DnDuet game who desperately wants a flavourful pet class.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The vast majority of the ones I've seen are poorly designed, too powerful, and exist to fill some character trope that I don't care about. I don't even like most of the UA from WotC and they put in token consideration of game balance, plus those are only archetypes not full classes. Barbarians in full plate that can cast spells with full casting is the general expectation of homebrew. There are three questions you can ask to determine whether a homebrew is worth reading in depth. 1) does it offer a new take and flavour for something, that you can't already do with an existing class? In this case, yes. Beast Master Ranger is very limited in what it can do and the spin you can put on it. This doesn't invade a niche (the companion is a good pet, but the base class isn't as good as a Ranger at combat for example, and doesn't have the exploration stuff). 2) is the class coherent with itself? Do most of the features make sense with the theme, rather than just arbitrarily giving the class a ribbon ability or random useful thing? The abilities here make sense for the pet class. 3) if the class was available in a game, would a power gamer always pick it? Aka the Hexblade test. This class is not so powerful that it would be played to the exclusion of other things.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At higher levels, it's practically impossible to balance them - simply because fights take so long that having a number of them is a waste of player time. Plus archetypes like the Champion, which shine in days with many encounters, have very little to offer outside fights. This means that nova builds such as Hexasorcadin are going to dominate in fights, whilst having a load of magical utility for any other type of encounter. It's bad design. Meanwhile, there was a lot of variety in 4E between archetypes. The problem it had was that it had the treadmill rather than bounded accuracy, so there were always optimal picks and a lot of the choice was illusory. 4E's power design combined with 5E's class/archetype system and bounded accuracy would have been far better than 5E is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The point is that they don't have empathy. They will maintain stable trade, until it's advantageous not to. You can come up with justifications as to why they don't act in an evil manner, but that doesn't mean that they're not evil - just that circumstances aren't correct for evil to benefit them. Seems like you're just creating a potential threat there, that you could have had all along. There's no actual game or flavour benefit, you've still got a race with a strong tilt towards sociopathy. Which is fine - sociopathy does have a genetic component. Even discounting that, it could be the snake influence of the gods that corrupted their souls. I don't see the benefit of not having races which are given to behaviour that is evil. Of course, those races should not be disguised (or naked) analogies for actual people or cultures.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To avoid people being born into financial power we would need a system completely without private property. It's not obvious that the human drive to pass wealth to our descendants will permit such a system to work. Likewise, the concept of fully elected Parliaments seems attractive until you realise that you're selecting politicians for people pleasing short term measures, rather than for sound long term payoffs. Deferred gratification is as important for large groups of people as it is for individuals. In some ways, a monarchy and Lords are superior - the monarch and Lords have more invested in the long term health of the nation, simply because their offspring will inherit a chunk of it. At the moment we have a Parliament of short-termists and opportunists.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I didn't have time to check all through the thread, but I wanted to highlight a multiclass synergy. Monk X/Diviner 2 works well for Open Hand. If you get a low Portent roll you can force a stun from Stunning Strike or a legendary resistance use. It also gives you Longstrider and Jump (and Shield and Find Familiar) all of which add some great utility, enhancing the Monk's strengths and mitigating a weakness. Jump can help the Monk with Step of the Wind, or prevent having to spend Ki on Step of the Wind. At level 19, you hit a new power spike with Portent/Quivering Palm (irrelevant in most games, but it's nice to have a power increase to look at). Wood Elf is the obvious choice for this setup as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a dire position to be in, and there's not really a magic bullet. You can try to give yourself the feeling of a bit more control. Some ways you could achieve this: 1. Think of job applications as a job. Don't get into the mindset of them being some extra task you fit between your unemployed leisure time, treat them as a Monday to Friday 09:00 to 17:00 job. That doesn't mean just slavishly making applications, you can use that time to research ways to improve your portfolio, write a better CV, write better cover letters. 2. Invest in a book written by a recruitment professional about how to write your CV and covering letter. Ideally from your country, as local cultures vary - many CV re-writing services that are presumably U.S. based just stuff the CV full of self-aggrandising buzzwords that will get your application ignored by U.K. recruiters. Particularly relevant in a field where there is computer-based automatic sifting. 3. Do A-B testing on your CVs and covering letters and portfolio. Particularly if you see some advice that is apparently good but doesn't seem to fit you. Write one CV and covering letter based on that advice, and another based on other advice. Then see if either method produces better results. You're in this for the long game, each time you don't get an invite for interview you do have a data point. 4. Talk to a recruiter in your field. If you can do temp jobs, that's often useful - the recruiter will tell you want employers want and help you with your CV, you do a temporary job for experience and money, and you know what to emphasise in future applications. 5. Don't take rejections personally. 6. My emergency backup plan was to apply for jobs as a recruiter in the field I wanted to work in, then use that to understand what employers wanted and make contacts. Fortunately I didn't have to do it ... but it's something to consider. Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I switched on a whim, and it's transformed how useful the iPad Pro 11 is for me (mainly the trackpad, I didn't have one before). The lack of pencil holder is very annoying when they could have fit it in the hinge and my previous case had such a place. Other than that, it's ideal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You should pick a modelling method before picking a tool. And the best way to do that is to think about who you're going to present to, and what they like to see. Some times senior stakeholders are turned off by anything more detailed than a Visio diagram. Sometimes they like full architectural details (it often depends on their level of IT experience). Some methods recommend particular views or viewpoints. Others are integrated relatively well with EA frameworks. Where I work, we model in ArchiMate, which integrates well with TOGAF. We also need to work on modes together. This narrows the field down quite a lot - most of the software is poor. The right software will allow you to do your modelling and map your dependencies, along with either offering an inbuilt way of managing properties and values associated with your modelled content, or at least an easy way to interact with a database that does so. If I was starting from scratch with no particular drivers, I'd look at Archi or Visual Paradigm Online. Both are free for personal use and to get a feel for what is out there. Archi doesn't work well as a shared repository, but it's good for ArchiMate. Visual Paradigm I've used for planning non-work projects, plus it has generically useful Help pages. There are going to be other tools out there with lots of features and low buy in, I just haven't tried them.</TEXT>

Also if a company is advanced enough to support remote wiping, they're likely to have a mechanism that lets the boss who wants the PA arrange for a SIM card. Unless the choice is "this or go hungry without a job", anyone who does this on their own device is adding a lot of risk to their lives.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The U.K. has a government elected by all constituent parts. It just happens that only a small number of those MPs represent areas that cling to this particular historical identity. To suggest that it's an abusive relationship because a minority of MPs representing a minority of people don't get their way all the time is ... a very self-centred view. Although in the case of food standards, I'd definitely prefer that we followed EU standards. Nationalism is disappointing in England, and it's disappointing in Scotland.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's an identity. The differences are a product of history. There's an unanswerable question of the degree to which Scottish nationalism would exist without the SNP to fan the flames - but I suspect far less. It's an absolute tragedy for the union that the most competent political party in the union is the one that wants to break up the union - although it's hard to say how well the SNP would fare if they couldn't blame Westminster for the SNP's failures (both the ones genuinely caused by Westminster, and the ones caused by the SNP themselves).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's not just that - often people choose to read or listen to things they know will make them angry, then blame others when they get angry. Public (particularly political) figures absolutely need to be held to account for their opinions at the next vote. Private citizens, blogging on Suburban_Chad_09's Wordpress site, or some 15 follower Twitter account, should be allowed to talk nonsense (and be castigated for it) but without the hounding elements and attempts by people to get them fired. In any public space there are two responsible parties. One is the speaker, who needs to be aware that they should be willing to defend their ideas robustly. An idea that can't be defended is not much use, after all. But listeners are also responsible. Firstly for making sure they can handle opinions they disagree with, without getting hysterical. And secondly by responding in a measured fashion appropriate to the thing they are responding to. There is no right to not be offended, but there is a right of reply. Attempts to ban people from speaking really do stifle debate - even if some of us are really over the debates in question.</TEXT>

Looks like a farmer's wife with a strong disapproval of fun, but I live in an urban area with no farms within casual walking distance. Many evenings in the winter when it's dark, as I get home at 19:00, my headlights illuminate her in the act of hoying a doggie bag over the fence into a small area of grass and trees around a power station. She never looks guilty. One evening as I walked back from the car I watched one of those skinny, scabrous urban foxes optimistically head over to a bag. Poor little bastard snaffled that bag right up and ran off with it. Must've been a disappointment for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is an absolute dumpster fire of an Unearthed Arcana. They seem to be getting worse with every new one, plundering existing classes instead of coming up with new things. * Eldritch Adept is a joke. Now one level of Hexblade, two levels of Paladin, and then Sorceror and you're not only the Smitemeister but as amazing in ranged combat as a full Warlock. * Fighting Initiate is also a joke. A second fighting style was one of the few things going for Champion: they could get the AC bonus as well as the relevant offensive option. Now any Fighter can get it. * Slasher. On the positive side, this is good for a Champion. * Tandem Tactician. This looks like a buff to Mastermind but it also takes the point of them away. It's immensely strong on any class that doesn't get much use from a bonus action. Non-Moon Druid, Fighter, Paladin, Wizard are all classes that often don't have things to do with their bonus actions. Of those, Paladin is the best choice: usually in the front lines, less likely to be using their Bonus Action for a Crossbow Expert short or a GWM critical hit. Of course, the real break here is Elven Accuracy. The limiter that cropped up for Elven Accuracy was that, between play test and live, they made it so you couldn't stack Elven Accuracy with Reckless Attacks. That's because it's effectively infinite advantage. The power play here is two elves grabbing it and getting four resource free guaranteed Advantage attacks (if all are melee combatants). Double Hexasorcadin goodness, particularly with Eldritch Adept.</TEXT>

And it's dishonest to say that this is a "full scale assault on devolution" - these powers weren't already held by Wales. Having said that, this quote doesn't even imply regions are disadvantaged: "There is also a proposal for a  #8220;mutual recognition regime #8221; requiring regulatory standards in one part of the UK to be automatically accepted in others. In practice this could leave them unable to reject UK government decisions on, for example, chlorinated chicken or genetically modified (GM) organisms." If that's accurate, all Wales has to do is rapidly require EU food hygiene standards and the rest will follow. It doesn't say that only Westminster can set those standards.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spend the next month writing down stuff you actually make use of, in a list. Then write down what you use it for. You've now got a list of things that you know you are likely to do in any month. Go through it. For example, do you actually use a lamp? If so, what for? How often? Do you use it for handwriting? If so, are you going to be doing much of that in the future, or are you going to be typing on a laptop? Do you use the lamp for reading? If so, are you going to get a Kindle or use a Kindle app so you don't have to carry books? Next make your list of all the things that you need to use the things above. Are there any opportunities to reduce? For example, can you get everything you need onto USB-C? You could go Chromebook or iPad Pro (USB-C powered), and try to ensure anything else essential for your target area works from the sockets you'll have (desk fan if you're going somewhere hot, Kensington laptop lock if it's an area with crime). Look at a travel adapter that can power everything. There are some fancy hubs that also offer wireless charging, if that fits the bill for your electronics - but minimalism is a great way of saving money. One last question I would ask is about internet connection - very much country or campus specific. Do they provide free WiFi? If so, great. Do they provide metered WiFi? Do you use a VPN and, if so, is that within their TOS? Do they snoop your connection more than you want? If it's cheaper to supply your own internet data then plan for that with your phone or a MiFi device.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you're just showing what exists where, I'd still keep it simple. Components are services (you plug them in and use them) consumed by your PaaS service. The advantage of services is that you're not pre-empting questions like "should I actually be using an Interface instead of a Component" etc. If you really want to model the behaviour of those components (function in ArchiMate is about behaviour) - which I am not sure you do, but it's your example - then you need a structure model. This would look something like: * "Azure Cloud" as Application Component 1 (if you really have to avoid Service ... ) * "Azure SQL DB" as Application Component 2 * "Azure SQL database write" as Application Function 1 * "Azure SQL database storage" as Application Function 2 * Application Function 1 and 2 are nested inside Application Component 2 * Application Component 2 is nested inside Application Component 1 As you can see, by using Functions you're going to have to add a lot to the diagram, because you're effectively telling the Solution Architect *why* each component is being used, and what the important parts are. This can easily result in a very complex diagram. If you just need to list components then Services are better. If you need to show what each component does, Functions are fine. If you need to show how data moves between Components, or how administrators use Interfaces to manage Components, different diagrams again. If that doesn't work, I'd resist the urge to show higher level (application) elements supporting lower level (technology) elements.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As stated above, I don't mind who uses what bathroom. I'd prefer unisex bathrooms simply for my personal convenience and because I'd never have to worry about misreading some of the bizarre signs that are in use. I don't have an opinion on women's spaces. I gave an example in the thread about debate, and you demonstrated the point for me by claiming that a number of subjects about just one controversy were "settled" in the "circles that matter". Which is evidently nonsense. I'm not going to tilt at any of your straw men. Not sharing bathrooms isn't the same as not providing bathrooms. For what it's worth, I'm quite happy to agree that gender is a social construct, and sex is a biological one. At that point, it's just a question of whether bathrooms are separate for biological reasons or social ones. As far as I'm concerned the best split is one that lets me have shorter queues - I.e. whatever split supports urinals. There: some agreement. However, my point - as with debating - is that it's dishonest to claim that your side of a controversial argument is correct and settled, as you are, and that the only the other side has to make the argument. Even the medical community as a whole isn't united in agreement with what you're claiming. And I am going to bow out, now. I keep forgetting how intensely divisive and valueless "identity" is as a concept (any identity). My mistake: I should have used a less emotive subject as my example for why no platforming is important.</TEXT>

But the behaviour that this report highlights is that the government opted to not investigate a national security threat, and that our various institutional safeguards against that threat didn't kick in to protect critical processes, or do post event analysis. If you think about it, post event analysis is critical. Either it finds no evidence, in which case people are reassured ... or it finds evidence, in which case we know and can expect the government to act accordingly. Even if this doesn't impact the rightfulness of Brexit, it strongly impacts trust in government.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There are many good arguments for unelected second chambers. 1. Elected representatives are driven by the demands of popularity rather than good governance. This often results in short term thinking ("what will get me more votes" instead of "what will make this country better in the long run"). 2. Experts selected by an appropriate system (e.g. peer nomination) are more likely to have actual expertise than experts trying to get voted in by the general population. Of course, each expert is going to weight their own area of expertise highly when it comes to providing advice. 3. Hereditary peers, more than most, have a vested interest in the long term health of the country: they are literally leaving estates to their descendants. Of course, this also incentivises such peers to provide advice that guarantees things like land rights. 4. Political appointees. In theory, these can be experienced politicians who have decades of dealing with policy under their belts. They are freed up from the requirement of popularity seeking and can focus on providing good advice. Of course, this ends up being a source of political favours and appointments made on the basis of past deeds not future promise. It's difficult. Based on the calibre of our politicians in the social media age, I'm not sure that elections will help. If anything they would be PR elections, which will give fringe parties more of a say. On the other hand, the nakedly political appointments are a disgrace. I'd like to see a system with a few hereditary peers (really), a few bishops, a whole lot of experts elected by their own professions, and some political appointments. The political appointments should last for a fixed term (let's say until the end of the Parliament after they were appointed). This would encourage nominations of Lords who could achieve things. Any party leader who MPs should be able to nominate a representative number of political appointees. Lastly, I'd like about a third of the Lords to be elected in an STV system done on a national list. This would allow some fringe party involvement and help make up for the issues caused by FPTP.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The particular book is by an authority on eating disorders and Professor of Psychiatry at one of the world's most prestigious universities. It's from around 2000 which means plenty of general doctors will have trained when it was new. You can try to present sugar addiction as settled science, but you'd be wrong to do so. Even if I personally believe sugar is addictive, that doesn't mean that it's an opinion the general medical establishment shares.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ouch. Are you okay? I'd have expected a less passive-aggressive reply from someone with Dharma in their name. Please understand that just because I disagree with you, that doesn't mean I'm "concern trolling". Assigning negative motivations to people is usually self sabotaging. For a quick recap: OP asked why it seemed like no-one is talking about sugar addiction. I responded to OP by explaining that it isn't settled science that food is addictive. I then responded to you saying the same. I noted that I do believe that sugar is addictive, but that me holding this belief does not mean it's settled science. Note: psychiatrists may have different beliefs about things. The book I'm thinking of is "Overcoming Binge Eating, Second Edition" by Dr Christopher Fairburn. 2013. It has a Seal or Merit from the US Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Therapies, and U.K. NHS doctors can prescribe it. Here's a quote: "as discussed earlier, the view that certain foods are toxic and somehow cause people to binge has no basis in fact." OP's description of a relationship with food such that they wanted Chinese so badly that they cried is practically identical to examples of broken food relationships given in the book. In regards to your comment that it's some "random book and doctor", here are some of the endorsements. Reviews of Overcoming Binge Eating (Second Edition)  #8220;By any standard, Christopher Fairburn is the leading authority in our field, so who better to write the definitive book? This program is based on vast clinical experience, numerous clinical trials, and a breadth of perspective that few possess. You can trust this book. It is a landmark. #8221; Kelly Brownell PhD, Director, Rudd Center for Obesity, Yale University  #8220;It is difficult to improve on a classic, but that is exactly what Dr. Fairburn has done. Overcoming Binge Eating, Second Edition, expands on the highly effective cognitive behavioral treatment for eating disorders that Dr. Fairburn has developed. If you or a loved one suffer from binge eating, bulimia or other eating disorders, this is the book to read--and re-read. #8221; Robert Leahy PhD, Director, American Institute for Cognitive Therapy  #8220;In this gem of a book, Dr Fairburn draws upon decades of clinical experience and research findings on binge eating and related problems. This new (and thoroughly reworked) edition is a  #8220;must read #8221; if you want to understand binge eating problems and begin (or guide and support others on) the journey toward full recovery. #8221; Ruth H. Striegel PhD, Editor-in-chief, International Journal of Eating Disorders</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let's be clear. You are asserting that you, studying at the PhD level, and your own unnamed review from a health practitioner, are more trustworthy than the author of the example I provided. That's fine: disagreement is just making the point I made. It isn't settled science. It doesn't even really matter whether the source of disagreement is sugar lobby lies, Coca Cola or whatever. What I said is that there is disagreement which is why sugar addiction isn't mentioned. In relation to the quote: I was linking it to OP's described behaviour, but Fairburn also disagrees with the theory that 'people who binge are biologically vulnerable to certain foods (typically sugar and starches) and as a result become "addicted" to them. These foods are "toxic" to these people who, as a result, are unable to control their intake so their consumption progressively rises. Since this vulnerability is biologically based, they can never be cured of the problem (or "illness"): rather, they have to learn to accept it and adjust their lives accordingly.' 'Is the addiction model valid? As Terence Wilson of Rutgers University has stressed, nowadays the "concept of addiction has been debased by promiscuous and imprecise usage to describe virtually any form of repetitive behaviour. Some of us, we are told, are "sex addicts", others are "TV addicts" or "shopaholics". The result is that it is no longer clear what it means to have an addiction. When the word is used in this loose, all-embracing way, most of us could be said to be "addicted" to something or other.' Well done on finding a negative review of the first edition, I suppose. The second edition which I referred to was published in 2013, as well, so the reviewer may (or may not) have found some of the updates they want. Again, I was responding to the original poster who asked why people didn't seem to talk about sugar addiction a lot. I was not undermining the original poster, simply providing an answer. If that is a definition of concern trolling, it isn't a helpful one. Being able to accept that there are arguments and stances that you don't agree with is useful. Certainly interpreting people saying "I think this, but some other people think that" as concern trolling is a very defensive stance to take. Anyhow, I think the point that there isn't universal acceptance that sugar is addictive has been made by this discussion better than I could have made it alone. I am not interested in circular arguments, so I shall bow out of the thread.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Surely we believe in our post-Brexit economy? More people of working age is good. Integrate, assimilate, and make productive. It's what we are hopefully going to do with the BNO from Hong Kong. I can understand the problems with trying to bring in cultures with very different mores to the existing culture. Diversity of approach to problem solving is easy to defend as a good. Wanting diametrically opposed goals is much harder. But our options here seem very limited, there are parts of the Channel with no international waters - it goes straight from U.K. to France - so we can't just nudge boats back the way they came from. Unsurprisingly these are the places people cross.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I acknowledge the point you're making, but I think it's disingenuous. The vast majority of people making the case that we should allow migrants in are not doing so in order to benefit people traffickers or because they want to see British culture destroyed. They are doing it because they see desperate fellow humans driven to abandon all they know and chase a dream, and they feel compassion. Compassion is a very worthwhile human trait. I do think it's likely that resource scarcity (including habitable land) is going to reach a point where this becomes an issue where things get horrific, but we are not there yet. And until we get there, it is incumbent upon us as a society that wants to think of itself as generally moral and hospitable (note: neither of those things necessarily mean accepting of the unqualified right of people to cross borders) to find the best solution for us and also for the people in this situation. The best solution probably isn't four star hotels, as described in the red tops. It also probably isn't trying to use warships to intercept sail boats and allow migrants to drown themselves or their children and create a scenario where either we back down or they drown.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that Atkins and other high protein diets fell out of favour for long term use because they were believed to increase health risks (https://www.healthline.com/health/too-much-protein#recommended-daily-protein). A lot of the studies on red meat etc seem to be from US populations where the quality of red meat can be very low due to farming methods and antibiotics. A lot may depend on the quality of the protein you eat, and your genes. Also with the amount of weight training you're doing, you'll be using that protein. Personally I tried Atkins for a while and found it good for weight loss and I felt great, but I didn't do it long term and I also enjoyed vegetables too much to skip them. Maybe stick with it whilst you feel good, get bloods done if you can afford it, and dial down the protein if you dial down your resistance training.</TEXT>

There are no bonuses or individual salary increases negotiated.

    <TEXT>I'd start by looking at the constraints and implications of the homebrew. Cantrips scale and spell slots, but extra attacks don't. That immediately makes magic a high priority, especially since high level combats are a fatigue grinder anyhow: grinding away with attacks is just agony. Of the damage cantrips, Booming Blade and Eldritch Blast are the most reliable. We get a Legendary and two Very Rare items. That offers us Belt of Storm Giant Strength (risky in a No Magic zone) and a weapon with damage dice, or Illusionist's Bracers. I'll assume Points Buy, simply because you haven't stated otherwise that I spotted. Let's assume we can pick any race, with 16 to start in two stats we care about (maybe we do this after the new race rules come out). Those notes, let's have a quick canter through the classes and discount things. Barbarian. Attractive at first glance, but falls off in the analysis as a primary class. It simply doesn't have enough ASIs to cap both STR and CON. It would need 7 ASIs per star, but only gets 5 from Barbarian 20, and up to 3 from Fighter or Rogue 10. The best we could do is Belt of Storm Giant Strength to take us to 29 STR, max CON to 34, and hope we never lose the belt. That lets us pick up a feat such as Great Weapon Master. Overall, though, this is at best a multi-class and probably a three level dip. That gets us Reckless Attack and Rage when we really want it. Since it's a three level dip, and we are part of a party, and we have a rudimentary grasp of mathematics, Wolf Totem Barbarian should be our non-selfish choice if there are any other melee characters. Constant free Advantage for our allies is going to save us more health in the long run than Bear adding some more resistance. Bard. Full caster. Can go SAD with Charisma thanks to the inevitable Hexblade multi-class. Only question is whether we want Lore for more spell versatility, or Swords for blade flourishes. Cleric. Full caster. Potent Spellcasting is good for our Cantrip plans, but doesn't work on Booming Blade or Eldritch Blast. We can take Arcana Cleric with Booming Blade, but it's unlikely we will have much of a Wisdom bonus. Divine Intervention is both more attractive because we will have it for many sessions, and less attractive because a deity is going to matter less in a level 35 game. Probably most relevant if you're playing in an anime style game and your character wants to romance a goddess. Druid. Moon Druid is not attractive at all in a level 35 game, because there are no beasts worth turning into, and elementals will be weak. Land Druid with Natural Recovery is probably the best of the bunch here. Shepherd doesn't scale because there's no higher than 9th level spells to summon with. Fighter. In general, Fighter is going to be the only Extra Attack class that has a chance of keeping up with Cantrips (excluding Paladin Smites). Champion's weakness is that it doesn't synergise with itself: it gets more critical hits and no benefit from them (hence it's a popular dip). The item choices here let us take a weapon with +damage dice, and look for other classes that will add damage dice to every attack. Champion scales very well. Battle Master gets up to six Superiority dice which isn't going to scale well for the lengths of combat at this level. Cavalier's level 18 ability is attractive, but sadly Sentinel doesn't stack with Polearm Master which means it's only likely to get a few opportunity attacks in per round unless the casters shape the battlefield in such a way that hordes stream past it. Cavalier Mage Slayer might be hilarious if the party is going to go up against monsters that cast spells and have Legendary Action spell casting - but how many times can you fight Niv-Mizzet? Samurai is good, the ability to sack an attack at Advantage for a normal attack. Stacks well with Barbarian for constant Advantage, tragedy we can't put it on a Champion chassis. Let's do a quick thought experiment. What if we take a Vorpal Sword as our Legendary item, with Elven Accuracy (so it has to be on a slashing Finesse weapon, which only leaves us with a Scimitar). A Samurai Elf can attack four times with Advantage at three dice. Turn one of those Advantage attacks into a normal attack with Rapid Strike, and we get four attacks with Advantage and one normal attack. Elven Accuracy means we have a chance of not getting a 20 of 85.7375% (0.95*0.95*0.95). Our chance of not getting a 20 across all four attacks with Advantage is ~54%. With the fifth attack it's ~51%. If we pop Action Surge then we have another four attacks at Advantage, so the chance of not getting a 20 is ~29.2% and ~27.8% with the ninth, non-Advantaged attack. An Elven Champion gets more critical chances but Vorpal Swords only fire off on a 20, not on a critical, so it's purely about number of chances of rolling a 20 for this build. Bearing in mind that a 20 is a critical hit, the 6d8 damage from the Vorpal Sword is automatically doubled (confirmed by Sage Advice) so 12d8, or an average of 54 magical slashing damage per 20 and a reasonable expectation of two 20s per Fighting Spirit turn. This looks like it could be competitive with Cantrips, but let's keep going. Monk. Same MAD problem as Barbarian, but no upside. Open Hand 18/Diviner 2 rocks for Portent Quivering Palm in a 20th level game, but it won't scale up to this. Kensai may be useful, for its ability to have flexible monk weapons. Paladin. Obviously amazing. Capable of SAD with Hexblade, Smites in a game with plentiful spell slots, Heavy Armour, save aura. There are four archetypes to choose from. Conquest gets some mild retribution and the jankiest capstone. Oathbreaker provides the one chassis for summoning that can scale up in this campaign. Ancients provides an aura of spell resistance that is so good that it's practically a party tax: someone needs this, preferably someone taking Paladin to at least 18th level. The capstone is pretty good too. Lastly, Redemption. Once per short rest, Redemption can do a full damage Radiant retribution. For some types of bosses (lich types, for example, where damage output outstrips hit points and they are Radiant vulnerable) this is immense. Your capstone is always on and that's a half Radiant damage rebuke, plus you can use Aura of the Guardian to take a hit on someone else which you then rebuke. You also get health regeneration, though you'll want a lot more. Overall, Paladin gives us a bunch of options. Ranger. I don't like the Revised Rangers because they're too good (e.g. concentration free Hunter's Mark). I'm just going to note Guardian of Nature from Xanathar's as a source of Advantage, and move on. Rogue. Rogue doesn't work very well for us, because the sneak attack only happens once in our turn and potentially once as a result of our reaction. If we are doing single, big attacks then Cantrips scale best and we have our Illusionist's Bracers to Bonus Action with, which rules out Arcane Trickster and Scout. This leaves us with Swashbuckler. High Elf Booming Blade Champion/Swashbuckler with Elven Accuracy is good, but as the maths with the Vorpal Sword above shows, Sneak Attack is weak. Sorcerer. Lots to like here, namely spell slots, meta magic and Charisma. Shadow Sorcerer probably scales the best at high levels. Warlock. Hexblade, obviously. I genuinely dislike Hexblade because it has no flavour except "best for killing". GOO Thrall for example would be fun in a campaign, but who cares because CHA for everything. There's plenty of potential for Warlock/Paladin multi smites talked about in other posts, so I'm going to skip it other than to note Eldritch Blast/Illusionist's Bracers/Hex/Maddening Hex. Wizard. Wizard has always been in an odd place because its capstone comes at level 18 so it is ripe for multiclassing. Diviner 18/Tempest Cleric 6 gets you two lots of maximised Lightning damage potentially with guaranteed failed saves. If you're fortunate enough to roll a 20 on a Portent dice then you can drop a 9th level Witch Bolt for 216 Lightning damage (crit on maximised damage with Channel Divinity) but really you need to be shaping the battlefield instead of such hilarity. I'd probably take the last 6 levels in Shadow Sorcerer for metamagic and Hound of Ill Omen. The other Wizard I want to note is Necromancer, for combination with Oathbreaker. Artificer. A lot of Artificer is irrelevant because of the magic item guarantees and attunement rules. Nothing worthwhile here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With that round up done, here are my favourites. I've put in a combo too. Wood Elf Fighter 20 Samurai/Ranger 4 Gloomstalker/Rogue 6 Swashbuckler. Defence and Duelling fighting styles. Maximise Dexterity, use a shield. Equipment: Vorpal Scimitar (legendary); Chronolometer (Acquisitions Incorporated); Peregrine Mask (GGtR). I went through some of the maths for the Vorpal Sword above. A bow build will be more accurate (Archery) and damaging (Bracers of Archery, Sharpshooter) but boring - and not much different from a standard Samurai now build, despite the extra levels. Here we have Gloomstalker 4 for another attack on the first round of initiative, with some extra dice, and for some movement speed. We also have Swashbuckler ... because almost any other class fits worse. Paladin and Barbarian waste Extra Attack, Barbarian doesn't work with our Finesse weapon. Swashbuckler gets us mobility and a bit of sneak attack damage that we can hope to use when we get a critical hit. The Chronolometer gives us a 50% chance of another turn once a day, for even more decapitation chances. The Peregrine Mask lets us fly up at 60' (Rogue bonus action Dash if required for 120') in case we urgently need to decapitate someone in the sky. If we do get a natural 20 - and we really should on our first turn - we hit for 3.5 (1d6 scimitar) +3 (Vorpal) + 54 (12d8 Vorpal hit) + 21 (6d6 sneak attack) + 2 (Duelling) +10 (Dexterity) damage. 99.5 average damage on a 20. Other attacks will be 18.5 damage. Potentially another 1d8 for the Gloomstalker (potentially 2d8, if we crit our extra attack). That's if we haven't just cut their heads off, of course. A typical first turn if we start within movement range of the enemy is: move to enemy; Bonus Action Fighting Spirit; Attack action for four attacks with Advantage, drop Advantage on one attack to get an extra attack with Advantage, take Dread Ambusher attack (six attacks, five with Advantage); then Action Surge and repeat (five attacks with Advantage since we can only do Rapid Strikes once per turn); then if Chronolometer fires another five attacks with Advantage. Better maths is above in Fighter, but we have approximately a 14% chance of a natural 20 per attack with Advantage. That's probably one decap or 100 damage hit. Probably two with Chronolometer. Excludes Dread Ambusher bonus damage, between 4.5 and 9. The chance of true glory if you get a bunch of 20s, leaving your Divine Smite buddies in your DPS wake, wondering why they can't just decapitate people. Fallen Aasimar Hexblade 10 Pact of the Blade/Oathbreaker Paladin 20 (Aura of Hate). Maximise Charisma by spending all 7 ASIs on it. All fiends and undead within 30' add Paladin's Charisma modifier to melee weapon damage rolls. Synergy between Necrotic Shroud (Aasimar racial to frighten enemies) and the Oathbreaker capstone. Synergy between Aura of Hate and Accursed Spectre, your Spectre will be adding your Charisma modifier of +10 to attack rolls (total +14) and to damage rolls. You just miss out on a third Warlock spell slot, but Armour of Hexes is very nice. Invocations give you your range attacks (Agonising Blast and Eldritch Spear). Also take Devil's Sight, Grasp of Hadar (drag people closer to your minion wall), and Lifedrinker. Maddening Hex was tempting but doesn't work with the capstone. Equipment: Blood Fury tattoo (UA, Legendary); weapon of choice, armour of choice. Necromancer 18/Shadow Sorcerer 12. Yuan-Ti Pureblood is a good pick, for the magic resistance. Maximise Intelligence. Undead Thralls gives your undead +18 health, and they add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls. You make the army, give them polearms, and you sit it by your Oathbreaker. Shadow Sorcerer gets you more casts for animate spells, and you get some metamagic too. Your Charisma will be low, so your Sorcery spells will not be combat ones. You mainly want the slots and the sorcery points. Darkness will hamper the undead army, even with +8 to hit, so your Concentration spells is likely to be a Summon Undead Spirit (UA). With a level 8 slot, you want a Putrid spirit. Your Oathbreaker friend can pass his save, and your animated dead should be immune to poison. The putrid spirit forces a save vs your Spell Save DC (26) to avoid being poisoned. The spirit multiattacks four times at +19 (+20 if you cast at 9th level but that's a wasted Wish); each hit does 1d6+3+8 damage (average 14.5) plus another 10 damage from the Oathbreaker's aura plus, if the target is poisoned, it has to make a DC 26 save or be paralysed. And once it's paralysed there's an army of undead, plus your Paladin friend, to crit it. Equipment: Grimoire Infinitus (Legendary, double Arcane Recovery, EGtW); Illusionist's Bracers (Cantrip as a bonus action, GGtR); Wand of the War Mage +3.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Apple developed their stack internally, rather than merging for it. They also can point out that there are easily available phone alternatives. It would be interesting to see if Epic win a lawsuit that permits their own App Store, if Apple can get away with enabling such a thing but then not supporting their devices after a user installs such a store. At that point the store has all sorts of access that the ecosystem isn't designed for. If installing Fortnite put you outside warranty, you'd have to really want Fortnite. Or with all of Apple's cash, maybe they just buy Epic and fire everyone involved with the law suit and turn Fortnite to iOS only. Exciting times.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to argue with this. We have had authoritarian governments since Blair. The Coalition era was a brief moment of comparative liberalism. Then May - one of the most authoritarian Ministers, and a lover of empowering the State and determining acceptable activity - became PM. It's got worse since then. The Psychoactive Substance Bill, the holes in RIPA, the rise in surveillance technologies, the porn laws ... the Tories were authoritarian before Johnson and the current government.</TEXT>

It's the only archetype that allows this (Battlesmith now, but not much synergy there with multiclass). However the overpowered part only comes in when you add two levels of Paladin so you can burn Sorcerer spell slots and Sorcery points to fuel Divine Smite, giving you crazy nova abilities whilst being effectively a slightly delayed full Sorcerer thanks to Charisma on melee attacks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>R.e. Metamagic - Moon Druids double dip class features into their spell slots, as do Paladins. It's just another resource decision to make: do you cast more spells, or more effective spells? More effective spells have better action economy (e.g. Heightened Spell). I agree with some of your other points, about the lack of spells, difficulty of theming, and so on. I also think metamagic costs shouldn't scale exactly with spell level for those that scale. However metamagic is a great class feature and far more flexible than Wizard spell recharge (and Clerics don't even get a recharge).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like it. I'd suggest a change to the DR though. The Colossal creature receives an additional Legendary action option, Colossal Fortitude, which does has a cost of zero Legendary actions and may be taken a maximum of once per turn, excluding the turn of the Colossal creature. Colossal Fortitude may be taken on the same turn as another Legendary action. Colossal Fortitude grants the creature a pool of temporary hit points equal to the total number of levels of the party it is fighting. A Called Shot ignores the temporary hit points gained from Colossal Fortitude. I think this would give the effect you want, without it being horrendous for low damage characters.</TEXT>
