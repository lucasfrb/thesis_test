While I was leaving the gym, the trainers were talking to him at the front desk, and told him to come back around 6 because that's when he "will make a killing selling cakes."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you like beer, Florida has a lot of great local breweries, Funky Buddah is in south Florida. Check out Mangos while on south beach and it turns into a club at night. If you decide to travel northwards, towards Orlando, and want to go to a theme park Universal Studios in my opinion is better than Disney. Universal Studios also has an area called city walk with clubs, dinning, a movie theater and shopping. If you want to do something disneyish check out Disney Springs its free to get in, it's kind of like Epcot(dinning, bars, shopping), if you go make reservations for dinner ahead of time. Traveling further north stop at Blue Springs State park. Its one of our hidden beauties. Rent a canoe or kayak and see real Florida. Have fun on your holiday!</TEXT>

Accept that you'll need to set firmer boundaries with her and she won't like it, treating you even worse. Accept that you're getting really tired of this immature shit she's putting you through when you've been doing your best to care about her. Accept that you may need to severely cut her out of your life because you deserve happiness that she is sucking out of your soul. Accept that you truly are much happier now that you've respected yourself enough to no longer tolerate her crap and she's responsible for her own happiness, not you."</TEXT>

He gets really irratible by day 3. One of the things we do to entertain ourselves while in the hospital is have the room door open and make silly faces to all the people that walk by staring into the room. I knows its really silly, but it helps the time go by with a little laughter. Also, the people that help clean your room up, in my experience, are usually really friendly and will spark up a convo with you. Just know you're not alone in this battle, and this is a very supportive sub to be apart of.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am my husband's caretaker. He has complex partial seizures that makes him do some really weird and involuntary movements. I hate that he is so hard on himself afterwards. The only person that should be embarrassed should be me if I do not do everything I can to keep him out of harms way during the seizure. Please don't be so hard on yourself. Mindful meditation is a practice that may help you cope with all of the negative emotions that comes with this disease and helps you be present in the moment. There's an intresting Ted Talk that got me into the practice. This has honestly helped my husband and I sleep through the night while we wait for his upcoming brain surgery next week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm in a very similiar situtation as you. Although my husband quit drinking 3 years ago, he often confides in me the lack of emotions he has like as if he feels nothing. It hurts really bad. I really think its the meds. His seizures are currently uncontrolled as we are waiting in the hospital for his 3rd brain surgery. I push through with self loving, waking up everyday I tell myself I'm a fucking super hero. I have administrated emergency meds, kept him safe from injury, nursed his body and mind back to health without proper training. We were born this way :) I also relate with 2 lost pregnancy and feeling very alone with my husband not being able to relate and be emotionally supportive. I really want a family of my own. I believe we both do because he talks about it on good days. I hope you find some solice in my story. And if you would ever like to talk or rant privately please reach out and pm me.</TEXT>

One laser ablation and insertion and removal of a stero eeg. His neuro is going to do another med change. We're so desperate. And I am hoping someone has tried Skullcap and it working for them. Good or bad experiences please let us know. He's currently lamotrigine 150 mg 2x day and zonisamide 100 mg 2x day. He's tried Kepra(turned into keprage) and oxcarbazepine, cbd, and mmj. We plan on starting the keto diet and him taking skullcap with his new medication this week.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ask his neuro for a rescue medication if they haven't provided one yet. They will explain how and when to use it because you don't use it every time. A rescue med will save him trips to the hospital and give you some feeling of control. We didn't have it until 2 years after he was diagnosed. If his neuro team has a social worker befriend them. A social worker will help you and him find a support group. Reach out to friends and family for support. Seizures are really scary to witness. Even I still get scared, and I see them all the time. If you have any questions feel free to pm me whenever. And if he has a seizure in public, be assertive with the people around him to back away and give you space and not to call an ambulance unless you direct them too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My husband had the SEEG in February for 8 long days and 7 nights. He had 3 seizures during this time, and they still couldn't pinpoint the spot. I don't want to discourage you. He is thankful that he is not having another piece of his brain removed for nothing. Last year, he had left temporal lobe laser ablation and that procedure failed too. My advice for the hospital stay is to bring condiments to make the food better, invite visitors so your not alone all the time, and be friendly with house keeping they usually enjoy the conversation. The SEEG is going to be painful and annoying. Let the nurses know if it becomes intolerable because they will help you. My husband doesn't like pressing the nurse call button, so I usually do it for him. ;) It's going to be hard, but you can do this. Best wishes on your journey!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>MIL threatens suicide after her son's attempt</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-14 10:11:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>Sorry for the format because I am on mobile and a little emotional and needed to get this of my chest. Backstory: My husband's physical and mental health has been on the decline for the past couple years. He recently found out his mom was using drugs, and he confronted her about her usage (my God do I have backstories about the bs she has done) but anyways she hung up the phone on him and has not spoken to him since. Yesterday, DH attempted suicide, and I had him 5150'd because there was no more help I could give him. I informed 3 of his close relatives, his mom being one of them via text because I knew she was at work. She responds to me with "Let me know what's going on since he doesn't want anything to do with me now." I have dealt with my MILs petty remarks for 17 years, and I finally grew a backbone because I have had enough. I responded with the difficulties I have been having trying to contact the hospital to find out where DH is and how he is doing but then I went on "You need to get your shit together and be a fucking mom. This shit has been so fucking hard on us and now you're acting like this is so fucking uncalled for. Instead of 'let me know what's going on since he doesn't want anything to do with me now' you should have said 'how can I be there for you guys'. Grow up it's not all about you. He just tried to kill himself for god's sakes. And I am not dealing with this to well either." MIL responded with: "Dont tell me to get my shit together. You guys should have never believed what that methhead liar because he is stil doing it too." (Methhead liar is my brother in law, her other son, who she was using with) "I feel like killing myself too." So, I promptly contacted MIL closes relative to let them know what she said and may be suicidal. I don't take suicidal threats lightly, even from a narcissist that's clearly trying to manipulate me. This is the first time I have ever stood up to her and feels good even though the circumstances. I hope she find peace in her life.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Update: MIL threatens suicide after son's attempt</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-16 10:55:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I didn't think there would be an update but here we go. .. Someone reached out to my mil after DH got out of the hospital to let her know. She promptly texts him How much she loves him and that she would have come to visit but after what u/Loves_fluffy_things said to me she didn't think it would be appropriate for her to visit. DH then went on to apologize for what I said to her and down played it by saying she couldn't visit him anyways. Which was a lie because he was allowed visitors. Anyways, I have been a long time lurker to this sub and have seen similar shit that has gone down. I am DH full-time caretaker and I am not backing down to meth-momster (Can I use this nickname?). My boundaries are up, I know who her flying monkeys are, and she won't have the privilege of me feeding her information. I think with therapy my damn-darling wonderful husband will see what's going on, and find within himself to have the confidence to stick up for himself. I am getting therapy too :) Final question or thought: As I am reading what I wrote, Did Meth-momster and DH villainize me to help their relationship? Wtf?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He has always sugar coated everything for her. He is so scared to make her mad or lose her love. He didn't expect her to show up. This is her normal behavior, but I usually allow it to slide to not hinder our relationship. Even after what he texted back to her he said "great now my mom is going to hate me forever." And I was like why, you completely sided with her.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly feel have been going through the same worrying, touching him everytime he moves while he sleeps, not wanting to leave him by himself, sleepless nights. And then the doctors upping his meds and him turning into someone we both didn't recognize. This is what has been working for me: therapy for both of us, yoga in a class, gardening, playing guitar during extreme anxiety(when I can) and crafting. Right now I need all that to be sane. I reached out to his family and they all pulled away. They never really understood our struggle and thought 3 brain surgeries were no big deal and didn't even visit him in the hospital. Sometimes people suck and you have to make the best of it. Please feel free to PM me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi everyone this is my first time posting in this sub. Hell, I just subscribed minutes ago. Anyways, my husband is epileptic, and for the past 6 years of his diagnosis I have had the ability to predict his seizures and auras. I think I can feel a change in his vibrational frequency and it sends me into an anxious or paranoid type state, like I am very high alert. He doesn't even have to be in the same room or in the same area, I just know it. I feel like a seizure dog. Is there a name for this? Does this happen to anyone else? Is there a way to change the upsetting feeling it gives me into a positive one? Am I crazy?... probably</TEXT>

That will make it easy for you to collect the seeds so you can replant. Once I remove the seeds I let them dry on a paper towel over night.

    <TEXT>How are things going now? I know it's been a couple months and I hope it has gotten easier for you. I too had a mother(methhead) and her boyfriend (alcoholic) mooching off me in my early 20s while I attended college and working full time. Ugh I even bought them cigarettes. I'm 33 now and have minimal contact. I had to move 2 hours away to maintain my own sanity. The most important thing to me was puting yourself first. It was hard, like really hard. I dealt with shame, guilt, depression and anxiety because of the grief that I was failing my mom. I should have not felt any of that because she was intoxicated my whole life and drug me to drug dens with her. They are going to be a money pit and mental health destroyers until you stick up for yourself and set hard boundaries. They are not your responsibility. You can do it and it will be so liberating.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sometimes the general public just sucks and sometimes it's awesome. My husband had a seizure at the register at Target while checking out his purchase with his debit card in the machine and the people in the back of the line got aggravated, so I grabbed his card and we fell to a back corner while everyone continued with checking out their purchases and the cashier continued to ring them up. He has complex partial seizures, so I guess it didn't look seizurey enough for people to give a damn. And then there were other times like when we were at Lowes and an employee helped every step of the way, getting both of us a bottle water, nice chair to sit in, ice pack and helped us to our car. I am humbled by the "good" seizure times, and the other times I can't bare to think about. I'm glad you and your boyfriend are doing well now. Ugh and fuck that guy</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I talk to my plants and sometimes sing to them. I do it with the intent that they will grow strong and beautiful to provide flowers for the bees and fruits for my family. I never really thought it was a witchy thing to do. I have been out of touch with it the last couple weeks, so I should probably get out this morning and do it today. I also sow seeds on special days. I planted black eyed peas on new years day, a lemon tree on my birthday, and pumpkins on mine and my husbands anniversary. This maybe gross, but sometimes I spit on the seed right before watering, I don't know why, it just feels right, like a little extra nourishment.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Has anyone supplemented with Lion's Mane?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-11 13:12:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just bought Lion's Mane for my husband who has uncontrolled complex partial seizures about 7-9 per week. He's tried many different med combinations and had laser ablation on his left hippocampus with no relief. The surgery made the seizures more frequent and severe unfortunately. He's also tried CBd, valerian root, skullcap, and ginger tea along with his meds. Anyways that's a little bit of our back history. So now he's going to supplement his diet with Lion's Mane. I watched Paul Stamets, a renowned mycologist, on Joe Rogan talk about the neurological benifits of this mushroom, lions mane, and how it helps generate Neural Growth Factor. I talked to his neurologist and she approved him taking it. Has anyone tried it? Does it work? Is it snake oil?</TEXT>

As a child, I remember always being scared we were going to lose our home and they would tell me about all the bills and I that I asked for to much. Hearing it from someone else made me understand how toxic that situation was. Thank you for sharing your story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm getting my medical marijuana card!!! My life has been really hard the past couple years. My husband is disabled with epilepsy, we almost lost our home, our marriage hit rock bottom, we lost our health issurance, and now I'm sick with swollen lymph nodes but not diagnosed, and we both suffer depression and anxiety. Enough is enough, so I'm getting my fucking card. I want to throw a small party (5 people) for it and it needs to be diy and affordable. Some of my ideas are a taco bar, have a raffle, non alcoholic punch(I don't drink), some games and maybe a good stoner movie, maybe even an arts and crafts table. All suggestions are welcome and recipes. I'm so EXCITED!</TEXT>
