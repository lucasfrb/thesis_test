    <TEXT>I see a lot of YouTube videos where the uploader conveniently disables the comments on their videos. This is especially done by big channels and big companies like BBC, Apple, etc. Mostly, this is done on videos where controversial and critical comments are expected. This is nothing less than censorship and should not be allowed by YouTube. People deserve to voice their opinion.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Disappointed with Apple #8217;s iPhone repair service: My experience.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-21 03:49:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>I own an iPhone 8 Plus which I bought in 2017. Last week, my phone suddenly stopped working. It won #8217;t charge or turn on. I took my phone to Apple #8217;s official service provider to get it fixed. They told me that there is a problem with the motherboard of my phone and a repair is not possible. The only solution is to replace the entire phone which would cost almost as much as buying a new iPhone 8 Plus. I asked them if they had opened my phone to inspect. They simply replied that they have a machine that tells them what #8217;s wrong with the phone and opening it up wouldn #8217;t be necessary. After googling a bit about it, I learned that it can be easily fixed. I took my phone to a 3rd party service provider. And they said it can be fixed for $60 but the Touch ID would not work after fixing the motherboard. I was fine with it as it #8217;s still better than replacing the whole phone. Now if I want to fix the Touch ID on my phone, I need to replace the entire screen which would cost me nearly $200, even though there #8217;s nothing wrong with the screen. Apple doesn #8217;t offer partial repairs for iPhones. A simple replacement for the home button would be fair for the customers.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The police couldn #8217;t have saved Priyanka Reddy in Hyderabad.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-30 05:53:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>The brutal incident in Hyderabad left me devastated. There #8217;s a lot of misinformation being spread and a blame game between police and victim going on right now. Firstly, the incident happened on the Outer Ring Road that surrounds Hyderabad. It #8217;s 40 kms away from the city. It #8217;s basically like a highway and it #8217;s very hard to patrol every inch. Crimes can easily go unnoticed. Secondly, blaming the victim for not calling police is absolutely ridiculous. You never know how terrorised she was at that time and you can never expect victims to calmly call for help in the last minute. The fact that she called her family tells you how women don #8217;t trust or have faith in emergency services in India. The home minister of Telangana insensitively told that she should #8217;ve called police instead of her sister. What difference would that have made? That was a highway and there #8217;s no one around to help. There were also reports that police initially weren #8217;t helpful when the family approached to lodge a complaint. This is unfortunate and most of the police in India aren #8217;t trained in gender sensitisation. Women are afraid and hesitant to approach police and report sexual crimes. Predators are everywhere in this country and it #8217;s impossible and impractical to stop crimes. The only thing government can do is it fast track the justice process and consistently punish the rapists with capital punishment. This will make a big difference and will make these predators think twice before committing a crime. We also need a reliable emergency response service that works like swiggy and help reaches you in minutes. This can only be achieved if govt privatises this and invests more money.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-01-12 23:10:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>!!Spoilers ahead!! In Ala Vaikunthapurramulo, Valmiki switches the babies in hospital. No matter how evil that was, his original intention was only to provide a son to his boss, whose son was presumed to be dead. Even though he went ahead and switched the babies, his intention to sacrifice his own baby needs to be appreciated. The problem with the movie is, his original intention was never discussed again in the movie. For the entire movie, he was bashed by AA for switching him but he never tells him why he had to do it. This is a big moral flaw and poor writing by Trivikram.</TEXT>

The emotional performances by Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel keeps the movie dramatic until the very end. It appeals to a smaller section of audience. If you #8217;re one of them, don #8217;t miss this.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sometimes, brewing just half a cup of coffee is enough. Saves a lot of money.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-01 05:50:44</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello r/coffee. I want to explain why I eventually switched to brewing just half a cup of coffee instead of a full cup. The ratio I use is 10 grams of coffee with 165 ml of water. (Brewing method - Pour Over) I noticed how my coffee gets a little cold by the time I get to the bottom of my cup. I don #8217;t like reheating my coffee, so I just throw away the last 20% of my cup. It may just be me, but enjoying the coffee to the last drop never happened to me, despite making great tasting coffee without any bitterness. So I decided to brew just 10 grams instead of 15 grams. It makes 160-170 ml of coffee which is approximately half a cup. This has worked out perfectly for me and it may work out for you too. Now I #8217;m saving my coffee. (I save 5 grams of coffee per day, which is 150 grams per month. That #8217;s 15 cups of extra coffee per month). Also, my coffee doesn #8217;t get cold since I finish it quicker. If you #8217;re someone who doesn #8217;t need to make a full of coffee and half cup does it for you, brewing with this ratio makes a huge difference. Thanks!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love RPAN and I'm always looking forward for the next time it goes live. And one of the major reasons why I'm always excited is because it's limited. And also because not everyone knows about it. If RPAN goes live permanently, it'll strip the creativity off the streamers and doesn't make them think. And also a LOT of new people discover this and hinder the overall quality of the streams. I think it's perfect as it is right now. RPAN should go live once a week at most.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I see a lot of posts about the roof finally helping Djokovic this year. Can anyone explain how? I think it helps Nadal even more. The roof keeps the surface dry and moisture out. It makes sure the balls bounce more. When the roof is closed, it keeps the wind out which doesn't exactly benefit Djokovic. Rafa and Novak played a very balanced match under the roof on grass and if those conditions are created on clay, Rafa will clearly have the upper hand.</TEXT>

As I said before, without context, my comment makes little sense because it's a reply to someone else who now deleted their original comment. If you want me to present facts, sure. Mughals invaded India and conquered some parts of India. But they didn't loot our country. They made it their home. The idea of Mughals being foreign to India was never even an "issue". In their rule, India saw the longest period of peace without wars. It was a significant part of our history. And also, Mughals defeated the Lodhi kingdom in Delhi (who are also Islamic), which started the Mughal empire. And Mughals didn't rule with an ideology of religious conversion. They coexisted with Hindu rulers. We still generate 70% of our revenue from tourism through Mughal architecture. And yes, religious conversion did happen under Mughals. But it's insignificant. Blame the Sultanate in Delhi for that. Mughals ended the sultanate in Delhi and brought normalcy. They made India centralized. The Hindu kingdoms in South worked together with the Mughals for development of the country. And yes, this doesn't mean we must idolize the Mughals. But we can't ignore the fact that they brought significant changes in India which in the long run helped us.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dude, it's based on the same report released by archaeological survey of India. Here's the same story from different websites - [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/taj-mahal-and-agra-fort-are-among-the-two-highest-revenue-generating-monuments-for-2015-2018/as67882800.cms) [Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/taj-mahal-agra-fort-qutub-minar-among-top-10-revenue-generating-monuments-govt-119020501224_1.html) And why is it hard to believe that we generate most of our tourism revenue from Indo-Islamic architecture? On a completely different note, here's a comparison on how important Taj Mahal is for our tourism. Our govt earns around 100 Cr per year from Taj Mahal on average. ([Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/with-100-jump-in-footfall-taj-earned-rs-119-crore-from-ticket-sales-in-2018/articleshow/67372193.cms)) It cost approx 2000 Cr to build Statue of Unity ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/politics/statue-of-unity-worlds-tallest-statue-constructed-in-record-33-months/articleshow/66446458.cms)) So, even if we assume that statue makes half the money as Taj Mahal does per year, it would take 40 years for our govt to recover the cost of the construction . Now you can understand how important are historical structures for our tourism.</TEXT>

Can't predict questions like state syllabus. Most of the schools have tie-ups with coaching institutes for entrance exam prep. Or, you can go for private coaching for those exams.

    <TEXT>Come out of your tiny rabbit hole and stop generalizing everything. Muslims in Hyderabad didn't vote for Pakistan's formation. Most of the Muslims here came from northern side of India before partition because they were facing religious discrimination. People who voted for Pakistan's formation left and followed Jinnah to Pakistan. Those who stayed back here only did because they have their livelihood here and India welcomed diversity. Learn a little bit of history before commenting shit.</TEXT>

Also, watch Pushpaka Vimana (1987). This is possibly my favorite South Indian movie of all time. This is a silent film, made in the 80s.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is no specific reason to ask about your family. It just allows us to examine your communication skills. If a candidate is not able to confidently tell about his family briefly, then it's assumed he won't be able to associate well with their colleagues and establish a rapport with them. No matter what questions the HR asks, they only determine your fit in their company based on your body language, clarity in expressing yourself, etc. Just be confident. Remember, you don't have to explain the financial status of your family, or even the names, professions of your family members. Just tell them if you are the only child and sum up your relationship in one line.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;The thing is whatever i say i am going to get negative votes. I didn't downvote your post or comments.  gt;Lets just leave it to that we have different thinking. Nope, it's not discrimination. It's in a way, it's positive discrimination. Women get special coaches and reserved seats in metro and city buses. But no one ever complained. These loyalties make Delhi much safer for women. Women who couldn't afford bus rides are now talking buses everyday and reaching home safely. Are men getting sexually attacked frequently in Delhi?  gt;implementation should have been better based multiple criteria like to women who need it not to everyone Rich women from South Delhi and other affluent places won't take DTC buses. And if women feel it's embarrassing to take a free ride, they can refuse it and pay for the ticket. Kejriwal mentioned that too.  gt; I am not sure but I don't think nowhere it proves that giving free transport to women uplift them. Is that why women ridership in DTC and metro fell drastically in the last 10 years? And it's just improving right now in DTC because of the free rides.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The super smart Roger Federer engineered and formulated a new virus in his biology lab in Geneva, Switzerland to stop tennis and save his grand slam record. His plan didn't exactly go according to the schedule. If it did, Australian Open would've been cancelled too. But better late than never. He withdrew from Indian Wells, Miami and the clay season, knowing well in advance that these tournaments would be cancelled due to the virus he formulated. Now, French Open could most likely be cancelled, preventing his best friend and lover, Rafa Nadal, from winning his 20th grand slam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can't evaluate team sports like that. The bottom line is, they did it. In a competition like UCL, that doesn't require consistency over a long term (like the domestic league), winners are not always determined by being tactically perfect. Atletico were a better side when they played the final against Madrid in 2014. Yet, they lost because a corner. That's the nature of this competition.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Long time ago, reddit lo oka post choosa. ee method ippudu use avtundu. This method will work only if you are okay with downloading movies from torrents. Step 1: Pick a good movie and watch it. Step 2: The next movie you pick must star one of the co-actors from the movie you just watched. The only exception is that you can't pick the lead actor. For example, if you watch Inception, the next movie you pick should star Tom Hardy or Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Ellen Page. If you pick Tom Hardy, choose a Tom Hardy movie - Venom. After watching Venom, I'll pick a Michelle Williams' movie like Blue Valentine... and so on.  #8203; This method will give you a good mix of movies, while keeping things random.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, the Chinese control the information vigorously. The virus is actually believed to have started infecting people back in October in China. And deaths in China are less than Italy and soon US and UK will possibly surpass, which everyone knows is because the Chinese govt is clearly misreporting their cases. But in this thread, the point I made is quite simple, which has nothing to do with any propaganda. It is something that is being spread on WhatsApp. I know that the point I made is trivial, a very annoying nitpick.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;I find it very hard to believe you said this. Really? Why would I like or defend China? It is virtually a fascist country with political repression. Is there any opposition in China? China is a country without any freedom of press or free and open internet. There is nothing that can be trusted that comes from their media or govt. They control every piece of information that their own people access on internet, TV. They have no human rights, anyone who speaks against the govt is basically a dead man. In one word, it's an organised govt run in a sophisticated structure, which is why no one knows their so-called process. Coming to this outbreak, last month I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P-P4vrY1Oc), explaining why Chinese wet markets cause so many outbreaks. It's not just their wildlife trade, but their basic lack of hygiene and a lack of food safety standards concerning meat. Their wildlife protection act is full of loopholes, and it allows the poor of China to do whatever they want.</TEXT>

And it ends convincingly, where everything just works. And no, I don't think Interstellar is better than Arrival. Interstellar was a better cinematic experience. To watch it on IMAX 70mm is a pure joy. Arrival is a better movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely Nodia. Because of the following reasons: - Better public transport (Delhi metro is world class and DTC buses are awesome. You can also go for e-ricks and autos are cheaper than Bangalore) - House rents are cheap, compared to Bangalore. And availability is awesome. - Winter in Delhi lasts from 2nd week of October to 1st week or April. That is 6 months of awesome, chilly weather. - Social life in Delhi pretty good and usually have more options than Bangalore. - Delhi has better access to green spaces and public parks. On the contrary, here are some reasons I wouldn't go for Delhi/Noida: - Despite 6 months of chilly weather, the other 6 months can be quite hot. Loo winds in May and June will raise temps to 45 - 50 degrees. July to September will be humid as fuck. - Pollution. Nothing to say about this. Air quality suffers for 4 weeks in October and generally, it's pretty bad throughout the year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also, the [Leader theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiGig8TyRoE) is one of the best instrumentals ever composed. Goosebumps everytime I listen to it. Edit: This theme is unique for one reason. The original [Maa Telugu Thalliki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqivXUY9teo), sung by Tanguturi Suryakumari is the basis of the main theme that runs throughout the movie. This can also be seen in Inception. Hans Zimmer used an extrapolation of the French song Non, Je ne regrette rien and composed the main theme of the movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here #8217;s some background on why Delhi #8217;s pollution peaks only in the month of October, for about 3 weeks. The farmers from the surrounding states of Haryana, Punjab and UP burn stubble to remove the crop residue quickly. Since Delhi has no control over the laws of those states, it suffers the worst period of pollution in October. It #8217;s not that bad all the time, still the air quality is pretty bad overall.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is blooming coffee really necessary?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-23 05:11:21</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m trying to find out what exactly blooming achieves. In theory, every one says it #8217;s necessary because it releases Co2, extracts better. I #8217;ve been drinking pour over coffee for 3 years and I experimented many ways of making a good pour over. The most controversial thing I #8217;ve been doing for a few months is not blooming the coffee and I don #8217;t see it affect the coffee in any way. From what I observed, the hotter the water, the more it blooms. And lighter roasts tend to bubble more than darker roasts. This is possibly dependent on how permeable the coffee is. Light roasts have a longer draw down time because it #8217;s less permeable. This is possibly the reason why dark roasts don #8217;t bloom as much, especially after the beans turn old. Irrespective of all this, I notice no difference in taste whatsoever. I was so obsessed that I had done a blind taste test of coffee that #8217;s bloomed and not bloomed and couldn #8217;t tell them apart.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Naughty Dog is not that kind of a company, that misleads its fans into buying their game based on false advertising. Just look at their history. Anyway, that's not the point. Naughty Dog will not do anything to improve the game, because it doesn't need any improvements. The writers/director want to tell a story and it must be told how it was meant to be told. They are not going to bend to the so called "fans" like you demanding a better story, just because it doesn't align with your views. Still, there is no context to the leaks. The game campaign is 30 hours long and you can't possibly judge it based on the leaks. You know how ND's games work. You gotta experience the game from the start to finish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>RPAN is a simple livestream where Redditors can live stream anything interesting, for a short time (1 hour max). But it goes live for a few hours on pre-selected dates. Typically once a week. (You can find schedules on r/pan) The streams are very creative. Like people all around the world record themselves playing a musical instrument, taking song requests, cooking, daily routines, etc. When I made that post, many people were requesting to make it a 24/7 thing, live all the time. I just argued that if it's made permanent, people wouldn't be as creative because there's nothing exciting about it if it's on air all the time.</TEXT>

The problem is, when you compare how many women face molestation, abuse and even simple eve teasing in general, the number is so huge. Instead of addressing the root problem, we undermine it by pointing out the flaws in someone who's making a general statement like "all men are monsters".</TEXT>

Take any Telugu movie, this is the case. Hero ammayila gurinchi goppaga cheptene aa ammayiki artham avtundi. The director is not giving that position of power to female roles to stand up for themselves and in each and every movie, they want the male characters to enlighten everyone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Time travel is theoretically possible. Before you learn about this, you should forget the notions you already have with time travel. Don't think of it like magic or a technology. It's simple physics. The simplest form of time travel happens when something travels faster than the speed of light. Let's say, a beam of light is travelling from Earth to Mars. It takes 182 seconds for light to reach Mars from Earth. If a particle travels faster than light, say it reaches in just 100 seconds, that's time travel. If both those particles start at the same time, the fastest particle reaches Mars 80 seconds before light. (That particle is from the future for light). Now take this concept to a larger scale. Imagine you can travel 10 times faster than light. With respect to light, you will always be from the future. Because people will see you much before they see light, even though you started at the same time. All of this is only possible on paper. As we know, nothing can travel faster than light.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;Reddit is all about staying away from mainstream content. Not true. Reddit is an agglomeration of links and a news aggregator website. It is a place where people post reputable, reliable links. It's the only way to make sure what you're reading is 100% factual. That's how news breaks on Reddit. Reddit is not about being the first place to discover things. That usually happens on twitter. #160;Redditors react to news. #160;Most of the meme content submitted here is directly from facebook pages and OPs even admit to that.  gt;Appati varaku adhi rotta content aipothadhi. You can post your podcast with the title changed to something like "Listen to this interesting podcast. I loved it". Don't just suggest that you're promoting your own content. However, this practice is still frowned upon on Reddit. Users are still advised to post less than 10% of links from their own sources. The aim of this rule is to promote quality content, not to turn Reddit into a place where you can write about yourself. Reddit is one big community. For example, if your podcast is published by Chai Bisket or any other Telugu website, you can post their link, citing your podcast. That is acceptable because it's not considered as self promotion. #160; When you posted a direct link to your own podcast, with the title saying something like "Please listen to my podcast and share your feedback", it's you being on reddit to promote your content. You are not contributing to Reddit. Rather, using reddit to your advantage. #160;If you really want to promote your podcast on Reddit, you can pay Reddit to display an advertisement. If Reddit allows self-promotion, it will cause a big flux of low-quality content and people can't differentiate what is genuinely posted or what is posted for personal gains.  #8203;  gt;at the end of the day, you will only see content that the mods like and will keep.....irrespective of what the sub people like. This is anything but democracy......especially true in major subs. Do you read subreddit specific rules before posting and make sure you're not breaking any rule? If not, the mods cite a rule that you are breaking and give you a reason for post removal. I called it an extreme democracy because Reddit lives by its rules.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sony really doesn #8217;t care about the specs. They will reveal technical details and continue to prove their point by making good exclusives like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man. I remember when PS4 and PS4 Pro launched, people were always talking about how inferior the specs were, compared to Xbox One and One S. But in the end, it didn #8217;t make much of a difference. I guess fans will realize that both consoles will be great irrespective of specs. If they really care about specs, they should go for PC.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The DualShock 4 #8217;s headphone jack completely changed the way I experience games, movies and TV shows.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-26 12:52:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>The headphone jack is the most useful feature of PS4. Sometimes I think it #8217;s a feature most of the users take for granted and a bit underappreciated. After I bought the PS4, I never used my TV speakers or the sound bar. The headphone jack just magically solves all the problems. As an added bonus, it also causes no disturbance for others in the house. It #8217;s great for games but I probably like it more when watching movies on Blu Ray or Netflix. It #8217;s great that Sony confirmed this feature will be available on PS5 #8217;s DualSense controller. Edit: To the people who are asking what's so great about a headphone jack, let me explain. Without the headphone jack, you are forced to buy only compatible wireless headphones, which are expensive, to use them with PS4. (This was the case with PS3. Headphone gaming used to be very expensive). But with this headphone jack, you can plug any headphones to get all audio directed into them. Edit 2: To clarify further, this is not a feature I just discovered. This is more like an appreciation for a feature I've loved ever since getting the PS4.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The visual quality you are talking about is entirely dependent on the DOP #8217;s vision. I feel our commercial directors have less control over these technical aspects. I am a big fan of movies that are colour graded to look warm (yellowish gold colour). We can see this style in David Fincher #8217;s movies and also very popular in Bollywood with directors like Imtiaz Ali (Tamasha). Recent ga vacchina Telugu movies lo Agent Srinivasa Atreya was really well made in this department. Excellent colour grading and use of colours to set mood. Also, HIT movie. They have extensive scenes with warm/amber lighting, which is perfect for crime thrillers. If you are talking about VFX (visual effects), that is an entirely different topic. Our movie budgets won #8217;t allow us to reach Hollywood style of VFX. It #8217;s as simple as that. To put things in perspective, the budget of The Social Network (2010) is 40 million dollars and Babhubali (our most expensive film) is 34 million dollars. And social network doesn #8217;t have any visual effects or graphics. They invest more on technical stuff, cast. But we simply can #8217;t.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think the best thing to do right now is to avoid legal procedures as far as possible. Try talking to neighbours around the house and seek their help to create an urgency and force the tenant to vacate or pay rent. If this doesn't work, complain to the police. If you have any contacts in police, they can give a warning to the tenant. If none of these work, then go for legal procedure by contacting a lawyer. This should be your last resort because these things will ultimately cost you more than the rent they need to pay you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Check the basic stuff first. Connect PS4 to your TV with HDMI and check if it #8217;s working. Faulty HDMI ports is a big one on used PS4s. Check if it #8217;s outputting sound. Make sure all the buttons are responsive on the controller. Play any disc based game to check the cd drive. Check if the system is making any rattling noises. Finally, connect to a network and perform a speed test to see if all the internet drivers are working. If it passes all these tests, your PS4 is in very good condition. Before using it, make sure you clean dust from the inside of the PS4 by removing top cover. (Check videos on YouTube for reference)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. Definitely fake. It #8217;s most likely a pre owned game which is fake sealed. This is not a new game. This is not a proper seal as the plastic wrap is stretching around the corners. This doesn #8217;t happen with original sealed games. Also, it #8217;s missing the PS4 band ,that around the case, at the bottom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem is not with the reviewers, but it #8217;s with the gamers and fans. After the leaks, everyone #8217;s so mad and inclined to hate the game, no matter what. I think all the reviews make perfect sense if you know the history of how that channel/reviewer always reviews games. IGN, for example, is always about the opinion about the person who reviews the game. And their review was good but it had dislikes because fans didn #8217;t want to see a 10/10 score. I don #8217;t give a shit about reviews (and most people don #8217;t either). TLOU2 will be one of the top selling games on PS4. People aren #8217;t gonna stop buying it just coz groups of people make it their point to dislike videos on internet. TR;DL: Don #8217;t just use the reviews to have them validate your opinion. Play the game for yourself before disliking and disagreeing with others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, also the way the leaks happened, everyone made it a point to hate everything about the game without actually playing it. And I guess that was the purpose of the leaks. The people who leaked it wanted to destroy the reputation of the game. Because they were taken out of context and the perspectives of characters. Gameplay and the survival horror was great and I think story was very ambitious. But I don #8217;t think as many people would #8217;ve hated the game if the leaks never happened.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pretty much, yes. See the reviews on Amazon, metacritic. There is no certified review tag on amazon (meaning they never bought the game). And they just give 1 star reviews because they didn #8217;t like what they saw in the leaks. It #8217;s basically like a circlejerk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not really. Watch Skill Up's review on youtube. That is proper criticism and I don't have any issues coz he actually criticized the game and gave reasons why he disliked it. But the reviews on Metacritic and dislikes on youtube clearly show people circle jerking. For instance, TLOU (2013) has around 10k user reviews on Metacritic after 7 years of launch. TLOU2 already has close to 19k user reviews, in less than 2 days of launch. It's 100% clear that majority of these users didn't even purchase the game. They are just giving 1 star reviews without even playing it for themselves. This is not criticism, it's just hatred.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with all that you said but if they are making players play for 10 hours as Abby, they shouldn't have marketed the game by using Ellie and her revenge as the premise in all the teasers and trailers. You see, Ellie is someone everyone loves from Part 1 and everyone wants to play as Ellie. She's the hero, at least that's how the trailers marketed the game. I get the fact that they wanted playing as Abby to be a surprise and a twist, but unfortunately, I never cared about her, despite a solid storyline. Because I am already invested completely in Ellie, from the first game and also from the first half of Part 2. The momentum was strong, Ellie was my hero. But then, shit hits the fan and you have to play as Abby almost until the game ends.. It just sucks. Why did I spend all this time investing and immersing myself in Ellie, only to play as Abby? Nah, didn't work for me. Sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Naughty Dog was afraid to portray an anti-hero, instead goes the other route and tries to touch mortality, which is the reason the game fails to deliver. God of War did it well. Kratos says to Athena "I'm your monster no longer" At this point, the gamers understand who kratos is. They don't take the moral high ground. Another example, Breaking Bad. The show just portrays Walt as a criminal in the later seasons of the show but it never tells the viewers what's right or wrong. The viewers are not dumb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt;But at the last moment, when she's about to kill Abby, it's not Joel's death that flashes before her eyes. It's a peaceful memory of him playing guitar on his porch. A memory about forgiveness. And at that moment she understands that it's not worth it, that this isn't what's causing her PTSD, and that she needs to let go of her anger, the same way she tried to do for Joel. That's why she lets Abby go. Brilliantly put in words. I thought of this when Joel's memory flashes in Ellie's mind. But obviously due to the abstract nature of the ending, it's impossible for the gaming community to understand it or see it because this kind of symbolism is used in movies and it's very rare in video games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes. You are. Because the movie is made in USA, it appeals to the majority (English speakers). But when Italian speakers watch it, they can relate to it on a different level. You'll be thrilled to find out they're speaking your language.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Very easy to get the platinum. But it #8217;s not possible unless you start a new game plus because characters need to be fully upgraded. Before you begin your New Game Plus, I advise you to collect artifacts, trading cards, coins and unlock all safes and find all work benches. This can be easily done by selecting individual sub sections in each chapter. The game will display how many you already collected. Use high contrast mode from accessibility to easily find items. After you collect everything, start a new game plus. And fully upgrade your character (both Ellie and Abby) and craft every item, weapon upgrade.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, absolutely. But the ending wouldn't feel as emotional and nostalgic if you don't play the previous games. But story wise, UC4 does a good job to stay relevant to new comers. If you're planning to play the old games, skip the first one. It's not worth playing now. Start with Uncharted 2.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Seems pretty exaggerated to say PS Now is not good or competitive. For the price I #8217;m paying per year (38 USD), I got nothing to complain. Game pass is very expensive in comparison. Even during a sale, it costs 80 USD to 100 USD. And even for that price, the AAA titles on both services are mostly balanced. PS Now has Control, Bloodborne, F1 2019, Watch Dogs 2, Just Cause 4, Metro Exodus, Evil Within 2, Shadow of Tomb Raider, Doom and PS3 games. If you compare the big games on Game Pass, you #8217;ll find that list pretty balanced when compared to PS Now. It has some good games like Witcher 3, Nier Automata, Hellblade and a few Xbox exclusives like Forza, Gears, Halo.</TEXT>

It #8217;s one of the blandest scripts I #8217;ve ever known. But that #8217;s how Unchrated games have always been. They are super fun to play. And the epilogue of UC4 is masterfully crafted, to say goodbye to the series. With that said, I also think TLOU2 #8217;s narrative and script is so complex, easily one of the best scripts I #8217;ve come across in linear games.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Far Cry 5 is the best game from the list you mentioned and for  #163;7, it #8217;s a great deal. Personally I feel AC origins and Watch dogs 2 are very weak in terms of story and graphics, when compared to FC5.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;m probably in the minority, but I really didn #8217;t enjoy this game much. The world looks beautiful, combat is great. But everything else is forgettable. The story quests make no sense and it follows an outdated system of investigating places, looking for clues and reaching waypoints. The combat is mostly enjoyable but the camera movement really takes away some fun. Only a few open world games like Witcher 3, Red Dead 2 can achieve what GoT was hoping to achieve. It is a good game, but I don #8217;t see myself playing it again after beating the story. It #8217;s just forgettable.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is possible because the game doesn #8217;t demand much from PS4. It #8217;s under 50 GB and they were able to  #8216;soften #8217; everything in the open world as a part of their design choice for this game. Texture memory is so low, almost non existent. Horizon Zero Dawn was able to achieve graphics that look 5 years ahead of this game even though it came out in 2017. I feel this game doesn #8217;t push the PS4 or utilize its full potential.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Because PlayStation Now + PS Plus combo is cheaper than game pass ultimate. I pay 35 USD for PS+ and 40 USD for PS Now for a year (I buy during days of play sale). That is 75 USD per year. Microsoft #8217;s game pass ultimate costs $100 a year during a sale. So I guess most people in this sub don #8217;t see this. PlayStation offers better value. I don #8217;t see much difference in AAA games offered in both services. PS Now started offering better games for downloading over the last 1 year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The streaming is shitty. Unfortunately PS3 titles can #8217;t be played on PS4 locally. I never use the streaming service. Only use the downloadable games. I guess the games PS Now provides are decent enough. They could add more exclusives but the way Sony treats their exclusives, they aren #8217;t meant to be offered for everyone in a Netflix-like model. They believe in big first party games and expect their users to buy them at full price. The same can #8217;t be said for Microsoft. They make cheap games and are able to offer them on day 1 on game pass. For Sony, quality  gt; quantity.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, it's not a 'few' trees. There are around 500 trees in that complex, most of which were planted in the Nizam era. All of them were cut down. [Source](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyderabad-group-offers-translocate-trees-telangana-secretariat-site-128810). Most of these trees take around 20-30 years to fully grow and it'd be almost impossible to relocate these trees because the cost of relocation is so crazy high. And relocation doesn't solve the problem of tree cutting, because it destroys the local ecosystem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is exactly what I meant when I said people always expect a masterpiece from Nolan. I saw similar reactions when Dunkirk came out, but I absolutely loved it.. it was his best film in my opinion. I will however judge Tenet only after I experience it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If Messi stays now, it would really taint his image, ethically. It would confirm the fact that he blackmailed the club to get what he wanted. I just really wish he leaves, which is good for the club and himself.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So if Messi stays only if Barto resigns, that directly means that he #8217;s putting himself above the club. It #8217;s ethically a bad move by Messi.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If he leaves, then it #8217;s not bad ethically and I would respect Messi for that. But by the looks of it, it seems that Messi wants Barto gone in order to stay at Barca, which is just ethically wrong, IMO. That is just Messi putting his interests ahead of the club #8217;s. Loyalty goes both ways. Barca has been loyal to Messi with the contract extensions, wages, etc. And Messi decision of staying shouldn #8217;t depend on the president resigning. Because he #8217;s in no position to demand that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s not the point. Messi is indirectly demanding the sacking of the entire board. No matter how BIG Messi is, he #8217;s in no position to make a demand like that in order to continue at Barca. And I genuinely believe that Messi really wants to leave and that he #8217;s not doing all this to get Barto to resign. And I hope he leaves. That #8217;s the best thing that could happen to Messi, if he could part ways with Barca without any legal battles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What do you mean by  #8216;overtaken #8217;? It sound so silly and pointless. Both of them excel at different things. Nolan is a master at creating blockbusters and epic movies. And he does it with original scripts, pulling audience into theaters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>They have very different styles. Villeneuve established himself as a great sci fi director, but I like his earlier works like Incendies and Polytechnique. What I admire about him is the fact that he doesn't try to make his movies accessible to general audience or casual moviegoers. Nolan, on the other hand, is old school and prefers style over substance. And I've never found it to be a problem. I absolutely enjoy the epic stuff he creates in his movies. And I often find it amusing when people compare these two, or any other director with Nolan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Miles Morales Honestly, I don't get the hype. People are excited because it's Spiderman. But even if they show the gameplay tomorrow, I don't think I'll get really excited about this game. I get a feeling that this will be a low-effort game from Insomniac. The campaign will probably be about 8-10 hours, with a predictable story and no replay value. I'm not ready to spend $60 (or 70) for it on day 1.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Games on Game Pass doesn't mean you own the games. Games will keep leaving the service. And you won't get big games (like Cyberpunk, far cry, AC, GTA, etc) on gamepass from day 1. To buy these games digitally, you will have to spend 4500 or 5000 and you can't sell them again. Microsoft will only add their first party games from day 1 (like forza, halo). Personally, I think it's better to buy the Series X. The difference is just 15k. And it will be worth it when you buy a new AAA game and sell it after a few months. Edit : Series S is not as powerful as X. Not even 4K.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you take the Game pass ultimate subscription, Live Gold and Game Pass are bundled together, which is a better deal. Having the option of buying cheap physical CDs is always great. CeX sells them for high price. It #8217;s good for selling your physical CDs though. They give a good price. Live gold gives you some discounts on games occasionally, but they #8217;re still expensive compared to physical CDs, because you can sell your physical CD after you keep it for a few months. For example, if you sell Cyberpunk 2077 CD after keeping it for 3-4 months, you #8217;ll still get 2500-2700.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Anyone else dislike the subscription model for games?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-29 16:33:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Maybe I #8217;m in the minority here but I feel there isn #8217;t enough discussion about this. I #8217;m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games. I was really excited to try out services like PS Now/Game pass, but unfortunately I never touched 90% of the mediocre games they offer in the library. Maybe it #8217;s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment. It #8217;s not like watching an average popcorn flick on Netflix and have a good time. I just can #8217;t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There #8217;s nothing worse than playing a bad game. There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models. I really love the monthly free games offered on PlayStation Plus because for most months, they do give decent games. But this subscription model just doesn #8217;t seem to click with me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So they think all the amazing AAA games Sony delivered for the PS4 in the last 7 years without using any subscription mode will suddenly go down the drain because Microsoft bought some studios? It #8217;s impossible to make games like TLOU2, Uncharted 4, God of War and offer them for peanuts on game pass. I #8217;d rather have a few quality games than having an overwhelming amount of them. Again, that #8217;s why I wrote in my post that it #8217;s specifically how I play games. It could be different for others.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>PS Plus + PS Now combined will cost you 60 dollars a year if you buy them during days of play sale or if you buy from CDKeys. They're always on sale. Gamepass ultimate will cost you 120 a year at the very least. And not to mention, PlayStation's online userbase is so big and it's easy to find a match or join other players in BR's. Xbox is underpopulated. And Gamepass day 1 games are possible because Microsoft makes mediocre games at best. They can't deliver high quality first party titles like Sony.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>HDR itself is a very confusing standard and many manufactures fail to keep up. A VA panel with 500 nits and above is enough to produce a very good HDR experience because naturally VA panels produce very good blacks. Local dimming also needs to be well implemented with more dimming zones. Many cheap entry level local dimming TVs suffer with blooming issues and it #8217;s so much better to turn it off sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>What is this obsession with 120 hz gaming? Most of the console gamers (that I know) care mostly about graphical fidelity in games. If you suddenly jump on the 120 hz bandwagon, you will be disappointed because higher framerate means you must sacrifice graphics. 4k @ 60 FPS is the benchmark the next gen consoles should be aiming. This is hard enough to achieve in big AAA games.</TEXT>
