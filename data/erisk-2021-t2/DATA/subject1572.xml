    <TEXT>What char do you use as leader/support? you're builds pretty good. I suggest you get his uniform and take advantage of the sale his 3rd skill gives him a damage boost and a heal. When I use QS for WBU I pair him up with WS and Ronin(L). Another thing, whats your skill rotation?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suggest going for GBI if you do TL, but for WBU Crit is pretty good. My QS is also level 62 and Ive been able to win some TL with him using Angel as leader but that was way back when his Uni got released. As for WBU I mainly use him for Corvus. You can check my QS to compare since where both level 62 my IGN is XIUJDD</TEXT>

But now that they removed majority of the game modes I find it a REALLY bad move to put Win Danger Room once in the daily missions its a bunch of BS if you ask me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well you cant use a stopwatch until ten minutes if you have the perfect timing rune and the items that come from using a stopwatch are late game items (GA, Zhonyas (Zhonyas can be a mid game item depending on the situation)). Its actually a neat addition if you ask me, it can make some great plays and it can only be used once. Once its been used up you have 2 options either rush the completed item (Eg. Mages usually would rush Zhonyas once their stopwatch is used since most lack mobility) or dodge all the enemy attacks and survive then complete the item late game (Eg. GA is usually a last item pick for carries and assassins). It also costs 600 gold if you dont use the perfect timing rune which is a bit costly for its effect (considering its a one time use item) I wouldnt say its broken, it might appear broken because of how the pros utilize it but its a different situation in low elo (currently in Bronze 1 and people still tend to misplay with a stopwatch). Compared to Spear of Shojin, Stopwatch isnt anywhere near broken imo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From your op.gg it seems like you only play Malzahar. Also as a fellow Malzahar main what do they mean by you dont lane properly? Malzahar has one of the best laning phases because of his E and is a great roaming threat once he gets to lvl 6 because of his R. Orianna and Veigar have great laning as well but have mana issues early like Malzahar. Ori spams her Q and E a lot for laning like Malzahar, and Veigar spams Q and W. The difference I would say is that Malzahar isnt a strong team fight champion as compared to Orianna and Veigar. A well timed Orianna R can be a significant Advantage for your team. Veigar can one shot squishy champions with his E W R combo. Dont own Qiyana and I dont play Annie a lot so I cant say much about them. I would say dont drop Malzahar and instead make him a sort of pocket pick also I suggest expanding your Champion Pool.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I suggest playing ranked after you #8217;re familiar with at least 2 roles. I play Mid or Supp mostly so when I first played ranked I choose mid or supp. Also try to master the basic mechanics of at least 5 heroes in your role (worked for me at least). A good example of this is knowing when to use your ultimate in a teamfight, how to react to certain situations, how to counterplay youre opponents champions, etc. Once you get comfortable you should be able to play competitively for your 10 placement matches. Also learn how to ward especially for supp and jungler. Thats just the basics of how I overcame my rank anxiety hope it helps</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Question about Photographer</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 09:55:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>So by far Photographer is the Hunter I face most in my matches (around 5 times a day). I #8217;ve noticed something unusual about them. Not all seem to use the camera world advantage (I like to Think of it as one) when chasing survivors. My question is: when a photographer does use the camera world is it safe to go inside it? If so, How risky is it to save someone in the camera world? Another would be why dont some Photographer users use the camera world at all?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Like I said Luca came before Melly. Based on Netease skin patterns Luca should get a skin before Melly. So thats why people are upset. Personally I #8217;m ok with using Moldy Bread for now but yeah people are really expecting it. Also there was already a confirmed A skin for Luca and people were expecting it in Essence 3 so theres that. Another reason is maybe since not many use Entomologist as much as Prisoner so only a few players would actually benefit from it. Had it been Prisoner who would get a skin Im sure a lot of people would spend money to get essences just to open them for a chance to receive the skin. The Ann player base is happy since shes been neglected for quite some time. Also regarding your last statement while it is true, a lot of players (generally speaking not just IDV) really love to use skins since it gives them a different version of their favourite character or they use skins cause the base look of a character isnt good for them (tbh Im planning on buying Mad Eyes now since I got his Scrooge skin). Also expect people to rant about skins a lot (as someone coming from League of Legends this is completely normal)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. I usually play 1 hour of rank for each faction (1 hour survivor and 1 hour Hunter) and I'm pretty comfortable with the characters that I use for each faction. I just felt stressed cause I lost in a promotion match (I'm Spider I and if I on my last game I would've been Cobra). I'm just kinda frustrated at how bad my luck gets whenever I have a promotion match (When I play Surv I usually get found first and recently in Hunter I cant seem to down anyone and end up surrendering in frustration). I'll probably take a break from Hunter rank for now until I get another Hunter. Again thank you :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>An important tip for survivors is just to focus on decoding when not being chased or if not attempting to rescue. Persona builds depend on what type of characters you use for Example for Rescuers an important persona would the 6 branch (the one going south) which has tide turner (Invincible for 20 seconds after rescue but if you or the one you rescued get hit you will be downed after the 20 seconds is over). For Contain, Decoder, and Assist types they bring either 39 or 36 (3- right side of persona web, 9- left side of persona web) 3 means you're bringing burrowed time which heals you one full state when the exit gates activate, 9 is broken windows which increases speed for 5 seconds when vaulting a window (Useful when being chased by hunter) it has a cool down of 40 seconds so be wary of that when kiting. A must have persona I would say is exit path since it allows you to self heal after being downed ONCE per match (Use it wisely) you can also bring distress (First persona upwards) which shows all survivors locations when one person is chaired. Also you should get to know the character you are using to effectively use their traits. For example I main Luca ("Prisoner") and knowing that he can connect two ciphers I can speed up the decoding progress of one of my teammates or decode two ciphers at once (Although this is less preferred since decoding two at once is slow compared to Mechanics version), Luca also has a built in stun that charges up when decoding on a connected cipher. He can also stun the hunter when the hunter enters the static field created by the connection albeit they become resistant to it after each stun (His built in stun doesn't have resistance but its a 40 second cool down and takes 12 seconds to charge again). Thats the tips I can give you so far since I started playing around 2 months ago, hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I experienced this once, I played Merc (since nobody wants to play rescue :( ) and this Prisoner added me post game just to trash talk me about why I didnt save. For context the match was in Moonlit, Prospector got early downed by Violinist and got chaired at the basement which is the opposite side of where I spawned so. Prospector pings focus on decoding so I decode for around 10 secs then I move to rescue. On the way there Violinist meets me and hits me with his string skill and there seems to be a lot of peepers since I noticed I moved really slow when J reached the basement he also seems to bring the persona for faster rocket chair countdown since while trying to avoid his attacks Prospector got sent back. I got downed after that and pinged Dont Rescue me (there were 4 ciphers left) then Prisoner ends up rescuing me (no tide) and he managed to kite back to the opposite way. Then he got chaired and Enchantress keeps saving him (again no tide) and I get frustrated that shes denying me the saves. In the end he downs both me and Enchantress and we end up surrendering. Sometimes I wonder why Enchantress players feel like rescuers at times and deny the actual rescuers to rescue</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Based on experience, never tight kite. BonBons bombs show the direction of the explosion so always try to avoid kiting in their area. Also DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ATTEMPT a basement rescue. Magician is the worst possible teammate to have against a BonBon because of his rescue debuff. BonBon's are heavy campers and spam bombs a lot especially after chairing someone. Known counters to him are Coord and Forward. Dont know how useful Enchantress would be but since Her stun range is a bit long she can use that to kite just make sure to not get hit by the bombs while kiting. Prospector is also quite good against him</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes since it can cancel out all of the hunters skills. Problem would be that it is a risky move since you have to time it just right for it to work. BonBon's usually spam bombs when chasing you so timing the firebomb is a bit hard. Unlike Sculptors statues, BonBons bombs can have different time settings (the fastest being 2 seconds). Most often when you try to hit a firebomb against him when you arent that well versed with acrobat is going to end up with you getting downed. Personally I'm still practicing how to kite with Acro since I just bought him but I'm doing pretty well in kiting for my team to escape. Havent been up against a BonBon as Acro yet but due to my badluck against BonBon's I predict the result will be the one I mentioned above</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you. I cannot express how much hate I get sometimes at post when I play merc because I dont rescue early downs(solo rank is hell with these teammates). I actually had to learn this the hard way, I noticed I kept losing if I saved early so I decided not to save early down or if I get chaired I ping do t rescue me. Hopefully newer players can grasp this better</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This confuses me no matter what side I play (Survivor or Hunter) but when a survivors feet reach the ground after vaulting sometimes it results to Terror Shocks sometimes it doesnt and results in a normal hit. Does anyone know how a terror shock is registered going frame by frame the moment a survivor crosses the other side of the window? Generally curious since I find it weird</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You can do this when camping and a survivor rescues. Place a tentacle somewhere near the chair but not directly in front of the chair. When you see a survivor tap the skill to let the tentacle attack then hit them with a basic attack afterwards. Thats how I completed it. 100% Feaster deduction btw</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Been using him for about 2 weeks. Only won twice. From what I learned dont stay in one console for long constantly switch between consoles to find survivors. If the console icon becomes green that means its being decoded best use that first to surprise hit the survivors.

    <TEXT>Depending on your actions in the game you earn persona points. There are 4 types for each faction. For survivors they are: Tranquility- Decoding Persistence- Using abilities/Items, staying in the fear radius, Opening exit gate, escaping Friendliness- meeting teammates, Rescuing, healing Bravery- Kiting (kiting for more than 70 seconds increases your score for the other three) For Hunters they are: Toughness- Hitting/Terrorshocking survivors Vigilance- Chasing survivors Deceit- Using abilities and Traits Dread- placing survivors on rocket chairs, eliminating survivors (extra points for a 4 man kill) A max of 3000 can be earned per match for each so total score would be 12000. Consider them as exp to get a persona point. Hope this helps</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Amazing story and great revenge. Although imo DW is OP. As long as you dont control a follower the heartbeat wont activate so its a bit easy to get Terror shocks especially in low tiers (Experienced this twice).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He can help speed up cipher progress of his teammates so hes really helpful with promoting cipher rush. Once I was able to help my teammates prime their ciphers (3 ciphers) before I finished mine, so by the time accelerated decoding activated there was 1 cipher remaining. Kudos to the kiter (I think it was a perfumer)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Story: So to earn 3000 for each trait I know you need at least 200% decoding for tranquility, using abilities and escaping for persistence, 3 heals or rescues for Friendliness, and 60 second kite for bravery. I reached over 200% decoding progress and expected to earn around 5-6K points but I ended up with 12000 for some reason. I remember I removed a follower before rescuing Merc from rocket chair and kiting a bit before DW went back to Merc. Still confused how I earned this much points Idk if its a bug or if removing followers nets you a lot of points</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So my efforts to get to mammoth are wasted. The reason why I want to reach high ranks is because there are too many Geishas in low tiers and I cant kite her because of her  #8220;MAGICAL #8221; hitbox. I dont see that many hunters being used or I #8217;m just unlucky that every 3/5 matches I get matched with a Geisha in Bee-Elk.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi we started playing at the same time. Here are some tips to get past ELK solo (Currently Mammoth V): 1. Learn how to kite each hunter - Not all hunters are the same, Some require different kiting techniques ex. Geisha has to tight kited so always hug walls especially if there are pallets (You can easily pallet stun if you can cancel her dash near a pallet) 2. Familiarize spawn points - This can really help especially with how you should ping QM's 3. Learn the best kiting areas in each map- This one could be a bit hard but knowing the best kiting spots is key (Eg. I memorized Red Church so its my favorite map Worst kiting spots are reception and Church, Top and bottom Broken are ok but it depends on how you break the walls, Graveyard is possibly the best kiting spot in the map) 4. Learn Dungeon Spawns- Can help you make a clutch escape if being chased by the hunter in endgame scenarios 5. Buy 1 rescue character- This one is a bit optional but its great to have 1 rescue character since you rarely meet people who play rescue (In my experience at least) in Bee-Elk. I suggest buying Merc since hes the best rescuer. 6. Learn how to rescue- Keep in mind once rescuers use their tide turner or if they become downed everyone else becomes a rescue although there is a priority imo ( Eg. Merc  gt; Other Rescue Character gt; Non Rescue who bring Tide (Eg. Enchantress, Perfumer, etc. gt; Other). Best time to rescue is when you know a cipher or 2 can be popped. I wouldnt risk saving early downs since it can turn a win to lose real quick 7. Communication is key - By far the most important tip I can give as a fellow solo player. Thats about all the tips I can give you. I strongly recommend following tips 1-4 since that really helped me out in ranking up to mammoth in S12 and now. Lastly as a fellow Prisoner main best use your charge stun wisely, connections can be used to detect where the hunter is so its best to create a fake connection sometimes, and hes probably the best decoder to kite with since he has no debuffs</TEXT>
