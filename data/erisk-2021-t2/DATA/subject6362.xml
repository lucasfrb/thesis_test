    <TEXT>"Yeah, I mean. You know, this last month, I think the thing that's been most surprising for me is you think you're doing a good job and then you really assess and you're like 'oh I should have done way better at this, this, that. I thought I did this and maybe I could have done this instead'. And it's one of those moments where you know, it hurts, honestly. Where you're like 'fuck, I didn't do well enough. What should I have done better? Why did I think I was doing well enough? Why was I making excuses that certain things weren't happening?' And you know, I think it's important when something like that happens to try to think 'alright, where am I gonna be 6 months from now? What did I learn? How can I do better?' And that's really all you can do." "Yeah, I'm excited for where things are going and it was an awakening in some ways, but I think it's been an awakening for a lot of people. Especially, if you have a platform, there's a certain responsibility that goes with that platform. I think some people can take that for granted sometimes and I definitely feel in my case, I did."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>in Maxwell's most viral tweet, which is his pinned tweet, he writes: "I'd like 2 apologize Jazz fans that were offended by my tweets. If I knew u guys had internet in Utah I would've never made those tweets." Link to the tweet: https://mobile.twitter.com/VernonMaxwell11/status/839893370449375232 This was tweeted in 2017. But have a look at former UFC fighter, Chael Sonnen in 2011: https://streamable.com/919ih9 It's the exact same joke. And to confirm Maxwell stole the joke, he hid a tweet that called him out for plagiarizing: https://mobile.twitter.com/Kalloused/status/840025222128402432 Not only did he plagiarize, but hiding that reply is weak af.

    <TEXT>I don't get how she was being treated less than. Are guys that aren't attracted to her and prefer lightskin women racist? Skin tone should be irrelevant when evaluating someone in the context of career, friendship, reliability, etc. But men or women having a preference in eye colour, hair colour, or skin colour is not something I see as discriminatory. Physical attraction is an area where being selective (about any characteristic) is morally acceptable, imo. Am I missing something here?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As someone that has been lurking this sub for a little while, can y'all give me some insight on the following question please. I don't fully understand the narrative that the initial treatment of Justine was unfair. Are guys that aren't attracted to her and prefer lightskin women racist? I think that skin tone should be irrelevant when evaluating someone in the context of career, friendship, reliability, etc. But men or women having a preference in eye colour, hair colour, or skin colour is not something I see as discriminatory.

    <TEXT>Do you think not being attracted to sexual partners of a certain race is racist? I read recently that within dating, dark-skin back women and asian men struggle the most in finding partners. And the literature in the area that studies this argues that this is the result of colorism. And colorism is largely due to representation and portrayal in media and popular culture. Do you think there is validity to this claim?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The "this is an opportunity" quote has been taken horribly out of context. What he was saying is this is an unforgiving sport where injuries are brutal and the competition is fierce. The majority of fighters are unable to stay healthy and stay among the best fighters in the world for many years. So, although Dana is exploitative and doesn't pay fighters enough, this quote was about longevity. "When you #8217;re a professional athlete, you have a very small window of opportunity. A very limited amount of time. You know?" "This isn #8217;t a career, this is not a career. This is an opportunity. Anything can happen at any given moment, the knee can blow out. Your back. Your this, your that. Covid-19, who the hell knows what #8217;s coming down the pipeline?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Why Adesanya isn't a major draw yet: Much has been made about Adesanya's following and viewership on social media. The problem is that social media analytics often don't translate to PPV buys. Often, fans are willing to follow you on IG, but that doesn't mean they're willing to pay $70 to see you fight. My cousin works in brand management and ecommerce. Most of her clients are social media stars. You'd be shocked to know that there are influencers with 10M followers that can barely do $50K / month in merch. Meanwhile, there are influencers with 4M followers that move over $400K / month in merch. Number of followers doesn't necessarily reflect conversion. I'm inclined to think he isn't a major draw in the U.S yet. Note that Adesanya vs Romero in Vegas pulled an underwhelming $2.7M gate. That's a super underwhelming figure, when you consider Usman vs Covington did a $4M gate. And Masvidal vs Diaz did a $6.6M gate. Even Cormier vs Miocic 2 did a $3.2M gate. I'm skeptical of the UFC's reporting of PPV buyrates, in general. The fact that they sourced the global buyrate, as opposed to U.S, suggest that they didn't hit their target in the States.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It suggests that Conor is getting a big % of the PPV and the UFC makes the vast majority of their money on Mcgregor fights via gate and concessions. I'm not saying that's the case, but it's what implied when it's rumoured the UFC doesn't want to book Conor until the fans return.</TEXT>

That tells you that Puma sees him as a potentially marketable figure. It doesn't mean he's a superstar. Do you know Puma has been signing low popularity NBA players the last few years? They're trying to become a player in athletics and they see his potential. That doesn't mean he moves a ton of PPVs. Jon Jones had a Nike deal, but even he often had underwhelming PPV numbers.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dana resents any guy that complains publicly. And unless you're a draw like Jones or Masvidal, you have no leverage. Aljo needs the UFC. The UFC doesn't need Aljo. He ain't a PPV draw. Atleast, for now.</TEXT>

Conor committed a historic amount of penalties in that fight. Herb Dean should have to speak before a tribune after the way he officiated that fight.</TEXT>

Edwards already hasn't fought in 15 months. Taking this fight is a no-brainer, imo. Here is Leon's response: "I know you didn #8217;t write this tweet so I #8217;ll forgive you this time. I don #8217;t get ring rust I #8217;m a championship fighter that stays in the gym.

Conor's FW run is one for the history books. He's accomplished very little in the UFC, outside of that.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've started using Schaub'isms in my actual life. A couple weeks back, my wife forgets to pick up the dry cleaning. I look right at her and say: "water we dune hear B" Last week, she says: "so, you remember my cousin, Victor" Instantly, without missing a beat: "great guy, never met him" Yesterday, she gets home from the gym. I look right at her: "that body is trouble" Whenever she needs my advice, I tell her to "axe Jay" and she keeps saying "who the fuck is Jay" It's driving her crazy. If I do it again, she's gonna leave me and take the kids. (The comments in this thread are hilarious btw. Cats working overtime, beast of a work ethnic.)</TEXT>

But when entering new markets in Asia, Oceania, Abu Dhabi (as a recent example), Dana and the UFC have been super respectful to the tourism boards, complimentary of their hospitality and ammenities, really courteous to their local media. Dana can be shitty to certain media members and should pay fighters more, but the UFC as an organization has far more infrastructure to develop new markets. And they're super gracious to all parties involved when putting on events in new countries.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>9-10% Just a few % above what professional bodybulders are down to when they're on stage. Below 8% is when your hormonal health can deteriorate and your physical performance is sub-optimal. The only people that get that lean and cut to the 5-6% range are bodybuilders on the day they step on stage. You'll notice a lot of gym users and even professional athletes use a digital scale that tracks BF% and claim to be like 6 or 7%. They're full of shit and don't understand the physiology of what I explained above. When you go below 8%, you're seriously risking your health. Last point on this: A lot of people are also 9-10% BF and don't have Marlon's level of definiton. This is because Marlon's abdominal muscles are as developed as you can get. The bigger the core muscles are, the more visible they will be.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> #8220;Let it go, #8221; Adesanya told MMA Junkie.  #8220;I #8217;ll give you a classic example :There #8217;s two teammates that I fought. Two teammates is the Italian (Vettori), and then there #8217;s Kelvin Gastelum. The Italian, he ran up on me in Vegas one time smiling and he was like,  #8216;What #8217;s up? What are you doing here? #8217; And I said,  #8216;I #8217;m here for my boy (Alexander) Volkanovski #8217;s fight. #8217; Then I had to tell him just shush,  #8216;When I told you guys I would come train with you (after our fight), it wasn #8217;t about you or because I lost. I was just saying that to your coach because he #8217;s a legendary coach. #8217; All I said was,  #8216;If I #8217;m ever in the area, I #8217;ll pop in. #8217; He holds onto that because that #8217;s he way of believing that,  #8216;Yes, he admitted that I beat him and he wants to train with us, #8217; like some Eric Kaufmann (expletive). But he holds onto that because he knows, he knows deep down he #8217;ll never see me again. He knows deep down he #8217;ll never get a title shot. So that #8217;s why he holds onto that as his own claim to victory when I smoked his ass in that fight. You might give him the third round, but I beat his ass easily in that fight, but he holds onto that."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some of you guys don't want to hear it, but TJ will be getting an immediate title shot. Probably in February, with Aljo getting skipped over. The precedent has already been set with Jon Jones testing positive and immediately fighting for the title after he serves his suspension. The reality is the UFC puts whoever they want in title fights. You had Petr Yan getting a title shot off a win over 40 year old Urijah Faber and Aldo getting a title shot coming off a loss, with 0 wins in the division. Aljo has spoken up about fighter pay in the past. They don't see him as a needle mover and they don't want a champion that speaks publicly about compensation. With Yan, you have a guy that gives you the massive, coveted Russian market. Same reason they hurried Weili to a title shot, because she gets you the Chinese market. The UFC is not even remotely a meritocracy and don't be suprised if Aljo is in Bellator in the near future.</TEXT>

Meanwhile, Bisping ducked all of the real contenders when he had the belt. Avoided Yoel, Jacare, Gegard. Fought a 45 year old Hendo and barely beat him. Bisping the real Paper Champ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Colby was hardly talking shit. He said something along the lines of "nobody believed I would win" Bisping was the journalist in this scenario and was being mad unprofessional imo. Jon Anik even tweeted that he thought Bisping was "disgraceful" lol And Bisping's disses did not age well. His biggest knock was "did Colby really have the invite to the White House". Meanwhile, Covington went to the oval office, got a call from Trump after his fight, and has leaned the fuck in to all the MAGA support.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Especially when it's a girl. DC and Rogan would usually be OOH'ing and AAH'ing over a beautiful headkick knockout, but their instant reaction was concern for Eye. This was the highlight of Valentina' career and the call was so underwhelming. Instead of saying the KO was "incredible", Rogan says that was "terrible". There was no enthusiasm over the spectacular KO they just witnessed. DC even had to look away: https://streamable.com/ubb4qm Imagine if that's how Felder and Hardy reacted to the Buckley KO. I don't know if it's because it's a woman or just because they knew Jessica had no business being in there with her. Mostly, the latter, I presume.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here is how it went down. In a Jon Jones thread, a user commented (about Jon Jones): "Fuck this douche bag. I'm over him dude, straight up." I sarcastically replied: "Why? He's always been a great ambassador for the sport. Does a lot of charity work, clearly cares about his community. Not to mention, he is the greatest of all time." The guy responds: "Are you talking about jones? The pisses hot every other fight, shoots a gun off in he parking lot while drunk driving, hits a pregnant lady and runs off with wads of cash high on cocaine, guy? He ain #8217;t a great ambassador to shit." I once again jokingly reply: "a) a pinch of a salt in an olympic swimming pool, he was vindicated b) he was literally greeting homeless people, giving them the unique experience of interacting with a world champion c) he didn't know she was pregnant and it wasn't immediately after partying, it was a few hours later and he was sobering up" Then Uncle creepy calls me a troll, saying: "You #8217;re in every comment section here either commenting shitty copy pasta #8217;s or fishing for downvotes and then deleting you comment. It #8217;s getting pathetic man, just delete you comment and move on like you #8217;re going to anyways." I reply: "I've contributed more hilarity in my short time on this sub than you have in 7 years. Do you even know who you're talking to? I produced the Jessica Eye Cameo, gave this sub some of it's funniest and more memorable moments. You have no idea how much I've contributed on here. My resum #233; speaks for itself."

    <TEXT>Atleast Floyd had years of hand injuries and no longer had major power when he faced Conor. Manny still has KO power that will seriously hurt McGregor. Unless Manny agreed to not hit him full force, which is plausible now that they have mutual management, Conor could be taking years off his life boxing Pacquiao. If Manny goes all out, he will absolutely brutalize Conor. Same thing with Masvidal calling out Canelo. Canelo would fucking slaughter Jorge, not just TKO him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He's gonna back out of the Dustin fight and blame Dana for ruining the negotiation, even though Conor never intended to fight Poirier. Then Conor will donate $250K (even without fighting him) to Dustin's foundation, to get that good PR and come out the good guy. Then he'll fight Manny in a "boxing match". As Manny is now a Paradigm client, they'll get Manny to agree not to viciously KO Conor. Manny will TKO McGregor in the 9th round of their glorified sparring session, just like the Floyd match. Conor will make another $75M off this. He'll take another year off, with a tax evasion scandal sprinkled within that year. In 2022, Khabib will be retired and Islam will be champ. Conor comes back in mid 2022 (when fans are finally allowed to attend live events) to face Islam for the title. Islam beats him in a one-sided affair. After the fight, Conor tweets: "good knock, looking forward to the rematch"</TEXT>

Dana isn't willing to have title fights on a McGregor undercard and have to pay extra PPV points 2. Dana wants to make a statement that the UFC won't bend the knee for Conor and he'll have to play under their rules A potential 3rd factor is the UFC and ESPN want to book Conor over a year after his last fight to drive more annual ESPN+ subscriptions. The one factor that is pretty uncertain here. Why isn't Conor willing to wait until January?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"What's your record? Networth of 3 mil. What's yours?" I'm Sitting on about $8 million cash, I have $2 million in real estate. I won the UFC belt nine times. I'm internationally famous. I'm 6'4. You on the other hand: i'm guessing 5 feet flat, I'm guessing with the net worth of $100,000. Never won any titles, can walk around without anyone giving a fuck who you are or what you do. my point is, you and I as UFC athletes are not even close to being on the same level. I'm guessing that's why you are constantly attacking me, it's understandable. You're literally and figuratively like a boy compared to someone like me. I'm actually questioning myself as I'm writing this thinking "why am I even giving you the time of day" every time I turn around you are writing me some bullshit, why do you try so hard to get my attention?</TEXT>

All of their 16 combined fights have been finishes. I also noted that they have 14 bonuses in their 16 fights. So naturally, tonight's fight went to decision and neither figher earned a bonus.</TEXT>
