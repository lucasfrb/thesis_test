    <TEXT>Hey everyone I #8217;m 14 and have wanted a PC for years now but not old enough to have a job, I #8217;ve saved just enough money to get what I think is a decent PC but really am not sure so I was wondering if I could ask you if it could run well on games like Escape From Tarkov or Rainbow Six Siege again not an amazing 400fps kinda thing just smooth and can run?

    <TEXT>First PC Buid for Birthday! :) Hey, so I #8217;m saving for a pc, I #8217;m 14 (in a few days) and gonna use the money I get to finish off my savings. I was wondering if this would be able to run things like Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant and other fps games. I don #8217;t want crazy frames or anything just like 100 FPS in medium-high settings, if there is anyway I could lower some things for a lower price but nothing that would compromise the efficiency. I have a Keyboard, Mouse and monitor just need the actual PC. If you would like to make one for me I know it #8217;s harsh just please use Aftershock and keep it below $2,300 AUD thanks :) WARRANTY PACKAGES : 2 Years Parts Warranty (Pickup and return from your location) CHASSIS : BOLT : BOLT MESH High Airflow Chassis | Tempered Glass Design - SLATE BLACK DESKTOP MOTHERBOARD : For AMD - ASROCK B450 Pro 4 CPU : DESKTOPS : AMD RYZEN 5 3600 | 4.2 GHZ | 6 Cores 12 Threads THERMAL COMPOUND : Premium Enthusiast Grade Thermal Compound GRAPHICS CARD : PERFORMANCE : ASUS TUF Gaming GTX 1660 Super OC Edition 6GB - Triple Fan RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) : DESKTOP : 16GB DDR4 3600 MHz Memory ( 2X8GB | Dual Channel ) KLEVV BOLT X CPU COOLING SYSTEM (DESKTOP) : AIR COOLING : AFTERSHOCK M-40 Frost Performance Cooler PRIMARY M.2 SSD : DESKTOPS : 1TB M.2 NVME SSD (R: 3500 | W: 3000) SECONDARY SOLID STATE DRIVE BAY : 1TB SAMSUNG 970 Evo Plus M.2 SSD (R: 3500 | W: 3300) FIRST HARD DRIVE : DESKTOP : 2TB Seagate BarraCuda 7200RPM HDD 3.5" CHASSIS FANS : Standard Black Chassis Fans CASE LIGHTING : AFTERSHOCK SPECTRA Advanced RGB LED WIRELESS LAN : DESKTOP : INTEL W-iFi 6 AX200 (AX WIFI + BLUETOOTH 5.0) CUSTOM CABLE SLEEVES : Standard Cable Setup POWER SUPPLY UNIT : FSP / EVGA 600W 80+ Certified OPERATING SYSTEM : Windows 10 Home 64bit ***(Unactivated)*** MICROSOFT OFFICE : None DESKTOP KEYBOARDS : None PRECISION GAMING MOUSE : None PRECISION MOUSE MATS : AFTERSHOCK Sliver Gaming Mousemat (254*355*3mm) SOUND SYSTEM BUNDLES : None EXCLUSIVE HEADSET BUNDLES : None PRIMARY MONITOR : None SHIPPING : Registered Courier - Desktop (Signature Required on Delivery)</TEXT>
