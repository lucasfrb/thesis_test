    <TEXT>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6285610.stm A study found that people who have more than 100 moles have longer telomeres (DNA that assist in replication, protection and stabilization of chromosome ends). You may live 6-7 years longer than someone who does not have many moles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Maine Kennebunkport Farmhouse Ghost</TITLE>
    <DATE>2010-10-29 01:46:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>At the beginning of the year my husband and I decided to drive up to Maine and stay in a few places up and down the coast for a few months. We had never lived in Maine, it seemed nice enough, compared to FL (where we lived for 5 years), we missed the snow, and were stressed out from work, so we thought this was a great plan for the new year. After a few months in the north of Maine we moved further south. One place we stayed at was a K'Port farmhouse. We found the listing online, it was a good price, and it was on a farm, something we hadn't yet experienced in Maine, and it was close to the little village. It was a huge house, broken into two sections. The old house from the 1800's and the newer house built sometime in the 50's. The older half was not part of the rental because there was no heat there, so we stayed in the newer half that had 4 bedrooms. The two houses were connected by living room area with a fireplace. There was a door that kept the other part closed off. It was in that living room where I saw the ghost. One morning, a few days after moving in, I went downstairs to feed the cat. As you walk down the stairs, there's a little corner you turn, and you immediately get a good view of the living room. That morning, with the cat leading the way, I turned the corner and saw a woman sitting in the far chair closest to the fireplace. She wore something white-ish. She wasn't looking at me, just staring off. Then I didn't know what to do because I could see through her. So, in my infinite wisdom, I ignored her, went to the kitchen, got the cat food, and rushed back up the stairs. Every morning until the day we left, I kept my eyes averted, fed the cat, and went about my business. I figured if the cat wasn't bothered, I wouldn't be either. I never mentioned it to my husband until after we left, because I didn't want to freak him out but it turns out he felt a presence too, just random chills and noises. My cat, who usually slept with us, slept on that same chair, every night, that I saw the lady in. The other half of the house creeped us out when we did a walk through it and we only did it once, it was incredibly cold there. The woman who rented it to us lived in another state. She once emailed me a few weeks into our stay to ask me if "the house was behaving for us". When we met her to walk through the house (before renting) I was ushered in the front door and I saw another woman sitting in the chair and said hello to her. The woman just smiled and didn't say anything back. When we were through with our look around the house the woman was no longer there. When we told the owner that we liked the way the house looked and that we would like to rent it she replied, "oh yes, I can tell this house suits you, you're a good fit." Even then that came across as creepy. Below are links to video walkthroughs that my husband and I made of the second, older, part of the house, and the other half of the house. In the first frame of the other half of the house, you can see into the living room area where the chair and fireplace are. That door at the far hallway leads to the old house.

    <DATE>2010-11-04 20:16:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>My father-in-law passed away in 2008. At his funeral my mother-in-law placed his cellphone on top of his coffin and he was lowered down. We said our goodbyes and drove her home. While I drove my husband and she talked about his life and the quickness of his passing (he died of cancer). While they talked her phone rang. She looked at it and gasped. His name was blinking on the screen. She picked it up and said "hello" but there was nothing on the line, just silence. I always wondered what made her pick it up. Is there something deep down that makes you think that that person isn't really gone? Maybe they made a mistake and he's still alive? But then the reality sets in. He was in the hospital, he died, he was checked, he was embalmed, days and days have passed since. The cellphone was turned off. And yet his name was there, the only person with that name that she knew. For a month the calls would come. Sometimes she answered it, sometimes she didn't. When she did there was always silence, or what seemed like dead air coming from a far away place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey Secret Santa, I was thinking about what the perfect Christmas gift for me would be, and since Christmas is really about giving of yourself, then give me a piece of yourself. (Not literally, I don't want flashbacks of Se7en, or strands of your hair. O_o) Instead, if you like to build things with your hands then make me something, if you're crafty then, by golly, whip out those popsicle sticks and craft me something. If you sing, make me a cd or upload a youtube video. If you cook then send me your favorite recipe. If you're into comic books, send me a comic book and tell me why you enjoy it. Tell me about you and your culture and your way of celebrating Christmas. I recently joined r/snackexchange. I don't expect someone from the UK to send me Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Doritos! No!! I expect them to send me Turkish Delight and Jacob's Twiglets! I like the community of Reddit. I want to know more about those in my community. I would like to feel some sort of connection with you instead of some generic gift that tells me only about a little bit of me and nothing about you. So Merry Christmas Secret Santa and I can't wait to get a gift from you! -subject1702 TL;DR Don't buy me some gift that is about me. Tell me about you.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2011-01-16 17:11:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>A few years ago I worked part-time at a large hotel. I mostly worked front desk but at times was asked to be the "runner". If I was scheduled for morning shift runner then I had to bring things up like towels to guests' room, if there weren't enough housekeepers, or shuttling guests around in the van. One night, I happened to be assigned the p.m. runner shift, and one of the duties was to slip envelopes under the door of the people who opted for express check-out in the morning. For some reason they didn't want you to do it while the guests were awake, so I had to go around at 2 o'clock in the morning. At the time of the incident the hotel was not busy, but there were a number of envelopes to be delivered. In the middle of delivering the check-out slips, through silent, endless hallways, I heard footsteps running ahead of me, just around a corner. "Great, there's going to be some dumb twin girls, in dresses, and evil smiles, staring at me when I go around the bend" was my not-so-funny joke to myself. No, not little girls. It was a little boy. He was running down the hallway, but there was something a little odd about him. Even in the well-lit hallway, I couldn't make him out too well, he seemed blurry, and he was only about 20 feet from me. He was wearing a red shirt and a diaper, his chubby little legs pumping on the floor, the diaper sagging a little. Then he stopped at a door and turned, waved at me, then went through it. I stood there, wondering if I just saw someone go through a solid door, or if there was a little gap and he sneaked through. I didn't hear the door lock catch, and I would have seen the handle move but I didn't. I passed the door cautiously but it looked closed and there was no noise from within. When I got back to the desk, I looked up the room number, and saw that there was a family in there, with a little boy. "Whew, just a kid running around at two in the morning. Nothing to see here folks." Then my shift was over and I went home. The next night, I was working again. When I got to work there was a hubbub. Apparently, some time after breakfast, that little boy had had a seizure and died. What was it I saw? Was it just a coincidence?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pyrex? Once, years ago, I used it too. I took it out of the oven, placed it on the stovetop, and I guess it didn't like the rapid temperature change. Luckily, I had stepped two feet away, and something made me turn around before shards of glass exploded. I probably would have had an eye-full of burning glass, and I wore slippers that day when I usually just walk around barefoot! I had something on the burner too, so the grease caught on fire and there was a huge flame burning away at the hood.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was in the busy tube waiting for the train and this guy was busy texting and accidentally stepped on my toes. Instead of apologizing he gives me a bad look. Like it's my fault that he bumped into me. So I told him to back off. He walks away. Then, I noticed that as he gets off at his stop, he dropped his wallet, so I go and pick it up and try to catch up to him so I could hand it back but that fucker walked really fast. I'm dodging all the people from the station, and he gets farther and farther. We finally get to a quiet street, and I yell at him to get his attention, and I start to speed up, and so does he, so I put on a burst of speed to catch up, but he suddenly trips, which causes me to bump into him. I grab at him so I don't go sprawling all over him. Then out of nowhere this guy comes up and starts punching me in the face! Then he kicks me in the nuts!! **WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED???**</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Best friends forever.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2011-03-06 22:11:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a child of the '80s. When I was 7, I got a Cricket Doll for my birthday. If you're not familiar, Cricket is an animated doll that looked around and talked, with moving eyes and mouth, and a cassette player in the back to make her sing and talk. While I slept I would have her next to me, with a little pillow and blanket of her own. Why I did this, I don't know, but I think that new plastic smell was sort of comforting. One night, I woke up to this whirring noise. It was coming from Cricket, and her eyes were just roaming back and forth, back and forth. Then she started talking in this low, slow voice, saying "You and me. Best friends forever." Whenever she would say it, her eyes would stop and stare straight at me, but when she stopped talking, her eyes would resume their roaming, all the while making that whirrr sound. Then she said it once more, eyes looking at me, but this time she just whispered it. "Best friends forever." I grabbed her and threw her across the room. She hit the far wall and started giggling. All the while the whirring got more frenzied as if her eyes were trying to process what had happened. Then, as I lay under the covers, wishing for it to all stop, she started whispering again, but it was so low and slow I couldn't figure out what she was saying. Until she said, "Talk to you later". Then all sounds stopped. The next day I told my parents what happened and they laughed it off, telling me that her batteries were just dying out. I told them I didn't want her anymore. They must have thrown her out or given her to someone else because I never saw her again. I would look her up on the web and put a link but I don't even want to see it.</TEXT>

So when you pass by her room, you could hear the shh shh shh of them moving and "talking". Once they all started crying then laughing. It was the creepiest thing ever.</TEXT>

I figured "pennies a day" meant 3 cents and collected $10.98 in change, put it in an envelope, and mailed it to Feed The Children. I thought I had helped one child for a whole year, and added an extra 3 cents because it was a leap year. I never heard back. I told my parents to keep a look out for any pictures of a starving kid I was supposed to hear back from in the mail, and when I never did, I figured the kid couldn't write.</TEXT>

He knows your uncle is slightly envious of your relationship, and so in a moment of weakness/kindness, tells him that "nah, having a kid fucks up your life", not meaning for you to hear at all. In another scenario, you missed the first part of the conversation, where your uncle and dad are talking about the time your dad spent in a foreign country and seriously considering keeping the kid that his mistress was pregnant with.

    <TEXT>This book changed my life. I found out that sickness, such as the common cold, stems from sadness and stress. If all the "cold and flu" germs are everywhere, why aren't we sick all the time? I began to look around me. People who were sick were stressed out and unhappy due to work, school, life. I combat it with laughter. Seriously. I don't exercise regularly, nor do I watch my diet. I eat with my hands, I hang out with sick people and haven't "caught" a cold or have been sick in over 6 years. Before this I would get the winter sniffles, the back-to-school bug, and whatever else was "going around". But no more! It's like I'm invincible!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Some people believe that we get reincarnated over and over again as humans until we "get it right", and if we "do wrong", then we come back as animals. But I'm working on a theory that states the opposite. When we "do wrong" we actually pay for it by becoming a more intelligent animal, such as a human, but as we get "better at it" we become less self-aware. Until we reach mayfly status. Mayflies live for 30 minutes in which all they have time for is the basics: eat, poop, and sex. Then it is all over, you become one with the universe.</TEXT>

I hooked up a tiny headphone in my hair and every time I opened my mouth, I would turn the volume up and he could hear the tinny radio sounds. He was so shocked he started crying. Also, from my husband, he once convinced a kid in his class that Malcolm X was pronounced Malcolm The Tenth and the kid did a report on him and kept referring to X as the 10th. Everyone had a good laugh.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am 14 weeks pregnant and had long thought this through before getting pregnant. I had four options; the first is the "standard" American route, which is to go to the Ob, the next is the midwife who does the delivery in a hospital setting, the third was the birth center, run by midwifes, where you go for your prenatal care as well as your delivery, and the fourth is the homebirth with midwife. I met with an Ob, a few midwives, and I called the birthing center to get the feel of it all. I did tons of research and in the end, I just went with what I was comfortable with, which was the midwife who delivered at the hospital. This is my first birth and am not comfortable with having a homebirth, but I didn't like the clinical, wham-bam feel I got with the Ob, who barely spoke to me, and just threw a few pamphlets my way, while the midwives spend an hour talking to you and getting to know you. You have to understand that some midwives won't accept you if they view your pregnancy to be "high risk" and will refer you to an Ob. I wanted a natural birth, and I wanted very little medical intervention. From what I've heard and seen you get to make your decisions with a midwife while you are told what to do by an Ob. Whichever you want to do, it's your decision and you have to decide what's most comfortable for you and your baby. Obviously I'm biased towards the midwife but hopefully your research will lead you to the best choice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, thanks for sharing this. What I'd like to know is, when you have this thought of taking away a 4 year old little girl, do you ever think about what will happen when she grows up, when she's 8 or 13 or 21? Will you still be attracted to the person or will you want another 4 year old? I don't know if I'm putting this right, but I'm certainly not attracted to 60 year olds, but one day, when my husband is 60, I hope that I am still desirous of him and know that part of that desire is just because it's him. He was 21 when we met and I find that as I grow older, I am less attracted to 21 years olds and more attracted to 35 year olds (his age.) I know this was badly stated but I hope you can put your view into perspective for me.</TEXT>

It can take from 20 minutes to an hour to review a case and answer a questionnaire. Starts at about ~$20 and can go to ~$60 per case, depending on the site. Just wondering if anyone has done it, how interesting is it, ease of doing it, and just any other info, before I sign up. Thanks :)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It's a method used by caregivers to read the baby's cues as to when it is about to pee or poo and let it go in the right place (toilet or potty) instead of a diaper. Many people start it as soon as the baby is born. I asked my midwives about it and one used it, but she basically said she knew when her child was about to go, because of routine, and just plopped her on to the potty and made the appropriate noise to communicate that the baby should go. A lot of cultures around the world do it. But I just wanted to know tips, tricks, and things that people did to do it. It seems incredibly time consuming, but, it does have benefits according to people who practice it.</TEXT>

My husband studied Classics, after college he taught himself computer programming which he used to create apps. We pooled our funds, bought a home for $50,000 and live off the funds that his apps bring, as well as any my books and writings bring in. We were never ambitious, or rather, we weren't into the ambition that our parents wanted for us. We always envisioned a life that was simple, with no debt, and with a lot of ease and happiness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, good job getting this all down and done. I understand that this contest contains everyone's first drafts so although I saw many grammatical mistakes in your piece I let them slide. I think many people have trouble writing in a child's perspective because they make them mini adults who use smaller words, however, I thought you did a great job creating a child's point of view. Violet is immature, selfish, more introspective, in other words, very childlike. That said, I couldn't sympathize with the other characters because they felt flat. As with all first drafts, this could use a rewrite but the concept is good.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! While writing, I wondered about the new words (faretheebye) or words that are real but unused (eidolon) being a distraction, and because I had a whole world in mind that encompassed more than just a novellette I thought, "oh heck, put 'em in!" but I think you're right, it probably was a bit much in the first chapter and better introduced slowly. Thank you and I'll make those tweaks when I rewrite it over.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you so much for actually reading it and liking it! About some words like 'napple' I wanted to show how much time had passed that "apple" was bastardized into "napple" like "get me an apple/ get me a napple", or a cariot is really an old car driven by horses (chariot). Yes, once I started to write this I could see it expanding it into a novel's size where more details could make it richer, but of course I tried to write this as quickly as I could so that I could make the deadline, so you're right in pointing out the lack of details like Neve and Cadam's relationship or who the heck is Teo? Thank you for pointing it out since as the author their relationships were concrete to me but now I know how new readers see them. Hey, I look forward to reading yours! Good luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Got into it immediately, good writing and great pacing. I liked it very much. If I had to have a criticism it's that the story is too familiar, one I've seen in movies several times over, there was no mystery. But don't take it too harshly, I did rehash The Garden of Eden. :) So far one of my top five!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm so glad you liked it. Before voting I started skimming through some of the entries and was kinda apprehensive that my entry didn't shout out sci-fi/fantasy so I'm happy to hear that it resounded with you. Yes, I thought of children of men too! On a side note, my favorite author of mysteries, PD James, wrote The Children of Men which the movie was based on. I never knew until a year ago that she wrote it and I feel hesitant to read it because I only know her for detective fiction, even though her writing is magnificent and the movie was great. :/ Thank you for reading my story, by the way, and good luck in the contest!</TEXT>

I always wonder about "bad guys" and why they would go through the trouble of destroying everything, when it would just end up with them either being entirely alone in the world, with their henchmen that they disliked, or being dead as well. But then I remember that although they're powerful and brilliant they may be insane too. Great read, thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, that was trippy! There were some good pieces of imagery that played well in my mind as I meandered through the story. It is unlike anything I've read in the contest so far. I did recognize The Egg and elements of some religious philosophies and I think it worked to add to the spiral at the end. At first I found it difficult to follow because my mind insisted on a coherent storyline but I reread it and this time just let it be and liked it for what it was. Good job on this first novelette.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi, good job finishing and entering the contest! I read your novelette and at first it started very slowly for me, the characters and story seemed to plod on, not too interesting, but it eventually began to pick up, and I found that I was looking forward to seeing what they would eventually encounter, if anything. The ending had a nice, unexpected conclusion. There were a few spelling errors and if you planned on rewriting it, I'd like more character 'growth' because they were a little one dimensional. Good luck.</TEXT>

Or maybe I'm the only person who tries to find meaning behind every character's names, driving myself insane sometimes? Haha I'm really glad you enjoyed it.</TEXT>

I don't wonder about what happens next, I won't daydream about the story or characters, there was no mystery. I'm only saying this because in a contest where I've read so many stories already, there are a few that haven't left my mind, and I'm building lives for them in my head.

    <TEXT>Hello, this was an interesting story! When I finished it I was a little angry that I didn't get to see what really was going on in the Sagan then I let it sit and found that I actually didn't mind if that was the final ending. It wasn't about an adventure seeking aliens or a psycho, but how John progressed in the story. That said, if that was your intention, his sudden turn was a bit abrupt, and there needed to be more character growth for the others on board just to reflect his eventual change. The only thing that was jarring while reading was the double spaces after each sentence, and that's easily remedied! Good luck.</TEXT>

Other than that, I think it was a good read, thank you!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I wrote this last night, hoping to create a longer piece (maybe novelette). Is it worth continuing on? I want all feedback; good, bad, and ugly. Ideas, suggestions, questions, all are welcome! Upon setting his eye on Aquus, someone unfamiliar with the oasis in the desert will believe that it is just like any great walled city with watchtowers tucked around the perimeter, their cylindrical bodies protruding out from the flat walls. However, upon closer inspection, the traveler will note that something is missing. If this weary wanderer were to traverse the forty miles it would take to go around the circumference of the wall he would realize what was omitted; Aquus, unlike other ancient cities, does not have an entrance. When I arrived at the outskirts of Aquus some five years ago, I had rushed to the base of the massive wall, spread my arms out, and gave its sunbaked stones an unabashed kiss with my parched lips. At last, after traveling for four thirsty days (my horse having left me on the third day of my journey) I had reached sanctuary. Then I glanced up at the wall, where the sands of the drylands led me, and realized that I couldn't get in. Where were the people? Where was the great entrance with 40-foot high arches? I stepped back and surveyed the wall that stretched out for miles but my dazzled eyes could not spot any opening. "Hello?" I called out. "I'm here! Let me in!" I screamed at the wall. "Help! I'm seeking sanctuary!" Nothing. I tried a different tack, "Open sesame!" and still nothing. I began to cough, my last sip of water hours ago. I fell to my knees, coughing, the sun boring down on me, and passed out. When I woke up, a cool, damp cloth was pressed onto my head. I kept my eyes closed surveying my surroundings with my other senses. My head was cradled by a soft pillow, my body against sheets that smelled of sun-dried lavender, a cool breeze and sunlight coming from an open window directly in front of the bed I lay on, and a woman humming a waltz took the cloth from my head and reapplied it after wringing it in water. Then I came to the realization, as goosebumps enveloped my body, that I was completely naked. "You can open your eyes now. I know you're not asleep," she said softly into my ear. Startled, I opened my eyes, and found hazel ones fringed in dark lashes looking at me. "How did you know I wasn't sleeping?" I croaked. She reached over to a table and handed me a glass of water. "Your um, breathing changed," she grinned.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>"I'll show you mine if you show me yours," I told her, trying to catch her hand. Instead she danced away from my outstretched fingers. She answered me with a laugh and ran into her house. Later she handed me a warm chocolate chip cookie and we took turns flying my kite, the light blue wings blending with the sky. It looked as if she had snagged something in that eternal, cloudless summer haze, fishing in reverse. We were twelve. At sixteen, I held her close at our junior prom, missing either her feet or the beat. I leaned into her, cinnamon, sugar, a pinch of nutmeg. Other girls smelled like flowers. She smelled like home. She went to culinary school far away. I wrote her weekly. She sent me viennoiserie: *pain au chocolat, chausson aux pommes, brioche*. We married at twenty-four. I did taxes and she opened a bakery. The walls are filled with photographs of our children, rolling pins in hand, flour smudged noses, aprons of various colors and lengths. She was diagnosed with cancer. I held her thin hand, the sleeve of her sweater riding up, just a glimpse of the swirly rays of a sun that was identical to mine. "My soulmate. I love you," I told her. She shook her head, "She's still out there," then she handed me a key. "Top drawer. Jewelry box. You gave me. For anniversary." I didn't open it until after. A photo of her at two, roly-poly, her arm waving. It wasn't the sun. *Our* sun. It wasn't even a sun. It was a moon, a crescent. The smile of the Cheshire Cat. On the back one word: tattoo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I used to work front desk at a resort and once in a while I'd have to be the runner and go around delivering gifts and packages to guest's rooms. The protocol was to knock, say "Front desk delivery" and wait, then repeat twice more. If no one answered then you can enter and leave the package or gift basket on the hallway table. One time after the knocks and calling out no one answered and I entered cautiously, and said "Hello, it's front desk delivery, I'm just leaving a basket on the hall table," and I walked in. No one replied, so I went to put the basket on the table but in order to get there I had to walk past the bathroom. The door was open and I looked in and got a full frontal of a man coming out of the tub. He looked at me, I ran past, dropped the basket on the table and scurried out without looking into the bathroom. He later called the back room and someone confirmed that a runner was sent up to leave a gift. I had already mentioned to everyone what I witnessed. I got laughed at. That wasn't the creepiest but it was the most embarrassing for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry this is late but creepy story time: I was doing runner again but it was a late night shift. Some time around one in the morning I had to go around delivering invoices to anyone who had express checkout, so I'd slip it under their door and move on. Although the hotel was a popular resort this was the time of year that there weren't too many people checked in. I only had about fifteen checkouts to deliver and I'm getting to my last few which is at the furthest part of the hotel where you had to wander down long winding hallways. I deliver one and I hear running and giggling just around a corner, and I think it's probably someone's kid, even though it's so late. When I turn the corner I see there is a kid, toddler age, just ahead of me, around 4 maybe, and I say out loud "hey buddy" and he turns around and his face is blurry, and I can't make out any features, then he turns runs down the hall up to a door and disappears. Now I didn't see the door open, didn't hear it close, and my heart's going a mile a minute because of the kid's face, but I'm trying to rationalize that maybe my contacts just got hazy and caused the blurriness and maybe the door was slightly ajar and he slipped in the room, and since it was down the hall I just couldn't make it out because of the contacts. So I check the envelope I have and it is for the room the kid just went into. I creep up to the door, listen but don't hear anything, no running or laughing, or tv, so I just slip it under and make my way back to the main desk. My shift ended at two, so I had a few minutes to check the room and it did say there was a kid there and two parents, so I just shrugged it off as being tired or just dry contacts, except... The next day I get into work and I'm greeted by a manager and I'm told that the family staying in the room with the blurry faced kid had gone down to breakfast the next morning before leaving and their kid had some sort of allergic attack or asthma and was rushed to the hospital. They weren't fast enough, and I heard that the parents were clueless to any allergies since the kid was young, and this was their first trip as a family. A week later I transferred to another resort that was part of the same hotel chain (I had put in for the transfer long before this incident) and I never heard about it again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This isn't creepy but it is unexplained. One day, a few weeks ago, I went to the supermarket on the spur of the moment because I needed something for dinner that I hadn't gotten on that morning's trip. When I got to the market I realized I had forgotten my mobile phone, but it was a quick trip so I didn't care too much. When I got back to car I distinctly heard and felt that zzz zzz zzz noise iPhones make when you get a message on vibrate. So I thought "oh it must have fallen out of my pocket and slid down the side of my car seat". I spent a couple of minutes searching around but couldn't find it. I made note of the time 4:20 before heading home. As soon as I walked into the door my husband called out, "hey you forgot your phone. I sent you a message while you were out". So I checked my phone and the message was sent at 4:18, around the same time I felt and heard the vibration.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Men In White</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-05-06 15:41:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I just read the MIB post and it reminded me of the Men In White I #8217;ve encountered. The following is long but hopefully people will be willing to share their experiences. I have had countless incidents in my life where I encountered, what I consider, my guardian angel(s). Here are a couple stories where I am guided, helped, or shielded by men in white. I #8217;ve given this a lot of thought, and they could all be just kind people who happened to be at the right place, at the right time, and if it #8217;s just that, I #8217;m super thankful to the universe for having my back. This one happened last fall when my son and I went to an apple festival at a local farm. Due to the festival #8217;s popularity their parking lot was filled and people had started parking along the side of the road outside of the farm. I had to park at the bottom of a long hill, on a patch of dirt next to a ditch (so that my car couldn #8217;t block the road). By the time we were done, there were no longer any new cars parking, several of the cars around me were gone, and no one was near the bottom of the hill where I was parked. When I tried to get out of the spot my tires just kept flinging up loose rocks and couldn #8217;t get any traction. I kept trying to leave but my car wouldn #8217;t move. I was about to get out, thinking maybe I should trek back up to the farm to ask for help when a huge white SUV pulled up beside me (now mind you, I don #8217;t know where this guy came from because I kept checking my mirror when I was trying to get out of my spot and had a clear view up the hill for any potential cars coming and would have seen a large white car coming). Out of the car came this big guy (think Big Pun), with a white shirt, white baseball cap, and white shorts, and he calls out  #8220;do you need some help? #8221; and proceeds to go to the back of my car, and gives it a huge push and we basically sailed out of our rut and right onto the road. I called out  #8220;thank you #8221; and waved and he waved back and I kept driving on, and he followed me, but when I turned at a bend I lost sight of him. The next story took place nearly 20 years ago while I was driving home from college. It was a four hour drive and while I was still on the highway, a dump truck entered the highway and got in front of me. I kept my distance and was looking for an opportunity to switch lanes when the dump truck #8217;s tarp flew off and covered my windshield completely. But instead of freaking out a calm just came over me, and a voice, right in the car (I was alone) said  #8220;speed up and leave the steering wheel as is it #8221;. I followed the directions, even though I thought I would crash any second, and the speed I was going managed to whip the tarp from my windshield and it flew off the highway into the trees. When I looked, the dump truck was far away, but I was flanked by two little white cars, kind of like Toyota Corollas, and I felt safe between them. I thought at the time this was funny because I was also driving a white Toyota Corolla and I thought,  #8220;ha, we must be a sight driving on the highway like a white car caravan #8221;. At the next exit, both the car in front and the car in back exited and I continued driving home. The last story is of a time I was at the supermarket alone, it was in the middle of the morning, no one else seemed to be shopping and there weren #8217;t many employees about. I had just started shopping and was down one aisle when I noticed another shopper in the same aisle, but didn #8217;t pay attention. However, as I got closer, I felt something was off. I looked at the guy and he seemed to be reading a label but I had the distinct feeling that he had been looking at me from the corner of his eye and had just glanced down at the label when he noticed me looking at him. I got the creeps big time. I left the aisle and went to another aisle, trying to dismiss the feeling. As I was getting something from that aisle I saw him come into the aisle as well, and again the intense feeling of creepiness. I went to another aisle hoping that that one had an employee but nothing. I #8217;ve shopped at this time of day before and I usually prefer it because it #8217;s so quiet and I can take my time to peruse but now I was aggravated that there were no employees stocking, or sweeping, or just milling around. I was far from the deli and the butcher area, and when I went to the front to look for any cashiers, just to ease my mind that I wasn #8217;t in some sort of Stephen King horror, I saw the only two at the far end of the market, and they were busy talking to one another to see me let alone notice me. Milk was the last thing I needed but I was conflicted because I knew that the far end of the supermarket was usually dead, and it #8217;s where the dairy and frozen sections were. I don #8217;t know how prevalent this is in other parts of the US, but my market #8217;s freezer section has motion sensor lights that light up as you walk by, so it #8217;s kind of dim if you look down that aisle and the milk is just around the corner, at the end of the aisle. I walked down and as I did the lights lit up and as I kept making my way down, I heard something behind me and I knew the guy was there, following me again. I pushed on, slightly faster, just hoping to get to the milk and then I #8217;d bolt out of there if need be. When I got around the corner, there was a man standing there, just staring at the milks as if deciding which one to get. He was wearing these light colored khakis and a white button down shirt (I only noted this after the fact, I didn #8217;t notice while I was there). He turned when he heard me behind him, and he was an indeterminate age, 30-60. He smiled and apologized for taking up the space, and then asked me which milk I wanted and got the one for me, and engaged me in polite small talk. The creepy guy behind me walked past us, and turned the corner. Then the man in white asked me if I knew where the water was, so I told him I was heading there and led the way. He thanked me, and since the water was close to where the cashiers were, I checked out, without having to encounter the creepy guy again, and felt safe once more. Does anyone else have stories like this, where you felt saved, or protected, and does anyone here believe in guardian angels or beings that are here to help us?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Running Low On Memory?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-26 11:29:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>I #8217;m wondering if our experience of the ME could be a problem of being  #8220;memory decay #8221;. For those who like to think we #8217;re in a simulation, think of it as our memory storage running low, or kinda the system back logs everything in long term, and as it becomes unused it slowly decays, and if someone recalls it, that item is brought back to light but now it #8217;s slightly off / #8220;needs more pixels #8221;. Or perhaps because it #8217;s running low on memory, it starts chopping off things to make it easier to store, like how many of us have noticed that  #8220;s #8221;s in brands have disappeared, or the cornucopia has gone, or even that its McDonalds and McCartney, instead of Mac. Or maybe it #8217;s a bit of both? If you don #8217;t subscribe to the idea that we are playing a game that has too many people and is taking too much time to render. Maybe you can think of it as our collective consciousness getting muddled. Everyone #8217;s remembrance is a little different and democracy wins, where the large majority of memories is what comes to the surface. If most people remember chartreuse as greenish-yellow, instead of purplish-pink then that #8217;s what it is. Some of us just didn #8217;t get the memo. Or it could be that we are all part of some strange sleeper cell experiment that were hypnotized because we watched a special broadcasted episode of the Smurfs as kids. And now, the govt is watching the effects of it.  #128540; What are your thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry, I should have clarified my last statement. I was thinking maybe subliminal messages through tv, not just once but several times, of a certain show that not many people saw over and over again. Like, the message was only ever shown during the New Year #8217;s Eve marathon of the Twilight Zone (something I watched every year). What if it was a MKUltra type of mind control/experiment to see how this would effect people in the long term? Would we go crazy? Would we try to splinter off and develop paranoia towards  #8220;the non believers #8221;? Could they control us through the perceived changes? Many of us, from what I #8217;ve seen and read, barely watch network tv, a lot of us are off Facebook, we tend to gravitate towards fringe subjects. Do we all have a distrust of authority? Or could it just be that many of us are disenfranchised Gen Xers/millenials and that just comes with the territory? Or we just listened to Rick Astley one too many times?  #128515;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you! There #8217;s something so solipsistic with what you described and it made me feel a sense of melancholy. Your idea reminds me of the belief that God broke into tiny shards, and those are now housed within us, but he purposely forgot that he was god and lives these experiences because he wants to be amused/is lonely. Also, I can see your point of the single experience stitched together, because I have thought that perhaps each of our  #8220;moments #8221; are just a single cell in a grand projection movie, not tied to time or space, but when played it gives us a sense of being part of a linear history. Thanks for sharing your idea, it helps add to my concept of life. Have a good day!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I like to think that for some reason or other those of us that are affected just missed the updates somehow. Perhaps we don #8217;t watch commercials or we have toxoplasmosis or we don #8217;t get the right amount of sleep. Either way our little devices aren #8217;t on the right version and we #8217;re all walking around with old memories, confused and weirded out. But that #8217;s just my counter for everyone who likes to imagine we #8217;ve suddenly developed superpowers, like our latent mutant genes finally are appearing now instead of puberty. Ha!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Right! Imagine everyone else #8217;s previous memories were wiped and new ones were put in to reflect the new system (Pikachu #8217;s tail for example). People who experience the ME just didn #8217;t get their memories  #8220;updated #8221; and so we #8217;re still running on the old memories. There #8217;s no way we can go back and see that it #8217;s different because it #8217;s been  #8220;updated #8221;. As for the residue, sure there #8217;s some because even in computers old memory can never be wiped completely clean, there #8217;s residual memory that just can #8217;t be accessed. It #8217;s still there but the directories just point elsewhere.</TEXT>

On Saturday night I had a very vivid dream about my grandmother, who lived in another country, and I hadn #8217;t seen her in years. In my dream she hugged me and told me she loved me. I woke up early in the morning to the phone ringing but didn #8217;t think about it. The next morning my dad told me that the call was from relatives telling us that my grandmother had passed during the time I had dreamt of her. Several of my cousins later on reported that they had dreamed of her saying goodbye to them.</TEXT>

My mom and I were clueless to what color it was and so I looked it up in the dictionary and ever since then whenever I read the word or saw the color I would think back to the wedding.

    <TEXT>There are two things about this article that gave me a strange sensation. First, the photo from the article is of an empty diner and diners are weird places to me. I always tell my SO that empty diners feel like strange  #8220;limbo #8221; waiting areas where you #8217;re neither dead nor alive, just hanging out waiting for something, anything. Second, the article reminds me of a town I used to live in called Celebration, Florida and since it was a Disney-built town, it felt  #8220;staged #8221; and it always garnered two diametrically opposed views, either people hated it or loved it. Don #8217;t get me wrong, I loved living there but it felt fake with people sitting on porches waving, and kids riding their bikes and flying kites, and gardens just so. Almost saccharine. This is how memory towns feels to me, and sometimes, this is how life feels, but if we go by the simulation theory, shouldn #8217;t it feel that way if that #8217;s how you choose to play the game? What #8217;s great about the idea of playing a simulation is how many different ones are going on at the same time. If you #8217;re into a war scenario, it #8217;s there. If you #8217;re into carnal pleasures, that #8217;s available. If you want to farm and grow crops, you can do that. If you want something that the  #8220;Theme From A Summer Place #8221; by Percy Faith conjures up, you can get that too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I #8217;ve noticed it for my parents #8217; flights in about a two year span. I book most of their flights and have taken an interest in how long it takes them to fly. Their flights have gotten significantly shorter from when I started booking their flights over a decade ago! I thought it was just better everything (engines, planes, routes, traffic etc), however, recently they took a flight to Florida and had to fly over the hurricane in NC, so their route was around the weather system instead of directly over it, and even though they left late, they still arrived 35 minutes early! I remember their flights from NY to FL used to be about 3:45 because I would laugh to myself that it was 15 minutes shorter than my drive from NYC to Boston but nowadays, their flights to FL are some times 2:15! I just looked at some articles and people were complaining over the fact that flights haven #8217;t gotten shorter, but longer! Everything is topsy turvy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not op, but I had a major near death experience in the early 2000 #8217;s and since then I #8217;ve felt like I #8217;ve just been meandering around, nothing seems to stick. I #8217;ve moved countless times, had an assortment of jobs, and the people I #8217;ve met seem like replicas of people I #8217;ve met already. For example, I worked with a woman over 12 years ago, at a part time job where I only saw her once a week. Recently, I began volunteering and met a woman who reminded me of my coworker, so much so that I told my husband  #8220;she #8217;s her twin #8221; - same built, same frizzy hair, same mannerisms, same voice. I only see her once a week and we don #8217;t have much time to chat but because I already knew my coworker #8217;s history I wasn #8217;t surprised to learn that this one grew up in a small northern town, is married to a surgeon, who happens to be Asian, and they have one son. Exactly like my first coworker. I #8217;m no longer surprised by this because it #8217;s happened over and over again. Sometimes I think I #8217;m Miss Marple, seeing the same characteristics in people again and again. But it #8217;s not just personalities! They look the same! Sometimes it takes me a moment to place them but eventually I say oh that #8217;s so and so. Maybe I #8217;m just not learning the lesson I should be to move on and that #8217;s why it #8217;s on a repeat? But they all seem like minor characters in my life sphere. I dunno.

And I remembered how everyone thought it was so funny that we misquoted the phrase  #8220;music soothes the savage beast #8221; when it in actuality it was  #8220;breast #8221;, but what if that was an ME? I think things have been changing around forever but we just now have the technology to find  #8220;residue #8221; and to talk to larger groups of people who can agree with us. When my parents found out a certain celebrity was alive that they once thought dead, how could they confirm it? They ask their friends who might or might not agree, and you couldn #8217;t look up old newspapers unless you wanted to go to the library and find the microfiche, and who wants to do that? You just chalk it up to misremembering. I laugh thinking someone saw Jesus walking around and was like  #8220;I swear that guy died a few days ago, but now he #8217;s alive! #8221;  #128514; Retroactive continuity, bitches.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t know, I feel like I #8217;m on the other side of this. We recently moved and I joined the local choir because I wanted to be part of the community and meet new people, and I like to sing. When I first sat in on a rehearsal, I thought they were kinda kooky. Not terribly crazy but they laughed at the slightest joke with such boisterousness, and I don #8217;t think I #8217;m too reserved, but I found it jarring. We #8217;re from different religious backgrounds, and from different parts of the world, but they #8217;re a jolly group of people, just really exuberant. I #8217;ve been with them for 6 months, several concerts, a few potlucks, and they still come across as a bit much. The first time I went to rehearsal I told my husband that they gave me weird vibes, and I had a nightmare where I went to rehearsal and they all turned out to be vampires. Ha. I dunno. Maybe there #8217;s just a lot more introverts out and about that prefer quietness and less emotion instead of enthusiasm and extra-ness?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a weird memory of being in the third or fourth grade and taken to a room where I #8217;m told to sit in a chair and a nurse comes in and gives me a shot. I moved around a lot concerning schools, and this particular memory is from a public school I attended in 3rd and 4th grade. I remember them telling me that it was part of a medical procedure and that my mom had already given her permission and that my classmates would be getting it as well. I #8217;ve always been a pleaser type so I just went along with it, and my parents were in the medical field, so the idea of regular shots and things of that nature were common to me, and I figured it was just a school thing. It #8217;s a vivid memory but I tend to have vivid dreams too. The only thing is that I reached out to a friend from Facebook, who was also in the same grade, and asked if she remembered it and she told me she had a hazy recollection of it. I never pushed it because she didn #8217;t remember much, and at the time we both kinda just thought it was procedural. It wasn #8217;t until years later that I found it really weird that they gave us shots in school and started to really question it. I #8217;m no longer on Facebook and I #8217;ve long since lost contact with that friend. So? I dunno.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not an exact recipe since I just kind of wing it but here #8217;s what I did: I used Martha Stewart #8217;s pate brisee recipe. Six apples; a mix between Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, and Jazz. About 1 1/2 cups of sugar (we like it sweet) (a mix of brown and white). A good dose of cinnamon. A pinch of nutmeg, cloves, allspice. A squeeze of lemon. Cooked it for about an hour in a ten inch pie plate. Voila! Serve with vanilla ice cream.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Definitely a term I #8217;ve never heard of. But the moon is different too. We would come home from midnight mass, when I was a child, and we #8217;d crest a hill, and the moon would be so big, it would look like it was sitting like a building in front of us. It #8217;s something so vivid, and thrilling that I can #8217;t ever forget it. As big as that moon on the cover of Moonstruck with Cher in the middle, of that big E.T. Moon. I asked my mom, since I never see a moon that big anymore, and she remembers, as an adult, seeing the moon, gigantic, just floating as if you could walk right into it. Does anyone else remember those kinds of moons? Like you could touch it? Now, no matter how full it is, it always seems just up in the air, never right in your face.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have apocalyptic dreams of New York City being destroyed by a flood. They #8217;re recurring dreams but from different areas of the city. Always summer and always early morning. I grew up in NYC and lived through 9/11 but I #8217;ve had these dreams pre-2001 and I continue to have them, but only like once every six months. I was one of those strange kids that believed something would happen that I actually studied edible plants and how to butcher and hunt animals. I started cooking family meals when I was about 8 because I firmly believed I would need to survive some kind of doomsday without family. So, it turns out I was just a prepper from a very young age.  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To me, NYC is so iconic that to have someone prophesy its eventual demise is part of its character. Our collective psyche holds these images of NY #8217;s collapse and it #8217;s in our media, from King Kong to Planet of the Apes, Ghostbusters, and even Day After Tomorrow. I think we #8217;re brought up to expect something to happen there. So, nowadays, I just shrug off the dream whenever I have it. It used to kind of freak me out, and after 9/11 I thought it would stop but I still get them. So maybe in the future but most likely not.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love the theories of time travelers, dimension hopping and quantum immortality, and simulations, to explain the ME, but what if it were much simpler? What if it #8217;s just mass hypnosis? Through television? I believe broadcast tv started in the late 40 #8217;s and MKultra was sanctioned in the early 50 #8217;s. I feel like  #8220;they #8221; were like looking at the potential of tv and thinking,  #8220;hm, why not try it out? #8221;. So they take something innocuous like logos that we see all the time but don #8217;t pay attention too closely to, and they  #8220;mask #8221; it. So we don #8217;t see it as it truly is. Then maybe they stopped or maybe we stopped watching tv (or they told us to stop  #129300;) or their reach has just diminished because of all the different forms in which we can consume media, so we start  #8220;waking #8221; up. And that #8217;s why we have these waves of people who say  #8220;oh I began noticing it at 2008 #8221; or  #8220;2012 #8221; or whatever year because it #8217;s when we, individually, stopped being under the influence. Maybe they replaced it with Facebook, YouTube, Reddit? I feel like it needs to be ingested visually. But I try to minimize my interaction with these sites and focus on creative endeavors instead. What do you guys think? Also, a side note, anybody else get scared whenever [this commercial ](https://youtu.be/v4zBYh2PUyk) came on? I wanted the full set so much, even if I got scared. Lol. We used to want to delve into the mysteries of the world so bad, now look at us!  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Let #8217;s say the heart has always been in the left/center but for whatever reason  #8220;they #8221; decide to mess with us and subliminally tell us that it #8217;s on the left. So, some of the people who drew the world maps or the figures of human anatomy are affected by the messages and draw it how we were told it was. Now we  #8220;wake #8221; up and we #8217;re like  #8220;what? It #8217;s always been on the left? #8221; and we have residue by the same people who were affected. But the residue is just created by another person experiencing the subliminal message. Or in a more nefarious way of thinking, those residuals were planted to see our reaction to the validation of our remembrances, and it #8217;s just to test how much we are affected and how strongly we cling to our  #8220;reality #8221; of the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1. I don #8217;t consider myself deeply affected, but I do feel like I have a mission. 2. Yes. 2004 3. No, but already spiritual. 4. Yes. 5. No. 6. Yes. 7. Was raised Christian - Catholic, but no longer practicing. 8. Yes. Several incidences from childhood that slowly added up, from cops to teachers to parents. 9. I don #8217;t know. I trust my intuition more than anything else. 10. No, but before experiencing the ME, I was driving down the road and looked over and saw a man waiting to cross the street. I was suddenly struck by how this man and I were connected, and I looked over and saw another driver next to me and I saw that we were connected! I felt this overwhelming feeling of deep, unconditional love for those people, and anyone else I saw. I had to pull over and I just sat there crying and crying at the amount of love I felt for everyone in the world, and I thought  #8220;this is how god sees us, this goodness and light #8221;. I loved them all so very much. This feeling would last for months, and I #8217;d cry at all the love I felt. It eventually died down. Such a weird experience. I #8217;ve never had it before or since. I don #8217;t do drugs or smoke, and at the time I didn #8217;t drink caffeine. Haha. This was early 2012.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes, I get lucid dreams often and can easily manipulate them when I understand that I #8217;m in a dream. I #8217;ve only ever had one sleep paralysis incident where I woke up and looked over and saw a shadowy woman emerge from the middle of the bed and make a grab for me. I freaked out and jolted up in bed, looked over and she was still there, watching me. I woke up, one last time, and was really shaken. The first one felt like a dream but the second felt like I was in real life, fully awake, so when I really did wake up it took a long time for me grasp that I truly wasn #8217;t in a dream any longer. I tried to do astral projections but could only ever get to the point where my body shook but I couldn #8217;t get past it, except for one night. I was laying in my bed but everything was dark and I kept hearing knocking on the door. So I got up and I walked to the door and I could hear whispering outside. So I said  #8220;I #8217;m home and I can hear you #8221; to the door and the whispering stopped. Then the thought popped up that I might be dreaming so I walked over to the fridge and tried to float up, like I usually can when I #8217;m lucid dreaming but I couldn #8217;t. So I grabbed the top of the fridge and lightly pushed off from my tip toes and I gently bobbed in the air. I looked at the top of the fridge and saw a piece of paper there and I read it. I walked back to my bedroom, saw myself laying in bed and I felt really giddy and mischievous, so I somersaulted from one part of the room so that I landed back into my body. The next morning, I told my husband what the paper said. He had written a bunch of different words on different pieces of paper and shuffled them, then placed them there, not knowing what the top word was. When he pulled it down, it was the word that I saw. I have never been able to replicate that experiment again though.  #128577;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yes! So strange because I have never been sure about many of the celebrity deaths, even Mandela, but Alan Alda I remember clearly dying and finding out he grew up near where I lived in NY. I was too young to watch MASH and had never seen any movies or shows he #8217;s been in, so to find out he was a  #8220;local #8221; celebrity of sorts was kind of nice, and piqued my interest in his work. So I took more of an interest thanks to his passing, but then to find out he was alive (again) was very off-putting!</TEXT>

I was like,  #8220;Remember, it was about the guy who was the only one who remembered the Beatles existing? We talked about how I liked the Beatles and the Mandela Effect? #8221; and he just looked at me like I was the crazy one! We had a long convo about it, dude! Ugh.  #129335; #127995; #8205; #9792; #65039; Edit: What if the Beatles came from a world where they were huge fans of the band called the The Romans and then were in an accident and found themselves in this world where no one knew of the Romans? But then Saul Tarsus of the band The Romans managed to come into this world and kill Paul, and he took over and became Paul? It is rewritten that Saul Tarsus who was once a Roman, shall become Paul McCartney of the Beatles.  #128514;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was shocked when drive time suddenly decreased recently! I grew up in NYC and I went to college in Boston (late 90 #8217;s early 2000 #8217;s and drove from my parents #8217; house to my boyfriend #8217;s house (outside of Boston). For 8 years I drove up and down, several times a year, and the trip was always 4.5 hours (with a quick gas up in between) and I would drive over the speed limit on the highways (~80 mph). Then I moved and we recently went to visit my family then drove to up to Boston and it was 3 hours and 15 minutes!! With me going the speed limit because my passengers didn #8217;t want me zooming around and a pit stop at McDonalds! I kept saying, wow, must be light traffic. But it was never bad traffic when I drove between the two when I was younger because I always missed the cities during rush hour! Oh! I agree with everyone talking about the Florida times. Growing up we used to drive down to Orlando and it was always ~24 hours and my dad would basically go full out switching with my mom for a few hours before taking over again. I corroborated with my husband, who drove down to Disney twice a year in their camper, and his trip from MA to FL was an added 4 hours, so ~28 hours. Then we drove down last year from Maine to Orlando (it should have been 30 hours) but google maps had us at 20 hours! Oh! I thought of another one. I remember growing up and people saying  #8220;it takes you about 7 days, straight driving, to get from NY to CA #8221; and I just looked it up and lots of people saying 3-4 days and google maps says about 40 hours and about 2800 miles! Does anyone else remember that it seemed like you needed a full week and it was over 3200 miles?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Haha, is this Nielsen? I have a story that starts with the $2 from Nielsen. About a month ago I got that letter so I went to the supermarket and bought a $2 scratch-off. I won $4! So I went back in and gave them another $1 and picked up a $5 scratch ticket and won $25. I was gonna pocket the twenty and get another $5 ticket but when I got to the counter something said buy a $20 scratch ticket. I never buy anything higher than a $5 so I felt so daring asking for a $20 one ( #128514;) so I asked for a $20 and won $500! I used some to pay for groceries and took the rest home! I was so happy and excited, I still use that remembered feeling of excitement when I am manifesting. My MIL chides me over not keeping on playing the scratchers, saying I could have made my way to the grand prize but at the time I felt like I was perfectly fine with that outcome. Oh I almost forgot! I sent in the survey a couple of weeks ago I got $5 and I bought a scratch ticket and won $20 but that time I just pocketed the whole thing. Haha</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don #8217;t follow Neville exactly but have been really interested in others #8217; experiences. I #8217;m like an LoA/Murphy/Goddard mishmash! Haha. What really works for me are two things I call  #8220;Nonchalance and Coupling #8221;. The nonchalance part is kind of hard to do technically and mentally but is the quickest way to manifest, literally in minutes. The scratch ticket event and other events where I asked for something almost goofily, are part of the nonchalance. I just imagine (intensely) in the moment what the outcome would be and then leave it be without pressure. And it has to be done lightheartedly! For example, my son and I were at Disney, eating lunch a few days ago, and I said to myself  #8220;oh how nice that there #8217;s tons of seating for everyone but if it did get busy I am totally into a stranger sharing a table with us and finding more about them #8221; and I imagined it, and even laughed at something they said in my imaginary conversation then dismissed it and went back to talking to my son about other things. Within ten minutes the whole place is packed and a guy came over and asked if he could share our table and I said  #8220;of course #8221; and we got to talk to him and find out all about his world. He was from Iran and absolutely loved Disney and didn #8217;t mind traveling alone just so he could hang out at the parks during his vacations! Goofy but it worked. Now  #8220;coupling #8221; works but takes longer. I don #8217;t know if that #8217;s the process (to take a month or two) or because I block a lot of it during my normal everyday and it #8217;s got to work uphill to manifest but the technique is easier and I have manifested my current condo and my current car, and a recent chunk of money that came into my life using it. Coupling just means to link what you want to manifest with a very strong emotion and memory. I would sit in a quiet room (or my closet) and envision (or watch a personal video or look at photos) of a time in my life where I was happy and/or felt like I was winning and I would couple that happiness/intensity with what I wanted to manifest. I do that for 30 days and in the next 30-60 days I get it. I #8217;m pretty sure I haven #8217;t won the lottery because I haven #8217;t been lighthearted about it. I #8217;m busy thinking of the how #8217;s and whys and even if I win, I have to drive hours to the headquarters or hire a lawyer and how can I trust the lawyer and all this busy stuff that doesn #8217;t matter but I can #8217;t let go of. But when it finally works I will let you know. Haha also, one caveat, always always be very specific about your manifestation. When I was 17 I spent a month wishing that I would be married to someone rich. I met my then boyfriend, now husband, a month later and the first thing he told me was that he was rich. It turned out that was his name!!! He wasn #8217;t rich at all. But we #8217;ve been together for over 20 years so... My husband always tells me I make the dumbest (or the best, in my opinion) things come true. Like a temperature perfect day with the best grilled chicken sandwich in my life kind of day. Hope you have that kind of day, internet stranger!  #10084; #65039;</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Whenever my child had a problem at school, I #8217;d hear him calling me too! The first time I heard him, I looked around thinking he was home but then I remembered that he was in school and thought it was just a kid outside that sounded like him. Then, a few minutes later, I got a call from the school nurse saying he had gotten hurt outside of gym. He had been knocked down and hit his head on ground. He was ok, but she called to let me know about it. The second time I heard him and I thought  #8220;hmm, maybe another kid outside? #8221; Nope. A few minutes a call and this time he was stung by a bee! This happened a few other times too. What #8217;s funny is that my mom had this with us, claiming she felt uneasy if one of us kids got hurt. And my mom recalled my grandmother had the exact same thing. She was convinced her mother was psychic because she #8217;d always know something happened to them when she wasn #8217;t around. It works the other way too! I could hear my mom #8217;s distress when I was away in college, and I kept asking my BF, at the time, if he could hear my mom calling me, but he couldn #8217;t. Turns out my brother had gotten into an accident. I #8217;m curious of is what is it? What is the explanation to this psychic bond? Is it in the DNA coding, is it context clues, is it an invisible neural link? I #8217;m fascinated by it. Also, I knew the night my grandmother died because she came to me in my dream and hugged me and told me she loved me. I woke up wondering what the dream was about then the the phone rang and I heard my dad pick up and talk briefly to someone. When I got up for breakfast he told me that my grandmother passed away and that he had gotten a call. She lived on the other side of the world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I #8217;m going in! You #8217;re new to the job, because it #8217;s a tidy desk, but not just tidy, also free of crumbs and  #8220;dirt #8221; that comes from accumulation throughout the years. Maybe something to do with HR or payroll and accounting, from the icon? You #8217;re young, male, right handed, unsure of your current path. Missionary kid maybe? But I #8217;m getting that from the computer photo. Something kind of sad and lonely about it. You know what it is? No family photos. No wife or kids, so young and single. No parents and siblings, so perhaps not the greatest relationship with family? Maybe your family traveled around a lot but I get a  #8220;without roots #8221; vibe from it. Is that Germany in the photo, maybe the Rhine? Or maybe the Yangtze? I #8217;m unsure though. The well-used lotion makes me think you #8217;ve got dry skin, but is it due to weather/environmental conditions or because you frequently wash your hands too much? I think the contact lens/eye drops might narrow it down for me as environmental conditions. Like you work in an office that blasts the a/c all day and it dries out your eyes and skin. Because of the brand Biotrue, I #8217;m thinking you live in the US, and I #8217;m gonna go with the desert part of the US, maybe southern Cali, Arizona, Nevada? Although, maybe Utah if I #8217;m right about the missionary. Yikes, this is only my second time doing this but thank you for posting your pic.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Dang it, I have to remember not to project my feelings into these deductions, it just seemed so empty that I assumed you didn #8217;t have a great relationship. I thought it through and maybe the rootless part was influenced by the fake plant, quite literally rootless, and now it makes sense that you #8217;re an army brat. And maybe psychologically, having a plant that you don #8217;t need to take care of and can be easily packed reflects that. I wish I included New Mexico, I didn #8217;t see the area code, but I #8217;m glad I got the reasoning for the lotion part (dry heat and a/c ) of my assessment correct. Whew.</TEXT>
