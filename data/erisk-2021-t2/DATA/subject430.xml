    <TEXT>Mr. Gates, You have been able to work with some of the best engineers and thinkers of this world. What characteristics do these people have that make them stand out in your mind far above the rest? I ask this as an early career MechE looking for characteristics to cultivate within myself. Btw, thanks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with littlewillingness, to have interest in something (not just people) one must pay attention to it, to get to know it. A plant becomes interesting if you watch it grow, if you watch it and know it over time. When I started learning about how retaining walls are built, they became not just amazing, but beautiful to me. People too become interesting if you learn about them. It reminds me of the saying...I can #8217;t remember it exactly but the gist of it was  #8216;love is paying attention #8217;. Another way to look at why you aren #8217;t interested in people is to as the question  #8216;what are the reasons that you don #8217;t want to pay attention to people? #8217; You may find something interesting in the answers. Best wishes on your journey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>1) answering the question  #8220;why are you not interested in humans #8221; with  #8220;because I #8217;m not interested in humans #8221; is a valid answer, but it #8217;s not an answer that will help you know yourself better. Can I suggest a practice that I know as the repeating question. You carve out an hour of uninterrupted time, settle in for about 10-20 minutes to quiet your mind /do mindfulness meditation. Then, take a question, and ask it and answer it over and over for 30 minutes to an hour. You can answer it the same way the whole time if you want but it gets more interesting if you vary your answer and it may help you get a different perspective on why humans are not interesting to you. 2) another question that might be useful to you is how do you benefit by not being interested in people? You may find that there are specific reasons that you #8217;re uninterested in people. 3) Human beings are animals too. What is different about humans that make you less interested in them than clams? Is it the social interactions? Is it having less control over how you interact with them? Etc If you are from the Buddhist tradition, are you familiar with the metta meditation as the other poster mentioned? If not, in brief, the practitioner sends loving kindness to 1) themselves, 2) a benefactor 3) a neutral person 4) a difficult person. I have heard reports that many people find that after they do an extended practice with the neutral person, when they meet/interact with them later on, they find a feeling of affection/delight/interest/investment in this person that previously could have just been background noise to them before. I wonder if that practice might be of use to you. Also, as a Chinese Buddhist, did you do any meditation growing up? My understand is that in some parts of Asia, meditation is considered something that monks do, where as American Buddhists meditation is highly encouraged among lay people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I believe that every meditator at some point in time thinks that it doesn #8217;t work for them and it #8217;s stupid. However, the best recommendation about meditation I have ever received was in starting out, start with one or two minutes tops. This is a muscle and you don #8217;t start with a full hard core work out. You train, like any other skill. Also, the benefits of meditation is in consistent habit, and building a habit takes a while to form. Everyone can devote 2 minutes a day. Where as 10-20 minutes, it #8217;s easy to make an excuse that you just don #8217;t have time. I strongly recommend getting a meditation teacher. There are so many ways to misunderstand how to meditate, that being able to have a discourse on what you are experiencing with meditation is invaluable. There are many schools of meditation, but I have found vipassana aka mindfulness meditation helpful. Free instruction can be found at audiodharma.org, along with talks. I recommend talks by the teacher Gil Fronsdal. I find that going in person to talks is very inspiring, to see so many people trying to do something productive for themselves and ultimately hopefully positively influencing all that they interact with. I hear that you dislike humans because they do horrible things on a macro and micro scale. Dislike is different than lack of interest. I would say that dislike is more negative where as lack of interest is more neutral. Would it be more accurate to say that you avoid humans out of dislike, rather than genuine apathy towards them? Does avoiding humans benefit you because it reduces discomfort? Because it #8217;s protective? Because it #8217;s less emotional effort? That #8217;s what I mean when I was wondering how does not being interested in humans benefit you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is something called state based learning that you should be aware of: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent\_memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent_memory) Basically, what ever state you are in when you learn the material (drunk, high, caffeine, etc) it's easier to recall the material when you are in the same state. So, when you are trying to recall the information such as when you need it on a final or when you are at work, you would find it easier recall the info when you light up. Not saying that you couldn't recall in a different state, its just easier.  #8203; I think it's a similar mechanism to what happens when you leave the room to get something and once you're in the new room you forget why you're there. It easier to recall what you're supposed to be doing if you go back to the first room.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Emotions have multiple components to it. 1) the thoughts and stories surrounding the story and 2) the physical manifestation of the emotion (eg. tightness in the chest or throat, ache in stomach area) The thing is if you concentrate on the story surrounding the emotion, it #8217;s like getting on a train of thought. You can ride that thought train for years if you want to and the reinforce and proliferate the same emotion. If you focus on the physical manifestation of the emotion (eg, sadness feels like a tightness in my chest, what is this feeling in my throat? Oh, it #8217;s anxiety). The body is always in the present moment. The physical manifestation is in the present moment, and they eventually end. It #8217;s been proven that an emotion, with no proliferation, reinforcement or amplification, generally lasts about 90 seconds. However, the hormones released in relation to emotions usually last in the synapses around 20 minutes. So sometimes even when you #8217;re through the emotion, you may still feel crappy. That #8217;s a good time to take a 20 min walk. By concentrating on things like the physical discomfort of the feeling or sounds (also always in the present) you can cut out the proliferation of the emotions and get through them. This is not repression, because you have to experience them. But you don #8217;t have to go make a story of woe and future woe around them and replay the sad story forever in your head. The other technique used to stop emotions from getting out of hand is to stop what ever story your telling yourself and count either all the circles you can see or all the corners you can see. Some how counting interrupts the emotional rollercoaster Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When you marry someone remember that your money from that point on is also his. So you will not retire early alone, he has a right to part of your retirement from marriage onwards unless you set up some sort of prenup. Not saying you shouldn #8217;t go for it, I #8217;m just saying when married people pay for things separately and keep separate accounts it #8217;s basically meaningless unless you have a prenup. Make sure your partner is a true partner.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is not how finances are divided in a divorce in CA. Just because it #8217;s in your name, if money was put in during a marriage union, that account (some portion of the account since the marriage) will have to be divided in a divorce. Without a prenump, half of everyone #8217;s earnings during a marriage is split in CA. All the shell games people play with accounts during marriage are pretty much meaningless. *Know what it means to be married wrt your finances.*</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you are married, and then divorce, in CA., Your partner has a right to 50% of what ever you earned if they are the lower earner. If you put some of your income into a personal account that account can be split upon divorce and you #8217;ll have to get into a lot of paper work trying to figure out how much can be split. What I #8217;m trying to say is when you are married, your assets and debts are 50/50 in the eyes of the law (in CA) regardless of what unofficial money agreements/accounts you might have in place. If you want to keep your money separate, get a prenup. And I suggest you really understand what marriage means before you get married.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for your reply. What part of the anatomy makes you suspect embiopteran webspinner over subterranean termite? Wiki says web spinners rarely leave their  #8220;galleries #8221; and I have been finding 5-7 ea in the last two weeks. Subterranean Termites however do tend to go into homes when a infestation is pretty severe. Also my specimens are only around .29 #8221; and it looks like webspinners are around .6-.8 (but Idk if that measurement is including antennae)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a good engineer is a problem solver. S/he generates ideas on how to get things to work, not just waits for some one to tell them how to fix something. It #8217;s also about attitude. You don #8217;t need to know everything, but you need to be willing to learn and tackle what ever problem comes your way. Engineering concepts can be taught, the right attitude cannot. Being able to communicate is also key as many here have said. If you cannot  #8216;sell #8217; your ideas, those ideas won #8217;t be implemented Being observant and detail oriented. I cannot tell you how many times a small detail has created a huge expensive problem later down the line. A little humility is also nice. Engineers with huge egos are my least favorite to work with. I do not have time or patience to battle for dominance. Old engineers confident and competent, willing to teach are my favorite to work with. (They so good, they have nothing they need to prove). Big jobs are accomplished in teams. Be a team player or stick to little jobs were you can be the big fish in your tiny pond. Documentation is key. Please please document. Things have a way of sticking around. Especially your worst work will come back to haunt you 10 years later. Do a good job and at least document where you cut corners.</TEXT>
