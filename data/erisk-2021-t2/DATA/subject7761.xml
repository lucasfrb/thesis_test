    <TITLE>Is What I Experienced Psychosis?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-09 07:33:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So.. it's been 4 months since I've been showing all the symptoms of Schizophrenia, along with depression and as a past self Harmer, I can't say I am not tempted to do so again. I have bizarre delusions and scary hallucinations, all three types common in schizophrenia, which is auditory, visual, and tactile. This happened a 2 weeks ago.. so I was chilling and it was like 12:30 am or something (yeah I'm a bit of a night owl) and I have a habit to stroll around my house to burn some extra calories while not being outside as ya know.. self Quarantine. As I was walking, I started becoming extremely paranoid that someone is watching me(I always feel this but this time it was.. intense to say the least) and my hallucinations were getting really creepy, like shadow figures with scary faces and eyes creepy. And then my "delusion" that nothing's actually real and everything is just in my head and I'm just a psych ward patient in some mental institution, and am basically, crazy as hell. When I am having these types of "episodes" I usually internalize it and don't show my emotions. So like.. I had a blank face during all this. And then I felt a numb yet sharp pain around my left temporal bone of my skull and felt like someone was messing with my brain, or put a chip in me to reprogram me. This lasted for 2 and a half days and it was hell. I still everynight feel this temporal bone thingy and now I also feel like someone has been messing with my internal organs while I'm in "this world". Was this extreme bouts of paranoia, delusions and hallucinations, and I forgot to mention the voices in my head telling me to kill myself, was this psychosis? P.S. sorry for rambling on too much</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No one actually knows, but they look quite robotic so I don't know. I think they're robots though, send by the government or some higher organization. And yeah they disclosed UFOs, but like.. I don't believe they did so this easily I think there was some ulterior motive or something which I can't even fathom. I'm pretty sure I have a "normal life" other than me hallucinating and stuff so I don't know about this either</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Even though I agree, but at the same time I don't think people shouldn't post about stuff like this. Of course how the person posts about it is the actual factor about this, but it's like.. they most probably feel stupid about doing what they did and want support and feel a little better about themselves, which is rare in the cases of depression. But at the same time, posts like "oh iM sO qIrKy iM dePrESsed", are stupid. It's not a thing to be proud about, and not something to be ashamed as well. It shouldn't define you. And the fact that you feel it's fake, think of it through their perspective as well.. they must feel everything is also almost fake like why is this happening to me so I understand if they post about stuff to further accept what's happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not diagnosed, but I go through the same. Voices in my head telling me bad bad things, whispers of my name, manic laughter, the grudge croaking in the middle of the night, my mom calling me out of nowhere, demonic voices, you name it. But schizophrenia isn't drug induced, psychosis is. Either you already had the affinity towards it or something. I've never delved into psychedelics but I experience this too, so yeah. And yes you should get this checked out, might be schizophrenia or something related to it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been working out for more than a year now, decent muscularity, atleast for a 17 year old, and 16% body fat percentage, before was 30% approx. And yes, due to my mental health issues and illnesses, it is affecting my workouts as well. My frequency of working out has significantly decreased, but maintaining muscle is easy, so I don't have a problem with that, and my fat loss progress, I've managed with adjusting my diet. So, if your goal is in general fitness, I'd recommend fixing your diet, or improving I'd it's already healthy, stay hypocaloric, and I'd say walk more, I walk 10 miles everyday personally. If your goal is muscle gain, I'd say somehow you have to manage and hit each muscle group twice a week somehow, minimum 5 sets each time. As for the mental health aspect, I'd say keep progress journals, give yourself positive feedback in front of a mirror, keep mirror selfies time after time to track progress, and think of it as an essential part of life rather than a chore, atleast what I try to do personally.</TEXT>

Related to my delusions I suppose. I feel bugs on my head, feel someone digging in my head and clawing or inserting something in or on my brain, through my temporal bone. See ghosts. The list goes on.Been suicidal lately, but I can handle myself and don't want to be hospitalized if push comes to shove.

    <TEXT>I know about proprioception a little bit.. I guess it's the sense that makes me aware of my body and space it's occupying? And that's why people know where their body parts are without seeing them physicaly? And I'll look up kinesthetic hallucinations.. and yea this early morning, I felt like my face was morphing and contorting.. I don't know how to describe it but I physically felt it but when I touched it, everything was normal. And damn yours is really scary</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am 17, and am a 'fitness enthusiast' with massive quotations but I have a decent enough physique(17% bf, 154 pounds) so I think I'd be able to manage my diet if I ever were to take antipsychotic medication because I eat alot of healthy stuff and well, workout everyday. But the problem is, my parents are orthodox about mental health issues and would deem me crazy if I tell them about this stuff, so I don't know what to do because I can't do it independently, I have to be 18 for that..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>What qualifies as different voices in your head? I have my internal monologue voice, and then two other voices, one is female and another is male, really deep voice. But I'm confused because are those voices really other voices in my head, or my internal monologue imitating different voices? I don't know how to describe it, but I think everyone's internal monologue can mimic other voices pretty well, right? I've never talked to someone about voices, so sorry if I'm just really wrong, but what would qualify as a different voice? Because whenever I hear them, I usually feel like I'm faking it all, and they guilt trip me too much saying bad things pushing me to being suicidal usually, but couldn't that just be my internal monologue? I don't know</TEXT>

And for me, it's not in my control, and they don't seem to hear me, or reply to me. I don't know how but I can imitate voices pretty well inside my head, and usually either there are these two voices, or there are so many that my mind becomes a mess and foggy, and I can't think straight during. Lastly, currently I can't seek help due to the situation I'm in, I'm 17(M) and can't seek therapy independently, and my parents are orthodox about mental health issues, so maybe they'll just negatively react and worsen my mental state.. Does voices in your head relate to Schizophrenia?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I guess it can be of psychiatric origin then.. I have been showing symptoms of Schizophrenia for 4 and a half months now.. I'm 17, M. And yeah, difficult childhood, emotionally abusive. Currently they're fine because I gave them a reality check, for some reason they believed they are really good parents and all us children (I have siblings) are ungreatful brats.. they've been better since. Having troubles with anxiety my whole life, but it's amplified now ever since something traumatic happened to my gf, I almost lost her due to it(.. she was raped and was about to commit suicide, I somehow stopped her..) we're ina long distance relationship, so I can never truly know now that if she's safe or not, or she's doing ok or not(she has some issues of her own to say the least) and it's been giving me anxiety attacks and nightmares, and destroyed my sleep patterns, wake up usually before I even reach REM, to stop having nightmares so often. BUT I can't reach for help because my parents are like this and orthodox about this stuff and will deem me crazy or attention hungry, and maybe the things that are fine now will worsen because of it, so I can't each for help..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Did you even read the photo? It said brainwashing people into thinking mental illness isn't real. If that's what it's being known for, then it should be banned, and of course every community has its own set of individuals which are toxic and a small minority that doesn't even belong to that mess, and I'm guessing you're a part of the latter. You can literally post your experiences on r/mentalhealth or other subreddits. If the conventional path isn't the answer for you, and want to try something else, then power to you, but I said if people really are brainwashing mentally ill people into believing mental illness is not real, then it should be banned. Never said that people having bad experiences with psychiatrists is wrong and should be banned. I think you do agree that mental illness is very much real, the post said that people are convincing mentally ill people into believing it isn't, then blaze the post and not me. I just said whatever is the context with the post.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I just looked up the subreddit, yes the people in that subreddit are looking for other ways because they have bad reaction to meds, or psychiatrist but also the top posts are anti mental illness you can't deny that. Just like our body can get ill, our mind does too, if our brain is making either too little or too much of certain chemicals, or if it's physically different from other "normal" brains. Those medications are supposed to help with those chemicals but CAN mess with other chemical releases as well, hence the people feeling like shit after taking meds. That doesn't mean meds are bad, it's just not compatible to you. As someone who is going through so much and has no means of any psychiatric help, if I'm made to believe that mental illness doesn't exist, I'd feel even way worse than I already am, and would feel like I'm faking it all even more than I already think I do. I wish you the best in your journey of self improvement, but like.. I don't agree with the message of that subreddit, even though the community is vast and have different kinds of people(like you) on there.</TEXT>

I NEVER said that I have an issue with like minded people talking why are you pulling stuff out of your butt? And Who said that mentally ill people cannot function well?

        <TEXT>And before you say anti vaxxers is a whole different issue, i sense a pattern as vaccinations can prevent illnesses but chose not to, for their children because of disbeliefs. That'll severly affect the child's health and longevity if there will be any, and the same concept can be applied here. Anti-psychiatry people are saying mental illness isn't real, and ignoring some issues which actually can be addressed by medications.. now I know everyone isn't compatible with them, so they can have therapy? Doesn't need to be an official but even friends who they can talk to? And then the quality of the person's life is diminished. Ok so I have a question.. how would you go your way about dealing with Schizophrenia without medications? I genuinely wanna know because it's something I am all too familiar with</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Hallucinations in general have been for a life time, usually prominent when I'm sleep deprived, and once had a full blown hallucination when I was 4 for no reason. Now I'm 17, and have been hallucinating and having "delusions" for 6 months almost, every. Single. Day. Mine are pretty gory so NSFW warning. I'm just talking about the tactile ones here, there are other ones, which are also pretty bad but since the post asked for tactile here we go.. Started with someone touching me with their fingers on my stomach, and I'd try to remove it but I'll come back. Then it progressed to bugs crawling all over me.. then me feeling me being surgically operated on and feeling a numb sensation of someone digging through my insides in my abdomen, then it proceeded to my head being messed with, and someone putting inside my brain and messing with my brain and putting things in my skull everyday, and this one's pain I could literally feel.. just 2 days ago I felt like a rod was stabbed into my head(with its pain btw) on two ends both coming in and out of my temporal lobe area, and then felt me bleeding out to death.. probably was experiencing psychosis I guess.. And I've been raped twice as tactile and visual hallucinations Edit: and once I hallucinated an earthquake too</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm from India too, 17(m). Firstly, I'm so sorry you have to go through this emotional torture.. as someone who has faced this myself in the past trust me I know what it's like, it's hell. I have been hallucinating for 6 months now too, and life is just becoming meaningless everyday. But sorry to say, none of us can escape this reality, but we have to create our own. Once you're done with school, I'd suggest for college outside city so you can get a hostel or something, just get away from them. That's what I'm gonna do in the future too, minus the college probably. Just hang in there for a year, that's what I'm gonna do too.. I can't even seek mental help because how my parents are.. if you want you can PM and vent about stuff anytime you want. I hope the best for you..</TEXT>

        <TITLE>Is it good or bad that a voice in my head actually talked to me?</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-08-12 15:51:06</DATE>
        <TEXT>So I've been hallucinating for 6 months almost, with having "Delusions" and I think I've had psychotic episodes almost 4 times now, I'm still unsure because I haven't talked to a psychiatrist but a friend of mine told my situation to one and they did say mine are the classic signs of schizophrenia. So, I have always had voices in my head and thought it was normal, but recently I was told by someone that it isn't and it changed my whole perception of myself not gonna lie.. and then there are evil voices in my head which tell me to do bad things to myself(usually self harm or suicide), whispering or screaming, etc. Recently, I was depressed and sleep deprived and I actually had a whole conversation with a voice in my head which tried to comfort me and actually responded to me unlike any voices in my head which just ignored me.. but then I got even more depressed because if I can talk to them that means I'm getting more mentally ill I guess? Anyways i still don't know and want anyone's opinion on if it's a good thing or a bad thing that it tried to comfort me and was responsive?</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm 17 so not independent enough to seek help on my own currently, and my family.. isn't the most supportive. Let's just leave it at that. I haven't gotten back with that positive voice, but a female voice did say two nights ago to make lemon cake(I know, weird) and I said I will so shut up and it did, kind of funny but at the same time terrifying to me, but hey got a lemon cake out of it so no complaining lol I'm not diagnosed but I've had my fair share of "breaks from reality".. I've had them too, it's like a whole mess of voices talking together like a loud crowd, and I can't focus on anything when that happens.. My voices happen randomly and I still haven't figured out the pattern on them of how they're "triggered", so rn all I can do is wait for the next time they choose to speak with me.. Thanks for replying!</TEXT>

        <TEXT>True.. and I don't think the voices are the sole reason for Schizophrenia because voices can be from other things too, like.. I can't come up with an example but it's like.. almost every kid has an imaginary friend, but most turn out normal, isn't this kind of the same? My hallucinations a and delusions are getting worse so I think I might have to get some help in the future I suppose..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>So.. it isn't about the concept but the execution. The concept in of itself isn't bad, I'm there was no point in adding twerking into this, they could've just left it at dancing. About the beauty pageant, that's not potentially sexualizing them, same goes for dance shows. But them including twerking of underage girls is highly questionable, especially after countless controversies about pedos filled in the industry.</TEXT>

Imagine them shooting and retaking the shoot and watching the kids shake their hips? Idk man seems shady to me. And the literal definition of twerking is that it's meant to be sexual, so either it's just a dumb person who wrote that, or something is fishy.</TEXT>

Seems like bad advertising at their part. Like they're targeting the content to pedos. AND again I don't trust people with this kind of content anyways, as I said earlier, there are alot of pedos out there that we're not even aware of. No I'm not ignoring the actual issues, Netflix is fucking doing that by advertising it this way. My complain is to not advertise it this way, and the premise could be done with an adult and it'll work just as well, rather than using kids.</TEXT>

Netflix is supposed to give a description of the movie before showing it, and it should resonate with the content being shown. If they advertise is as showing pedo vibes hell I won't watch that shit or look in depth to it, people I this world is messed up and this may get alot of traction from the pedos(there are alot out more out there than we think there are..) like.. and there isn't just director on the set, many people are on a set, can you really 100% guarantee me that none of the people present there were kid fiddlers potentially? You just can't and that uncertainty is what bugs me the most. But now I will read about it tho</TEXT>

It's not me stigmatizing more than them hopefully not acting out on their urges? I am well aware of the fact that it's a mental Illness, but are you aware of the psychology of MOST people in the industry? Since these kind of people usually have power, they get corrupted and exploit the power as you've seen in countless cases by blackmailing them, or using sexual favours as a way to make them famous, hell this even happens to adult female actresses, but children are more exploitable. As Isaid, MOST, not all. And power to them if they wanna get better, but if they're acting out on it, it is bad no question about it.</TEXT>

Let me give you this scenario, you have a kid and she has to dance in front of an audience of 100 people, out of those hundred, you cannot be certain if anyone is a pedo or not, and there are some. Are you still gonna be comfortable with it, I wouldn't be tbh. And you can't guarantee me a 100% that anyone that was present on the set wasn't a pedo, you just can't.

But this is an exception, Netflix did an major oopsie. False advertising stuff. And I'm kind of worried for the girls because of how many pedos are filled in the industry, like we've seen many cases of pedos using their power to manipulate them. I can't guarantee that not one person there was a pedo a 100% and that uncertainty scares me.

Even if it isn't an industry film I can't guarantee if anyone there wasn't a pedo still, the kids who are taken advantage of also "agree" to do so, that doesn't make it right ya know. And as I said, I won't reply after this anymore. The same can be said with people having intercourse with a minor because both mutually agreed? The minor still agreed but it isn't right because they're underage, and don't know any better.

        <TEXT>Because they'll react badly to it, and it will make things worse.. I mean, my dad is always abusive anyways, putting me down and sometimes beat me(not as often anymore because I'm stronger than him now so it doesn't hurt anymore) that will only worsen because they're orthodox about this stuff. My mom even though she may not hate me, but her everyday actions shows that she does hate me and once even told me to kill myself, so that's a no from me dawg.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>It's because people rarely sort through "by new" section of subreddits, so the rare ones get to the hot posts and the all the newer posts get ignored. If you don't want to be ghosted, try reposting or try a different subreddit which is smaller (for example, all mental health subreddits have people sorting through by new so I get responded most of the time) or REALLY popular like, meme ones, so there are atleast a few by statistics that are bound to due your post due to the sheer number.

        <TEXT>With the different people you're describing, and you have had your breaks from reality, it kind of sounds like Schizophrenia, I'm 17M, so I'm also not too much informed obviously, but what I do know is I have potential Schizophrenia, and well.. I have the same issue with the people in my head. Voices in my head, hallucinations, etc. I just wanted to answer because idk what's the issue with this subreddit but most of the time I post here, no one responds, it's like no one even scrolls through "by new" and that's why I rarely post here.. anyways.. I feel like this is also partly due to your lack of attention when you were younger(I'm assuming cuz of adhd, my gf has it as well and well.. her family is abusive just like mine..) and if you can, seek a professional for this.. I wish the best for you. Edit: i saw on another comment that you currently can't seek help and it's alright, I'm in the same, that's why I said potential Schizophrenia, I understand. My parents are abusive and they'd never let me seek help probably, if you're in the same please hang in there, and if sometimes things get to much you can PM me ok?</TEXT>

I know these words may seem empty to you, but please try your best to stop while you're still new, take this from a "veteran cutter" if you may, this is addicting and can ruin alot of things.. and if you want you can PM me if you're lonely. I remember when I first did it I just kept doing it until my whole forearms were filled with cuts, probably like 60 or more each hand. So take this from another addict, try your best to stop..I wish the best for you..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Well.. as someone who does spend ALOT of time on my phone, let me say this.. the point where you said that we're not living in the moment? Yea my every moment sucks, I'm 17 and stuck with abusive parents. Dealing with alot of mental health issues, and reality just freaking sucks so I use it as an escape because I can't literally do anything else.. if I'm alone with my thoughts for a long while I become self destructive, probably will self harm, or have suicidal thoughts.. but I get your point, most people become narcissistic, and think the whole world revolves around them, but not all. Boomers usually (atleast all the boomers I've seen around me) generalise and think that everyone does so. Obviously every statement has exceptions and I guess I'm that exception here..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>As I said, not necessarily that they actually train secretly but maybe their daily tasks are strenuous enough, but no one can lie around and gain muscle that's just factual. I don't WANT something to be correct when it is factual, but there's a lot of unexplored territory when it comes to the human body due to ethics so it's debatable I suppose, but you can't gain muscle lying around that's for sure. But I guess you don't wanna hear my side anyways so I'm ending the thread here.</TEXT>

The angle at which he's standing the the first one also doesn't "complement" your physique to the "standard", so imo this is faked..

        <TEXT>I don't know where to post this and I'm new to Pokemon (games) so.. I have never seen anyone talk about this and would love to hear everyone's thoughts.. Red is an socially awkward introvert. He doesn't have friends, but Blue is his only friend, best one at that. Usually people would abandon people like that but not blue, he sees the real Red, who's strong and "kind" from heart, and is not judgemental, which means he's not as cocky as everyone thinks he is.. this is just my interpretation of their friendship atleast.. even when Red abandoned everyone and went to Mount silver blue still sticked with Red, seen in their reappearance in sun and moon I think? I am at gen 5 rn, so idk</TEXT>

I got r*ped in my dream and then chased off by gruesome creatures, too humanoid, and tortured for a while but I woke up. 3. Dying by suicide, toaster in bathtub even though I don't even own one.. right when I died I woke up And alot more.. not sure about PTSD though, don't wanna self diagnose</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Maybe I wrote it incorrectly, sorry English isn't my first language.. but I had pictures of everyone in my class performing, not specifically her. Yes, I told people not to do it but they still did it on their own volition because they themselves thought that she was being unfair and she should atleast talk to me. For a while I tried to talk to her, but then I left her alone, which was a whole month before said picture event.. I just wanted an explanation, that's it.. she herself called me her best friend and then all of the sudden cuts all contact? It messed me up and I wasn't in a good mental state during this time as I mentioned in the post, so I just wanted to know why..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Thanks for the insight.. yea I had a rough past and honestly this has made me not approach women anymore, I'd rather be alone for life, but I found someone special, so we're in a relationship, long distance. If things don't work with her I'll be alone forever.. Yea the teacher didn't handle this very well, he was judgemental and tbh really a simp for girls, did anything to impress female students especially in a way to show himself charismatic, but I always found it kind of creepy.. I honestly don't know what kind of person she is.. she was really sweet during the first few months of the new school but then turned trashy in just the next few months.. And lastly.. true, I guess I was kind of an AH to myself, so everyone sucks here.. Again, thanks so much for responding, it means alot..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>If you just want to be ok looking, and not care about being healthy, it doesn't matter. As long as you burn more than you eat you'll lose fat, but you won't be "healthy" if I'm making sense.. you absolutely need a well balanced diet and caloric deficit of course to lose weight "healthily".. but the usual "healthy" foods are more filling than junk food so trying to go lower in calories becomes easier as you're more fuller, so it's desirable more, plus longevity of life. So in short, it should matter to you where your calories are coming from, but a healthy diet isn't the end, sometimes having a diet break is ok.</TEXT>

Of course, if you act the socially acceptable way you're more likely to make friends, but still, they're superficial and not true friends.

True friends are rare but they do exist, I know so many people who'd call me a "friend" but they're really acquaintances to me.. only 3-4 people out of all of them are really my true friends and they're the only ones I talk to.. people throw the term friends too lightly nowadays</TEXT>

        <TEXT>So.. this is probably a dumb question but.. do all living beings perceive time just like us? For example, some animals have too fast of a reaction time in certain situations, does it mean that they are perceiving things slower than we are normally? Reality is what our brains make of it, right? Does the brain of different animals perceive time differently? An analogy and what made me think of this is that how relative to us the universe is so old(13.7 billion years) and then in the grand scheme of things, the universe is super young right now..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Calorie surplus is calorie surplus, so I don't think there will be no weight gain.. this case is extremely hypothetical because even whey protein isn't completely isolated unless super highly processed, and no food source is just pure protein. But even if there was, and you only feast on protein, rather than carbs or fats being your energy source you'd start using protein as energy, which is very dangerous for our body, and stressing to it. Plus your muscles most probably will lose size because of lack of glycogen storage.. but you'll also gain fat probably, the carbohydrates stores in your body which are already present will convert into fat probably.. because in the end you're eating more and burning less. But yea you'll die if you keep this up sooo.. yup. And you'll also lose alot of water weight because of lack of carbs there's no water storage, so you'll initially be stable or even lose weight but then gain some and well.. lose it all when you're dead lol</TEXT>

No one usually stops at 300 calories of junk food, but people can usually stop at 300 calories of just veggies and fruits because you're literally full because less calories and more volume so it's filling. So it's preferred and "easy" to eat "healthy" low calorie dense food as you're full but at less calories, making the deficit part easier</TEXT>

        <TEXT>1. If you lack self control, I'd prefer that oh just don't buy them. 2. If you do have self control, Try eating them as a reward, like.. if you have been eating clean for a while reward yourself with a cookie or something. 3. Remember that food isn't good or bad the proportions are, if you can manage the proportions you eat in, you can easily put in some sort of sweets and still be fit.(I eat sweets like every 4-5 days, or sometimes everyday but REALLY less amount, so as to not mess up my calories, and still have them 8 packs) 4. If you give into cravings, don't beat yourself up, things happen. But at the same time don't give up like "eh I've eaten one bite imma finish the whole packet" If you follow a diet you enjoy and can do forever, it's actually really easy once you get used to it, which will take a while but it'll be worth it.</TEXT>

        <TITLE>New to this sub.. got broken up with for the first time.. help.</TITLE>
        <DATE>2020-10-13 23:58:43</DATE>
        <TEXT>Hi. I'm new to this sub.. for valid reasons. My long distance girlfriend broke up with me after almost 6 months, a few days ago.. I've got no one to talk to.. I'm completely broken and I'm losing my will to live at this point.. TL;DR known her for 3 years, loved her for 2, agreed on long distance. She wasn't opening up so I asked her about it and got to know she made out with a guy and was falling for him but still loved me. So she's gonna date him until our distance is over because she's not really into long distance anymore, even when she said otherwise. First ever breakup, losing will to live. Help. I'm 17, she's turning 16 in a few days. We've known each other for almost 3 years now, she's loved me since more than 2 of those years but I was an idiot and rejected her.. but she still loved me. After a while I started to fall for her too and told her I want to be in a relationship and she agreed, and said she doesn't mind long distance. I for sure don't mind long distance and we(I don't know how she feels now, but I feel this way) love each other to death and promised to meet one day and will be together forever, and atleast I mean it, I don't know about her anymore to be honest. I was the virgin of this relationship, she isn't. So being considerate towards someone's basic human needs I said that she's open to sleep with someone as long as it's safe and no emotional attachment is involved. Tbh I don't really care about sex unless it's someone I truly love, which is with her only, so this open relationship was one sided with only her allowed to sleep with someone else. Plus she's a freshman and I didn't wanna ruin her high school years like I did, I wanted her to have no regrets because I'm in it for the long run.. which was forever.. anyways she obviously agreed and her birthday is coming up so she was going to sleep with someone that day and I was completely ok with it. But.. what happened is.. She was completely happy with the relationship. She had no issues with me and loved/loves me, but some.. events took place. A few days ago I was talking to her about some issues I had with her, how she doesn't open up much(we've.. both been through alot of abuse so we sometimes just get shut in..) and how I wanted to hear everything about her.. she said that opening up on text and then someone saying it'll be alright isn't actually comforting, and it kinda hurt, but I was like ok, and then she tells me that her best friend(the guy who took my gf from me..) is someone who she's comfortable opening up with and they cuddle and watch movies together. This kinda stinged but I said ok but one day when we actually get together she can open up to me anytime, we'll cuddle and I'll kiss her, watch movies, etc. All that lovey dovey crap.. then she drops the bombshell on me.. They kissed and made out with each other and she's falling for him but she still loves me. This fucking messed me up.. I was fine if there were no emotions involved, but this was filled with those feels.. I told her that I was speechless and didn't know what to say, she apologized and said that she has a proposal, and I can deny if I don't like it.. she said she'll date him and when I come to meet her in real life she'll break up with him and be with me then.. even though this plan had alot of flaws I agreed and said to keep her promise of us being together forever. She said of course that I'm her dream guy, etc. But she wanted to experiment before settling down forever. I said ok and jokingly said then I'll sleep around too then, she said she's not comfortable with that so I dropped the joke.. I.. don't know what to do anymore. She was my everything and this guy took her from me.. and now she's being really awkward talking to me, even though she said we can be normal friends again in the deal.. we always used to say love you to each other but now she's not even comfortable saying that. I've had bad experiences with people and she is the only one I love and ever love.. I feel like she'll fall for this guy more and I'll never get the chance to be with her again.. maybe these thoughts are a part of my insecurities or something idk.. I had so many plans for her birthday, I even made her a card.. I don't know what to feel. I cry myself to sleep every night, sleep is rare anyways.. I break down crying randomly during the day and overall my will to live is slowly dying.. please someone tell me how to cope with a breakup this is my first ever and too intense for me to handle to be honest..</TEXT>

        <DATE>2020-10-14 23:22:23</DATE>
        <TEXT>Known her for almost three years now, I'm 17(m) and she's about to be 16(f), met online and she started to fall for me like 4 months in.. I said no but after some time I fell for her too but didn't say anything.. then 6 months ago we did long distance.. now we still love each other, but we've both been through alot of abuse from both our families and.. we've both attempted suicide in the past, more than once. So.. everything was going so well, we were both really happy with each other. Now.. this is a long distance relationship, and as a human being one has sexual needs.. I don't really care about that stuff but I guess she did, so I suggested a one sided open relationship where she could sleep around as long as no strings attached, no emotions involved. She agreed. We love each other and I don't want her to have regrets of settling down too early in the future, because if we're together it's for the long run, and she's in her late teens like me, so I wanted her to have her fun. only as long as we're long distance, once we're both done with school I plan to move countries to meet her and be with her.. but things didn't go as I thought they would. Everything was going great and she has issues with opening up so I was talking to her about my insecurities and her situation of not talking and she drops the bombshell at me that she made out with her best friend(this guy knew we were dating and still went for it smh..) and she was falling for him but still loves me. I.. was speechless.. didn't know what to say. Me being a pathetic guy said that she can be with him them, he'll make you much happier than me.. she said that's impossible.. that I'm her dream guy etc. But she wants to experiment before settling down forever. So she'll date him and when I move to her's she will break up with him.. I was like ok and jokingly said that I'll sleep around too and she wasn't comfortable with that(I promised her in the past that I'll lose my virginity to her) so I dropped the joke, as I don't really care about sex unless it's with someone special, which is her. So.. this broke me. I cried and cried and well.. barely slept for days. This is still all too fresh, only happened a few days ago.. so we agreed till then we'll stay close friends. But I was too heartbroken to talk to her for a while so I went offline. Her birthday is coming up, and I already made her a card as her boyfriend, so I wanted to ask if she was comfortable with it, and she said yea she is.. then I came back online and said that what is she comfortable with me saying and not saying, no that we've broken up and can't do certain things together anymore.. and she was busy so I dropped it. What do you think if this situation? Is it ok to be in it..? Idk.. I love her and want to be with her so this seems perfect and flawed at the same time.. Then when she finally came back online, this happened today.. I said I had classes so we'll talk later and for her to do whatever makes her happy and I'm doing better sort of(I was not.. I just wanted her to feel less guilt) and.. all of the sudden she says her goodbyes to me. This made me almost panick. The only time she says "goodbye" is when she's suicidal.. I asked her what's wrong.. she said she swallowed 20 pills(of idk what).. now I really started to panick.. she said that she loves me and then went unresponsive, no matter what I say she didn't reply.. all messages were left on seen. If I hadn't instantly come back online when she came back online, and didn't know one of her friends.. this would have been certain death.. but thankfully I played everything right.. I firstly contacted her friend(another guy, not the guy who took my gf from me), he raced to her house and we analysed the situation, he called the cops and they took her to the hospital, and she was brought back thankfully.. She's ok now, but.. she won't tell me why she did it.. I really want to know.. I want to know if I could prevent this from happening ever again, I love her too much and if I lose her I have no purpose in life.. should I ask her again or just drop it? She usually doesn't open up so I feel like I should drop it but.. I really want to know..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>The thing is.. I still love her.. there were almost nil negative aspects of her in our relationship, it's like we are made for each other. Only some negative aspects were how she doesn't open up usually and keeps her emotions bottled up, which most probably led to her attempt.. I did distance myself from her for a while but I had to ask her something so I came back a few days later(which was yesterday) and then I found out she was going to kill herself so now I'm scared to go offline or block her.. I don't wanna lose her. Even if we stay just friends for a long while.. I made no mistakes.. she was happy. I guess the long distance aspect wasn't working for her anymore..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Talk to them about it first.. communication is key to a successful relationship. What aspects of your sexual needs aren't doing fulfilled? Is is an issue of not knowing what you both like or something else? Talk to them first.. if things work out then good. And if not.. breaking up is better. To be honest for me sex doesn't matter that much, the person does.. so I personally wouldn't break up if I truly love her. But for others the aforementioned is the best solution for this problem</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Animal proteins have usually all essential amino acids, whereas plant sources usually lack a few. And animal proteins are easily digested, so even though both are good, and you can alternate or eat simultaneously if you want, but animal protein is more convenient to build muscle. Not saying that you can't build muscle with plant proteins, but I personally would prefer animal ones.</TEXT>

I.. still love her and miss her alot but decided to not come into a relationship (long distance didn't work for her, I was fine) until our distance is lessened.. till then we're just friends.. I miss calling her my baby.. I miss the lovely conversations we used to have.. but I gotta keep it to myself in my situation.. as for yours.. if you guys are so close and talk about your emotions and stuff, that it doesn't affect your friendship, you should go for it. If she doesn't reciprocate it'll hurt, but then you have an answer, and tell her that you're not gonna talk to her for a while. Process your emotions and deal with them and you can be normal with her again.. if she says yes that's a different story.. then it's all up to you. And if you're scared that it might affect your friendship then it's up to you if you even want to ask, because what you have with her is precious and if I were you, I wouldn't wanna lose that.</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I'm 17 she's 16, known each other for 3 years we're long distance for almost 6 months and she broke up with me for this guy who is her close friend, (who knew about me and her btw) and yet kissed her and made out with her. She fell for him that moment and broke up with me because of it, but said that she'll break up with him once our distance is over and so I agreed with her deal because I really love her and want to be with her someday(kind of a simp move I know). I was the best boyfriend I could ever be with her, and she was happy. But I guess the long distance aspect didn't work out for her. This happened so suddenly and this broke me, so I went offline for a few days. Her birthday was coming up and I had already prepared for it(a birthday card..) as her boyfriend so I felt that I should send pics to her anyways, and asked her if she's comfortable with that, and she said yes she is.. and said goodbye. Which scared me.. she said that only when she's suicidal. Things happened, she attempted and went offline, I panicked and messaged one of her friends I knew that she's in danger, and we saved her. Well her friend saved her I guess.. I was just a medium for saving her. No one would've even known she attempted if I hadn't texted her so I was lucky.. Now in the panic of her almost dying on me, I told her friend, which is a nice dude(let's call him A), that she broke up with me for the guy(let's call the guy she left me for L) and A was surprised as my ex didn't tell anyone of her friends. I.. felt bad for telling A because my ex probably didn't wanted to tell anyone about this.. then A tells me that he'll beat the shit out of L for doing this.. I asked him not to, I just want my ex's happiness and all.. and A tells me that they made a blood pact that they both liked her but won't go any further than friends, and L broke that pact. This L guy doesn't sound great on paper tbh, broke his friend's pact and knew this girl was in a relationship and still went for it.. Well.. I still said that not to do anything, and A said he won't, but idk anymore.. I asked my ex how things were going with the L and she said that things got complicated and didn't wanna talk about it.. she sent me a screenshot that he's been distant from her lately and left it at that. I feel like A did something or talked to L about the blood pact or something.. I'm going to ask A about this anyways, he hasn't responded yet. But.. if A really did something, did I just sabotage my ex's happiness? Is this all my fault..? I just wanted her to be alive.. I was and still am hurting about the breakup so I just spilled everything on A and didn't know this was a secret.. is this all my fault? I wanted her to be happy..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>I.. haven't had great experiences with people in the past.. so I don't think I'll ever be in a relationship now probably. She was the only one I trusted who wasn't like that, known her for 3, long years.. she means so much to me. It.. hurts that she did a 360 like that. She was the one who used to say how she'll love me forever and such, and I was the one who didn't reciprocate initially. Then after a while I did, but thought long distance might not work. I don't care about sex tbh but I thought she does so I didn't.. but she said she doesn't mind long distance so I tried it out. I guess she didn't knew she minded, herself lol .. but it happened too suddenly and I'm still dealing with it.. crying alot, etc. She has an abusive family like mine so being underage she can't seek help rn.. but I really hope she does in the future.. I always let her know I care for her, but how much can I really do with such a long distance..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>First of all.. thanks for responding. I guess I'm the plan B guy now.. there was a time I was always her first priority.. I miss those days not gonna lie. To be honest I'm pathetic enough to be ok being the fallback guy.. got no self confidence etc. Whatsoever. Haven't had good experiences with people so I gave this a chance and was like if this isn't work out nothing will work out and I'll stay single till I die. I am giving her all the freedom she needs.. hell I didn't mention this in the post but I even gave her the allowance to sleep with others as long as we were long distance because I didn't want her to miss out on her younger years, and we agreed that no emotions would be involved.. I guess she broke that agreement, even though they didn't sleep together.. things didn't work the way I wanted I guess.. If things don't go as I wished and we don't end up together.. not gonna lie my whole world would be destroyed. I wouldn't wanna be alive anymore.. yeah I got mental health issues as well I know, but like her I got an abusive family so can't really seek help.. Just.. how things can end so sudden has terrified me of ever being in a relationship now. It was so fucking unexpected.. I didn't even think that she could do something like this tbh.. I guess everyone is immature at this age so I don't blame her.. she's figuring things out. But I'm scared if her happiness with this guy L has been sabotaged because of me as I told A about our breakup.. I know the L guy is kind of an asshole here for ignoring both the blood pact and the fact that she's in a relationship but.. she doesn't deserve this.. I just realised I'm a fucking simp omg I never thought I'd come to this lol</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Fuck.. I messed up by doing that.. I thought I was being understanding.. I.. don't care about sex myself unless it's with someone I truly love, which was supposed to be her.. I thought not everyone was like that and well.. gave her the allowance.. I'm a virgin and she's not so I thought.. well.. this all kinda began because me smh.. well fuck being considerate to others tbh.. I made myself an option in this situation.. I think I'm just done putting up to people's bullshit now.. thanks for this insight..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yes, when someone eats slot for a long while their stomach stretches. It decreases satiety and makes eating more, more "efficient", which is bad if you're constantly overeating their calories..</TEXT>

        <TEXT>Yup, same here. It's either they hate me(in my mind) or one girl I know online, we live far away.. she has had multiple suicide attempts and could have been many more if I wasn't there.. she recently attempted again and I had to save her by calling her friend and instructing him how to save her.. well technically he saved her and I was the medium but still.. I am always get scared that I'll lose her when she doesn't respond..</TEXT>
