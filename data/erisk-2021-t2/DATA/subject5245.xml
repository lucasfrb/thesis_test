    <TITLE>Is the audio in the Arctis pro (wireless) good compared to other headsets?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-22 18:46:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i got a black friday offer and the Arctis pro (wireless) is at a 40% discount from the original price, but the main factor in buying it or not is the audio. So i was wondering if the Arctis pro (wireless) has a good audio quality compared to other headsets of other brands or from the same brand. This is the audio card in my motherboard SupremeFX S1220A.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AITA I embarrassed my classmate during a presentation wich resulted in him being suspended from our school.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-03-08 22:45:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>In my school we were going to do a presentation about English grammar and it's meaning etc. They selected groups of two randomly so you could come with anyone in the class. I have very good grades in English but unfortunately i was selected to be with one of the worst students in the class (let's call him Chad). Chad didn't want to do any work and just played games during the lessons when we were supposed to be working. This was fine since i'm pretty bad at working in a group and i like to do my works solo. But when i got done with the entire presentation and started to memorize it Chad got up and started talking to the substitute teacher. I couldn't hear what he said to her but after he was done talking to her she said that she would talk to my real English teacher about my behaviour. I asked her what i had done wrong and she said this ''if all you want to do during the lesson is to watch videos and not help your group you can get out of my classroom''. I got so shocked by this i didn't even know what to say, i got angry and confused at the same time and when i tried to explain that i had actually been working this whole lesson she said ''prove it''. Then i proceeded to show her the edit history in the document. To my surprise Chad had edited my entire presentation and deleted all the previous saves in the document so it would seem like he had done all the work. By this time i knew the teacher wasn't going to believe me so i kept quiet the rest of the lesson and planned my revenge. I re did the whole presentation since he kicked me out of the old one and memorized it and everything. The next week came and we were preparing for the next period which were gonna be the presentation. Then Chad went to the bathroom and left his computer wide open for anyone to do something to his precious presentation that I wrote. I copy pasted a lot of fucked up porn into his document which the presentation text was in. I made it so all photos would appear when you press start on the powerpoint document but invisible if you didn't start it. So the next period came and it was Chads' turn to do his presentation. Right when he started the powerpoint all that could be seen was that porn i had put in, and when i say fucked up porn i really mean it. Everyone started laughing and the teacher's face was red as a tomato. He got suspended for a week and after that everyone judged him because of that incident. After all this i felt kind of bad and i think i went a little too overboard. So guys what do you think am i the asshole or was this justified?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Titans' need a buff in PVE.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-10-16 18:48:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm going to start this with saying that i'm a hunter main and i've been one for a very long time. However i have always complained that titans' in general are overpowered especially in crucible with their one eyed mask. I recently started playing titan since i was getting kind of bored of hunter. So i started playing some crucible and i did fairly well but not as good as i would on my hunter. I didn't use the one eyed mask and didn't ape since that's boring as hell. However when i had played some matches i realized ''wow, titans aren't as broken as i thought''.  #8203; Then i started playing some gambit and doing some raids and i just felt useless. I couldn't dps as much as i did with my hunter or even close to it. The titans' supers are pretty much designed to either protect or clearing ads. Seems kind of right since the titan is designed to be a tank. Then i came to the realization that the titan is the only class in the game without a high dps super. Even the warlocks that are considered a support class has a high damage super (nova bomb and chaos reach). Not even thundercrash has high dps which is a one use projectile much like the celestial and nova bomb. Thundercrash also has a lot of risk using it since you're landing right next to the boss. If i were to decide on what should be nerfed and what should be buffed i would say the following. Nerf OEM - Remove wallhack as well as the damage buff. Buff Thundercrash - 100% damage increase. Nerf bottom tree striker - Remove the regen on kill and make the super last 5 seconds longer. Buff burning maul - 30% damage increase. Remove the auto finding sprint melee and make it a little more like the hunter arc slide melee. Now, what does everyone think of this? Does the titan need a buff or not? Please let me know your opinions on why titans should be nerfed/buffed or kept as they are.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Berserker's guide to Darius:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-11-05 16:12:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So i saved Berserker's guide to Darius that has helped me climb my way through silver all the way to gold. However he removed it since he had stopped playing league and couldn't update it anymore. However i had saved this guide in case he decided to do this thing. I just want to say that i won't update it since i don't have the knowledge but if you want to update it just dm me and i'll give you permission in the document. TL;DR I'm not the creator of this guide and i just want to let new Darius players have access to a well written and an overall solid guide. If the owner wants me to take this post down and the document i'll gladly do it.

    <TEXT>Here's a good guide that i have been able to find, he removed it though since he didn't play league anymore and couldn't update it. However i managed to save it.  #8203; Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dariusmains/comments/ds1cis/berserkers\_guide\_to\_darius/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dariusmains/comments/ds1cis/berserkers_guide_to_darius/)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well he's not spreading the guide, i'm the one that's doing it. I also said that this information will not be updated. Also if people wanted me to take down the guide i would have gotten downvotes. Since i'm a new Darius main i have no idea how Berserker was like. All i know is that this guide has helped me improve A LOT on him and i would like to give others that same chance. If Berserker wants me to take it down i 100% will.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Darius passive is pretty useless tbh. It should definetly get buffed so when he hits an auto he instantly gets noxian might. Also his q should heal for the damage done and his w should slow 90% for 5 seconds at least. Darius is such a bad champ right now and if you haven't understood my sarcasm yet you're more useless than Aphelios E.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was planning on getting a 2060S but then there was a good offer on a 2070 so i decided for that one instead of the 2060S. I would like to know if i need to upgrade anything else in my build to be able to function properly with the GPU. Ram: Corsair vengeance 2x 8gb 3200mhz Motherboard: Asus rog strix z370 gaming H CPU: Intel core i5 8600k coffee lake. PSU: Corsair RM650w gold The desired GPU: Asus GeForce Rog Strix 2070 Advanced 8gb. Also is there any known problems with this GPU for example coil whine or performance problems? Edit: my question has been answered and i'm very grateful to everyone that has answered. Thank you all.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have been wondering if i should upgrade to the Rtx series. First i was interested in the 2060 super but i found a pretty good black friday price for the 2080. Right now i have a 1060 sp my question is. Will i notice a really big performance spike and are the Rtx cards in general worth it? I have heard a lot of negative things about them which makes me hesitate to buying them. Thank you in advance :).</TEXT>

    <TEXT>TFT is based on chance rather than actual skill while ARAM is only skill. I also find Aram to be harder than league since you're teamfighting 24/7 which challanges your skill of fighting as a team. Which many low elo players lack including myself. If they add a ranked queue it would lead to players having a place they can truly practice teamfighting as not a lot of players troll in ranked. While in draft or blind trollers are a lot more frequent.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The size of boobs doesn't matter</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-02 18:29:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I always see women being overly obsessed with their boobs and sometimes they even feel bad because they don't have as big boobs as some of their friends. I could even say that women are way more obsessed over their boobs than guys are. Most of my friends don't really give a shit about the size of girls boobs (myself included). However I always find all these men in movies that are obsessed with the girls boobs and are drooling before her. A lot of people also view men as mindless idiots that only want boobs all day long and I just get so mad at this. Big boobs or small boobs, it doesn't matter at all. Women should stop caring so much about their boob size and focus on other things, for example have a great personality. You can't change your boob size without doing any surgeries or if you haven't gone through puberty or something of the sort. However you can change your personality and a lot more men including myself think that a good personality is the best thing a girl can have.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>This game would be so much better with more team pve content.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-11 08:19:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>I feel like they should add more PVE content to the end game. For example raid dungeons and special mob drops. The majority of the community wants this and I think it would easily bring a lot more players into the game. There isn't really a mmo like BDO that has amazing graphics, amazing combat and an amazing world overall. A raid dungeon or something of the sort would definetly make the game so much more popular. It would also make the game more entertaining. Now people are going to say that I should just play another mmo game like wow if I want the PVE. But frankly I hate the other games graphics and combat system. BDO is the only mmo game that I actually enjoy playing. It's not the concept about mmos that I dislike. It's the game itself. To finish this post up I want to say that BDO is an amazing game that would benefit greatly if the devs add a PVE end game. TL:DR Add dungeons and raids to make the game more enjoyable for players in the end game.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I really don't understand how people can dislike this. You're getting more features and more players into the game and at the same time it stays the way you know it. Pvp will still be there of course. It's just a way to get more players into the game and to make the game more enjoyable.</TEXT>

Imagine if a temple that is unique to that biome comes rising up from the ground at a random location and stays up for 6 hours. That would give the players a challenge where they look for the temple and if they discover it they can raid it with their buddies and get nice loot. Would also give players the open world discover vibe you talked about.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>RTX Asus rog strix 2080 8gb lag spikes after playing for about 2 hours</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-13 22:58:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have made posts about these things before and done everything they said and it still hasn't fixed the lag spikes. The lag spikes are on a game called black desert online where after 2 hours of playing the fps goes from 120 to 70 rapidly when I'm fighting. I have tried reinstalling drivers, disabling XMP and enabling my ram to go to 3200mhz (the max) and also troubleshooting my system. Still happens in every single fight and I'm sick of it. Have I received a faulty product or what's happening here?

This is the automated setting but I have a feeling this is a bit too high for a graphics card. I have NOT overclocked it and have been experiencing lag spikes after like 1 - 2 hours of playing games. My temps are pretty good at an avarage of 65 but I have a feeling I'm pushing the card a little too much.</TEXT>

I just installed a new graphics card as well so that might be causing it. It's a corsair RM650X which is the recommended wattage for this gpu (Asus rog strix rtx 2080 8OG). No idea what could be causing it other than that as it's the only part I have replaced in a while.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but the thing is, I have had problems with this GPU before, for example the fps drops like hell sometimes when I'm fighting. For example it can drop from 140 to 72 or something like that. They also stopped producing these cards when I bought it so they can't replace it and I will have to send it in to their workshop which will take about 3 weeks. They will probably not find anything either as they usually do. My only choice is to return it back to the store and get my money back which is around 200 dollars less than what it's worth since I got it from black friday. So rip black friday deals I guess.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Eating raw pasta out of the box is the best!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-18 21:49:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know the title may disgust some of you the same way it disgusted my roommate, but hear me out! Firstly it's the crunchyness and the taste that I love about it. It's also the different things you can do with it. For example, you don't have cereal at home because you forgot buying some. No problem just add some milk and some uncooked pasta and BAM just like that you got yourself a good breakfast. You can also eat it when you're looking for a snack as they take pretty long to chew over regular cooked pasta. It's a bit like gum in a strange way since you can chew it to steady your hunger or prepare for a meal. So yeah, that's why I think it's the best thing ever and I'm really looking forward to seeing you guys reaction to this. Maybe I'll find someone that shares my ideas :).</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Need help with proper installation of ssd</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-12-22 09:56:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Back when I first built my computer I just had an ssd with around 240 gb of storage. Later on I bought a harddrive with 1 tb in storage that I was going to use to store my games. Now 2 years later my harddrive has started making a lot of noise and I recently bought a 1 tb ssd to make everything run faster. However I realized that it wasn't as simple as when I installed my harddrive. What I want to do is to either move everything from my hdd to my ssd or just completely wipe the hdd and take it out of my computer as I don't need it anymore. How can I do this in a safe way that will not cause any possible harm to my system? (My operative system is on my original ssd which I'm gonna keep in my computer)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Mine was when I was around 8 years old and I still remember it super clearly. It was one of those nightmares that seemed so real. I was walking down my staircase and suddenly hearing whispers from our basement door. I remember walking to the door and slowly opening it. The door was tall and white with a copper colored handle and led to a brown staircase that led to our basement. I saw a big tall shadow from the last step of the basement and all I could make out from the black shadow was the eyes. The eyes weren't regular human eyes either, they were like cat eyes (looked like the top of the [tower](https://d1u1p2xjjiahg3.cloudfront.net/7307339a-68) from lord of the rings. I closed the door and started running. As I turned around towards the tall door something grabbed ahold of me and I couldn't move. I was frozen in place and couldn't move at all just like sleep paralysis. The door slowly creaked open and the shadow started sliding towards me. Not walking or running. The shadow were standing up and somehow sliding towards me coming closer and closer for what felt like an eternity. And when I could feel that things breath against my face I woke up in my room. I have had this nightmare a couple of other times and it has always been as terrifying as the first time it happened.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Have been playing AQW for little over a week, this is my progress so far. Also some childhood memories from the game!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-01-06 19:16:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>After not playing this game for years I finally picked it up again to get a nostalgia trip. My old account got deleted which I created in 2011 so I started a new one and this is my progress.  #8203; So far I've been playing for little over a week and I'm currently lvl 68. I got the burning blade/burning blade of abezeth Chaos slayer class Joined the legion and got 3000 legion tokens (bought 900 ac and got 500 ac for the yearly bonus) Over 6 million in gold.  #8203; Still miss my old account as all my memories I have is from it but really satisfied with my progress so far. Also since I was like 7-8 years old when I started my old account I also understood a lot more about the game and it's story itself. Since I couldn't speak nor read english as it's my second language. I was surprised to see all these botters in the game and how the game has died a bit. Kind of sad tbh since this was the first mmorpg game I ever played. And it's most likely the reason I play a lot of those games today. If you're wondering if I have botted this past week i want to say that I don't bot and will never do that. I see it as a cheat and I just want to enjoy the game to it's fullest. However I see no fault in players that actually do bot since getting classes like void highlord is a pain even with a bot. To end this thread I want to share some memories from when I was about 8 years old. I remember I always enhanced my gear with strenght even though I played mage! And I was so hyped when I saw my attacks do 800 crit damage. My dream as a child back then was also to get the necromancer class as I loved the battle pet that came with it. Really good memories and some of the friends I made playing AQW I still have contact with. If you have a memory of your childhood playing AQW please share it as I would love to hear your story!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Quinn players and all ranged/mage top laners are afraid of the other lanes due to their lack of skill. So instead of actually getting good at the game they play an unfair matchup where they can attack and you can't. This has made a lot of top laners quit playing top lane and Riot will never do anything about it. That's the sad truth. All we can do is just to counter pick them with good gap closers like Renekton and completely dump on her in lane. If you're first pick then GG enjoy farming under tower the entire game. Also it's confirmed that all ranged/mage top laners think mayonnaise is spicy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah that definetly makes sense since distractions during the prayer wouldn't really be respectful. I can also see Muhammad playing a role in this as well. Since he's a man and serves as the messanger of god maybe some think that women can't lead the prayer since they don't share the same sex as Muhammad. In case I write anything that's wrong please correct me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I upgrade my graphics card to one of the rtx cards or wait for the newest generation?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-06 07:56:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi fellow redditor, I was thinking about upgrading my old monitor to a 1440p 144hz screen as it's old and quite tiny which is a strain for my eyes. I have a gtx 1060 dual oc 6gb right now and I was wondering if I should upgrade to the rtx cards since I want to actually be able to handle that monitor. However I recently read that the new nvidia cards will soon be released, don't know how accurate this is but it's pretty much a dealbreaker for me. If it will take a couple of years until the next generation launches then it's rtx for me. But if it's like a year then I might wait but I'm unsure. What do you guys think? Is it worth upgrading to the rtx cards or should I just wait for the next generation of cards?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel the same tbh, the gtx 1060 6gb I have right now costed me 3000 Swedish crowns 2-3 years ago which is like 320 dollars. The performance was amazing and I still love it. These rtx cards are like 560 dollars in my country and that's for a 2060S.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Made the question in paint to clear up any kind of misunderstanding. The first triangle is without you knowing any of the angles and the second one is when you know one of the angles.

    <TITLE>Have been sick for 2 weeks with a fever, stuffed nose, minor problems to breath, a sore throat that hurted like hell as well as black boogers that were so large that they hurt coming out.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-12 21:00:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm currently recovering from being sick and the only thing I have left is a cracked voice. However, I want to know what it might have been that caused this. I also lost about 5 kilograms of weight even though I'm 174cm and was weighing 57kg which is perfectly normal. When I was sick my ears hurt quite a bit as well and my hearing was a bit odd. Since I couldn't find anything describing the big black boogers that came out of my nose every hour or so. I know it's gross but they were like 5cm long as well as 3cm wide. I have pictures but it's pretty disgusting so if just dm me if you want them. If I need to give any more information just ask me but I'm curious what exactly it was that was terrorizing me for so long. Age: 16 Gender: Male Race: I'm a white guy from Sweden but my grandparents come from Romania. No pre-existing medical issues The reason I posted here instead of going to a hospital is because I live around 1 hour from the nearest hospital. I also don't think it's life threatening so I don't want to take up time that could be used for life threatening emergencies.</TEXT>

But if they keep making this mistake without learning I get so tilted. Which has resulted in chat restrictions and no rewards. However, I want to learn how to be less toxic and actually be calm and collected even if my team are inting like there's no tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice they could give me?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Volley with agility is pretty much cheating</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-03-16 21:49:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just went up against someone with 32 agility (the same as me) and 36 volley. No matter what I did he froze the balls in the air and just ran to them and did a volley on me. How is that fair? I even shot the ball outside the field just to get some hard balls in in order to throw him off which worked pretty well until he just let the hard balls through. Volley is broken and stopping time and running to the ball is just weird. Poor game design that should be dealt with. Pls fix.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I definetly can see the hate in the video. But I don't think it should be taken seriously at all. Just a shitpost of many coincidences. Also taking my words out of context is pretty misleading. I said that I didn't give a shit to you calling me a nazi. Which I still don't do. And yes it's very childish and rude to say that someone is a nazi and need to seek help. Especially towards a minor. Also learn to let loose and not take everything seriously. You still haven't told me what it is you're seeking from this argument. Do you want me to say "sorry for being so ignorant" because that will never happen. Also you don't decide what I should think is funny or not. So step off your high horse and learn to understand that your opinion doesn't matter to some stranger on the internet. Like I said before, if you don't like it there's a downvote button and a exit button. Go ahead and press that and leave me alone.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[NEWBIE] How can I start learning the electric guitar and what do I need to buy?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-17 18:18:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have wanted to learn the electric guitar for a long time but I feel overwhelmed by everything to learn and don't know what I need to buy nor do I know where to start learning. I don't have any relatives or a musical background so I can't really ask someone that's close to me either. Luckily there's a magical place called reddit so I hope I get some helpful answers by you guys as I'm extremely interested!  #8203; \* You don't have to read this but I just wanted to tell how I decided to finally start learning this amazing instrument\* It started when I was about 10 years old when my father listened to "Thunderstruck" from the group AC/DC. I started to listen to a lot of songs from them as well as other rock bands with my father which has probably influenced my music taste today. Which is mostly rock and metal music as well as techno. Anyway I have wanted to learn this instrument for about 4 years now (I'm 16) but each time I decided to do it I came to a stop. There was a number of reasons this happened. Firstly I didn't really have a lot of money as a young kid. The biggest reason however was because there was so much to learn and I didn't know where to start nor did I know what I should buy. I just kept giving up and giving up until today. Here's the video that finally made me make this post [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxnV-1LLa8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxnV-1LLa8w)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>[List of items](https://imgur.com/a/4zeVNCI) I want to mainly focus on playing Rock music as well as a bit of metal. As I have no prior experience in the guitar world other than that I really want to learn playing this amzing instrument please feel free to explain even the simplest thing. Also my hands are pretty small but as I've read it shouldn't limit me in any way. Here's some videos of the kind of music I want to learn to play eventually. [Kuusou Mesorogiwi - Mirai Nikki (Opening) | MattyyyM Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlsbfE68c-o) [AC/DC - Thunderstruck cover by Thomas75s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGWbbbYgheY) [Fairy Tail Theme Cover By TheDooo](https://youtu.be/Dh6k35R70eg?t=474) (7:54) [Giorno's Theme / "Il vento d'oro" (Guitar Cover) - JoJo's Bizarre Adventure || Shady Cicada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5182K2Vmz6A) [Powerwolf -- Army Of The Night Guitar Cover - By Preachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTwGq1qn0w) (A bit loud so if you have high volume on then I would advice you to lower it.) Thank you for reading my post and hopefully you'll see me here in a few weeks/months with a guitar in hand playing something. Maybe even the hardest of all songs, SMOKE ON THE WATER!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have had this problem for a long time, I'm just too scared even if it's in my own house. I'm always on the alert and I feel extremely uneasy if I'm alone. This never happens in the day and any noise that I hear is instantly something illogical like something wanting to hurt me even if it's obviously something else like my cat doing something. I also think that I'm waaay too concerned about my mother when she's out late at night and I'm home alone. This doesn't happen that often but when it happens I can't stop thinking about all the possible bad things that could happen to her which makes me want to call her almost every hour. However, I usually don't do this because I don't want to ruin her night. I'm afraid I'll keep being afraid even when I move out of my house and get something of my own. Any advice?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As the title says my friends are salty af because I'm climbing faster than them and they just say that Darius is a nobrain champ and that I will not go past gold. I'm already gold 1 and still stomping and even if I try to explain that there's A LOT of counterplay against him they still don't want to realize that maybe I'm just good at the game. For example I usually say that if you kite Darius and doge his Q you win. You can even bait out his e - auto - w - q combo by using a dash when the pull releases you. Then proceed to demolish him because he has 0 abilities left (besides from ult). Also you can go in as a team if he's fed and not just 1 by 1 so he can stack his ult.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Well the thing is, I find those games quite fun since there's a challenge. You actually have to put your game knowledge and skill into overdrive and try to achieve the win. If it's basically impossible then make it possible. Use their mistakes to your advantage. Honestly the best skill in league isn't macro or game knowledge. It is the skill to recognize mistakes and take advantage of them by punishing your opponent.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have had a crunchyroll subscription for 3 years now and I'm done. Everytime there's a new anime I have a 40% chance of being able to watch it. The reason being that it is blocked in my country. What I don't understand is why they're being blocked. It's not like the officials in my country block certain animes. Frankly I don't think they even give a single shit. Also the fact that we're not even allowed to use VPN's is stupid. The last option I have is to pirate it. It's not like I don't want to pay for anime, but I want to pay for a service that supports the creators. But the main reason is for me to be able to watch ALL animes that are available on crunchyroll in high quality. Honestly fuck Crunchyroll and since I have a year subscription I will still watch until march next year.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm going to refer nan app that makes you appear somewhere else as VQN so that the bot doesn't detect me. What I don't get is why this is a thing? If I want to watch a show legally I have to buy a subscription to a streaming service. However, I need a (VqN) to watch some of the shows since my country has banned them. Although a (VQN) is an option almost all streaming services block them. Also as we have found out many (VQN) services are not safe as they have sold out a lot of information about users.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hi fellow wow player. I'm new to the game and I've tried some classes but I couldn't find "my thing". Since I can't really try out classes unless I lvl them up I turned to you guys. Melee is more fun as sitting in the back locked in place isn't really my thing. I would like to be more agile and still do high damage. I would like to be relevant in dungeons and raids later on and feel like I'm needed in a raid/dungeon. I like flashy attacks as well. Sorry if the post isn't relevant to this subreddit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm new to the game and I love everything about it, the dungeons, the quests and the endgame seem like a lot of fun as well. There's however only one problem. I can't find any class that I want to play. I thought I would like warlock/mage but mage is underwhelming and warlock doesn"t have that many abilities. I tried moving on to DH and DK but the problem with DH is thay it didn't feel that good to play. The DH however felt pretty solid. I kind of want to try warrior, but spamming dungeons just to lvl and then find out in the end that warrior wasn't the one for me either is just a waste of time. My question is, what should I do? Has anyone here experienced the same thing?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How does it feel to play paladin and warrior?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-05 09:18:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm a new player that absolutely loves the game to the point I'm litterly freaking dreaming about raiding and stuff even though I haven't done it yet. However, there's one issue. I can't find a main class. I've tried Mage, Warlock, Demon Hunter and DK. Nothing seems to be sticking to me at all and It's generally just boring playing them. **Classes that I've tried and why I don't really enjoy them.** **Warlock** I've only played Destruction but I don't really feel like it has that agility that I'm looking for, I don't really feel like spamming bolts over and over again and standing still. I want to be active. **Mage** Arcane - Spamming 1 or 2 buttons Frost - Spamming 1 or 2 buttons Fire - Quite fun to play but takes ages to gear up for a new player and I feel like it's dependant on RNG for the critical strikes which isn't how I like to play **Demon hunter** Feels too agile and I want to have a starting class and not one that starts at lvl 98. **Death knight** Blood DK was actually pretty fun but I feel like I was waaay too immobile, the dps was not the best and I just felt like I was standing still with no ability to move around. Also it started at 55. ***Side note*** This is quite a long post so if you take the time and help me out I would be most thankful. If you don't have the time or just don't want to read about the classes that I've tried and want to go to the questions I have right away, feel free to just do so. **Just some info** Now I want to try either warrior or Paladin and from what I've been told before the warrior and paladin seem to have nice dps and still being able to tank. However, I'm probably not gonna play paladin as a support but more like a dps/tank. **Questions** Now I'm wondering, how does it feel to play Warrior/Paladin in WOW? Is leveling fun? Is there lots of flashy AOE abilities? Is the dps good? Are you guys wanted in raid/mythic groups? Can I PVP for a change of pace?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-09-06 20:30:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've recently started playing mage and absolutely hated the arcane spec. It's good for low lvl content like clearing dungeons and such but god is it boring. Frost is in between boring and fun atm since I feel like it isn't as braindead as arcane where you spam 1 or 2 buttons the whole fight. The fire mage however, has extremely strong aoe and single target damage as well as cool abilities. The only thing being is that it takes so long to gear and to a new player it can be quite a hard task. But I'm up for the task. The only thing that bothers me is how it's going to look in shadowlands. Is it going to be good or just awful forcing me to play arcane *zzz* or frost?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not a meta abuser or anything but feeling "needed" is a part of the enjoyment. Seeing high damage is also really fun. I guess what I want in a class is high and constant aoe damage, satisfying abilities and high single target dps. The mobility doesn't have to be good or anything but something to get out of danger quick.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-10-19 09:39:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>My grades usually vary fron C-A but in Spanish I almost have an F. I dedicate more time to Spanish than any other class but I just can't seem to learn it. I know grammar pretty decently but it's my lack of words and linking words that is the main problem. My teacher hands out vocabulary tests each week which I train for and usually get around 90% correct. But then a week passes and I forget them. I don't have time to waste on re learning and stuff like that because my teachers just LOVE to throw tests, homework and other stuff on us. These past weeks I've been doing with around 4-5 hours sleep per day and the rest goes to studying. I'm 17 years old btw.</TEXT>
