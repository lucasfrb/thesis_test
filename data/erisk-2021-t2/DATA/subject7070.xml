    <TEXT>*Theory/explaination related to your 'overnight at hi5 studios' video* (I have a really crazy theory in mind. Correct me if im wrong and sorry if someone thought about this before me) Im gonna get straight into the theory. So what happened was the door shut, then the lazer moved and then the door in front shut again. So my theory is that there was an entity that moved through the semi-open door resulting it to shut. Judging by the way lazer moved i can say that its current shape was like 2-3 feet tall, implying that it was crawling, and then the door in front shut due to the same reason the first in closed. (When i was thinking about this theory, it was 3am in the morning and i was legit not able to speak) BTW If your reading this have a great day</TEXT>
