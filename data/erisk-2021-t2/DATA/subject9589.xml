    <DATE>2014-10-23 21:52:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, so i need help with instaling LED lights tape and defog heaters to my mirror. I found this from a guy nicked craptain :http://imgur.com/a/Q1dvx I would like to do it also but got some questions. So i need transformator for my 220V to 12 V for my LED tape, and (as i know) also need transformator for electric heater. I was wondering can i connect them on the same transformator ( i found some 21mm deep trafo with watertight case) and use the same switch that i would put on the bottom right part of the mirror or do i need to have 2 of them switches and 2 transformators (i would use touch switch). Thanks in advance</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-03-26 11:38:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hey guys, I am starting a wall mounted watercooling pc and would like to ask a few noobish questions. 1. Do you think is it worth the money of buying a waterblock for gtx680 that is around 120$ or sell the card and buy newer one and then go with watercooling? 2. Are the watercooling components from different manufacturers compatible? Lets say i buy a pump from ekwb a reservoir from someone else and a gpu waterblock from someone third? Thanks in advance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually it is only for noise and looks purpose since it will be on the wall exposed so dont wanna hear the fans on gtx680.. But maybe you guys are right, i can put her up on the wall with stock fans-and water cool only cpu- i think it wont be such a noise since she is not overclocked and i play only dota2 and csgo and then save money for new and then add it into the existing loop. Other than than do you know any place i can find some used watercooling equipment that is being sold?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2015-06-24 19:24:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Good day guys, I am almost done with my wall mounted PC but i just have 2 questions. 1. Any advice on how to disperse the light from LED tape a bit better over acrylic (on which the components are mounted)? FYI the ends of the acrylic are cut under 45 degree angle. 2.I am concerned about those dang PCIE riser cables since I ordered two (20cm) from ebay and will have to daisy chain them since my MOBO is a bit far from GPU and was thinking on shielding them with aluminium tape. Do You think it will work or do iI have just buy that 3M 100us cable and be done with it? Thanks in advance</TEXT>

I have cut the clear acrylic the same size as my components and cut the edge under 45 degrees... the question is what is the best way to place LED strip so that it disperses the light in the most efficient way? Do I cut the V shaped groove on the middle or do I make a big hole and I put the led strip on the walls of that hole ( acylic is 1 cm wide)? Any advices would be much appreciated. Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Used windows 7 for many years now and had it always on 125% and NEVER had anything "broken".

I mean wtf i have a 550$ GPU and i get blurry picture, that is just-dont ahve the words...</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The 'Cabin crew prepare for landing' announciation is for cabin crew since the passengers would already be in their seats with seat belt fastened because the at least in our company we put the 'Seat belt ON' sign during the descent or latest when passing FL150.... And concerning the cabin crew-the alternate sign for this announciation is Landing gear DOWN..that is the time they have a seat and fasten their seat belts becuse sometimes this cabin crew prepare for landing gets forgot.... That being said they should have made a go-around that is a no brainer-the airbus procedures state that also-if you dont land in touchdown zone you should make a goaround even if the runwqy is 4000m...</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Kodi -openelec 5.08 on raspberry pi 2...more times then usual slow streaming?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-02-01 01:56:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hello guys, So i have been running kodi on raspi2 and everything was fine (under fine i mean that 95%of the time i would be able to get streaming with no problems) But these days i get slow streaming speeds, no buffering, no stream available and just generally to start the movie or series i need at least of 15 minute hassle that i now just download it from torrent and watch over the network.. So any suggestions for this-happens mostly on weekends but i dont know if that is related to kodi servers being full...i have 50mbit network so i doubt it is on my side... Any ideas, advices? [edit] yea sorry i forgot to add some details. I use Genesis addon and sources like vidics and others cant remember now i am not at home but will update when i come home... Thx</TEXT>

I have set up Real Debrid account and payed for 3 months and boy i was wrong, the links in Exodus work better than Real Debrid premium links... I mean it starts streaming right away and with subtittles but when i choose real debeid it is stuttering... The onlyy thing i miss from genesis is the easy kodi library integration...if exodus does that it would be the look no more addon. Now i use Trakt:Progress added to my favourites so it is only 1 click away from me.</TEXT>

If the rest of the dota community is like those few players then that is just a shame! Those guys are picking the most important roles (but have the lowest rank), going double mid, screaming at you and all that when we all tried to ask nicely and arrange something together. And I usually ask those random guys Good day, what do you want fo play? And in return i get no answer- they pick shaman mid and start flaming...All i can do is report and explain but i never saw some of them get baned or low prio or something.:(</TEXT>

Was thinking of using amazon firestick TV, is anybody using this and what do you have to say (pro/con wise). It looks handy with the remote Thanks</TEXT>

This is the event's fault?  gt; I had to take a whole week off from my fulltime job. Had to? You chose to.... and again, this is the event's fault?  gt; I had to travel 7 hours to Paris and 7 hours home. How dare they not cater to your specific geographical needs? While you have other criticisms, none of them are of any real substance. Yes the premium seating was a ripoff, yes the goodie bag is a ripoff. That has been the case at almost EVERY dota event ever apart from TI. I could understand if this was your first event, except you yourself say you have been to many. YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER. I replied to this comment. Was that your first one? Although I can put some more time and thought in replying to your every sentence I will just say this - your comment is not really constructive. It sounds that you are almost defending their poor organization.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Aaand that is only the beginning: You didn #8217;t mention the condensation in cockpit on the escape hatch during a flight which is 1hr or more so when you land you are splashed with water. FO side lower right corner where your foot is located-there is a 10cm diameter a/c hole blowing all the time over your foot to a temp sensor in between your legs (to help regulate the temp) who da fck put it there ?! My foot has been dead first few flights before i started to put some a4 paper over it. FMS #8217;s are not connected. You couldn #8217;t open doors if the flight went through icing or cold weather (which for us was all the time over alps) so cabin crew cant open the main fuselage door because the seal is frozen. Did I mention it was built in Canada? Cold weather? All problems start because of cold weather which shouldn #8217;t be the case!! During winter months water in toilet would freeze up so our maintenance would drain it and turn off the flush and water in toilets (you were given a bottle of water). Again built in C A N A D A. Localizer intercept with speed over 180kts-no way it WILL overshoot every time. LANDING this plane. Just. I cant. I had no words, you have to ADD power on flare in order to keep it not plummeting into the ground. First few landings were OMG The length (ARM) between its main landing gears is huge, so if you are just a few cm #8217;s in traverse the landing will be shit But to be honest still it helped me gain hours and get into a bigger and better plane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good day , Tried wings of Liberty and in my opinion it is too big if you just want a quick 30mins of shooting. I spawn (after the really bad menu) and after waiting for 2 minutes for the whole engine start sequence to finish I am finally able to depart. Then you have to fly -only in cockpit mode for long time. Get your engine overheating because your throttle control is not that accurate so it jumps from 60 to 80%. Land in a field. Again dreadful menu, spawn, start sequence, fly 10minutes to location, manage to spot some enemies, try to padlock but hey wait there is none-you don #8217;t have VR or Track IR well then just go home player, there is no way of tracking with camera the plane you wanna shoot up except with your hotas but setup of that is just. Hyperlobby had options. Want a quick shoot up with 50 planes in 2NM ring radius, no problem. Want missions, no problem. Want all realistic shit-lemme use radiators and pump some fuel and use carburetor heat and all that other stuff well here is a server for you also. I am flying all day in real life I don #8217;t need that back home, Just want to get up there with realistic aerodynamics and physics without that other shit and see some wings falling off. Whoa that must have been bottling inside me for some time. Thank you</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am also having similar problems. One scraper works and another doesn #8217;t and that is all with Real Debrid (premium account) Looks like different scrapers have different priorities on hosting servers (imho). So I have lost a bit of faith in Real Debrid (try watching a movie Green Book) so sometimes I just download a torrent from IPT on pc and put it in library and watch through Pled but that defeats the whole purpose of paying for Real Debrid. Anyone knows how to increase reliability?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hello guys, Why does Venom and all add-ons once they get updated break everything. So I came after vacation, wanted to watch a show and opened Venom. Saw that it is updated-ok I know I have to do RD reauthorization again. So I do it and then get this problem:Seasons-Nothing was found. Ok I had that before (using kodi for 7years, paying RD for like 3). Lemme try Seren, it is just bleh. Ok let me install new add-on Techstream Fork, but that is just don #8217;t have the words with all the slow loading. I am this close to dump this all shit and go and pay for Prime, Hulu, Hbo, Netflix and all together and die a better death from starvation rather than stress of waiting, reinstalling, waiting, reauthorizing etc etc... Sorry for the whining i just needed to release some steam.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good evening The, Are you the admin or the software developer for Venom or something that feels like he needs to defend himself like this? Don #8217;t be a sensitive little b* and just reply constructively to my (what I already acknowledged by myself whining). Everybody got it that the whining wasn #8217;t pointed at no one but just a way of bitching in general after my frustration. And yes I am using it that long but never had so much problems and updates that I needed to clear cache so probably I missed a class where everybody learned to clean a cache. Now I got it and will try to see if it works. I am supporting all developers that are doing this for no money at all and thank you if you are one of them. Now that I got your attention, Venom is slow in opening Trakt My collection. Thank you in advance, (Grabs popcorn)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How old are you? The reason I am asking is that I have read the books when I was 17-19 and I read them few times each. I was thinking of reading them again but am afraid that my adult changed brain might spoil the memory I have. Reason is that in my opinion some books you need to read at the right time to get hooked and I dont want to spoil that. As example: Star Wars-I watched the movies when I was younger and now when I watch new Star Wars I see some parts which are for new kids and I dont mind I just notice some parts. So my question is this , will the stupid adult 33 yr old brain of mine spoil the experience of reading them again? Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Good then. Well I haven #8217;t personally used it but I really don #8217;t think I need to upgrade my Xs and I was actually looking forward to but I just cant justify that now after release. It doesn #8217;t have to be big but at least they can try. Samsung at least tries (foldable phone),Huawei at least tries in innovation etc. I would open my own company but I would be probably goal and customer satisfaction oriented rather than income oriented and that company would go under in few months. Edit. Comma was missing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Actually I have a very good job and can pay no problem. What I hate is that ever single expansion needs purchasing, downloading, getting used to, new menu, new planes. I am not 25 anymore. Just give me all planes and options where to play with servers. 1946 had it all sorted out. So take your little childish contradicting elsewhwre because my points are valid. Make one game. Price it 100euro and I will gladly pay for it if it is all inside. Or check cd project red.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Any electricians here? Need help with wire sizes for Induction hob</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-06-16 16:18:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Good day guys, I would like to install an induction hob in my kitchen. However as I live in UAE they mainly use gas here which I hate. My house currently has a 4mm wire and 20A breaker. Induction hob is rated at 7.4kW. I wanna change the wiring but since my conduit is only 25mm I am kinda limited. Electrician said he will pull 2x 10mm wires and 1x4mm wire for grounding and 40A circuit breaker. Is this safe? Can I install 3x 6mm wires and like 32A CB and be safe. Main concern is fire hazard? Thanks</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was talking to some electricians and they say since I wont use all 4 at the same time when starting the hob even 4mm and like 25A would be fine. Some other electricians say 6mm and 32A is fine. Am a bit confused who to believe because if something goes wrong I will have to pay for it. Maybe I am just paranoid for no reason.</TEXT>
