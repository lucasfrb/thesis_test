    <TEXT>How do I create humorous NPCs that aren't annoying? I want to add some humor to my game to keep the tone light, but I've been sticking with normal or serious NPCs thus far because I'm nervous that any funny or weird NPC I try to create will end up being annoying to the PCs. Anyone got ideas on how to create funny NPCs that won't irritate the PCs?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The dark wizard could be attempting to get a powerful magical item (maybe a weapon of some kind) which can only be attuned to by good-aligned creatures, and he needs her to activate and use it. Or, the dark wizard needs a spell component from a creature which can only be approached by good-aligned people. Maybe getting the spell component would even result in the creature's death, which would present an interesting moral dilemma. Hope this helps!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know exactly what the feeling you're describing is like. It's really tough to feel like you've messed up with no way of fixing it. Here are a few tips that I think might help: 1. Like other people have said, if you're starting to feel crushed from the pressure, call for a break. In my experience, the players don't mind and might even welcome a break to have a little time to chat, get a drink, etc. While they're doing their thing, think about what was just happening during the session and write down a few notes about how you might want to proceed. 2. Give yourself a little time to think at the table. You might be feeling extra pressurized because you feel like you have to figure everything out immediately at the table. It's okay to say to the players, "give me a second to think about this." If you need more time, then take a break like in the above note. 3. Let your players know when you haven't been having fun at the game because of your mistakes. They'll likely be more lenient when you do make mistakes and you'll feel less pressure. 4. Try to write down an outline before each session. It's difficult to run everything from memory, and you don't even have to write extensive notes. For example: your players are in a dungeon and about to explore a couple different rooms. A segment of your outline might look something like: **Temple room** 1. Carvings of Gruumsh on the walls 2. Arrow trap in doorway 3. Touch altar: 4 quasits emerge from the rafters  amp; attack TL;DR tell your players when you're not having fun anymore when you're feeling pressured, give yourself a little time to think at the table or take a short break from the game, and always write down a very brief outline before each session</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So a couple weeks ago I was cleaning out my room because I was tired of it being cluttered. I go under my bed and see a large red box. I'd received it as a gift from my grandma three or four years ago. I vaguely remembered putting some notebooks and things inside but I wasn't sure what all was in there. A little backstory: I've been working on a fantasy novel for six and a half years now and gone through five or six drafts on it. I've written upwards of 300,000 words over that period and I've been improving all the way. So I open the box. There's some fancy paper, an old sketchbook I never filled up, a couple dusty pencils and... my very first creative story I ever wrote. I'd almost forgotten about it, and by the gods, was it terrible (plot? I don't know her), but man, it just took me back to flip through it.</TEXT>

Like maybe a spell that creates a toothy pit in the ground (like a Sarlacc Pit) which counts as difficult terrain and deals piercing damage when you move through the space?

The weapon curses the wound, causing the character to take necrotic damage every day. If the necrotic damage reduces them to 0 hp, they turn into a zombie.

    <TEXT>Did almost this exact same thing a few sessions back. I had a story arc where a sacred unicorn of Lurue had been killed and her horn stolen. I planned for the villain to be a priest of Lurue. However, I didn't think that would make for a very interesting climactic battle and I couldn't think of a good enough motivation for the priest to take the horn from the unicorn. Last minute before the party confronted the unknown villain, I decided that the priest had actually been possessed by the spirit of a dead wizard who was using him to create a potion from the unicorn horn that could bring him back to life. Made for a way better villain and a way better battle.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Something I really wish I knew before I started DMing was to not railroad. (if you don't know what that is, railroading is when you force the plot into a predetermined outcome rather than letting the players decide what to do) If the players do something that messes up your super amazing cinematic scene you've planned, it can hurt, but act accordingly to the player's choices. As tempting as it might seem, do not force that super amazing cinematic scene upon them when doing so would contradict the player's decision. It ruins the fun for both you and the players. Similarly, always, always, always let there be more than one way for players do something important. Give important bits of knowledge to multiple NPCs, let there be multiple ways to break into the giant's fortress, etc. Hope this helps, and best of luck on your DMing journey!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's a lot more to it than you'd think, but start with reading the DMG and probably the PHB too. That'll teach you the basics. Once you've read those, try your hand at crafting a one-shot and playing it with a few people you know. That alone might actually teach you more about DMing than any of the reading, and you keep learning more every time you run a session, so it's sort of an ongoing process. I'd say learning to be a Dungeon Master is more difficult than learning how to be a player first time around, but not impossible by any means. Best of luck with this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A couple weeks ago I was talking with my band director during a band lesson about upcoming all-state auditions. I was so stressed and worried I straight up started crying in front of him. He got some tissues for me and told me (with all sincerity), "There are wolves and sheep in this world. You're a wolf." I swear it felt exactly like I was in a movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, he was actually partially inspired by ol' Voldy. Exactly! Cherry picking plots and plot pieces from already existing media can make some really amazing adventures, once you shape them to fit the world you're playing in. Recently I took a leaf out of Matt Mercer's book and had the party enter some underground tunnels in order to rescue someone at the other end, but I turned it into a long Underdark adventure arc rather than a one-session thing to travel through.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>About a year ago I had a very strange dream that I was looking for a boy who had gone missing. I was standing in this big, high-ceilinged attic filled with medieval-age junk (broken jousting sticks, old shields and swords, dusty cloaks, etc.). There were two raised platforms in front of me. The left one held a glowing, gilded chest with fog spilling from the cracks, and the right held a huge pot of steaming chicken soup. Somehow I knew the boy could be found in the pot, so I walked over to that one and lifted the lid. Inside there was a little green goblin, spluttering and choking on the hot soup. I pushed the goblin into the soup and placed the lid back on, waited a moment, and took the lid off again. Inside the boy I was looking for emerged from the soup, fully clothed. I helped him dry off with a towel and walked him back to his mom, who was waiting downstairs--but the woman who was supposed to be his mom looked exactly like my mom.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure. I feel like that dream was just my brain fooling itself, but I have had several dreams before that made me question my values and spurred me on to do good things--for example, in real life I'd had some drama with a boy and we eventually stopped talking to each other. A few months later I dreamed that I got closure from him and it felt really good. When I woke up, I thought, "I should actually go and get closure from him." So I did, and I felt a lot better. I think there was some meaning to that one.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is 10 rooms too many rooms for a one-shot dungeon?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 21:17:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have an idea for a Halloween one-shot about a spooky pocket dimension library run by an undead spirit named Dewey. There are going to be 10 rooms in the library, arranged in a circle around a central area holding the focus of the pocket dimension (this is also where the boss battle with Dewey will take place). I want each room to be based on one of the 10 categories of the Dewey decimal system. I think this makes for a good premise, but I'm afraid 10 rooms will take far too much time for my players to get through in a single three-hour one-shot. Is there any way I can ensure they move speedily through the dungeon or do I need to cut the Dewey decimal system idea?</TEXT>

I want each room to have something important in it, and If 5 rooms is the ideal amount, I think 10 rooms would probably be too much. Thanks for the input.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thank you for the long, well-thought out answer. I want to include all three of those without bogging down the story. I'm running this one-shot with experienced players, so battle shouldn't take extremely long, but I think I would probably get too stressed trying to get my players through 10 rooms in 3 hours. I'll probably cut the Dewey decimal system idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Heya! INTP female here. One of the best ways to engage us is through intellectual conversations. Some of my personal favorite topics include natural science, art, music, and philosophy. A good way to start a conversation with an INTP would include "what's your opinion on x?" We love to express our views on different topics and love it even more when our conversation partner seriously listens to what we're saying. Once you've got the conversation started with her, let her talk and really engage in listening to her response, then respond accordingly. There's nothing that turns me on more than a good intellectual conversation with someone who deeply listens to me. Best of luck with this one, mate.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My advice to you would be to immerse the players as fully as you can. Give them lavish descriptions of their surroundings that engage the 5 senses. Give your dungeon NPCs unique voices, and flesh out their characters and mannerisms. Let your players feel like they are in an ominous castle filled with lore and danger, not just a couple of connected rooms with some monsters roaming around.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair point. Backstory and the player's talent at acting and improv definitely play into RP potential, but but I feel more engaged in RP when I'm a warlock because patrons can cause such unique drama. There's an otherworldly being that I can communicate with through dreams and visions, and it gives me the occasional sidequest apart from my party members, which may or may not conflict with the party's wishes as a whole. There's hard choices to be made when the patron's goals conflict with the party's, and since in most settings warlocks are looked down upon by most of society as evil-doers, it can make some unique tension with the other party members.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>To be honest, the warlock mechanics aren't for everybody. It can definitely be annoying only being able to cast one or two non-cantrip spells per short rest. However, there is an advantage--whereas other heavy casting classes have to take long rests to regain their spells, you only have to take a short rest. During dungeon crawls this can be a huuuge advantage. As for spells--Eldritch Blast is a really good cantrip, but it's not the only damaging one. I personally really like Toll the Dead as well, so you could take both if you want to switch it up a little. If you want to go more defense, try Blade Ward.</TEXT>
