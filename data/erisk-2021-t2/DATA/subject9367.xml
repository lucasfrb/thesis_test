    <TEXT>Hey guys. I just finished a custom build and the CPU fan is a bit noisy (I believe it's the CPU and not the case fan). The case is a [Thermaltake](http://thermaltakeusa.com/products-model.aspx?id=C_00002680) and the CPU is an [AMD FX-8350](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113284). [](/sp) Either way, what would be a better CPU fan to use that isn't too expensive?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I was re-watching some old episodes, **Message Recieved**, when we first meet Yellow Pearl and Yellow Diamond. I know there had been some debate as to weather the Diamonds had really been that big all along since we see YD pick up two Pearls in one hand in the latest episode. Well [take a look at this picture](http://imgur.com/a/rYkbI). Then [at this one](http://imgur.com/a/hOJGO). I think they've kept the proprtions the same.

    <DATE>2017-01-13 17:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've been a longtime Nintendo fan. I've been playing the GameBoy since '95 and I've had every handheld since. I loved the Super Nintendo, GCN, Wii and Wii U. But boy, did the Wii U take my wallet for a ride. [](/sp) I love being a social gamer. Have friends over for co-op and local multiplayer. Smash Bros, Mario Kart, Nintendo Land, NSMB, etc. If I can hand my friends a controller and say "Play with me" I'm happy. [](/sp) But man, the Wii U took my wallet for a ride. So it comes with the Gamepad, great. Every system comes with its own controller. I got the system on launch day and bought NSBU. I had a couple left over Wii Remotes from the Wii that I let my friends use. Then I saw Nintendo Land. It required a Wii Remote with Motion Plus. Alright fine, got some of those through sales and rechargeable batteries. Then I get Mario Kart 8. Everyone hates the Wii Remote set up. I get a couple Pro Controllers. Hey, at least I can use these for Smash Bros. and other games too. Then Smash Bros. comes out. All my friends want to use their GameCube controllers. Okay, the adapter is only like, $20, I can do that. ____ What the shit Nintendo. Nobody else does this. Why do I need another controller for every other game? I see what you're doing already with the JoyCons. I just want a system where I can play 100% of the games with maybe one other controller necessary for a friend with what it comes with. Stop making controller gimmicks and give us a standard one. Stop trying to be innovative. Stop trying to be creative with how we play games. I thought we left motion controls behind after the Wii, but apparently I was wrong. Just give us a regular controller and let us play our games!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-01-16 20:23:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So in the episode *Sadie's Song* we get to hear a musical number sung by Saide and Steven. [Song Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3sH7S1SlyA). If there's one thing the Crewniverse does, it's subtley and very careful word choice and small details that hint at something. Let's disect the song lyrics for a moment. [](/sp)  gt;I can't help it if I make a scene, stepping out of my hot-pink limousine. I'm turning heads and I'm stopping traffic, Other than rhyming with *Palinquin*, it's a mode of transport generally for those of high importance, such as a diamond. When a diamond is involved, it's of the upmost importance and people stop what they're doing.  gt; When I pose they scream and when I joke they laugh As a diamond, she commands the other gems. They'd do anything she wanted them to.  gt; I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in, they're hypnotized by my way of walking. I've got them dazzled like a stage magician. Pink Diamond took humans captive for the zoo. If she was like the other diamonds, she had diamond shaped pupils too. She could have easily used her powers to trick and trap ancient humans.  gt;When I point they look and when I talk they listen. Again, she commands a whole colony to be built for Earth.  gt;Well everybody needs a friend, and I've got you and you and you. So many I can't even name them can you blame me I'm too famous! When you're a diamond, I'm sure it's easy to lose track of all the individual gems you're employing. Even Yellow Diamond didn't recognize which Peridot was reporting to her from Earth. Everyone knew Pink Diamond and we know she loved the Rose Quartzes.  gt;Haven't you noticed I'm a star? I'm coming into the view as the world is turning. If the mural means anything, Earth was Pink Diamond's first colony. She was just getting started and being recognized as a great leader.  gt;Haven't you noticed I've made it this far? Now everyone can see me burning. Now everyone can see me burning. Now everyone can see me burning. At the height of her popularity and colonizing the Earth, Rose Quartz rebelled and started fighting against homeworld. This is when the war began which ultimately leads to Pink Diamond being shattered.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>How can I [25 M] raise my GF's[26 F] self esteem?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-20 06:10:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So while this relationship is new, the better part of two months, there is something I've noticed: she doesn't think highly of herself. I'm very open with her and she tries to be with me. She's afraid I'll be upset if she doesn't like something I do and has trouble speaking up at times. Last week I noticed something was bothering her. I had to pry out of her that she wanted more foreplay before penetration. I told her that as fine! I'd definitely try next time. I've talked with her as to why she thinks I'll be mad. Apparently one of her ex's was like this. Almost anything she'd do that wasn't perfect would set him over the edge and he'd get angry. We'll call him G. [](/sp) She's still friends with G and they talk from time to time. They did a gift exchange at Christmas. She bought him Barney's Playbook and he bought her the entire collection of *Legend of Korra* on DVD. He then belittled her and said that she didn't care about their friendship, because her gift was thoughtless and he spent *SO* much more money on her's. Two weeks ago, when she started telling her friends that we were dating, G goes off on her again. G gets upset and doesn't talk to her and G's GF is blowing up my GF's phone. I've been teaching and playing Dungeons and Dragons with her, and apparently G wanted to play for years and got super jealous? [](/sp) One day my GF and I were watching Steven Universe. One character, Jasper, shows up and begs another character, Lapis, to fuse with her. Jasper is an antagonist and wanted to be with Lapis to become a bigger, stronger character. She felt like nothing without their combined power even though it was horrible for both of their wellbeings. I asked my GF:  gt;"Is that you and G?" She said yes. [](/sp) I've told her that she shouldn't be friends with someone who treats her that way and that she shouldn't put up with it. I suggested a price limit on gifts so nobody gets hurt feelings. Other than D amp;D I've been teaching her Magic the Gathering. She's getting really into it and having fun. She's still learning, but apologizes a lot for taking a while on her turns. If she forgets a rule or some mechanic she calls herself stupid. She's played five games, I don't expect her to know everything yet. She's even beaten me a few times! I repeatedly asked her to not call herself stupid and that it upsets me. She does have a lot of talents. Last week I learned she can play the piano. She can also read music! She played a song from Lez Miserable, On My Own, and we sang it together. She didn't think it was something much, but I told her it was amazing! Lastly, she is a bigger girl. I'd say she's fluffy. It doesn't botherme, but I know how it can be being bigger. I don't know if she has body issues and I haven't brought it up with her. [](/sp) What can I do to help her feel better about herself? --- **tl;dr**: GF stays in contact with toxic ex and has low self-esteem. What can I do to help her raise it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been teaching my GF how to play Magic. We started with some standard to get the basics out of the way. We played for about two weeks and asked her if she was ready to start Commander. She said she was. We went out in hopes to find Meren, but no luck between three stores. We setteled on Daxos instead. She got sleeves and a deck box for it too. I explained each card to her as we sleeved them so she would feel a little more confident when playing. ____ The first game we played was against [[Rhys, the Redeemed]]. She hates him now. Mana ramp and token spam out the ass. She didn't like my four X/X Constructs attacking her for ~60 damage each. The second game I used [[Pia and Kiran Nalaar]]. I thought I was in good shape but she had a Sol Ring turn 1 and was able to cast [[Aura of Silence]] turn two. I had to spend four mana to even get out my [[Fire Diamond]]! Her biggest weakness, as most new players, is not being agressive enough. There were a few turns I couldn't do anything and she didn't attack me while I slowly built up enough mana to cast my artifacts. After I had enough mana, I was able to recur [[Spine of Ish Sah]] several times to clear her board and stabelize. She got really upset, but she still had fun! She's still learning and I hope she continues to learn and play!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>When your Internet decides to poop; a voucher out that doesn't decrease your SR</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-01-31 07:51:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I was playing a handful of games with some randos I met online. We were doing really well, though I was carrying the team. Anyway, in our last game, my connection went to poop. Ping was fluctuating between 15 to 315. I'd turn a corner and see nothing, then I'm dead. I could barely play at all. I knew if I quit I'd lose a big chucnk of SR, but I still tried to play through it. We lost. 3 to 1. I think there should be a way for B.Net to look at the connections of everyone in the game and if the ping is going all over the place and doesn't stay stable, offer the player a message:  gt;##*Your connection isn't very stable, would you like to be removed from this game at a cost of 15 SR?* Or something like that. Yeah, you still lose some SR, but it's not a lot but it saves you from being tortured the whole time. You're not playing at that point, you're just delaying the inevitable. It also doesn't punish you for dropping out of a competitive game because this was something outside your control.

In the last week, however I've had a decrease in my GPU performance. It's started to get too warm too easily. Playing Overwatch on medium settings will cause it to go between 78 #176;C-81 #176;C.

One time two weeks ago the whole thing overheated and closed the game. ____ I do have a new card on the way (GTX 1050) but I want to know if it's even worth saving this old card.

    <TITLE>Remembering the Wii U</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-02-26 08:15:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Right now, we enter the last six days before the Switch. The Wii U will soon be a distant memory for some, and a fond experience for others. I'm making this post as a send off for Nintendo's eighth generation system. I'll share my experiences, thoughts and commets, and hope you guys will do the same. #Cons Many complaints were made against the Wii U.  gt; * Marketing was poorly done; most people thought it was a tablet add-on for the Wii.  gt; * There was little to no third-party support.  gt; * First party games were far and few between.  gt; * I still had to pay for Virtual Console games I already bought before. [](/sp) Sure, every system has its flaws, there is no perfect system. But too many people have been focusing on the negative. Don't think about how Nintendo screwed up; instead, try and focus on what they tried and the risks they took to create a unique experience. You don't look back at your favorite song and think about the not so great parts, you remember the good ones. I'm not saying you have to have loved the Wii U, but it did try some really cool things. ____ ##The System First off, we got Nintendo Network ID's. No more Friend Codes. We could simply look each other up and add each other! Not only that, but you had video chat built into the tablet to talk with your friends over the Internet! Next was the tablet controller itself. Honestly, this thing is still amazing. Being able to stream the game screen directly into your lap is a god-send for people who have to share a television. If you want to sit down and play your game, but the TV is already in use, you simply play off the tablet! The headphone jack lets you hear the game without bothering anyone else too! You also had the TV remote and IR blaster on the tablet, so you could easily change channels and inputs without having to find your normal remote. [](/sp) Of course, these features don't mean much when you buy a game system to play... Well, games! This is where I think Nintendo did something really cool that had a lot more potential. ##Assymetric Gameplay Know what my most played game on the Wii U is? Nintendo Land. Why? Because I could play five player games! Mario Chase was an absolute blast. Running around the levels and having your friends chase you down was so simple, but so much fun. Or teaming up with my friends in Metroid Blast or Battle Quest. Animal Crossing: Sweet Days always had us laughing and screaming at each other, and Luigi's Mansion brought about dread as I would knock everyone out. I also had a lot of fun in Game amp;Wario, but I mostly played Sketch because Pictionary is simple, easy, and still fun. [](/sp) This idea could have been so much better, been so much more. Mario Party 10 used it really well, pitting Bowser against the other party members. I haven't played it myself, but unless you had a full five person game, I hear it was too easy to knock out the CPU players. The idea that one player is against four others, with a beefier character and some extras was really cool. ##The Games I can't speak for others here, but I only had a handful of games for the Wii U. But even still, I had a lot of fun playing them. I already mentioned Nintendo Land and Game amp;Wario, but I also had: * Pikmin 3 * Mario Kart 8 * Hyrule Warriors * Mario Maker * Super Smash Bros. * Zelda: Wind Waker * Zelda: Twilight Princess These games were phenomenal on the Wii U. I had so much fun just playing these games and getting sucked into their worlds, and their use of the tablet worked great. ###Pikmin 3 I've been playing Pikmin since the first one, so I'm used to a standard controller set up. But the implementation of an active overhead map was a great addition. I could easily spot fruit to gather and see hazards before even being in that area! Not only that, but being able to divide up captains and spread resources out was a good challenge and an interesting way to complete the game. The challenge mode was a good addition as well, and making it for two players meant I could share the fun with my friend who also loves Pikmin. ###Mario Kart 8 What can I say, it's Mario Kart! It's fast, it's fun, it's racing! The anti-gravity tracks were cool, the graphics were great, the soundtrack was amazing, and the whole thing was just spectacular! I didn't do too much online racing, but there was very little lag on my end and the games got intense. While I was a little disappointed with half the roster being Koopalings, the DLC tracks and characters were very welcomed with their low price for all it added. Did I mention it's a lot of fun to throw Link into the Blue Falcon and race around an Animal Crossing town? ###Hyrule Warriors I had never played a *Warriors* game before, but this looked like a lot of fun, and boy was I right! From the get-go you get to just slaughter hoards of enemies. The gameplay is fast and active. You get info and updates on the tablet and you can even do co-op with a friend! Not only that, but you still have secrets and puzzles to explore. Granted the game focuses more on the combat than a traditional Zelda game, but the Adventure Mode can more than satisfy your yearning for a more authentic experience. Unlocking more and more characters and weapons helps keep the game fresh. You have any idea how much fun it is running around as Ganondorf and annihilating bokoblins? ###Super Mario Maker I grew up with platformers, it's easily my favorite genre. When I heard you'd be able to create, share, and play customized Super Mario levels, in any flavor from the original to *New*, my body was more than ready. Coming up with ideas took a while to be sure, but I had the most fun designing Ghost Houses, with puzzles, traps, and misdirection. Yeah, a lot of the online courses were brutally hard and only the best of the best could complete them, but you could still share level codes with friends and online communities! ###Super Smash Bros. (Wii U) For me, each Smash Bros. game has been better than the last. It was sad to see some things disappear, such as Adventure Mode, but the Challenges were a nice addition. The use of amiibo figures helped add so much more to this game for me. My friends and I would train up our figures to level 50 and pit them against each other to see who was the best. Omega versions for each stage was a lot of help too, since I can get competitive at times, it helps to have an even, flat stage to play on. But now I can listen to the Mega Man II music while we do it! The character roster is bigger than before; I can play as Ryu? Hell yeah, I can shoot fireballs for days with my manual inputs! Did I also mention you can use your 3DS as a controller and play up to eight fighters? ###Wind Waker/Twilight Princess I haven't noticed too much change between these from their original versions. Other than a graphical upgrade, which is fantastic, Wind Waker gets you the Super Sail to really cut down on sailing times. I actually haven't played Twilight Princess yet (only recently bought it and was busy with Season 3 in Overwatch), but nothing can replace dungeon crawling and discovering items like a Zelda game. [](/sp) ____ I'm sure most people in this sub own a Wii U and have games they've enjoyed on it. At the end of the day, that's what really matters: What you enjoy. That's why we game. Everyone has likes and dislikes. I'm sure most of us here have more than one gaming system too, and that's okay! Gaming isn't an exclusive "Members Only Club." It's for everyone and anyone, and that's what Nintendo tries to do best; let *EVERYONE* play. Heck, right now I'm playing Kingdom hearts 1.5 Final Mix while I wait for Breath of the Wild! But again, what it boils down to is the fact that you had fun. If you don't like a certain game, genre or even system, that's fine! You're allowed to not like something. But that doesn't mean others have to agree with you. Yeah, the Wii U didn't do so well by anyone's standards, but you know what? I still had fun with it. There have been weeks that I've gone without playing it and do I regret it? No. Because it still helped me create memories, bonds and experiences, online and off, with friends, with other gamers. So c'mon guys, squeeze every last drop of life out of your Wii U before you dive into the Switch!</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-08 22:21:04</DATE>
    <TEXT>So right now, if you don't wear any special clothing, you have a nice center point where Link can be comfortable in any area. When you equip say, the Warm Doublet, it decreases the threshold in which Link can get cold, meaning he can freely move in cold areas without any risk of freezing. However, this does not increase the threshold in which he gets warm. Wearing the **Warm** Doublet in say, Gerudo Desert, doesn't make him heat up any quicker. I think that instead of reducing how the weather effects you on one side, it simply rotates to show where your new comfort zone is. [It'd look like this](http://imgur.com/a/ztz1I). What do you guys think? Would you like the clothing to work like this?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So there's a part where you place down a round bomb and then tilt the Beast to make it roll and go through a tube to blow open a few rocks. Well I wasn't thinking and threw the bomb to make it roll enough. I blew open the first part and it opened a window. I climbed outside of the Beast and jumped down with my gilder to fly through the now opened window, not realizing that was totally not intended for me to do. After realizing my folly, I used Magnesis on the giant ball to press a switch, this time ignoring the tilting.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-03-14 23:18:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>The idea of Zelda being an RPG has been debated time and again, with Nintendo putting it under *Action/Adventure*. But now that BotW really lets you play any way you like, does this allow us to call it an RPG? Does the use of numbers for equipment and micromanaging put it in the RPG category? Or is there something more to it? What do you guys think?</TEXT>

I didn't think anything about it since this wasn't the first time to happen. Well when I got home I plugged it in, but nothing came on to show it was charging. I left it in over night. Right now, it's not powering on. There's still nothing to show that it's charging. Is my iPod gone? Do I need to get a replacement now?</TEXT>

These guys will see you before you notice them, and they will arc their shots. Not only that, but they'll lead their shots too, so you run into them! And they'll still hit you from behind cover! These guys are so annoying, and all you get is an octo-balloon and tentacle? Granted they can remove rust from weapons, but how often do you keep a rusty weapon? I hate the octorocks in this game the most of any other enemey. Kill on sight!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[spoilers] My gripe with armor</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-21 21:36:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm about 100 hours into the game. For a better part of it, I was just wearing the Hylian set and enhancing it as I could. I purchased the Rito armor set when I found it to explore the colder regions; I became a cross dresser for the Gerudo; the Gorons helped me from combusting. [](/sp) I eagerly took these armor pieces to the great fairies. I wanted them to be more useful and give good protection. What a sad, sad realization that was. The Champion's Tunic is 32 defense by itself when enhanced four times. Add in the soldier's grieves and helmet and you're looking at a solid 88 defense. While this doesn't provide any set bonus, the fact that it provides 28 more defense far surpasses any extra features of the other sets. [](/sp) I had upgraded the Barbarian Set all the hoping it'd help me take on lynels and other big baddies. But only a 60 defense? Sure the damage amplifier is nice and I reduce stamina consumption when charging attacks; but that's all worthless if I get knocked out. The Zora armor is fun to increase swim speed and reduce stamina drain while dashing, but as soon as I enter combat I switch out of it. I've found the rubber leggings and shirt fairly late into my playthrough. I still have yet to equip them or really see a use for them. There's a headpiece out there somewhere. I don't see a point in enhancing armor sets beyond level 2. Maybe I'm alone in this, maybe I'm not. [](/sp) Do you guys feel the armor sets and bonuses are worth the penalty in raw defense?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>If you aren't familiar with Oracle of Ages and Seasons for the GameBoy Color, they had a unique feature. By completing one game, you got a code to use in the other. What the code did was unlock certain things for you and continue a larger story. Playing the linked game, you saw Zelda travel across the lands to visit the kingdom of the second game, only to be kidnapped by Twinrova. They seek to sacrifice her to resurrect Ganon, as without her essense, he'd remain a mindless beast. You stop their plot but the ceremony had already begun and Ganon is brought back as a rampaging monster. [](/sp) In Breath of the Wild, we are introduced to Calamity Ganon. This incarnation of evil is a mindless beast filled with rage who seeks to do nothing but wreak havoc and destruction. [](/sp) Am I saying that BotW falls on that side of the timeline? No. But it is interesting to notice some more inspiration drawn from other games.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Should I get Skyward Sword?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-03-24 05:55:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I've played and beaten every other 3D Zelda adventure out there. From Ocarina of Time to Breath of the Wild, and everything in between, I've played from start to finish all those titles. But I never got around to Skyward Sword. When that came out I was just getting into PC gaming and with all the hubub of "waggle controls," and "I really hate Fi!" it didn't sound that good. I also didn't have a Wii Motion Plus Wii Remote then either. But now I read people saying it was a lot of fun. I did get to try a little bit at a friend's house. I made it to the surface in the forest area. Fighting was a bit odd. Whenever I Z-Targeted, the enemy would always block my attacks, wheter it was a jab, horizontal or vertical slash. I always tried to counter how they were standing with the appropriate attack, but it never worked unless I stopped Z-Targeting, but I digress. [](/sp) I have enough My Nintendo gold coins to download it from the eShop for my Wii Uat a discount. I have the proper remotes for it too. Should I just go ahead and get it? Do I owe it to myself as a Zelda fan to sit down and play through Skyward Sword?</TEXT>

When the Darknuts follow you, you can't just focus on one because they get too close together and block your attack as you attempt to hit the other one. And waiting for an opening is so tedious! [](/sp) Redeads are also annoying because of their paralyzing scream. You try to attack one and the one behind it screams and thr one closer to you knocks you down!

    <TEXT>So I'm playing LttP on my New 3DS, and it's the SNES version. This means saving and loading brings you to three hearts and only in a select few locations (Sanctuary, Link's House, or top of the Pyramid). Because of that I'm using Save States, pretty much only as I enter dungeons or wherever I am when I'm about to turn the game off. But the dungeons are shorter than I remember and a lot less puzzles. In the Dark World's forest dungeon, where you get the fire rod, I was only in a total of like, four rooms. I know it's a unique dungeon in that it can go in and out of the dungeon into the world again, but I was finished in like, 10 minutes! Granted I played this game a lot growing up, but not enough to have dungeons memorized, only the overworld. I'm currently in the Ice Palace because I need that Blue Tunic because the Dark World hurts. What about you guys? Did LttP ever give you trouble?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When I first started playing Magic, I was 12 going on 13 in the middle of the first Mirrodin block. I had a really cool card called [[One Dozen Eyes]] that got you a bunch of cool tokens. However, back in 2004, I don't remember having any tokens, not even in boosters. To this day, I can't find a 5/5 beast token to use for that card. Through the years, Wizards has started to slip tokens into boosters that could be used for that set. Now in Amonkhet, the bundle not only comes with the lands and 10 boosters, but all the necessary tokens you could use in the set, including the special embalmed tokens! I hope this is something they keep going forward. I love using tokens instead of a random empty sleeve or a spare card lying around. Edit: It also comes with the Gideon Emblem from the new Planeswalker.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For as long as I've been playing Magic, tokens have been apart of the game. 1/1 green insect, 3/3 colorless artifact golems, 1/1 warriors with vigilance, the list goes on. Opening the odd pack nowadays may get you a token, god knows how many 2/2 zombies I got from EDM and SOI, but for that rare token that you may need, they were hard to come by. In the Amonkhet bundles, however, every token the set could use is in there! From 5/5 wurms, to a 1/1 white zombie cat with lifelink, all the tokens are included, along with the new Gideon emblem! Each token is also double sided. I hope Wizards does this for each set moving forward. Really adds value to the bundles.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Theory about Lars</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-06-12 07:31:51</DATE>
    <TEXT>Before I delve into this, I need to explain some parts of Magic the Gathering, specifically, Planeswalkers. If you already know about Planeswalkers, you can skip this. #Planeswalkers: So in the Magic multiverse, there are powerful magic wielding beings called *Planeswalkers*. They have immense magical power that allows them to cast spells, summon creatures, and even walk between planes (or dimensions). In terms of the game, you actually play as a planeswalker with all their powers in tact, unrelated to the actual cards. A Planeswalker gets their spark in a near death experience. When placed under immense pressure and stress, in a do or die situation, their spark will ignite and they flee from their current situation to safety into another plane. Once they realize their original reality has been shattered, they seek to explore other realities and learn what the multiverse has to offer. ____ #Domri Rade There is a specific Planeswalker I want to talk about. His name is [Domri Rade](http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/domri-rade). He is from the Plane of Ravnica, the City of Guilds. He was orphaned in the city and was constantly on the run, either from the Orzhov Cyndicate or the Azorious Senate. He tried to join the Gruul Clans (think barbarians) who live in the wilds outside the city, but they deemed him too scrawny and and weak to be of any use. One day, he is pitted against an Orzhov procession who sought to attack the wilds he called home, so he commanded a herd of ragebeasts to defeat them. He has a powerful magic that can summon, command and enhance these creatures. ____ #So What About Lars? Okay, so if you looked at that link, you'll see they look very similar; small tuft of hair on the head, scrawny, and strange ear piercings. But now think of what just happened to Lars: * Near death experience * Head allows for inter-dimensional travel * Is connected to lion, who can be seen as a beast We've also seen that Lion possess powers, most likely due from whatever Rose did to him. I'm sure Lars has special powers now that he has yet to discover. Lars is a Planeswalker!</TEXT>

If Blizz let users trade skins and unlocks, people would probably quiet down about duplicates and not getting what they want. It also means people that missed events are still able to use those skins. Duplicates would be given an option: hold onto a spare or redeemed for currency. However, event tied unlocks cannot be traded until after the event is finished. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For some of you who may not remember, we got a game called [Drill Dozer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_Dozer) back in 2006. You may remember her [as an assist trophy in Brawl.](http://www.nindb.net/wii/super-smash-bros-brawl/img/cameos/assist/jill.png) The main character, Jill, has her father kidnapped by a rival gang and she has to rescue him. It's a puzzle/platforming game with a drill mech used to unlock new areas and find powerups throughout each level. [](/sp) One of the coolest parts about this GBA game was its built in rumble feature; that's right, it had a gyro in the cartridge. It was awesome feeling that thing go off as you plowed through enemies and broke down walls. But now we have a new system that we can take on the go. With built in HD Rumble. I'd love to see a new adventure busting up banks and stealing goodies again.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know Nintendo doesn't like to directly compete with Sony and Microsoft; they want to create a new and unique experience with each system. But like it or not, everyone will compare the three companies together and each system will fall into a generation of gaming. For those unaware, we're in the middle of the 8th Generation with the PS4, Xbox One and... Well this is where it gets weird. The Wii U was Nintendo's 8th Gen system, but now we have the Switch. [This Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console) hasn't even been updated to place the Switch anywhere! Do we count the Switch as an 8th Gen system, or an early jump into 9? Or do we just let Nintendo completely ignore the Generation thing altogether?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Terraforming Mars; Actions</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-06 17:20:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>So last night I played Terraforming Mars for the first time and ran into some overpowered cards that got my opponent a little upset. It was his game and he explained that that each generation, everyone gets up to two actions before they have to pass to the next player. Play like this continues until everyone takes no actions on their turn and then the next phase begins. ____ So the first card I had was **Small Animals**. It says as an action I can place an animal on this card. All it showed was an image of an arrow pointing to a pawprint.  gt;How do I place an animal on this card? Do I use my own cubes or the money cubes? What's to stop me from just placing down tons of animals when my opponent has no more actions to take? The second card was the **Steel Mill**. As an action, exchange four Energy and gain two Steel, raise the Temperature up once. The last card was **Planetary Equalibrium** (I think). As an action, reduce your Energy production to raise your TR by 1. ____ I was producing 10+ energy a turn, so I was able to keep pumping out steel, raising O2 and thus my TR. My opponent felt it was too powerful because I kept boosting my TR by raising up the Oxygen level, but we saw nothing in the rules that said you can't do this as your action. I would do it whenever I had excess energy. At the end of the game, I was producing four energy, so I used my actions to reduce it to 0 and raise my TR by four. ____ He was the owner of the game and we were playing based off what he remembered but we also had our nose in the rulebook for most of the game too. [](/sp) Also, as a side note, if you don't have enough resource cubes in your color, are you supposed to not gain those resources?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm playing SS for the first time and I've made it to the first dungeon. It's been a hassle, but I just cannot stand these motion controls. Trying to fight bokoblins is a pain in the ass. * I see they're blocking on the top, so I swing from right to left, but they immediately block it. * I swing from above but they've already moved to block it. * I try to wait and strike with a horizontal attack, but as soon as there's an opening they hit me. * They block on the left side, so I swing from Right to Left, but they still manage to block the strike. These fights are tedious and un-fun. Not to mention the fact that I'm constantly having to re-center the Wii Remote because Link will get stuck with the sword pointing in a funny direction after a strike. [](/sp) The bug catching net is really awkward to use too. It seems to have some built in delay that makes it really hard to catch anything.

    <TITLE>Dungeon! Is really unfair to the Cleric</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-07-23 18:18:18</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I got [Dungeon! Fantasy Board Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1339/dungeon) this past Wednesday as a simple game to play that'll allow for a lot of people. I wasn't expecting a lot, but it's a cute little race game that's easy to explain and you can finish in 30 minutes or less. But I've noticed a problem, and it's the balancing issues among the classes. Both times I've gotten to play so far, the other player took the Fighter and I chose the Cleric. Cleric seemed like he'd be easy to win with. He only needs 10,000 in treasure to win and his Safe Areas are levels 2-4. Well that last bit is just untrue. While level 2 was a little tougher than necessary for the Cleric, I had a lot of trouble with level 3 and never even attempted level 4. By the time I cleared out most of level 2, my opponent has already gotten a various items work 4k+ apiece and was breezing through everything. And this isn't even so much about luck of the dice, but the average. [](/sp) [These are the level 3 monsters.](http://imgur.com/a/HbDIk) Only two of them require a 6+ to beat. Everything else is an 8+. This is supposed to be the middle of the "Safest" levels for the Cleric, but this just isn't true. [](/sp) [These are the level 4 monsters.](http://imgur.com/a/ZZFPk) Granted it's supposed to be a bit more difficult being at the end of the "Safe Range," but these are still a lot of high rolls. [](/sp) [Here is a graph](http://imgur.com/a/WSE5Y) showing how many times certain rolls show up among all the levels of monsters. The numbers on the left are the number of monsters, while the numbers on the bottom are the required die roll. I have omitted the Fireball and Lighting Bolts from the graph as it was very cluttered, but you may look at it [here.](http://imgur.com/a/Sy5Mi) Most of the Cleric's monsters require a roll of 8 or higher, which is about 70%. But look at the Fighter; their rolls are more evenly distributed, barely 50% are above 8! ____ At least I know now, going forward, that if it's a two player game, it's best to match your opponent's class to put pressure on them as you'll be hunting in the same levels. But if you're in a full 8 player game, the Cleric players are going to have a miserable time. [](/sp) Has anyone else played this game recently? I know it's not as complex or involved as other games, but it can still be fun.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For a lot of people, I'm sure (Settlers of) Catan was an entry game, as it was for me too. But there are a lot of problems with the game as many dice rolling games; sometimes (read **a lot**) the dice don't do anything for you, even if you have spaces with high chances of getting rolled (6's and 8's). I taught my gf how to play this past Saturday and we did the two player variant found in the rules of the *Traders and Barbarians* expansion. The trade tokens help a lot by being able to force a trade (two of your cards for two randomly from your opponent) and being able to move the robber. [](/sp) One thing I haven't tried yet is the Event Deck. It's a deck of events and dice rolls that can replace the normal dice. Does anyone have experience with it? Does it change up the game enough so that each turn you can do something? Also, I'm sure the scenarios and campaigns have more to offer, but the base game can get frustrating at times.</TEXT>

The game had an auto save feature that saved every time you completed a special stage, win or lose. If you completed it, then the Chaos Emerald would be saved to your file! Well this is still all true for Sonic Mania! Don't worry if you didn't grab all the Emeralds on your first time through, you can always go back to other levels where you know the Giant Ring locations and try there. [I just got all the Emeralds not too long ago.](http://imgur.com/a/PL05D) Good luck and have fun guys!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Sonic Mania vs Genesis; Differences and Similarities (Trivia and Spoilers)</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-08-18 16:38:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it's no secret that Sonic Mania is the true successor of Sonic  amp; Knuckles. The physics are pretty much the same, the art style matches up, and we get lots of familiar badnicks. I grew up playing the Genesis and I've bought these Sonic games over and over again. But there's a few things I noticed that have changed. [This is a screenshot comparing Sonic 2 and Sonic Mania](http://imgur.com/a/0Ffsw). [](/sp) Back in Sonic 2, 3,  amp; K if you went Super Sonic, even your life total icon would turn yellow. I believe this was due to cartridge limitations and they used the same pallet for the icon as the actual player sprite so any changes that happened to one affected the other. But as we see in Sonic Mania, the icon remains blue. I thought it would have been really cool to bring that back. [](/sp) Another thing that's different are the sign post mini games. In Sonic 2, there was only one bonus stage, the Half Pipe for the Chaos Emeralds. Once you got all seven, the game would no longer be accessible (there was no reason to play it any more). Sonic Mania's sign post bonus stage, Blue Spheres, will continue to spawn even after you have collected all the medals. If you have collected all the medals as silver, then they'll repeat until you collect them all as gold, locking out each one you've gotten gold on until they're all completed, then giving you random ones after that. However, just like Sonic 3  amp; Knuckles, jumping into a Giant Ring with all seven emeralds will simply add 50 rings to your total! [](/sp) After reading a lot of these posts, I've found out a couple things. Namely, a lot of people here didn't play the older Sonic games. A lot of stages are pulled from past games, such as [Green Hill Zone](http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Hill_Zone), [Chemical Plant](http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Chemical_Plant_Zone) and [Stardust Speedway](http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Speedway). These are more or less the same as the originals, but with extra stuff added in to fit in with Sonic Mania. But then we get to [Flying Battery Zone](http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Battery_Zone). While the name is taken from Zone 2 of Sonic  amp; Knuckles, it's made even bigger and combined with [Wing Fortress Zone](http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Wing_Fortress_Zone) from Sonic 2. The outside of the ship and turbines that lift up Sonic were staples of Wing Fortress. [](/sp) I've also seen Oil Ocean talked about a lot. I always hated that stage in Sonic 2, but Sonic Mania has made it a bit more bearable. The boss of Act 2 is actually a mix of other bosses. The orbs that break the surface were taken from the Act 1 boss of the original [Lava Reef Zone](https://youtu.be/uUxaQMnEva8?t=6m3s) boss. The claw and laser beam are true to the original, but removing the platforms is new. Hold down a longer jump to stay above the oil!! Along with that, Oil Ocean Act 2 has gas build up that eventually hurts Sonic and you have to pull a switch to air the stage. This is borrowed from Sandopolos Zone Act 2 inside the pyramid. Ghosts will follow Sonic that get bigger as the lights dim and will eventually attack and hurt Sonic. The ghosts cannot be defeated, but pulling the switch will reset the lights and stop the ghosts for a while. [](/sp) The last piece of trivia I'll fill you guys in on is the first boss in Act 2 of Green Hill Zone. If you played all the way to the end of Sonic 2 (or beginning of Sonic Generations, or the Sonic Level Pack of Lego Dimensions) you'll recognize the giant [Death Egg Robot](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ztJ9NscKOw/hqdefault.jpg)! Except in Sonic Mania, [he's a lot more menacing](http://imgur.com/a/Il1Mf). The drill arms being attached to the suit were actually adapted from Sonic Generations. ____ So, what have you guys noticed and recognized from other Sonic games or do you miss?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My biggest issue with Junkrat</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-08 00:19:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Junkrat is in a funny place right now. His ult charges super quick and his Rip-Tire can be devastating. He has two concussion mines for massive damage and good mobility, as well as a trap to immobilize players. But one thing that makes him really aggravating to play against are his normal grenades. I know people are tired of seeing this comparison, but I'm going to point to the Demoman in TF2 for a moment. His grenades can deal a lot of damage, but they arc and are slow. They also don't blow up on impact unless they make a direct hit on an enemy player first. Hitting the floor first will set them on a timer to explode later. Ricochets off a wall or ceiling that land on a player still count as a direct hit. [](/sp) Junkrat's grenades will blow up on impact from any bounce; wall, floor, or ceiling. While this makes area denial great, but it also allows him to simply spam in an area he knows where the enemy is. It promotes a blind fire mentality that doesn't promote or develop a new skill for JR. I think there should be some changes in how his grenades deal damage. A direct hit would of course deal the maximum damage, but for each surface it touches before a player, it would deal reduced damage. This way, Junkrat can still provide area denial for threat of being blown up, but also encourages him to try to make more direct hits instead of just spamming a hallway. ____ What do you guys think? Do you think they should reduce the damage on his grenades on indirect hits?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I am so excited for Friday</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-09-11 05:46:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>I have been a long time fan of the Metroid games since I first played **Super Metroid** on a zSNES emulator in 1998. I used a keyboard and save states, but I beat that game. I even got pretty good at wall jumping! As the years passed, slowly but surely, a new Metroid game would churn out. In 2002 I got **Metroid Prime** and **Metroid Fusion**! Prime was hard for 11 year old me, so I got the game guide. I even had a deja-vu moment as I was flipping through it. Though I only co-owned these games, my brother bought them and I paid him half the cost to play them too (didn't stop him from selling them later). My brother had acquired a copy of **Metroid II** for the GameBoy at some point. It took me a few years to beat it, but I managed to kill the queen and get off of SR388. I still have it too! But **Metroid Prime 2** and 3 were mine, all mine! I got Prime 2 as a Hanukkah gift the year it came out, I almost started playing it while people were still over at the house. In 2007, when I turned 16, I had pre-ordered and paid off my copy of Prime 3. While I loved those games and they were a lot of fun, the one I played the most was **Metroid: Zero Mission**. I remember the old commercials for it. I was 13 at the time and I was saving up allowances and chore money to be able to buy it for myself. The day before it comes out, however, my brother (older) tattles on me about some silly little thing. My father punishes me by grounding me from video games for a week. I end up in tears. My brother is always trying to get me in trouble and I had been waiting *months* for this game (which is forever 13 year old time). I appealed my case to my mom and she talks to my dad who revokes the punishment. The next day after school, my mom and I go to Target and there, in the glass display case, is just boxes of the new game. [](/sp) I get home and I immediately start playing. After a week or two of exploring Zebes, I beat it and discover Hard Mode, and Metroid Fusion extras! I beat every mode and unlocked the original Metroid too (which I beat one morning on the bus ride to school). I got so good I could beat the game in a day, in under two hours, and eventually in under an hour! [](/sp) Fast forward to 2010 and we get **Metroid Other M**. I didn't get it at launch. I heard too many bad things about it. Even my friend, u/FreemanC17, regrets buying it for full price. I did eventually snag it at a used price of $10. I played it for a few hours but eventually gave up. The constant shift from platforming to first person was odd, and I didn't like how the Samus was portrayed. The game just wasn't fun. I gave up after getting beaten up too many time at the same mini boss encounter. **Federation Force** came out last year and it was alright. I have yet to try it with more than two players, but it was still fun in its own unique way. [](/sp) Now, this coming Friday, is the next step in my Metroid journey. Samus finally returns to what she's known for. Blasting aliens and and becoming a powerhouse. Isolated on a hostile world with one mission: Kill. All. Metroids. These new abilities and power-ups look like tons of fun to use. Counters, time manipulation, and burst firing, Samus hasn't looked this powerful since Prime 2. I know we still have Prime 4 to look forward too, but Samus just works better on a 2D plane, and boy, is it gonna be a good time exploring SR388 again.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2017-09-23 07:04:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>Tradition was that the end screen would score you on your speed and item collection. These two things would then reveal Samus in less of her suit; the full suit, just the helmet off, or only in her Zero Suit. However, Samus Returns is different. It only cares about time completed. While it shows your item percentage on your save file as you load, the end score doesn't list it. I just beat Hard Mode with 100% items in under 8 hours. All I got was her helmet off. According to [this page](http://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-samus-returns/Endings), item collection has nothing to do with the ending poses for Samus. Though I'm not sure if having 100% items unlocks extra memories or that extra credit sequence, it's still weird it's not presented on the results screen. ____ #Edit So other Metroid games ending results are based only on completion time.

    <TEXT>So I went to my local Best Buy on the off chance they'd have any LoZ amiibo. They didn't, but did have one Koopa Trooper left. When I came into the aisle, this guy was holding a Switch and I asked him about it. He had been interested for a while, but this was his first time seeing it in a store (the store had four systems). He apparently didn't know all the system had yo offer. He was afraid about the battery life, but I explained that it depends on the game and if Joy Cons are attached. I also tought him about the motion controls for fine aiming in games like BotW and Splatoon 2. [](/sp) He said he was really excited for SMO but he was afraid Nintendo would release a better Switch next year with better features, like Blu-Tooth or improved battery. I said that it wasn't new for Nintendo to release bigger batteries like they did with the Wii U and 3DS systems. I told him that if he had even the slightest interest in a Switch and the opportunity for it, he should grab it. The ease of playing at home and then pick up and go anywhere. After maybe 10-15 minuted, he picked Zelda off the shelf too, thanked me, and went to the register. ____ This is what I love about games.

    <TEXT>So I've been a CNA for a little over five years now. This patient I'm taking care of last night has really bad short term memory, but according to the nurse she is diagnosed with Dimentia. So after dinner, she likes to go back to bed. I help her lay down around a quarter to six. She doesn't say when she wants to put on her night gown or foley bag for the night. Around nine, she asks the nurse to find her aid because she's been waiting. According to her, she told me that wanted to get to bed between 8:00-8:30. She never said any such thing. So I go in to help her and she says:  gt;What happened to Andrew? He was supposed to be here at 8:30 to help me get ready for bed! My name is Andrew, she remembered my name, but not who I was. I help her undress and fix her up for the night. She tells me she's ready for her nighttime medicine. I go tell ther nurse but he says she's already gotten them. I come back to her and told her that she already got her evening medicine. She responds:  gt;Oh, okay... And I think I know what happened to the man who was supposed to help me. It was one of two things: Either he joined ISIS or he's thinking about it! I told her that I'd warn the nurses about this new development.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>There's something off about the latest Layton Puzzles</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-18 20:13:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm going through Katrielle Layton and the Mystery Journal now and it's interesting. Having many smaller cases as opposed to a single large one is cute, but I feel it takes away from the grand adventure of the previous games. Anyway! Onto the puzzles! There have been a few puzzles that are left vague and make you infer information that you wouldn't otherwise infer. ***SPOILERS BELOW*** So puzzle 19 is called School Sisters.  gt;Two sisters attend the same school. Each morning, the younger sister sets off first, and the older sister leaves the house when the younger sister has traveled one hundred metres. The younger sister walks at one metre per second, and the older sister walks at two metres per second. What is the minimum number of seconds it would take the older sister to catch up? They live in the same house, travel the same route, and neither of them turn back on their way to school. Nowhere in the puzzle does it say that the Younger Sister *STOPS* traveling when she reaches 100m, simply that this is when the Big Sister begins her travels. I thought that while YS travels at 1m/s with a 100m lead, and BS travels at 2m/s then it would take 100 seconds to catch up. But apparently the school is only 100 meters away and this is when the YS stopped. Maybe I'm an idiot but how were we supposed to know that? I guess you're supposed to assume that YS stopped because of the last line "What is the minimum number of seconds it would take the older sister to catch up?" The true answer is 50 seconds as the BS goes twice as fast and the YS waits for her at the school. ____ This isn't the first puzzle to omit information like this, but it's the one I remembered.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The game was a success!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-26 05:00:12</DATE>
    <TEXT>So yesterday, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7f93gp/im_sorta_worried_for_tomorrow/?st=jag9ge3r amp;sh=2bf47d9d) about a one-off session I'd be doing tonight. Mostly worried because of the lack of variety of classes. With five players, I had only three classes, with Rogue and Sorcerer getting double dipped. It was two people's first time, two experienced players, and someone who hadn't played in a long time. But they had a lot of fun! The one friend I finally convinced to play the game (after years of saying no) said he would play again with our specific group, and the other players really enjoyed the dungeon and said I did a better job than some past DM's we played with. ____ I've been an on and off D amp;D player for 13 years now, first starting when I was 13. Tonight was my first time actually DM'ing a full game with a dungeon. [](/sp) #Mirror Rorrim Originally carved out by dwarves many decades ago, this mine has been abandoned after people began to go missing. Legend tells of a deep wellspring below the mine that housed a reflective body of water known as The Mirror Pool. By speaking a special incantation and then throwing anything into the pool, an exact duplicate could be produce. The pool was never discovered and the legend of the pool became misquoted as buried treasure somewhere within the mine. Many adventurers go in, but never have returned. While dwarven runes can be seen throughout the floors of the mine, the walls are the most interesting part. The walls are made of a peculiar crystalline substance. It is a reflective surface that has little bits that glimmer and sparkle, giving off light. But this is no ordinary mine, as you may have no guessed. It is sentient; the crystals are alive. ____ To speed things up, I simply put the party at the mine entrance and told them that there's word of a treasure inside somewhere, but that people don't usually come out when they come in. In the first large room they come into, a part of the wall breaks out as a small rock monster. It attempts to head-butt the dwarf sorcerer, but he misty-steps away and the rock monster falls over. The dragonborn sorcerer helps it up but the monster begins biting his hand. The dwarf fighter hits it with his war-hammer and it shatters. [](/sp) As the party spends more time in the mine, the rock monsters evolve, becoming larger in size and then reflecting the party members themselves. Before they take on the form of another creature, the twinkling of the stones become their eyes. At one point, the dragonborn stared at his reflection. He smiled at it. The reflection then frowned back and emerged from the wall and started a fight. While it was simple enough to defeat, since they crumpled the crystals, they reformed in to two copies of the dwarf fighter. At one point, the party tried to Witch Bolt the creatures, but due to the reflective nature of their bodies (and mine) it bounced off and hit another party member. They did end up being weak to acid, however, and the party used this to their advantage. [](/sp) In the North West part of the mine was a staircase leading down. In this room was a lever, a gate made of iron bars, and three chests behind the bars. The dwarf sorcerer used Misty Step again to get passed the gate, but when the lever was (eventually) pulled, it did not open the gate, however something elsewhere in the mine moved. While stuck in this little alcove, he opens the chests to find some gem stones and two keys made out of the same crystal material as the mine. When he looked up, the dwarf saw people instead of his own reflection. By fogging up and writing on the walls of the mine, they negotiated a price of 1,000 gold to be rewarded for their escape. However, he himself was stuck, so the rest of the party when to explore more, but the halfling rogue stayed behind. [](/sp) In the North East part of the mine was another staircase, but this went up. When they arrived on the new floor, they noticed the room was almost identical the last one, except this time the iron gate had been lifted already, and there was another lever on the wall. Using their Stonecunning, the dwarves realized how this mine was put together and they pulled the lever, opening the iron gate from the other room, freeing the dwarf sorcerer. Opening the chests in this room revealed the same items, gemstones and two crystalline keys. Again, people were seen instead of their own reflections on the wall behind the chests. Thinking they were trapped, the human rogue used acid splash to try and free them, but simply melted the crystalline cover, revealing bare stone. This time using gestures, they agreed to rescue these people. Before going back to retrieve their stuck friend, however, the dragonborn decided to push the lever back, almost crushing the halfling in the process. [](/sp) When the party regrouped, both the halfling and dwarf sorcerer were now trapped behind the bars; the dragonborn when back to correct his mistake. They could feel a rumbling through the whole mine felt at the South end where they came in at and went to investigate. After dealing with two more crystal monsters, they see a hidden passage leading to a lift has been opened up and take the lift down In this area, they notice a bright light coming from ahead of them and investigate. There are four torches in the room, and a mirrored ceiling with a flat reflective surface. Everyone can clearly see themselves. One torch is not light and the floor has a faint glow to it. The human rogue lights the torch and the glow disappears. They then realized to extinguish all the torches and a message appears backward in the floor in dwarvish (luckily they all had dwarvish as a language). (At this point I handed them a mirror and a piece of paper with the message printed backwards). The riddle read:  gt;With body forward  gt; And eyes in place  gt; Exit from here  gt; At backwards pace [](/sp) Following the instructions, they walk backwards out of the room and disappear from this chamber to end up in a similar looking chamber. They are now in the mirror world of this mine. They set off to find the prisoners who are trapped in this area. With the keys they found in the chests, they are able to unlock the gates keeping them in, but they break in the process; each door requiring two keys. As it turned out, the captured people were the mayor, his wife, two towns people, and four people who head the town's advisory board. The mayor says they had been captured and thrown in there while mirrored doppelgangers (Mirror Entities) assumed their form and went to wreck havoc on the town. The Mirror Entities grow stronger the longer it sees the creature it tries to imitate. The more time spent in the mine, the more it learns about that creature and how to replicate it. However they will behave in opposite fashions, such as a bizzaro world sort of thing. [](/sp) The party could not figure out how to leave the mirrored world, but the mayor had heard on how to do it; by simply walking backwards from where they entered in the first place. While I had some town RP prepared for restoring things back to order I wrapped it up at the end of the dungeon. The players really enjoyed it and I had fun seeing them stumble through my puzzles.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>When Machi Koro first came out, I jumped right on it after playing.

Does it fix a lot of the problems introduced from the original and expansions? Is it worth it as the defacto version? What are your guys' impressions of it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why Howard Stark is the single most important Marvel character for the MCU.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-11-30 22:18:06</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those who may not remember, Tony has always had issues with his father, Howard Stark. While a great genius, he wasn't always there for his son on an emotional level and it really shaped who Tony became. However, to really see his impact, we need to rewind back to World War II. [](/sp) Trying to design a serum for a Super Soldier, Howard Stark took the work of Abraham Erskine and later perfected it. The Erksine serum was used on Steve Rogers to bring out his true potential as someone who upheld justice, dignity, and loyalty. While also experimenting with vibranium, Howard also developed the shield that has become the icon for Captain America. Howard's perfected serum lead to Bucky hunting him down and killing Howard and his wife. Because of the success (and loss) of the serum, Bruce Banner tried to replicate it. The experiment went wrong and Banner became overexposed to gamma radiaion, resulting in the Hulk. [](/sp) As for Tony, he didn't realize what sort of legacy he was following until he was attacked himself with his own weapons from Stark Industries. This attack propelled Tony down a new path where he wanted to amend his demons and fix all these problems *by himself.* These were his weapons causing mayhem in death in the world, so it was up to him as Iron Man to fix them. Along the way, he finds his father left a bigger project for him to finish, and Tony was able to synthesize a new element as a source of incredible power. Time and time again, Tony tries to improve upon himself and his father for the better of humanity, but it doesn't always work. With the plans of the Arc Reactor being split with a Russian engineer, Tony realized that working alone was killig him slowly (along wih shrapenal in his heart) and allowed James Rhodes to work with him. By the end of Iron Man 3, Tony finally realizes that he's been hiding behind the Iron Man suits and instead of improving his creations, he should be improving himself. [](/sp) Trying to be better than his father, Tony takes Peter Parker under his wing and tries to impart wisdom on the teen that he had missed with his own father. He wants Peter to be better than even he is currently. As someone whose super power is an iron suit, it takes a toll on his physical (and mental) health and he cannot keep up with the other heroes. [](/sp) With the events of Civil War, Tony feels that everyone should be accountable for their actions. He knew his weapons caused damage in Socovia, even before Ultron attacked (also Ultron was his fault). He is willing to take the blame. However this doesn't go well with everyone on the team and a rift develops between the Avengers, especially when Tony finds out that it was Bucky Barnes who had killed his parents. [](/sp) And less we forget, Howard was also a founding member of SHIELD. Nick Fury wanted to uphold the idea that those with the power to protect the defenseless would rise up to the challenge and do their part. ____ We've been on this journey in the MCU for nearly a decade now, and it was Iron Man that started it all. While everyone can point to that film and say "that's where it started," the intertwining and connected plots through all these movies really help to bring the whole series to life instead of just a string of sequels.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Spoilers] The Book of Life and Coco</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-07 06:12:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>When I first saw the trailers for Pixar's *Coco* I was skeptical. A young Mexican boy travels to the Land of the Dead on some spiritual journey? Then I had heard that the characters family hated music and mariachis. To me, it sounded like it was Pixar trying to copy *The Book of Life*. Since then, however, I have seen *Coco* and while there are some similarities, they are very different movies. ____ ###The Book of Life La Muerte and Xibalba are bored during a Day of the Dead festival and place a bet on two boys. La Muerte chooses Manolo to marry Maria while Xibalba chooses Manolo's friend Joaquin. Xibalba cheats and gives Joaquin the Medal of Everlasting Life to protect him from any sort of danger. Growing up an orphan, Joaquin lost his father who fought Chacal, the Bandit King. His father was seen as a hero to the town and aspired to be just like him. On the other side, Manolo loved to play music and wanted desperately to be a musician. His father had other plans. "Music is not work fit for a Sanchez!" and pushed Manolo to be a bull fighter. Manolo hated the idea of having to kill the bull and is never able to do so. [](/sp) During a bull fight, Manolo protests to killing the bull, much to the dismay of everyone watching, except Maria who thought it was very brave of him. Seeing as Manolo was winning over Maria, Xibalba kills him so she'd be forced to Marry Joaquin and win his bet. Seeking help from La Muerte in the Land of the Remembered, Manolo finds his family and ancestors who lead him to La Muerte. However, it turns out she has lost her kingdom to Xibalba from the bet and must journey to the Land of the Forgotten; this is where people go to fade away when nobody left alive remembers them. Here he finally confronts La Muerte and tells her his plight. Manolo is given one chance to come back to life after Xibalba's cheating surfaced; Manolo had to defeat every bull his family had ever killed over the ages and through the generations. Instead of using brute strength, Manolo opens his heart and sings to the bulls instead, soothing their souls and letting them be put to rest. [](/sp) Manolo is sent back to the land of the living and helps Joaquin and Maria fight off Chacal and his bandits who are searching for the Medal of Everlasting Life. When Chacal is bested, he threatens to blow up the whole town. Finally understanding what it means to be a hero, Joaquin secretly places the medal on Manolo's back to make sure he survives and potentially sacrifice himself. At the last moment, however, Manolo pushes Joaquin out of the way and covers Chacal and himself in a giant bell, engulfing the explosion. Manolo survives with help from the medal and gets to marry Maria while Xibalba and La Muerte decide to ignore the original bet. ____ ### Coco Miguel feels a calling to music, but his family abhors it. Coco's father had abandoned their family to pursue a musical career and never returned home. Instead of sulking, Coco's mother Imelda opened a shoe making business and taught her daughter, and then through the generations. Miguel didn't want to work with shoes, he felt such a calling to music and he adored the town's local hero, Ernesto de la Cruz. He was the greatest musician in the world. Many of his songs spoke to him on a spiritual level. [](/sp) After breaking the frame of an old photo of his great-great grandmother and great grandmother, Miguel notices the body of a man holding a special guitar; the same guitar held in the tomb for Ernesto. Wanting to prove himself, Miguel sneaks away in the evening of the Day of the Dead to take the guitar and play in the plaza to show he is a true musician. However strumming the guitar leads him to the spirit world where he can see and interact with those being remembered during the Day of the Dead. [](/sp) Miguel soon meets up with his family who will only offer their blessing for him to go back if he stops pursuing music. Miguel breaks the promise and flees from his family and stumbles into Hector, a lonely soul who only wants to visit his girl but nobody has put up his picture. The two agree to work together; if Miguel can reach Ernesto, he can offer Miguel his blessing to go back and be able to put Hector's photo en su ofrenda for the night so he can return. [](/sp) As the two make their way through the land, they bond as close friends and Hector even convinces Miguel to play in a contest to try and win an audience with de la Cruz. While he performed very well, his family was close on his heels and fled before a victor was announced. Finding out he had other family to help, Hector feels betrayed and leaves Miguel to make his own way to de la Cruz's home. [](/sp) Miguel reache's the palace and finally gets to meet his hero. After taking with de la Cruz, Miguel realizes that he is not the super star he had thought. De la Cruz had a partner that he poisoned and stole music from to reach his fame. As it turns out, that poor soul was Hector, the same person who was originally helping Miguel, his real great-great grandfather. De la Cruz had taken Hector's photo from Miguel, and Hector's time is running out as Coco is the only person alive who still remembers him and she is slowly forgetting. [](/sp) After talking with his family and explaining the situation, they attack de la Cruz and retrieve the photo while ousting de la Cruz for the horrible person he was. Just as his original death, he was crushed by a giant bell as Miguel's family gave him their blessing to return home. [](/sp) Back in the real world, Miguel plays a song written by Hector for his daughter Coco, Remember Me. She sings along and finds the old torn portion of the original photo to piece back together, allowing Hector to keep being remembered and visit the next year with the rest of the family. ____ #How Are They Similar? It's obvious some similarities will pop up. Here is what I've noticed: 1. Mexico and the Day of the Dead. That's the big plot point and time crunch, that most of the movie takes place during a very short celebration that allows for people to remember their ancestors. 2. A young man who strives to play music. Both Manolo and Miguel love music but their families are against it. Manolo's father wants him to follow in the family's tradition of bullfighting while Miguel's family wants him to follow in the family business of shoe making. 3. The bell. This is an odd one, but it was something I noticed. Chacal was killed by his own explosion inside a giant bell while Ernesto de la Cruz was crushed by a giant bell, twice. 4. The twins. In *The Book of Life* Manolo has two cousins who died fighting in "The War," while in *Coco* Miguel has two great-uncles who are also twins. Maybe I'm grasping at straws with this one, but it's something I noticed. 5. Mom calls the shots. Manolo travels through most of the film with his dead mother and grandfather. His mother is the one who calls the shots, even right out slapping Xibalba. When Miguel was asking for a family blessing, only his great-great grandmother, Mama Imelda, would offer it to him on her conditions. She was the one leading the search for him through the film too and played the biggest role out of deceased family members (barring Hector). 6. The message. Both films teach us that family is very important, and they help shape us as we grow. Manolo wanted to break way from tradition and carve his own path the same way Miguel did. Neither one wanted to be forced into their family's business but instead used music to help themselves stand out as someone different. ____ #How are they Different? 1. Where they got help. While Manolo traveled with his mother and grandfather, most (if not all) of the trials he faced were for him, and him alone. He made it through the labyrinth, he was judged by the guardian, he fought the bulls. He proved to his family that he was capable. Miguel, on the other hand, needed a lot of help. Dante, his spirit guide, tried pushing him in the right direction, but otherwise Hector helped him through a lot, at least giving him inspiration to perform, and getting to Ernesto's palace. 2. The main villain. *The Book of Life* is a little more simple in this regard by giving us Chacal, who attacked the town and seeks to reclaim his medal. For *Coco* there really isn't a villain until act 3 when we find out the truth of de la Cruz. 3. Telling the story. The story of Manolo is told with wooden figures by a museum guide as a fable of many ages ago. We find out at the end that the museum guide and security guard are actually La Muerte and Xibalba in disguise. As for *Coco*, it is simply as an adventure that we happen to observe. 4. The music. Okay, yes, *The Book of Life* had some awkward modern musical numbers thrown in like Creep, and I Will Wait For You while *Coco* was able to come up with original scores to help add more life to the film. 5. The journey. Manolo's time in the Land of the Remembered was more of a fantasy adventure going through traps, mazes and distant lands. Miguel's travels were a bit more tame, but he got to meet a lot more people along the way (Frida Kahlo!). ____ #What does it mean? While I may be biased because I loved *The Book of Life*, *Coco* was a whole other thing by itself. Each film elicits different feelings. I cried during the last 30 minutes of *Coco* (might have been longer) and I really felt along with the characters. *Coco* is much more of a spiritual journey than *The Book of Life*. Manolo's adventure was more of well, an adventure. It had some touching moments too, but its impact wasn't as strong as *Coco*'s. If you have the chance to see either film, I highly recommend them. These are just my thoughts and opinions, so don't take them as fact, but I'd like to know what other people think as well. Thanks for the read!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Movies Anywhere is amazing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2017-12-07 20:25:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>So sometime in October, I found out about [Movies Anywhere](https://moviesanywhere.com). It's a site and app that lets you combine all your movie collections from across different services together into one place. I like to buy the DVD+Blu-Ray+Digital combos so I can have a good digital copy to watch on the computer at will. But here's the real cool thing: It brings in your movies purchased/redeemed from one service into the rest! All my movies have been redeemed on iTunes unless they weren't available. Case in point, *Spider-Man Homecoming.* The code was only for Sony Vudu. So I had gone ahead and made an account to get my digital movie. After linking all my accounts through Movies Anywhere, I can now watch my iTunes movies on Vudu, Vudu movies on iTunes, everything on Movies Anywhere, and even stream them from YouTube! [](/sp) This is my [iTunes](https://imgur.com/a/0M1jX) library. This is my [Sony Vudu](https://imgur.com/a/mxgiB) library. This is my [Movies Anywhere](https://imgur.com/a/15Wrw) library. This is my [Google Play](https://imgur.com/a/PfQ9S) library. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/zs9JB) are a few movies I can watch on YouTube. Though I did notice that Power Rangers is not showing up on anything except iTunes, I'll have to ask them why that is. Either way, if you have movies on a digital format and want easier access to them, I highly recommend signing up with them. It's free!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think a lot of people forget the fact that The Men in Black, while short lived, is a Marvel comic book property. We know that the symbiote is an alien life form and the MIB monitor all alien life that comes in and out of Earth's atmosphere. I think there could be potential there for them to cross these two together. Maybe I'm being crazy in trying to intertwine Marvel super heroes with another Marvel property, but what do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Thanks GameStop!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-11 17:31:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>So Tuesday I went to a GameStop to ask about a PlayStation Vita. I was interested in getting one because I've really gotten into the Persona games and don't want to be tied to the TV. Sometimes I have enough down time to do a quick couple days if there isn't any dungeon crawling involved. [](/sp) So I talk with the manager about an Arctic White model. While that store didn't have one, the manager passes by another store on his way home that *does* have one. He takes down my info and picks it up for me so I can buy it the next day. I come back Wednesday to grab it and everything seems fine, though the system is a bit dirty, there wasn't anything else wrong with it. That was until I turned on the system and noticed some damaged pixels in the center. Turns out there was a nice scratch in the screen. I decided to bring it back to my local GameStop closer to home and exchange it there. [](/sp) I had the receipt and everything so they swapped it out for another Vita. I tried to power it on and check the screen, but this one was dead, so I couldn't check it there. I don't live too far away, so I decide to plug it in as soon as I get home. Only I couldn't; the special Vita charge cable was missing. [](/sp) I leave for work early to stop back in and tell them what happened and they give me a 3-in-1 charge cable (for Vita, PSP, and GO) and apologize for the inconvenience. I get to work early and finally sit down with the system in the break room. After the initial set-up something was weird. It was [showing Uncharted: Golden Abyss](https://imgur.com/a/8rYQx) on the apps screen. I didn't buy any games with it, and it had obviously had its storage formatted since it was traded in. Well, I check the game card slot and sure enough [it was traded in with the game still inside](https://imgur.com/a/gMZCX). [](/sp) Not only that, when I went to place in the 8gb card I got for it, [there was a 4gb card](https://imgur.com/a/wCPF8) left inside as well! So thank you for saving me $30 GameStop!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm pretty sure it's been less than an hour, but I'm loving it so far! I know talking to the demons is a SMT staple, but it's omitted from the later games. I find it a lot of fun interacting with the demons. This one wanted a life stone, but after I annoyed him enough and demanded an item from him, he gave me a life stone! I also made a group of Pixies too happy and wouldn't listen any more. A few demons simply gave specific party members EXP. Oh, and stat allotment is great to really build your own character. ____ The only other Persona I've played sp far is 4. To me, the combat of 4 was pretty standard, nothing special (other than extras for having higher social ranks). It's interesting being restricted based on your formation and having to work around it.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-01-22 04:41:38</DATE>
    <TEXT>So after finishing Persona 4, I decided to go back and try from the beginning, starting with the first Persona remade for PSP (playing on Vita). [](/sp) Being able to talk to the demons really adds a lot of depth to the game. I've been able to nab a few spell cards already, but I still can't do anything with them. I just rescued [spoiler] (#s "Mark and Brown from the Police Station") so I'm not very far. I also like how it's more of a tactical game, with party member placement being important. Other than everyone getting a gun, it's also kind of bonkers how many party members you can have at once! I think I have six at the moment. Finally, being able to allot points into your character's stats on level up makes me very happy. One of my favorite parts of Diablo II was being able to build my character specifically like I wanted. I also enjoy getting my HP and SP restored on level up. ____ I know I'm still very early on in the game, but I'm really enjoying it so far. Getting demons pissed off and making them flee sucks 'cause you get no EXP from it, but it does mean you can cut short a lot of battles. I am having trouble trying to discover which moves are best against which demons. The analysis feature doesn't seem to track what I do.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Why I believe the Soul Stone is in Wakanda</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-03-21 20:04:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>More accurately, why the Soul Stone is *underneath* Wakanda. [](/sp) We know from Black Panther that a meteorite of vibranium hit the Earth and imbued its properties into the land. The trees, grasses and everything that grows had vibranium elements mixed in with it. That tells us some things: 1. Vibranium is not naturally occurring element on Earth 2. It came from somewhere. ____ As we saw with the Red Skull's technology, he was able to harness the properties of the Space Stone into weapons. Loki's scepter was able to use the properties of the Mind Stone to brainwash people. From Black Panther, we see T'Challa consume the heart shaped herb which lets him commune with his father and his ancestors. The Souls of his family live on and he's only able to see them for a moment after consuming this herb. [](/sp) My idea is that the vibranium meteorite was a casing for the Soul Stone, launched eons ago into space, out of reach of anyone who would seek to find it. It happened to crash into the Earth and mesh into a local ecosystem. With the vibranium acting as a conduit to spread its influence, the Soul Stone was able to produce the heart shaped herb that the Black Panther uses for his powers. Each stone is said to hold immeasurable strength and that no mere mortal can handle it in its raw form. This is why the Black Panther gets heightened abilities such as strength, speed and reflexes. [](/sp) To go along with that, Thanos' armies attacking Wakanda are shown prominently in the trailers. So either they're tying to fake us out or they're hinting at something.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>During the Bismuth special, she had said something that confused people.  gt;"Just another quartz soldier, made right here in the dirt." When I had brought up that up some people disagreed. Another point to bring to that is the fact that there are two featured Kindergartens on: Prime and Beta. We know that Jasper is from the Beta and Amethyst is from the Prime. *But where did Rose Quartz come from?* ____ In **Your Mother and Mine**, Garnet confirms that she was in fact made on Earth, and we had already seen a whole room where Yellow and Blue keep the other Rose Quartz gems bubbled up. Peridot probably couldn't find info on the third Kindergarten because the Diamonds saw the Quartzes as defective and terminated its coorinates and destroyed the warp pad, meaning nobody knows where to find the Alpha Kindergarten, where Rose Quartz was created. ____ That's just my thoughts from about halfway through this episode so far though.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Meaning of a dream: Could not Speak</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-04-29 05:30:42</DATE>
    <TEXT>Last night, I had a very stressful nightmare. I was in my old home (childhood home, I just moved a month ago) and I was having trouble speaking. I get to my old bedroom and look around, but it's barren. Suddenly my mom appears in the doorway. She startles me and I ask her to knock next time; only I can't. No words can come out. I panic and knock a knuckle against my open palm, to show her. I look toward my window but the blinds are closed. I look one more time behind me again and the door was closed and my mother was gone. This scared me because there was no sign of her leaving or closing the door. I was only looking away for maybe three seconds. I attempted to scream, but again, nothing happened. Even now, typing this out again, it gives me chills and goosebumps. ____ Apparently this is a sign of sleep paralysis, but I know I wasn't awake for it. From how I understand it, is that the mind is conscious while the body is asleep. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So last year, I posted [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/5od7ji/theoryearly_release_sadies_song_is_a_prelude_to) about Sadie's Song and how it was a prelude to PD on Earth. Now one more line makes even MORE sense.  gt;Haven't you noticed that I'm a star? With the revelations of the newest episodes, it makes more sense that this pop song was foreshadowing Pink Diamond. The Crystal Gems are famous for the stars on their uniforms. Pink Diamond started this. I'd type out more, but I'm not at home, so I can't dissect Sadie's song further, but everything is falling into place.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So Steven uses the Glass of Time and creates a band. He goes back enough times to gather three other Stevens, creating a four person band. However, when Steven starts to assign roles to everyone and force them into a specific attitude, the other Stevens revolt.  gt;You can't kick me out of the band. I'm the original Steven! I created you! Steven and the Stevens was my idea; without me, you'd all be nothing!! ____ I know everyone's grasping at straws for foreshadowing now, but here's my idea on it. White Diamond was the Original Diamond. She created Blue, Yellow and Pink in her image. While Blue and Yellow went along with the motion, we all saw what happened with Pink. Then there's the roles Steven assigned: Smart, Funny, Sensitive and Handsome. Yellow is Smart Blue is Sensitive Steven is Funny That must mean White is Handsome. Edit: I almost forgot! Steven's last line of the episode:  gt;I learned to stay true to myself, by watching myself die. [](#s "Just like when Pearl poof'd PD.")</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Theory] All Pearls as they should be... Maybe</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-25 18:29:29</DATE>
    <TEXT>So right now there's a lot of speculation between Pink Pearl and White Pearl and who belongs to whom. [One idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjTBmDhhNZI amp;t=478s) is that our current Pearl for the Crystal Gems is actually White's original Pearl, and White's current used to be Pink Diamond's. This is mostly due to the gem placements matching between Diamonds and their Pearls. [As seen in these images](https://imgur.com/a/8kCU0La), Blue Diamond and Blue Pearl have chest gems, which also matches Yellow Pearl and Diamond. However White Diamond is odd in that her gem is on her belly, but Pink Diamond's Pearl was on her head. But something else that ties Pearls to their Diamonds is their hair. I've highlighted a few key points on Pearl's hair that match Pink Diamonds, as Yellow and Blue are more obvious. But this then makes things confusing because White Pearl has the Space Buns. You could argue it's curly hair that matches Rose and Steven's curls, but that didn't come into play until PD became RQ. Further from here, all the Pearls as they have been presented have hair color to match their Diamond. The image I posted above is also the oldest version of Pearl we've seen. Her uniform is very... Colorful. It has blue shoulders, yellow chest piece, a pink skirt white a white trim, a very big difference from the other, more mono colored Pearls. ____ It could very well be that the Pearls were swapped, everything is up in the air right now. But I'm willing to argue that the Pearls weren't swapped too. What do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-08-14 18:32:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>So back in July, I made a prediction that the episode *Steven and the Stevens* would give us a snippit of White Diamond before we got to officially see her. Steven 2 was the Smart One (Yellow) Steven 3 is the Funny One (Pink) Steven 4 is the Sensitive One (Blue) Leaving Original Steven as *The Handsome One!* (White) [](/sp) Jokes aside, these traits align with the Diamonds pretty well. But there's one thing that sticks out to me. Steven tells the group to "Take 5," after a small argument. They all exclaim in unison:  gt;***"There's a fifth Steven!?"*** Now I want to direct you to [this image.](https://imgur.com/a/NXYWb2q) The normal Diamond Authority is the four gems as shown on the far left. But if we add in a Fifth Diamond, it becomes a Star Pattern. So either there really **IS** a hidden fifth Diamond being kept from us, or Rose Quartz is the unofficial fifth member of the Diamond Authority.

I've had a character get knocked out once or twice so far, but no game overs. For some reason, I had this idea that the game would be hard with a lot of grinding and backtracking. So far that's not the case at all. It's been fairly straightforward and I haven't gotten lost or confused on what to do. [](/sp) I do really enjoy the writing and dialog though. The comedy is really good in this game, I can see why it was so popular. I don't like how little EXP I'll get at times. Beating a boss will only get me 15 experience, are you kidding me? I've played all the Mario  amp; Luigi RPG's before this one and I can see where those games got their humor and gameplay from. After this is onto Paper Mario!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I remember when I first caught a Wobbuffet, I was excited to try and use it as a defender. It was awful. It came back to me relatively quickly and then I looked at it's HP. 92. The so called "punching bag" Pokemon best known for it's ability to return damage to the attackers only had 92 HP at around 890 CP. ____ Well since this last update, at 904 CP, it has 300 HP (holy wow!). Has anyone else tried using it as a defender yet? Is it worth trying?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I just found out about this company called Dirt Cheap Dungeons. They've just launched [a kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dirtcheapdungeons/dirt-cheap-dungeons-portable-rpg-gaming-accessorie?ref=602797 amp;token=e8a45d53) to create modular dungeons that allow you to build up a 3D map! The campaign just launched today and as I'm writing this, they already have 1.7k of the 30k required. I know I'll totally be backing this project. There are another 34 days to go!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>As someone who played Diablo 2 for 15+ years, I am loving Diablo 3.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-11-05 17:41:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>When Diablo 3 first came out six years ago, I had heard nothing but bad things about it. "It's nothing like Diablo 2!" people would say. "They changed too much! I don't like it." was the common complaint. The Real Life Auction House also caused a lot of issues since people were trying to get rich quick. My brother had gotten the game and he said it would be best to avoid it. ____ Fast forward to this past Friday and Diablo 3 for the Switch is released. I had been following along with changes for the game and how it had been improved since launch. Being able to play on the go is a big plus, as well as couch co-op. I've been playing since Friday and I'm about to hit level 30 as a Monk. Here are my impressions compared to Diablo 2. ##The Good * Everything is streamlined. In Diablo 1 and 2, you had a simple grid-based inventory system; think Resident Evil. You could only carry what you could Tetris onto your person. This time, you still have a limited amount of space, but it's 60 items. Picking up a two handed ax to sell for later doesn't take up any more room than a chipped gem. * No more consumables. Scrolls of Identify and Scrolls of Town Portal. These were so annoying to keep track of. Even in Diablo 2, Scroll of Identify were useless since Dekard Cain would identify all your items in town. These items were common enough to keep yourself replenished, but also necessary enough that you had to devote permanent inventory space to keep them. * To go along with consumables, no more Health or Mana Potions. Trying to find a strong enough belt with enough potion slots was awful. You really had to compromise what you wanted in your build. Not only that, but trying to find potions worth stocking. Finding a bunch of Minor potions aren't going to help you when you need Greater ones. The heal times are also greatly improved when you do use it, as opposed to running around waiting for it. So long Full Rejuvenations! * Gems are whole. In Diablo 2, there was a special item called The Horodric Cube. You could use it to craft special items (or emergency storage space). You take three chipped gems of the same kind together to make a flawed one. Flawed into normal, normal into flawless and flawless into perfect. It took a long time. Skulls were also cool to find and they had great socketed potential, but they could be very rare and followed the same process as gems. * Skill Swapping is easy. Instead of using up points to pick a single skill/improve it, they become unlocked that you can swap around at any point. * EXP Multipliers are a lot of fun. Chaining together kills for Bonus EXP is a great reward for being faster and stronger. The Double Damage Orbs are really useful too. ##The Bad * I can't build my character to the same depth as Diablo 2. In D2, you gained skill points on level up. Depending on the equipment you wanted to use, you would allot these points appropriately. Some armor required more Dexterity, while certain weapons needed more Strength. I have noticed there are Paragon Points, but I'm guessing that's very late/end game stuff. Along with that, Skills are simply unlocked instead of picked. Being a Sorceress in D2 meant you were picking some points in Warmth to restore mana more quickly, and then specializing in an element that wasn't Fire (ICE SORC 4 LIFE). D3 gives each character of the same class the same unlocks. * I'm already level 29 and I've died once, maybe twice, on Hard Mode. The game seems a bit easy, but then again, maybe Expert is the real "Normal Mode," and "Normal" is the new Easy. * The Magic/Rare/Legendary drops are very... Common. At level 29, I've already encountered six Legendary drops (two were Odyn Son, and two were Pinto's Pride) along with the others. The two Pinto's Prides were obtained within 10 minutes of each other on my way to The Butcher and defeating him. Also within those 10 minutes I leveled up twice. * Weapons affect spells and abilities. This is just something that doesn't make sense to me. Why does the weapon I'm holding affect the power of my abilities? It's like Goku holding the Extendo Staff and it makes his Kamehameha Wave 20% stronger. I'm a Monk holding a two handed sword, how am I punching with both fists? ____ All in all, I'm having a blast with the game. It's fun slaughtering waves of monsters and demons and unlocking new abilities. The game looks nice and runs great. I also love that I can run around with Mercy's Wings! I do not like the fact that Ganondorf's cosmetics cost 50,000 each; I guess it's more of an end game thing when you're less likely to change gear. If you're on the fence about Diablo 3, I say go for it. It's a lot of fun even solo.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I'm playing on Nintendo Switch and I just found a legendary fist weapon (Scarbringer). When equipped, my damage is 13.5k by itself. If I use a shield with it, it climbs to 14.9k. ***HOWEVER***, if I use another fist or one handed weapon with it, my damage *DROPS* for some reason. Beyond that, when I use a *SHIELD* with it, my damage *INCREASES*. I do not understand this. ____ Edit: I just equipped a different fist weapon (which showed a large drop in attack if equipped) but the value still increased.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-11-12 03:08:46</DATE>
    <TEXT>So my players finally got to their last mission for chapter one of **Hoard of the Dragon Queen** tonight. I read to them the description:  gt;*From the darkness, a creature strides into the dim light of the dying fires around the keep. Although it is shaped roughly like a human, it is at least seven feet tall, its skin is covered in blue scales, its fingers bear wicked claws, and its face has the muzzle and reptilian eyes of a dragon. The creature stops about eighty yards from the main gate of the keep and scans the walls. A line of kobolds fan out behind it. With their spears, they prod four human prisoners into the dim light. You can make out a woman, a teenage boy in a blood-soaked tunic, and two children.*  gt; ***"Defenders of Greenest! This has been a successful night, and I am feeling generous. Do you see these four pitiful, useless prisoners? We have no need for the, so I will trade them back to you. Send out your best warrior to fight me, and you can have these four in exchange!"*** ____ I read the quotation in a powerful, deep, and gruff voice. That is when I revealed to them what their foe [truly looked like.](https://imgur.com/a/rIAYu7s) [](/sp) We had to pause for a couple minutes to let the laughter die down.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys! I know this sub doesn't get a lot of traffic. There's the odd post here and there, but not much is ever going on. I've come up with an idea for us all to do together! ____ #Tamagotchi Survive What is this? Starting Saturday, January 5th, everyone that wants to participate will start a new Tamagotchi egg at the same time; 9am PT/11am CT/12pm ET (or wherever else you may be located that lines up with this). [](/sp) Take a picture of the device you're using with the egg on it, and document as it grows! Pictures each time it evolves is a fun idea. Daily photos too to show how long it's lived for. The general idea is to see who among us can get their Tama to live the longest. I realize that this varies based on the device. The Mini, for example, has a maximum life of 14 days. Also, some of us have devices that can live a lot longer than others. [](/sp) I wouldn't want anyone to spend money they don't have to, but I think using a Gen 1 or 2 device would be best. I'm still pretty ignorant to all the available devices, so if someone else has a better idea, I'm all ears. [](/sp) # Is there a prize? No. At least not as of yet. I don't have anything set up for a prize, but I'm opened to ideas. It's more of a community thing to have us all be raising Tama's from the same start time together and showing off our progress with each other. I know a lot of this sub is already like that, but I think it'd be fun if we all started at the same time with similar devices. ____ What do you guys think? Is this something you'd want to try? I'm open to comments and other suggestions.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2018-12-18 21:41:57</DATE>
    <TEXT>#Tamagotchathon! ###What is it? As a community event, we will each be raising a **Re-released** Gen 1 or Gen 2 all starting at the same time! /u/birdwithleaf is setting up a small thing to collect money so the winner can receive a prize. The ultimate goal is to see whose Tamagotchi can live the longest, but while having fun along the way! [](/sp) Each day, I will be posting a new thread. The thread is for posting how your Tama had done the previous day. The first post will be made Saturday, January 5th. This will be for posting pictures of your Tama device, its name and other information from the "Points" section below. This will be Day 0. Day 1 will be January 6th; in that thread you will write down progress notes on what you did with your Tama on Day 0. [](/sp) ###Start Time We will begin this event Saturday, January 5th, 2019. I want us all to begin as close to the same time as possible. ***9am PT/11am CT/12pm ET***. If you do not live in one of these time zones, then adjust accordingly. [](/sp) ###Points There are points! Earn points for a high score! Even if your Tama doesn #8217;t live the longest, you might have a shot at winning!  #8226; Picture of your device: +5 points  #8226; Picture of the egg on your device: +3 points  #8226; Naming your Tama: +5 points (Original names please, not simply what the Tama is supposed to be; So, nobody named Mametchi)  #8226; Create a backstory: +10 points (attitude, hobbies, favorite foods, how you found the egg, etc. Be creative!)  #8226; Daily check ins: +0-8 points. These are done each time the Tama goes to sleep. Check on its status to see the Hunger and Happiness. You get +1 point for each heart filled (up to +8 with both meters full). Day 0 will have an extra one when the baby takes a nap.  #8226; Age: These values will vary based on a range. * 0-5 years: -5 points (if it dies before day 6, you lose 5 points) * 6-10: +3 points/day * 11-16: +6 points/day * 17-21: +10 points/day * 22+: +20 points for reaching age 22, then begin to add another +10 points per day after  #8226; Poopy beds: -8 points. If your Tama goes to sleep before you clean up its poop, it #8217;ll cost you. You can reduce the points to only -4 if you post a picture of it.  #8226; Extra poop: -16+. If the poop starts to pile up, you get -8 for each poop you #8217;ve returned to. You can reduce the points you lose by half if you post a picture of it. [](/sp) ###Other Rules Pausing your Tama is allowed. Many of us live busy, hectic lives and it can be difficult to constantly watch a digital pet. This is also why I'm starting early on a Saturday to hatch the egg; hopefully you have a good hour of free time to make sure it won't die. Just be sure to adjust the clock to the correct time when unpausing your Tama. Please, no cheating. It is very easy to cheat by not reporting poopies or having your Tama die early. We're doing this to have fun and do something together as a community. Don't be a butt, stay honest. ____ [Here is a link to the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0-eCJJCX9OmANw_jvCwzKbkZnYbGm_s546PZ4pu9FA/edit?usp=sharing) page. It is an excel spread sheet. I'm still working on getting stuff in order, but there's a good start. Right now, feel free to simply write down your names in an unoccupied column. Please do not play around with anyone else's. Edit: I need to mention this, because so many people are doing it, do not write ***0*** into your score space. I've written a basic formula that will add up all the points you earn in your column that will automatically adjust your score for you. All you need to do is type in the values in the other spots.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here it is, the day you've been waiting for! Day 0! So today to earn points you can: * Post a picture of your device (+5 points) * If you have the egg itself on the device, then it's another +3 points * Name of your Tama (+5 points) * Backstory (+10 points) * Check-Ins (0-8 points) [](/sp) Since the baby will nap and evolve within the day, there are two check-ins. Again, these occur whenever your Tama is asleep and will earn you points for each filled heart (from 0-8 points). For the age, before day 6, mark it as 0 unless it dies in which you get -5 points. [](/sp) If your Tama falls asleep before poop is cleaned up, that is -8 points. If you post a picture of it, then it's only -4. All posts for Saturday, January 5th will be contained in this thread. You can string along on your own comment chain or simply create a new post in here. ____ For the full list of points, check the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tamagotchi/comments/a7flcl/community_event_tamagotchathon/?st=jqhqpdtq amp;sh=eeb43773).

    <DATE>2019-01-21 07:45:36</DATE>
    <TEXT>So it was only recently that I learned that Digimon were just a more... Boy tailored version of Tamagotchi. I had a yellow one when I was little (I was 6 in 1997) and it was fun. Now that I *know* what I'm doing, and that there are different versions with different monsters, I've ordered a few. http://japanyouwant.com just got a bunch of new items in stock (a lot of it is pre-owned product) so I ordered a Pendulum. As much as I love me some giant dinosaurs, Kabutarimon and his Mega were always my favorites. I never realized how much I was missing out on these other devices! I don't think they hit the stats? I also got an Xros Wars Graymon and an OG red one coming in, plus the special Digimon X in March. ____ I'm also glad I have a few to have them fight each other and try to get some Ultimate forms!</TEXT>

Anyway, I'm re-watching Season 1 right now and looking up Digimon as they appear. According to the Wiki [Gazimon](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Gazimon) has no previous forms. Does he simply hatch as such? What about other Digimon they encounter? Were they just... Always like that? I know in the movie, Parrotmon immediately hatches out of the egg, is that how it is for the others? In the episode I'm on, Tokomon was kidnapped by the [Pagumon](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Pagumon) for Digivolving.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Despite the crying Mario, Yoshi's Island was one of my favorite games. It was fun and colorful and very creative in the puzzles and bosses. I've only played one level of the demo for Crafted World and I already want to buy it. It just *oozes* with charm. There are Shy Guys in the field just holding paper butterflies on sticks like they're part of the scenery. And you can just smack them with an egg for coins! [](/sp) There are still the flowers to collect and hidden red coins, as well as extra hearts. Each level tallies up your totals and you collect the flowers (don't know what they're used for yet). Oh, and you can also hunt for little Poochies that run back into the level you just completed. There's also side missions to replay where someone wants a souvenir. The robot wanted some cows, so I had to go knock over five cows, but scanning the background really got me to appreciate how well put together the world is! This is a definite buy for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I got HW back on the Wii U and I loved it. I played through the story mode on Normal and I had a lot of fun. I never really got around to the Adventure Map though. I even got the game on 3DS, which admittedly was more difficult than I remember it being. I think I'm still on a Linkle mission where I'm saving the Twilight Realm from the dragon I gotta use the clawshot on. [](/sp) Anyway, would the Switch version be a good investment or should I go back and keep going at the 3DS version?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[Theory][Spoiler] Realm of Magic</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-05-08 10:29:39</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm new to this sub and on mobile, so forgive me if I labeled the title wrong. ____ So let's take a look at some other media first, shall we? Legend of Korra, Dragon Ball, Kingdom Hearts, and Star Wars. Good/Evil or Light/Dark, however you want to look at it, one cannot exist without the other. Two sides of the same coin. A balance has to be established. Korra had Vatu and Rava. Dragon Ball had Kami and Piccolo. Kingdom Hearts used the Darkness and Light. Star Wars uses the Force. Each of these is in an eternal conflict. For what is the measurement of good without bad? How can we say something is bad if we have no comparison? You cannot have a shadow without light. [](/sp) Glossaryck said to Star "Maybe you weren't supposed to be there then either." (Something like that.) When asking about her visit to the magic realm. I propose that the realm of magic is not meant to be physically traveled to. It is the wellspring of magic that connects all the worlds together. It's also the reason we got giant invisible goats and Joy Suckers on Earth. It only began to become "contaminated" once Ludo began using his wand with ill intentions. The realm was sealed off similarly to how Won separated the spirit and human worlds, because humans wrought too much war and fighting by themselves to live peacefully with other creatures. Star thought it was purified, but using Eclipsa's All Seeing Eye brought back the dark stuff. With Star using her magic less, and Eclipsa using it more, I believe that this has brought about more of the dark magic. Seeing as The First Born wasn't immediately tainted by the opposing unicorn, I think that's the eternal fight against light and dark. ____ Well, what do you guys think?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-05-11 11:45:00</DATE>
    <TEXT>So the way Bruce explains the time travel is that it is not a single continuity like *Back to the Future* or other time travel films. Going back in time is basically going to alternate realities before certain events. Basically like Dragon Ball Z's time travel with Future Trunks; defeating the Androids in the past didn't stop the future that Trunks had come from, his timeline was a different reality. They've created an alternate reality where Tony's "heart attack" caused him to drop the Tesseract and Loki escaped. [](/sp) So then how about Steve Rogers? We know he delivered all the stones and Mjolnir back to where they when/where they were taken, but how exactly did he "live his life" and end up in the same reality he left? Is it possible he lived his life and still used the suit to come back, remove the suit and have his shield packaged without them noticing? Or would he only be able to come back through the portal device? Or is this simply the writers screwing themselves up by trying to make the time travel work like the way Bruce said it wouldn't?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I came up with this idea while playing last night. Instead of doing something, they can feed their 100% ult charge to another teammate. So right after Soldier 76 finishes Visor, he can start another one. Or after Ana Nano Boosts Genji, she can Nano Boost Rein too. [](/sp) Does something like that seem too overpowered, what do you guys think?</TEXT>

Right now I'm without a printer so this is the easiest thing for me to use to create new characters. Unfortunately, for some reason, there is no Vampire race in this app. I've checked a few others and it's missing from them as well. I can easily modify the Human, but it'd be nice to have it ready from the get-go. Does anyone know of an app that has the Vampire race in it?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>The 10 Commandments of Super Mario Maker</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-06-28 02:22:52</DATE>
    <TEXT>I created this original post way back when the first game hit the Wii U. With the new game dropping tomorrow, I figured I'd post this again. ____ #The 10 Commandments of Super Mario Maker If we want quality levels, we need to make quality levels. I feel there are some good steps and rules to follow when creating levels. * **Thou shalt not spam enemies.** #160;Just because you put up a wall of Goombas in front of the flag pole doesn't mean your level is hard. It's obnoxious and annoying. * **Thou shalt not spam traps.** #160;Along with #1, traps can be really annoying too. This can be from the trap spike block to hiding an enemy in a ? Block. It's okay to use them sparingly to make a player think about their actions, but there shouldn't be a trap every other block "to make it hard." * **Thou shalt not obstruct the course end.** #160;Throwing a ton of Piranha Plants and leaving only one spot to finish the level on is terrible. It hinders the player and it's annoying. The end goal should be the one place there are no obstacles. * *Amendment 1* #160;Obstacles are okay at the course goal, however try not to completely block the goal or otherwise make it impassable. * **Thou shalt not hide blocks during jumps.** #160;I'm sure a majority of us have seen #160;Super Mario Bros. Frustration #160;and it's exactly why you do not do that. Never punish the player not knowing something. Hidden blocks should be used to hide goodies or misdirect them, not make them fall to their death. * **Thine levels should be adequate in length.** #160;Don't make a level too short. Players won't feel like they've accomplished anything. Longer levels are okay but there should be a good mechanic in there so the player doesn't get bored. Keep the player engaged so when they reach the goal, it feels like an accomplishment. * **Help thine player.** #160;You want stars and a good reputation? Give your player Power-Ups! Players get anxious if they don't have a Super Mushroom. Any one thing could kill them and it means no mistakes are allowed. Sure you can sometimes get away with no Power-Ups if it's purely platforming and no enemies, but even the best players can get knocked out by a Goomba. * **Pretend you work for Nintendo.** #160;I would say 80% of the levels online right now would be rejected from Nintendo and trashed. Nintendo takes their time to make their levels good and fun, and you should too. Turn on the Mario Tracer (so you can see his run and fall patterns) and use that for platforming and obstacles. A level may not be finished in one sitting and that's okay.  gt;A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad. ~Shiggy * **Try to unlock everything first.** #160;I've only recently gotten the Warp Pipes and sub-levels. Because of that my Ghost House is easily my favorite, if also not best level. Don't limit yourself by not having all the tools. Keep playing around with the basics and learning how it all works so when you get the new goodies you'll be prepared to use them. * *Amendment 2* #160;This does not mean that you can't make a good course with less tools. It simply means you'll have more to work with in the end. * **Test your levels as you play.** #160;You might think the level may work one way, but until you play it, you won't know. I've had plenty of levels where I wanted to use a Lakitu, but it found out it was too easy to kill him and steal his cloud to reach the goal. Keep testing as you go to get the feel for the level and how it flows. * **Use the space.** #160;The level doesn't have to be only 14 blocks high. You can have ledges higher up. Vines to reach new locations or platforms to get up higher. You can start the course higher and end it lower even! It doesn't have to be the same height throughout. Give the player choices on where to go. Sometimes all paths lead to the end, sometimes one is misdirection! Also to go with #10, try to use appropriate Level Setting. If you want to throw players for a loop and get them lost, use the Ghost House. If you want a lot of traps and hazards use a Castle. This helps the player too in that they know what they might expect and can more easily anticipate what may be coming. I hope these guidelines help you in creating good levels for people to enjoy and eliminate bad design! Disclaimer: These are not the end all be all rules. These are simply guidelines to try and follow if you want to make a successful course. I offer these tips and "rules" so we as a Reddit Community can have standards in our levels and hopefully bring about better quality fan made levels. ____ This is simply copy and pasted from the original post, but with so many new makers joining, it can still help!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Maybe I'm an outlier and I'm actually just bad at Super Mario, but I find a lot of the "Normal" stages I come across are difficult and/or poorly made. I came across a level that asked me to find 135 coins. I lost four lives trying to find them before I skipped it. Piranha Pipe Land or something. Anyway, there were no clear signs as to where I might find these hidden coins. Could they have been through a pipe? Maybe, but the whole level was littered with them. I don't know what determines if a level is easy, medium or hard, but it's just a mess right now.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-08 06:02:27</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm working graveyard shift right now (7pm-7am) as a CNA. I work in a long term care facility in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. I was taking a patient to her room to get her ready for bed. She took out her right hearing aid for me, but when I checked her left ear, there was none! I immediately told the nurse and we began to search. First her clothes and chair. Then the table she was seated at. The nurse helped me out her in bed and we searched the chair and clothes more thoroughly. Well once I got her undressed, I notice how red her face and chest are. I ask my nurse if she knows what happened and she said it's sunburn. I ask when she got it because she didn't have it yesterday. The nurse explains the daughter came to visit and took her outside, not thinking the sun would be that warm. I then propose the idea that the hearing aid fell out while they were outside. I finish getting the patient ready to sleep and when I'm done the nurse shows me the missing hearing aid... More accurately what was left of it. She had found it right where the patient and her daughter had been sitting earlier that day. The nurse called the daughter to inform her what had happened. [](/sp) The daughter expected the facility to cover the damaged device. After talking with our DoN, she confirmed that we would not be covering the replacement cost of a new hearing aid. ____ You guys have any wild stories of absent minded families?</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-07-13 18:15:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>For those of you who don't know, Tamagotchi's little brother is finally coming back to the West! While Tamagotchi got the P1 and P2's re-released back in 2017, we're finally getting the Digimon 20th Anniversary Editions in English! [Releasing at GameStop July 15th](https://www.gamestop.com/collectibles/toys/digimon-digivice-assortment/173073), they come in four colors: * Yellow * Gray * Blue * Brick Here's a quick rundown for those who may be interested. #Similarities Digimon and Tamagotchi are very similar. You start with an egg that will hatch into a baby. Feed and play with it, while cleaning up its poop to make sure it grows up! Once it hits Stage 2 (In-Training), depending on how you care for it will determine Stage 3 (Rookie). Their weight will also be a factor in how they digivolve. Different forms are achieved based on the care provided. However, that's where they similarities stop. #Differences Digimon are all about fighting. Each device has two metal connectors and pegs on the top to connect with other devices. Starting at Rookie, they can begin to fight other Digimon. Their win ratio and number of battles will determine how they evolve into the later adult stages. Instead of a game to keep them happy, you have Training to keep them in shape. Instead of Meals and Snacks, you have Meals and Proteins, as Proteins can help keep their strength up. However too many proteins will pack on a lot of weight and also has a greater chance of getting them sick. Fighting too much in a single day can also exhaust them and kill them too. In these 20th Anniversary devices, you can actually raise two Digimon side by side at the same time. It has a built in battle mode so you don't need a second device, but there are secrets to be held if you do connect them together. You also get to pick and choose which egg you want to raise, meaning you have even more friends to try and unlock! ____ I think these little guys are a lot of fun and can even be more engaging than the standard Tamagotchi (I can't speak for a Meets/Mix/On though). /u/thehumulos has created [a guide](https://humulos.com/digimon/dm20/english/) to help people get the Digimon they want too. I really hope some of you will check these guys out, they're a lot of fun!</TEXT>

There's another "Un-Used" still listed at I think about $37. These came out in the 90's with the "Rebirth of Mothra" film. Oh, and I also ordered some screen protectors for my dudes. The Digital Monster ones should fit the standard Tamagotchis just fine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With Sigma manipulating gravity, what if he could catch incoming fire and send it back? Like, set up a turret that's basically a U-turn that curves incoming attacks and sends them back in the same direction? Maybe not a turret, but like a small pole or something? Or even being able to catch enemy fire and it builds ult faster, and when you use the ult it unleashes everything caught. So if you caught Pharah's Barrage or Hog's Whole Hog, then you can send it back. Think of Mr. Game amp;Watch's bucket from Smash Bros.</TEXT>

When your Tama is an adult, they will do random activities and the Call Icon will appear. This means that you can catch the activity on the camera. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/kz4ukeq) show my tama doing a special activity that even gets a unique caption. However, [generic photos](https://imgur.com/a/JoLLfbc) say stuff like "Be happy every day!" or "Memories last forever!" So keep an eye out! The Call Icon isn't always bad or needing attention.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>A Game where nothing happens?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-08-31 04:54:55</DATE>
    <TEXT>So this week I played a game of Planechase EDH. I don't remember all the commanders but it was: * Me: Ghired (Naya Tokens) * Player 2: Kadena (morph precon) * Player 3: Don't remember * Player 4: K'rrik ____ I had started out strong with a Doubling Season and Mirari's Wake, but no creatures yet. Chaos was rolled on a plane and they chose to break all my toys. But it didn't end there. It was a constant back and forth between everyone of just stopping each other from doing anything. After about two hours, the lowest life total was maybe 16 from K'rrik who also had his [[Whip of Erebos]] in play. I had no cards in hand and nothing but lands in play and had already cast my commander twice. There had been two board wipes as well. There was just nothing happening. We were going nowhere so painfully slowly. We had started the game around 7:30 and I scooped on my turn at 9:30 to play something else. At 10, I asked them who won but they didn't finish. [](/sp) How often does this happen to you guys?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I can't find one Missile Expansion in Super Metroid; Please help!</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-09 21:35:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've beaten Super Metroid countless times starting from the zSNES Emulator in 1998. I've played it on the SNES, Wii Virtual Console, Wii U Virtual Console and 3DS Virtual Console. I've always gotten close, but never achieved 100%. Now that I have the Switch, I've beaten it once again, but still only 99%. I've taken pictures of every time I obtained an item/expansion and then marked them on maps I found. It could be really obvious, or it could be very well hidden. I don't know where to look. I have 225 missiles, 50 super and 50 power bombs and every suit upgrade. [Crateria](https://i.imgur.com/bPB2ZcK.png) [Brinstar](https://i.imgur.com/GjSVCGu.png) [Wrecked Ship](https://i.imgur.com/np9Ax3l.png) [Maridia](https://i.imgur.com/0gIlqUt.png) [Norfair](https://i.imgur.com/JpV78qO.png) ____ I know this can be asking a lot, but this happened to me two years ago on the 3DS version too, with only one missile expansion I can't find. I'd really appreciate any help you guys can give in to where this expansion is. Edit: you can open the maps in a separate tab to zoom in and view them better.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Disclosure, I'm 28 and well removed from highschool. I just finished watching **Tall Girl** on Netflix and it ends with the Homecoming Dance. It got me thinking of my time at school. When I was in highschool, I never went to a single dance, but it seemed everyone around me was always in the know of the next event/function. There always seemed a pressure to go, ask a date and do these events, and I had a lot of friends go but I was never apart of any of that. I know that's more of me being an outcast, but like, where is this all learned? Like, going into Freshman year, I heard of Homecoming for the first time and when I heard it associated with football I immediately dismissed it, yet it's still some big thing. Is this taught through the grapevine or were other students just more informed than me?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So I've been working through a backlog of games. Now that I've finished Spyro 1 (100%) and God of 4's main story, I can get into Persona 5! My girlfriend was mildly interested and I proposed an idea with her: I'd focus on the combat, dungeons and micromanaging equipment and she could focus on the Social Links and character aspects. This way she can enjoy the story along with me and still be apart of it instead of just an onlooker. We've just met Morgana and escaped the castle and we're supposed to meet Ryuji on the roof as the next part. I'll also have her try some of the combat too 'cause it can be fun having your characters kick ass.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-24 09:26:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I didn't have as much trouble with the DM Ver.20th as I do with the DMX, but the fact that some of these guys stay awake until midnight is crazy. Could you imagine being an eight year old and having your virtual pet die just because you go to sleep at 8:30? And waking up at 7:00, holy cow! That's so early! Of course you can always adjust the clock as necessary to take care of them, but going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 7? I sleep more than seven hours sometimes, and I hate having to freezer/nap them. DMX freezer is nice since it pauses indefinitely, but I haven't had a new roll in two days now because they haven't gotten their full sleep! Also, why are we still turning the lights out? Tamagotchi On has the Tamas fall asleep on their own at bed time. This is such an improvement. I wish DM's would get some improvements like that too.</TEXT>

So for example: D.Va in the Zero Suit with her Meka in the color scheme of Samus' Gunship or Power Armor. Doomfist with a Captain Falcon Skin. Roadhog and Junkrat with Wario and Waluigi skins. These would work for the Nintendo Switch version. [](/sp) Then on Xbox, you could have a Master Chief skin for Soldier 76. Playstaion could get Freya for Ana, maybe a Spider-Man skin for Blackwidow. ____ What do you guys think?</TEXT>

Here's how it'd work: ____ ##Wave 1: Saiyan Pride * These devices focus on the Saiyans, with only three going all the way to a stage 7. * Instead of an egg, you start with a Saiyan Pod. * Win Ratios and Care Quality will lead to Goku, Vegeta or Broly. * With Goku or Vegeta, you can also get Gohan, Goten or Trunks. * The stages they evolve into are Super Saiyan, Red, Blue, Ultra Instinct, and Berserker. * Secret Character Bubbles (from King Kai's Planet) who can become Ozaru (the Great Ape) * Quest Mode takes you along to fight the baddies of the series, including King Piccolo, Radditz, Nappa, and so on. * Jogressing would be available for fusions. [](/sp) ##Wave 2: Android Invasion * These devices focus on the Androids of Dragonball, with only three going all the way to stage 7. * Instead of an egg, you start with an android capsule. * Win Ratios and Care Quality will lead you to Androids 13, 17, and Cell. * With 13 and 17, you can also get 18, 19 and 20. * The stages they evolve into are focused more on Jogressing, which is necessary for Cell to reach his final stage. * Hell Fighter 17 can be obtained by Jogressing two 17's together. * Secret character Android 8 can be unlocked who becomes Android 16 * Quest Mode has you attack the world and fight series staple heroes such as Master Roshi and the other Z Fighters.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-02-13 17:05:49</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I just finished the first season and I've notice a lot of parallels from *The Last Airbender* * Aang/Kipo: has lots of lost knowledge from being raised by elders. The surface is basically the future for Aang, where nothing is as it used to be, but their lost knowledge still allows them to navigate the new area. They primarily try talking before fighting. Kipo's Wonderbeast State is like Aang's Avatar State, it will take time to master and understand and be the key to success. * Toph/Wolph: Reluctant to help the new person, but their knowledge and skills are paramount to survival. Their skills and training directly oppose the main character as they attack first and talk later. * Jamack/Zuko: Banished from their clan, they seek to redeem themselves by hunting down priority one themselves. When pushed into a corner, however, they do the right thing and help their adversary, slowly coming to terms with their situation and whose side they're really on. * Sokka/Benson: They know a lot and are really capable on their own, but are often overshadowed by the other people in the group. They don't have any extraordinary combat skills or special abilities like the others, but they still keep the group together and try their best. * Momo/Mandu: Cute animal companion that you forget is there until they do something to distract the villains or get in the way. ____ I don't really have a counter for Katara or Dave yet. There may be more characters to come to fit those rolls, but Dave could be apart of Benson.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Nervous about playing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-21 02:58:03</DATE>
    <TEXT>So a few years ago, I played and beat Persona 4 with just a little help from friends and guides (mostly to get the true ending). I'm no stranger to JRPGs or games in general, but I always prefer to play games as blind as possible for my first time. So now I'm playing P5 with my gf (her first Persona) and our friend has gotten in my head. "You can clear this palace in X days" or "Make sure to focus on that S.Link" stuff like that. I know he's just trying to help, but it makes me anxious to play because I'd rather discover these things for myself. It's doubly hard because I know these games have an optimal route and what to do on which day. My gf is continuing to play our file on her own (I have a separate one for myself) and that's fine, but there's just something that's got my stomach in a twist when I'm being told what to do without even asking.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This game doesn't let you place them in home storage (why was this removed?) and leaving too many of them on the ground will lower your town rating. Where the heck are these supposed to be kept during the week? I guess I can put them in the basement now, but that comes so late! What do you guys do?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>My experience playing two games at once [P3+P5]</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 04:52:31</DATE>
    <TEXT>So several years ago, I began on my Persona journey with 4 on the PS3 through their classic downloads. It was recommended through a friend and I loved it. I even got a PS Vita when I learned that most all of the other games are available on it. I bought Persona 1 but put it in sleep mode to go to work and then forgot to resume, losing about 90 minutes of progress. That was all in 2017 or so. Fast forward to now. I still have the Vita and PS3, buy I've double downed on the games. While my gf is playing P5 my PS4, I got a digital copy for myself on PS3 to play while I'm at home. I work the graveyard shift (7pm-7am) and have a lot of free time. I downloaded P3P to play while at work. Do I regret this decision? No, but it has been difficult going back and forth. [](/sp) Because of the quicker, condensed nature pf Portable, I was able to catch up with my P5 file (as far as dates) relatively quickly. Keeping S.Links and characters in check wasn't an issue either, as everyone is very memorable and easy to place for each game. The problem I've run into is remembering which Persona's I've encountered and have on hand since their levels vary so wildly between each game. I often forget who I fused where. Also, the QoL improvements from 3 to 5 are crazy! I'm still enjoying both games, but 3 seems like such a lack luster experience when compared side by side. For reference, I just defeated the Justice and Chariot Shadows for August, while awaiting to send the Calling Card for palace six. I gotta catch up in P3, but it shouldn't take as long with days finishing in three minutes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having played through three Persona games, I always find myself annoyed at status conditions. Shock, Burn, and Freeze may happen with regular skills, but trying to inflict Poison, Fear or Brainwash is such a chore. Anything worth Brainwashing generally can't be or doges, and it's generally easier to just use a Weakness or increase Accuracy/Evasion otherwise. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think these moves should either be buffed or just removed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I just got an Elgato Capture Card today and set everything up. I did a live stream of Mega Man X on my Nintendo Switch and when I went back to review it (other than fixing some audio feedback loops) I realized that tons of frames were being skipped. The game would just seize up for a moment before continuing. [It's super choppy.](https://youtu.be/WewDAVacLug?t=355) Even when it's not recording and just sitting idle, I notice lots of frame skips. Playing Animal Crossing with my GF and watching the game through the OBS preview screen is super choppy. [](/sp) My computer specs are: * AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core * 32gb RAM * NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti [](/sp) Using ShadowPlay and even Elgato's capture program worked fine. What am I missing with OBS?

    <TEXT>So way back in the day, I had a Jurassic Park Lego set. Except it wasn't explicitly Jurassic Part, but it was advertised as a movie set... Set. It came with a Lego clapper, movie camera and director mini figure. I don't remember much about the set, but I think it was supposed to be the attack on the visitor's center from the end of Jurassic Park. The t-rex was blue and had a red tongue which was the top of the alligator figure's head. Well I still have most of the t-rex except for one of its feet. I wanted to look up on Lego's site to find a replacement part, but I cannot remember the set number, and my search terms bring up current sets. Can you guys help me out?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fetishes are just something people have. There isn't much in being able to explain why it occurs. Common ones, such as feet, say that because the feet are on the lower half of the body (where the genitals are located) there's a mixed signal that clump them together as "attractive".

    <TEXT>When the Europe first began to colonize the North American continent, they drove out the indigenous peoples. Christopher Columbus believed this land was India, and called the natives Indians. We know now they were Native Americans. [](/sp) At the time, war was fought by having an agreed upon time and place, whoever lost more soldiers would lose the fight. Native Americans did not fight this way. In what is called Guerilla Warfare, they would set traps, hide and sneak upon those they would wish to attack, the same way they would hunt prey.

    <TITLE>[Mobile] Why is aiming so terrible?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-08-27 09:43:11</DATE>
    <TEXT>For anyone who has not tried on mobile yet, the screen is split into left and right halves. The left half controls movement and aiming, while the right half controls attacks and focuses. Because of this, you can't simply drag the cursor on top of enemies, no no. You have to first tap and hold to charge a focus (after swiping to select which ability you want to use), then use the left half of the screen to move the cursor. Because you aren't moving the cursor from where your finger is, the aiming is really difficult, often sliding the cursor around the field like an air hockey puck. Letting go luckily will instantly stop the cursor, but I feel aiming is way more difficult than necessary.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>So my girlfriend and I were shopping at Goodwill (second hand store for those unfamiliar) and while we were looking at CDs she hands me *Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne*. It has two CD keys still intact, but only one of two discs. I knew I could redeem old codes on B.Net, so I figured for $3 it was worth the gamble. I get home and log into my account and type in the keys. Success! They hadn't been claimed yet! I never played the original WC3, so I'm looking forward to playing some more RTS goodness.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Growing up, I had the occasional snack in the car, like a little bag of pretzels or a granola bar, but not full meals. My dad was very anal about making messes in the car, so we never ate big items while driving or even parked. "To-go" food was "to-go home" with. Maybe on special occasions we'd eat on the go, like a vacation. My gf and I have started to eat in our cars because quarantine means less indoor seating and we don't want to wait sometimes.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I grew up with a father who was very into ball sports. He loves baseball and football, as well as basketball. He'd love to go outside and just toss a ball back and forth. But I was just never that interested in it. Growing up in the 90s, it was a technological boom. Video games were huge, home Internet was taking off and the birth of Nick Toons and Cartoon Network meant there was just so much more to do inside. ____ From this aspect, I've never been too big into sports at all. Why watch someone else do an activity when you could do one yourself? Why watch NASCAR when I could load up Mario Kart or F-Zero and do the race myself, with crazy tracks, fun items and zany music? Why watch the Cubs vs White Sox when I could load up Backyard Baseball and have Pablo throw a no hitter? [](/sp) Now I understand why people enjoy sports and professional games. These are people at the top of their game and can do it on a level the average person can only dream of. But for myself, I'd rather do something that I'm engaged in, that I can control and manipulate. I want to be the one who wins. I enjoy it more when I win instead of the team I'm watching.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem with racing as a viewer is there's not much to do than track your car. I think races go on for a crazy long time too. This is why college sports are better than professional: less commercials. A game is over sooner so you can still do something else.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I started watching this show on Netflix a few weeks ago. I'm in the middle of season three now. But my gosh, the main cast can be so awful. Winston, however, is the bright light. He's always looking to better and improve himself and he's open and honest. He has some of the funniest jokes and plays so well off everyone else. How do you all feel about Mr. Bishop?</TEXT>

I've made sure all files are in the right locations and *loader* renamed to *boot*. Nothing I've done works! There is still plenty of space on the SD card. Even when loading up the GCN games that are installed now, I can see a brief Nintendont image, but I don't know how to get into it!

    <TEXT>Not so much for single player games, but anything with an online component can lead to account bans and even system bans, meaning other users can even go online with it. Cheat codes and devices aren't as common these days, but with so much of an online presence and constant updating, it can really screw games up. Famously, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl would give you a Bad Egg. This egg would never hatch and cannot be removed from the party. I forget what else it did. Michael Jackson: The Experience on Wii replaced all audio tracks with vuvuzelas if you tried to pirate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Warner Brothers covers a *LOT* of ground. From Bugs Bunny and the Loony Tunes to the DC animated universe, including Batman TAS, Teen Titans and Justice League. [](/sp) Hanna-Barbara was great in the 60s-70s, but once Disney launched their own dedicated network in the 80s, they fell to the wayside. Their cheap animation stood out more and more as being lazy. Recycled backgrounds, stiff characters and limited frames really stopped these shows from matching up to others. I wouldn't say H/B got good until the late 90s with Cartoon Cartoons, like Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls. The Flintstones and Scooby Doo may be iconic, but the original shows don't hold up. [](/sp) Disney can be very hit or miss. Their animated theatrical films have an excellent track record, until the 80s, but the resumed in the 90s. I'd say their lowest point, animated TV wise, was 2000-2009, with Kim Possible being the biggest TV name for them, until Gravity Falls premiered in 2010. ____ At the end of the day, I'll go with Warner Brothers. They offer such a broader variety of cartoons and shows, with some of the best super hero movies made. Marvel may dominate the silver screen, but DC has always made excellent home video films.</TEXT>

They were nice! [](/sp) As I got older and new shows came out, I was hooked into Cartoon Network. Almost their whole lineup had me wanting more. * Dexter's Laboratory * Powerpuff Girls * Edd, Ed 'n' Eddy * Codename: Kids Next Door * Swat Kats Other shows to mention: * Pirates of Dark Water * Invader Zim * Darkwing Duck ____ There are still plenty of good cartoons today. Check out: * The Amazing World of Gumball * Sonic Boom * Gravity Falls * Star vs the Forces of Evil * Wonder Over Yonder * Infinity Train * DuckTales (2017) * Glitch Techs * She-Ra * Voltron * Dragon Price DreamWorks is on a roll with Netflix originals, btw.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The new GPU's, announced two weeks ago, are the Nvidia 3000 series. 3090, 3080 and 3070. 3070 is the lowest tier for this series as of right now, and it's $500. I believe it's $800 for the 3080.</TEXT>

Once that star is collected, you exit the level and unlock the next star for that world and sometimes a new world too. The gameplay is a lot more stop 'n' go than Odyssey.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The problem with Overwatch is how toxic and demanding teammates can be. It was so bad, they had to force a 2-2-2 system because free hero picks were too off balanced. Nobody wanted to play support because they'd be left to die, and everyone wants to play DPS. "I spent money on this game, I'm going to play it how I want!" Well shit, guess I'm going to lose another match because the guy playing McCree keeps dying to Widowmaker and won't counter pick or chose another Hero.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Game: Among Us It's a social deduction game. 1-3 players are Imposters who try to blend in. Their goal is to kill everyone else and sabotage the ship. Regular Crew members perform tasks around the ship, like fixing wires or aligning engines. When you find a dead body, you can report it. This leads to a discussion where people point fingers at each other. When enough people vote for another player, that player is removed from the game, and their true identity is revealed.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>From 2006-2012, I would say Xbox. Other than the RRoD, the 360 was an amazing machine with 90% backwards compatibility. While it took a couple revisions to install a network adapter, Xbox Live was the best place to play games online. Not even needing to share a game, you could party chat with your friends. Halo was the king and LAN parties were amazing. 2013-Present, PlayStation. While still being more expensive, Blu Ray is a Sony technology and they take full advantage of it. They've added in party chat and offer extra games with your online subscription. Being able to play Blu Ray movies natively is a huge bonus as well. While barely any games are backwards compatible, they have a much more expansive first party list of exclusive games. Spider-Man, God of War and Persona 5 alone were enough to make me want a PS4. I will say the Dual Shock 4 has the absolute worst battery life of any controller I've ever used.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>u/Gabriel_Iglesias and u/JimGaffaginHere are great American stand-up comics. They tell stories about their lives in comical ways. They understand that you need to be able to laugh at yourself and be humble. They don't get political or talk about current world events. I have a Lewis Black album and he talks about Terry Shivo, Shrek the Third, Hurricane Katrina and Bush/Cheny. It's hard to listen again because none of that has really been relevant for 15 years. If I had to pinpoint the Great American Common Denominator, it's food. Fluffy has told countless storied of being brought chocolate cake to his shows. Jim Gaffigan's moat famous phrase is "Hooooot Pockeeeets!" Even Lewis Black from his Carnegie Hall show talked about candy corn. Ralphie May was a big man. He loved to talk and joke about food. Food is something everyone enjoys so it's easy to connect with.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Having beaten Odyssey 100% earlier this year, beating Galaxy three years ago, and playing 64 and Sunshine today, here are my thoughts: As far as controls, Sunshine is the worst. At least on the Switch, Mario slips and slides all over the place, causing him to do flip jumps when I don't want him to. He's always breaking into a full sprint, which makes delicate platforming even more difficult. It took me about 20 minutes to get a pair of blue coins in Noki Bay because I needed to use the boat. Oh, and having to wait for the other boats to get Yoshi to that one island (with a super annoying challenge course). That Yoshi thing is so tedious! Yoshi kept slipping off the boats and into the water. [](/sp) Mario 64 is doing a lot better than what I remembered. I feel much more in control of him. He goes where I want, jumps better and moves better. There seems to be some sort of delay in Sunshine, but not so much in 64. [](/sp) With movement out of the way, the game can be a lot of fun. Erasing goop and sludge off of everything is really satisfying. I've actually enjoyed splitting the R trigger between stand and move spraying. This way, you don't accidentally move or stick yourself by pressing too hard or not enough. I've collected 40 shines in Sunshine so far and have gotten two game overs, but lost a lot of lives along the way. I collected 20 stars in 64, also had two game overs, but I'm up to 21 lives, thanks to 100 coin stars. I'm honestly enjoying 64 more than SS just because it's playing nicer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Okay, I can help shed some light. My father was born and raised in Chicago. My mother, however, is a Cuban immigrant. She came to the US in 1969. She did not have the easiest time learning English, she was nine at the time. Her parents only spoke Spanish and a few phrases in English. She's fluent now, but it was a long process for her. This makes me first generation on my mother's side. I was born 1991. Growing up, my brother and I asked our mom why she didn't teach us Spanish. Here's what she told us:  gt;"I was worried you might speak Spanish in school or get confused in class." She knew first hand how difficult it was speaking not-English in school. She regrets it now, but her fear was that we'd be moved to an ESL or some remedial class if we couldn't separate English from Spanish.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Comparing my family with my gf's is quite interesting. Among my gf and her parents, everyone gave each other several gifts. But it was Christmas. I haven't gotten several gifts at once since I was maybe 11? Even celebrating Hanukkah and Christmas, I'd generally just get a single gift from my parents if I asked for something. I haven't gotten presents from relatives since I was maybe 15? I'm 29 now. Even among the adults, my family doesn't do presents at the holidays any more. Maybe little cute things, but that's about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here are my thoughts on this: Dragon Ball's Great Ape transformation works with any planetoid being illuminated by a star. Even holograms can work. In GT, Goku and Vegeta were able to use Earth to trigger the transformation. Now I know werewolves go back a lot farther than 1997, but I'd argue that simply being on the moon wouldn't cure it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I've been a CNA for close to eight years, here's some thoughts I have. * Let grandma die. Too many patients come into my facility with a Full Code status. This means we need to try every life saving measure we can in case the person begins to die. Most of the people in question are 80+, under 100lbs and generally not well to do, be it in constant pain or completely unaware of reality. Let them go on hospice already! * Confusion is the most horrifying thing that can happen. I have a lady who will get up out of her bed, come into the hall and then beg for someone to help her get into bed. She will do this four times in 10 minutes. We simply watch her get into bed and cover herself with a sheet, only for her to return moments later. * Another patient can't remember why she's in a rehab facility, let alone what sent her there. She keeps waiting for her daughter to visit, but we don't allow any visitors due to the current situation. * We are not a specialty facility to help memory patients, and it really taxes the staff having to help them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While anime has been in the US since the 50s, I'd say it began to take root in the 80s. Voltron and Gundam got people hooked on giant robots, and Transformers (while an Western toy) were based off a Japanese property. 1996 was when Dragon Ball hit US shores, followed soon after by Z (for reference, GT was already underway in Japan by this point). Toonami definitely helped main stream anime with DBZ, Sailor Moon and Tenchi Muyo. Moving to the late night Saturday slot in the early 2000s brought us shows like Inuyasha, Cowboy Bebop anf Outlaw Star. Once Toonami moved to Saturday evening (instead of midnight) and started showing Naruto, that was it. Hot Topic was selling headbands and gloves. Anywhere that sold graphic t-shirts had Naruto merch. Everyone wanted ramen noodles and and ran with their arms behind them. 2005 was when anime became mainstream in the US.</TEXT>

[](/sp) I don't like Yom Kippur. Going to services as a child was torture. Needing to dress up, go to temple early and several hours at that. Morning and evening services along with fasting.

    <TITLE>Two ideas I had: Secret Agent and The Brig</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-09-28 01:03:34</DATE>
    <TEXT>So a new role idea is based off The Psychic from Werewolf. As a cool-down action, they can interrogate other players. This will reveal the Agent's identify to the suspect and the suspect's identity to the Agent. What can ensue: * Fake Secret Agents can lie about identifying the Imposter * Secret Agent can find Imposter, but be killed immediately * Other players can out Secret Agent, causing him to be targeted by Imposter * Secret Agent acting sus since he doesn't do tasks As a server rule, between 0-1 Agents can be added. This allows for even more engaging gameplay and sleuthing skills. ____ My other idea comes from the biggest Imposter in space, Battlestar Galactica. Instead of voting off the ship, players can send each other to jail instead. The time in jail can be modified, but they cannot kill, be killed, or do tasks. This will result in longer games, but again, I feel it adds another layer in complexity. I'm actually rethinking of putting a vent in the jail.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>7/10 The visuals are great, and the sounds are good. The biggest issues is Mario's slippery controls. Sliding off platforms happens too frequently, and it's too easy to overshoot where to land. Needing to have a gap between Mario and a wall is confusing for me, and it's near impossible to do a straight wall jump between two walls as he'll move at an angle. You can fix this by moving the camera to hide Mario so he jumps straight forward and back instead. There are many secrets in this game that you'd have no idea about, like spraying a sign for a blue coin. These hidden parts were an excuse to sell game guides as nothing in the game would prepare you for or hint that this would be necessary. There are also some incredibly difficult shines to obtain, such as the Pachinko and Toxic Water trials. The slippery physics make doing these a pain. Even reaching toxic water takes too long as you have to wait for boats with Yoshi and pray he doesn't slip off on the way. Missing a coin in it means you have ro kill Mario unless you want to do the boat wait again. [](/sp) These issues aside, the game is tremendous fun with tons of levels and areas to explore.</TEXT>

However, 1-3 players are Imposters and are trying to sabotage everything and kill Crew Members. The Crew Mates can also win by getting rid of the Imposters. A special action the Imposter can perform is moving through the air vents. Only they can do this, so by witnessing it, you know for certain they are an Imposter.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Tonight has been my most difficult easy shift ever.</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-03 10:55:40</DATE>
    <TEXT>I work 12 hour overnight shifts from 1900-0730 as a CNA. As soon as I came onto the floor last night, I was informed we'd be receiving a Covid positive patient and that I would be 1-on-1 with them. We do this to decrease possibility of cross contamination. Well this was more or less a "walk in" patient as this is a long term care and rehab facility. We have independent living across the street and this is where the patient came from. [](/sp) The patient arrives at 1930 and I wheel them up from the lobby. They're kind and agreeable and don't put up a fuss, so I'm very thankful. I spent a fair amount of time in the room just sorting belongings and explaining everything that will happen. By 2100 they're in bed and I've done the skin assessment with the LPN. But my poor co-worker is answering all the other lights (16), and three nurses trying to keep up with the workload as two other admissions came in yesterday too. [](/sp) So here I am sitting down playing Nintendo and I can't help by going into any of the rooms. The most I can do is fetch supplies for them. I felt so bad for my other CNA, but at least we had another come in for 11-7 shift. It's almost 6am right now and I'm typing this up because I have nothing else to do. I wish I could help my co-workers more, but I'm stuck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I initially purchased Legends on my 3DS, way back when it was new. I was having a great time up until this level. I could consistently get up to the end where you fight Argorok and Zant, but I'd always lose. Two bosses at once just made it harder, and his flying nonsense kept getting me. I initially put the game down to try later, only I got busy, new games came out, had to work, etc. More things came up and I forgot about it. Now with AoC on the horizon, I remembered I had this game. It took me a few more tries, but I finally finished the damn level! I didn't even attempt the Gold Skulltula. That's for later.</TEXT>

I've also recently (within the last three years) developed really dry skin on my face. It drives me crazy and I still haven't found the best solution. I know I over exfoliate because I have to shave so often. I'm going to start using an electric razor more often to try and reduce irritation on my face and let it heal.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ah, okay. I had watched a video and become familiar with the [Umibozu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umib%C5%8Dzu) who, in Japanese mythology, appear as a bald monk and attempt to sink ships and drowns the crew. The video drew parallels between the Water Wraith, and even the Plasm Wraith, to this yokai as they were very difficult bosses and potentially caused the ships to crash onto the planet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT> gt; Mandatory EXP share which lead to easy over leveling and 0 challenge I'm gonna be honest and say I don't mind the EXP share, but they didn't increase the difficulty to scale with it. The worst part of an RPG is getting a new party member and having to grind them up to the rest of the party's level. I understand why some people don't like it, but I appreciate not having to shove Magikarp in the front of the party, then swap him out to earn more EXP. Or having several lower level Pokemon that need the boost at the same time.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I don't understand how only the player characters get to respawn</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-19 10:34:33</DATE>
    <TEXT>It's been a while since I played BL1 and 2, but I believe the Hyperion respawn stations basically create a clone of the character. This means if you die, you get to respawn. [](/sp) But why isn't everyone registered then? If a random shmuck from off a bus can just register, why can't random bandits? Or other main characters? How does anyone stay dead when there's "Come Back to Life" machines all over the place? I'm sorry if this has been discussed before, but it really seems weird when say, the president of a universal corporation tells you to kill yourself for fun, you come back and he pays you, but he himself doesn't even use those machines? Even in BL3, you're offered to kill yourself again, the characters knowing full well that you'll come back. How do Vault Hunter characters stay dead when they were able to respawn in previous games? I don't know if the games ever explain, other than I guess dying too far away from a machine? I remember being really disappointed in how 2 ended because of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The first game helped it establish an in universe way as to why you get to respawn, instead of any other game where you have to go back and re-do that section again. Like, Handsome Jack says "Go kill yourself for money." and you do. You come back and he pays you. I feel there could have been ways to explain why some people don't respawn, but they haven't provided any.</TEXT>
