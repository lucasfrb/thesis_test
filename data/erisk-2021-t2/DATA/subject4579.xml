    <TEXT>Give me, give me, chicken tendies Be they crispy, or from Wendy's Spend my hard-earned good boy points On Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints Mommy lifts me to the car To find me tendies near and far Enjoy my tasty tendie treats In comfy big boy booster seats McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's But of my tendies none remains She tries to make me take a nappy But sleeping doesn't make me happy Tendies are the only food That puts me in the napping mood I'll scream, I'll shout, I'll make a fuss I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Tendies are my heart's desire Fueled by raging, hungry fire Mommy sobs, and wails, and cries But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries My good boy points were fairly earned To buy the tendies that I've yearned But there's no tendies on my plate Did mommy think that I'd just ate?! Tendies, tendies, get them now! You fat, ungrateful, sluggish sow! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! I screech while hurling into her eyes My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise For she who is unpooped on is she who remembers: Never forget my chicken tenders Hey hey hey! Hey hey hey! Hey hey hey! Whatsawhatsawhatsawhatsawhatsawhatsawhatsa up Bitconnect! Hey hey hey everybody my name is Carlos Matos and I am coming from New York City, New York and let me tell you guys that I am so excited, I am so happy, I am really so thrilled to be right now sharing this amazing, glorious, super, and exciting moment of my life with all of you guys, and let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it, the world is not anymore the way it used to be, mmm mmm, No! No! No! BITCONNECT! Wow! BITCONNECT! We are coming and we are coming in waves! We are starting and we are watching go all over the world! We are pelting the entire world! Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago with only $25,610 and right now I am reaching $140,000! Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah Whats up? And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun\- I mean $1,400 on an every day basis, seven days a week! What #8253; I am right now independently, financially independently. I am saying to so many people who say that this was going to be con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game,  #8220;Hey! You #8217;re gonna lose all your money! #8221; My wife still doesn #8217;t believe in me! I #8217;m telling him  #8220;Oh honey, this is real! #8221;  #8220;Oh no no no no no, that #8217;s a scam! #8221; And I said  #8220;But wait I #8217;m gonna go to the bank and I #8217;m gonna get my bitcoins and I #8217;m actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table! #8221;  #8220;No, that #8217;s money you took from another account! #8221; And I #8217;ll say  #8220;What am I gonna do #8253; #8221; Then I said to myself,  #8220;You know what? When I am starting to put $10,000 a day on her, right on her, you know on her table. #8221; Then she #8217;s gonna say  #8220;Woah! #8221; Hahaha! Yo yo yo yo yo!  #8220;OK that #8217;s real! #8221; Hahahaha! So guys, I #8217;m gonna tell you something. Faith and believe is the one thing that we will need to be able to change the world, and right now I believe that in this room, we have the seed that #8217;s gonna germinate and is going to explode into an amazing opportunity for us to change this entire world. I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so excited to be here right now and let me tell you something, that each and every one of you has the opportunity to become like those amazing people that we know here from Vietnam. Hey hey! My group from Vietnam! Making so much money that it could probably that could probably have a real hard time counting it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

    <TEXT>Ironically, James tends to be a much better critic than the Nostalgia Critic. When he made [Top 10 Popular Films I Don't Love] (https://youtu.be/YneqewcVLVY), he was honest and brave enough to break the circlejerk on a movie. Unlike most movie critics who just get a glimpse of a review from Rotten Tomatoes and consider a film immediately full of shit or a masterpiece even without seeing it. In conclusion, these movie critics are not critics at all but rather people who are talking about the metrics to bring in a certain audience to whether love or hate the movie when it comes to what MetaCritic or RT tells them to do.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Help! I have 2 accounts (US  amp; Asia) and the Physical Copy I bought is from Asia (Codes are region locked) so I had to make sure both of these accounts were primarily activated on the PS4 (meaning they can share DLCs, Online Gaming, and even games) and which it was. I activated the code and everything is working (5 Bonus Points, Suit Pack, Dynamic Theme, Early Spider Drone) but for some reason my US account didn #8217;t get the avatar! Only the Asian account has the Avatar but not my US account so is there any redemption to this? It would be kind of you to give any suggestions or help.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There is literally some Australian hoe in Instagram who says she is "Sad" or "Depressed" then a few stories later (in less than a day) she posts stuff like "LIKE MY RECENT XOXOXO" or "hmu cuz I'm sad" while some XXTENTACION track is playing and a boomerang of her wiggling her ass as she expresses her "sad feelings." The fact that this bitch has 2800+ followers and just uses sadness for internet points is what really sets me off! Not to mention that she has "besties" (hoes) to accompany her and a roof over her head is just how ungrateful she is. I am really sorry if this is something that is straight off my chest, but mind you that at least I am giving a piece of my mind on what actual depression is like.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Damn, I could relate a whole lot to him. The truth is I actually loved any kaiju themed or prehistoric themed movie or franchise to a point I would set up an image of a photo-realistic image of a prehistoric or mythological monster around a few years ago. And for the record I am an introvert. Little did I know that making such would give me a huge drawback to my reputation in my school. People would literally parody  #8220;Popular Movie Franchise #8221; theme and every time I stood up by the teacher #8217;s attention people would sing it out loud, like jeez grow up already! (It gets worse as it even catches the attention of people 2 years higher than me) Everyone started spreading photos of me watching some certain movie my parents posted on FB on how proud and excited I was. I couldn #8217;t endure it any longer. I had to stay away from everything related to  #8216;that #8217; by changing interests and such. My last resort was to make my pfp a blank white image and blocking a lot of people to make sure they are in no means of approaching me. I couldn #8217;t delete my FB account because everyone would start blaming me for being absent and unhelpful since it is the only platform most of my peers go to, I am forced to stay. (Not to mention group projects and hws) I am 1 year behind senior high going to STEM and its hard to believe that the same people are still doing this like for 3 years? Like, just let go of it already. Best I can do is avoid them. I really hope he (Sammy Zenith) puts his past way behind him along with the people he #8217;s around with. You really can #8217;t judge someone forever because they simply can #8217;t agree with you or relate to you. Sorry if I had to get this off my chest and this may not be the proper sub to comment here, and I really hope for the best for people who are trying to redeem themselves like him.</TEXT>
