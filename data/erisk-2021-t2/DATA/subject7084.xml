    <TITLE>How drunk was tom during the reunion tour?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-29 18:39:22</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not trying to steal focus from the new album or dig up past issues, but obviously with the new album I'm on a bit of Blink kick, which naturally includes a lot of Thomas DeLonge songs. So my question is: how drunk was Tom during the reunion tour? I ask mainly because I watch videos of the reunion tour and he seems so on. He was playing really well and he was funny as always, but actually seemed to want to be there. Yet I always hear he was wasted every show. Is that really true? I can't seem to find many articles about it. And if it is, does anyone know why he felt the need to do that every show? Seems kinda disrespectful. Did he ever get over that or is he just like that every time he plays live (which is basically just with Blink)? Kinda puts a damper on those reunion videos, cause he really seems like he's having a lot of fun, and I'd like to think its not just alcohol.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is Transvestite the ultimate blink-182 song?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-06-30 19:38:10</DATE>
    <TEXT>I would argue that these guys got it right on the money straight from the beginning. And its not even widely available these days! But seriously, Transvestite is both of the guys, hysterical, but also a great song with a fantastic build. It never gets old to me and kind of the first song I think of when I think pure Blink, as opposed to the later more polished mainstream Enema and Take Off stuff.

    <TEXT>What are people's thoughts on this? I've seen it before but I go back to it often cause I just find it so fascinating. I'm probably naive, but Mark and Tom seem totally fine here. But that can't possibly be the case right? Mark must be at least a little peeved that Tom was promoing all this stuff at the same time as Neighborhoods, and the thing that basically held Neighborhoods up for so long. I didn't think their relationship was on good terms by this point but they seem so cordial here. Enough to fool me. I guess cause its AVA it seems so shocking to me, although mature.

    <TITLE>blew it big time with a tOYPAJ vinyl</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-08 05:01:23</DATE>
    <TEXT>Earlier tonight I found a vinyl for TOYPAJ for a mere $55 on Ebay. Included all three of the singles too, which is why I'd even want the thing! The whole thing seemed weird to me, as they usually run like $25-$30 more than that, and this was Buy It Now AND Free Shipping. Almost too good to be true that it threw me off. Kinda waited on it a bit then figured "what the hell, this'll be great". By that point, it had already been bought, and I figured it would go fast. FUCK! Still shocked at how cheap it is. That is rare right? I mentioned it to someone else tonight and they were like "couldn't you just find it in a store?" and I said I'd never seen one other than Ebay. Here's a link to the listing: http://www.ebay.com/itm/BLINK-182-TAKE-OFF-YOUR-PANTS-AND-JACKET-WHITE-VINYL-LP-3X7-/222172692868?hash=item33ba864184%3Ag%3ABE8AAOSwkl5Xdh3~ amp;nma=true amp;si=QYdLgToSZ6bRLDWPC%252F8bDnbZn2Y%253D amp;orig_cvip=true amp;rt=nc amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2557 Was the lucky bastard anyone here lol?

    <TEXT>Just downloaded the supposed bonus track on We Don't Need To Whisper called The Machine, and when I listened it seemed the lyrics were identical to Start The Machine. A bit different instrumentation I think, but is there any real difference between the two songs? Seems the biggest thing is Start The Machine has the extra verse at the end about "if love's a word that you say..." but otherwise its the same. Seemed curious to me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>"Enthused" and "Apple Shampoo" - the ultimate defiant tom and mark songs?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-20 16:10:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm figuring out how to quite phrase the question, but I've always thought when I listen to Dude Ranch those songs seem like pretty defiant statements from these two, essentially, kids about to and trying to take over the world. Does anyone else hear this? I just love their placement in the album, almost side by side, and just feel each one speaks so clearly them. Enthused - I LOVE that buildup to Tom's vocals. It almost seems like it might be an instrumental track then you get that defiant strong guitar strum leading up to Tom's angsty "Am I strung out? Crazy, or not allowed..." I'm not quite sure what he's railing against, but I feel its just so genuinely Tom's feelings at the moment mixed with some great music. Apple Shampoo - a similar thing here where its almost pure Mark (and Enthused pure Tom) just venting about life and where to go. "both getting tired of punk rock clubs, and both playing in punk rock bands." Just such a statement of being at a crossroads. I don't know, maybe I'm insane. But I've always seen these two as the deep cuts that perfectly work together and speak to their respective values. Love their placement on the album and love the defiant nature they seem to have about them. Does anyone else hear it, has anyone else ever thought that, or am I just strung out and crazy?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm sure its not, but has Travis ever talked about this? Does he feel uncomfortable playing songs that he didn't originally record and now that they have 3 huge albums with Trav they tend to avoid them? And also why they go towards Wendy Clear and Dysentery Gary as obscure cuts as opposed to Dude Ranch songs? Just all thoughts I've been pondering. I love Enema, TOYPAJ and self titled as much as the next guy, but how many times can we hear those same songs.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So how long was this album really brewing?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-07-28 22:39:01</DATE>
    <TEXT>Here's why I ask: So Tom leaves (or gets fired) in January 2015. He releases a CD of demos 4 months later that includes the song Golden Showers In The Golden State. Now, it can't just be perfectly coincidental that the song is a childish ode to the very state our newest CD is all about. Even Tom said some of these songs were planned for Blink, so obviously by the time Tom left Blink must have already decided on the California theme of the next album, a full year and a half before it comes out. I just found that interesting. I wonder when they originally planned for the new album to come out (maybe summer 2015?). Did Tom write any other songs in keeping with the California theme? Are they on To The Stars? IMO I'm almost angry that Tom even had anything to do with the album. Not cause I don't like him, but I just then think about what he would have added. The fact that something Golden Showers exists makes me want to hear this album done with him. Regardless of what people think of the song's lyrics, the music is pure Blink. I don't know, I just kinda wish they had come up with the idea after he left or done something completely new after recruiting Skiba. Cause since its inception was around with Tom I keep thinking "what if?" Anyone else? It also just surprises me this album took almost 2 years to make. They talk about it being fast, but obviously it was planned as early as winter of 2014.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Would anyone else love to see Tom do a solo tour?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-05 15:00:30</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm genuinely not sure whether this is the right place to post this or extremely obvious, but does anyone else feel this way? Just listening to the Demos disc right now and I really do think there are some good songs there. Maybe nothing too deep or long lasting, but I don't see a problem with New World and Suburban Kings, and I was just thinking "will we ever see those live in any form?" And then I thought "it would be awesome if Tom went out and did a solo tour". He's got so much music with so many different bands that I think that would be a really cool and fresh show. He wouldn't have to restrict himself to just playing one thing, he could just embrace his catalogue. Play Box Car, play some solo stuff, play AVA, obviously play Blink material. But I think it could be really cool. Play intimate venues, get a list of about 50 songs worked up you'd want to pull out, and just go out and do your thing. Not really sure who the band would be. Hard not to imagine David on guitar who I think would be right, and Brooks would be cool on drums (since he's been solo and Blink), but I'd be fine with Atom or Ilan too. But I just think that would be a lot of fun. Focus on your centric Blink songs, well known and deep cuts, and just have a blast. I think you could easily make a 25 song setlist of just Tom's Blink and other material. TL;DR: the question posed at the title of the thread.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Finally saw Blink for the first time tonight. A few thoughts:</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-15 04:30:58</DATE>
    <TEXT>Overall, I thought it was a very good show. I feel any negatives weren't really their fault. My biggest negative was I thought the sound wasn't that great. Maybe its because I was on Mark's side, but it just seemed way too muddy and it was hard to hear Matt most times, and vocals in general. Good setlist. I'd never seen them before so obviously I don't have the benefit of knowing the real difference without Tom there, but it started off sorta weird. Not weird, but the first 4 songs or so being so Mark heavy, even taking the mic center stage for What's My Age Again really seemed to solidify that they are making a stand. By the end I noticed it less because it was a fairly even split, but at the beginning it seemed noticeable. Surprisingly, two of my favorite performances were Down and I Miss You, which I think they just killed, and those are two I rarely listen to these days. Lots of new stuff which was nice and disappointing in the same way. We got like 8 songs which seemed way more than usual, and while I like that they are pushing it I wish they were playing more of my favorites from it. I'd definitely include She's Out Of Her Mind and Rabbit Hole for others. Cynical I thought was great. Reckless Abandon was awesome, as was Violence and Dysentery Gary. Los Angeles was a weird main set closer and I'm not sure why that was switched with Carousel since I believe that was a first this whole tour. Overall, a really solid show. Probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. I could say more but then this is gonna get really long. I thought Skiba absolutely destroyed in places and in others Tom was sorely missed. Also, I have read nothing but "Skiba has low energy and doesn't move at all" since this tour began. Maybe tonight was different, and I know he doesn't have as much energy as Mark (who does) but Skiba was all over the place tonight. It was awesome.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>With the lack of banter, it pretty much is a different band</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-08-18 06:40:02</DATE>
    <TEXT>Let me preface, but saying I love the players in this band, and while I love Tom I don't agree with what he did and how he conducted himself post reunion. But I gotta be honest, tonight at Barclays, I saw a different band. A different band than has been Blink for 20 years. I get that the banter isn't everyone's cup of tea (I have met people here that have said the live album doesn't really do it for them) But this is just such a left turn from what we've always known. Blink ALWAYS talked in between every song. Tonight, I legitimately think they said less than two minutes of talking to the audience. It is night and day. In no way am I disappointed in tonight's show. The band and Skiba kicked ass and sounded better than they have since pre-breakup. The music was incredible tonight and so on point, but god, this is a new band. I truly don't know what the right call is. Its 2 of the three in Blink and it shouldn't be up to Tom to decide whether they use the name based off his commitment. But tonight proved Blink is those 3, and Scott in the early years. It just is. The banter is what made them them. And without it tonight, it really could have been any other band up there. Just in terms of nothing sticks out as totally unique to them anymore besides the players. Its weird. This was a weird feeling tonight. I don't feel like I saw a Blink cover band, but I don't really feel like I saw Blink 182.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Could newer Blink fans be the most honest judges of California?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-25 13:40:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>Say, people that became fans of Blink in the last year. That would mean they are getting into Blink after their peak successful years and its no longer mainstream. They have no reason to really defend this band, unlike many of us that have been hardcores for years. In theory, they got into the band recently because the music spoke to them, presumably Enema, TOYPAJ or Self Titled. They continued listening if they liked what they heard. I would think those people could give the most honest opinion of California in that case. No matter how unbiased we may think we are, I would assume every hardcore fan has at least some opinion they can't get past (mainly either they love or hate Tom) and that will change your view of the record. A newer fan, on the other hand, can take the record on its own face value merits, because they don't really have any lasting ties to the band to think otherwise. They can more easily relate to an album just touching you regardless of whether you know or like the band or not. Thoughts?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Was WDNTW not praised as much as it should have been?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2016-10-31 13:01:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>While it may sound like a cliche question I do mean it seriously. I don't think there's an easy cut and dry answer, but just curious as to opinions. Was the album disregarded by the general public or was it honored exactly as much as it should have been? Obviously Tom was coming out of Blink and there was a certain degree of hesitance or excitement or both. Angels and Airwaves, without question, never became the same level as Blink, that much is clear. But listening to WDNTW 10 years later, was it overlooked by the public? I think there's a strong argument for it, as the music is nothing displeasing and at its least captures all the elements of the other crap people listen to today. There's nothing really not to like unless you're actively comparing it to Blink. In that case you can say its a great record that no one ever really took as seriously as they should have. However, I also completely see the argument that it was rated just perfectly. It connected with a certain group, they found an appreciation of it, and for the magnitude of it thats all that really matters. Hardly any artist has two bands that hit so any praise this album got was fine. Tom himself has said he considers AVA more niche and not exactly a band, so maybe the success he's had with it is absolutely on par with that. Again, just things I'm pondering. On some days I wish the album got more attention and wasn't so bogged in the controversy, Blink and otherwise, and on others I think "its not some masterpiece record that has gone unnoticed. I like it and its a good record, but it got just as much notice as it should have." I assume the consensus will be that it should have been taken more seriously, but even I can say objectively "its good, but I'd only argue it should have been taken more seriously if it even hit me as hard as one of the classic Blink records did on first listen."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I get it that most here don't like the celebrity interviews. I actually still enjoy them and even ones I think I might not like I end up getting pretty into. I was dreading Cardi B and actually thought it came off as her best interview. Thats not saying much, but I thought I'd have to skip and pleasantly heard the whole thing. The Paltrow one was a new low to me. Howard AGGRESSIVELY trying to kiss her ass and literally having NOTHING to talk about with her. And she was equally bad. Maybe she's not a total bitch but she certainly comes off as one (her mother Blythe Danner is incredible though). She gave horrible answers or at most times didn't even know what to say, although in fairness Howard was also barely asking her questions and more commenting on things and then asking for replies which she and no one would have. I don't know, this was easily his worst interview in awhile IMO. The two had zero to say to each other and everything out of Howard's mouth was basically the antithesis of everything's he's said over the years to the nth degree. "Why get married? Oh, I LOVE marriage!" I know this is probably old news to most here but holy crap was that one bad and I'm pretty easy on him with the interviews.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Stuttering John leaving - how awkward in studio was that?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-06-19 17:02:13</DATE>
    <TEXT>Forgive me but I missed the years when John left to go join Jay Leno. I've obviously known about it and I never cared cause I never liked John, but that seems like it would have to be so awkward. To be leaving, and to of all things be going to Leno who Howard despises; I can't even imagine how John came into work after that cat was out of the bag. Did it sound super awkward? Was it talked about a ton of the show? How long between them finding out did John leave? I'm trying to think of a way to justify John and the only possible one is John thinking Howard was retiring and trying to secure a future. And that if he mentioned this to Howard Howard would say "I'm not leaving" and then feel responsible to stay on for John. Which I do get, although it still seems like a stretch. How was that run? It seems like I would never want to go back if I was found out to be jumping ship. Its a total betrayal and I'm shocked he wasn't fired on the spot. Also, it just plain never made sense to me why Jay would hire Stuttering John to announce. Am I missing something but thats what makes the whole thing baffling. Who wants a stuttering announcer?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey all, and hopefully this is not against the rules. So I saw that a couple people were creating compilations of all the covers Al performed on this tour but I got antsy and also wanted to make sure it was done to my satisfaction. No extreme editing, having all the dialouge in I felt was necessary, really doing the whole thing with love, so I started messing around on my own and it came out pretty good. I put together a compilation from the first 18 shows of the tour (up to Apollo night 1) that run like a seamless show. I tried hard with the editing and personally think it sounds good. I will try to do the rest of the shows as well but will probably take at least a week of time to go through the rest so here's the first batch. It was just for me but figured there might be others that wanted it since the editing is not done crudely and meant to salvage as much of that section of every show as possible. If you'd be interested in a link, feel free to DM me. And if this is wrong feel free to take this post down or I'll edit it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Just saw the band The Struts and made me miss this band a lot</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-19 13:28:07</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I saw Foo Fighters the other night at MSG and the opening band was this band The Struts. I had heard of them but never seen them or heard their music. Long story short, they were pretty good and I was rather impressed by the frontman. Basically a blatant Freddie Mercury rip off but he pulled it off well, but the band and the singer kept reminding me of something... Heard the album the next day and it clicked (way moreso studiowise than live): "oh, they're Foxy." Then the last two days have basically been spent reminiscing about the wonders of Foxy Shazam and how much I miss them. I don't listen to that much new music these days and these guys just clicked with me. A friend showed me Church Of Rock N Roll and I quickly heard the whole album. Fell in love with that album and the self titled, and relished my friend's stories about how the singer would hang from the rafters and eat cigarettes live. He gave me Introducing which at first I thought was way too screamo punky for me but I've grown to love and really think is an excellent album. Finally saw them live on that Church tour and they were just killer. It was outstanding. A few years went by, Gonzo finally came out and it was the first "new" album since I had become a fan. I was very underwhelmed. I thought the title track was great, and that Story Told was a masterpiece but everything in between was kinda bland. I was so upset too because they were on this great rise. Unstoppable was in a commercial, they were moving away from how they started but I thought getting buzz and a following and doing it all right. Then Gonzo came out, for free, basically as a live in the studio thing, and regardless of whether it was good or not I said then "well they just squandered everything they had been building these last few years." Maybe it wasn't a mistake, but I knew that album good or bad relegated them to being less of a "thing" than I thought they were becoming. I didn't love that record so I skipped the tour but they were coming back a year later. I realized I had to go and bought tickets finally the week of the show after wrestling back and forth. Literally 3 hours later, they broke up. I was devastated. Listening back to them over the last couple days, and after having seen that band, I just miss them so much. That band was an unstoppable force, Eric is a freak to behold and such a talented frontman which is so hard to find these days. And on top of all of that the songs were fantastic. I know they'll come back one day cause they're just too young not to, but I really thought they were going places. I've never heard the Flamingo album after all these years as I don't think its my style. Maybe I should seek it out. Anyway, just wanted to ramble. Hadn't been in a Foxy mode in awhile and get so overjoyed by their music and sad that it'll never blow up the way I thought it was going to. Short ride but made a very lasting impression on me.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Is this the worst cast in decades?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-07-22 15:34:14</DATE>
    <TEXT>I should start off by saying I don't not like any of them. But looking at the list and binging on old clips I realize all these people have been here for quite awhile and as a cast they've been fairly unremarkable. The only true star is Kate and this has to be her last season. All the featured players are rather forgettable. All the star men (Mikey, Alex, Beck) aren't anything special at all (Beck is only the best man on the cast by default, its not impressive) and the women are all fine but have been unable to break out the way Kate has. Aidy and Cecily have been on for what, 5 years or so and don't appear to be going anywhere once the show ends. At least not in the same way Maya Rudolph or Amy Poehler did. Even the way Rachel Dratch and Ana Gasteyer did. And Leslie Jones, I'm sorry, is just a terrible sketch performer and I don't get the appeal. I'm sure none of this is terrible new, but in general this cast has been here for awhile and have done very little of note. I think its the most unremarkable cast in recent memory. The last groups went on to enormous fame, when I thought many of them might not: -Hader, Wiig, Sukedis, Samberg, Armisen, Forte, Meyers all are doing huge stuff -Cast of Fey, Poehler, Rudolph, Fallon, Parnell, Tracy doing great -Will Ferrell is the biggest of his cast but Oteri, Kattan, Hammond, Molly Shannon were all great on the show and made a lasting impression this cast hasn't. -Sandler, Spade, Farley, Norm, Rock era -Myers, Carvey, Jan Hooks, Nealon, Lovitz era. Besides that small blip in the mid 90s, this is the most unimpressive cast since the show basically rebooted in the late 80s. And unlike the blip in the 90s, this dip has been several years long. I'm not saying the show isn't good and I'm not saying these cast members aren't talented, but no one has had breakout star quality and seem to have a future career past this show. Even guys I thought like Forte or Armisen might go nowhere have done huge things. Clearly they just had more drive. I feel like this cast has been resting on a lot of sketches but as a group are fairly unremarkable. People only stand out because frankly, its just a bad cast. And props to Lorne, the last cast is hard to follow and he hadn't had to do a major overhaul in awhile. But I feel the one for the last 5 years is the weakest in 30 years.</TEXT>

Between E, HowardTV, and now the app there's been a visual component for at least 20 years at this point. Were there things that didn't translate? IE. Artie's fight with Teddy, which takes on a whole new meaning when you see the visual. I'm listening to Ronnie the robot stuff and realizing its good but its also more a visual bit than anything else. Has there been any time where you're like "this would make for a better TV show than a radio show?" Any time's that it was truly impossible to understand or appreciate just by listening?</TEXT>

And I promise this isn't meant to be a trash Beth post, but watching their therapy session after listening to his calls with Allison and seeing how he finally found that person that won't challenge him yet also have him wrapped around her finger. Allison was a partner, Beth was... I don't think she was a gold digger but she was just so submissive. She found a perfect situation and grabbed on. Howard screams at Allison for spending his money yet doesn't care at all about Beth buying way more expensive stuff. Her voice is essentially the exact opposite of Allison's. She's obviously conventionally very attractive so you can show that off. And listening to the therapy session, she doesn't object to anything. Its just both of them constantly trying to make the other happy, so that he can keep her and she reaps his benefits. I know its not a new observation or anything but it is so striking when you listen back to back: Howard got exactly the girl he always wanted and Beth plays it note perfect.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>So who wants to explain to an idiot like me the whole Billy West scenario?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-17 15:59:19</DATE>
    <TEXT>So I'm trying to piece this together, and I'm sure its been asked a million times, but just trying to figure out exactly went down. I'm reading conflicting (actually not conflicting) things that Billy hates the show and doesn't answer questions regarding Howard. He basically left and never looked back. Some say, himself included, that it was because of money. Others say it was other things. So then I'm surprised listening to the Howard History (that JimFixx brilliantly uploaded) Why Billy Left and Billy is participating in it. I would think he'd want nothing to do with the show. Then it says on wiki that they also had a retrospective about Billy's work on the show at some point, and the first time Billy was involved since leaving. So I wonder why that happened and why they'd do that? Are they trying to erase him or do they recognize his importance? Does Howard only not shit talk him like he does John because Billy actually became super successful? And why is there still a feud that Billy has never been back and Howard never mentions him? And then finally, where does this whole John K and Billy thing come into play. I'm listening to the interview where Howard "ambushes" Billy with John K after they had a huge falling out. Some say that was Billy's last straw that Howard was such a dick to bring him in. Why DID Howard do that and how truly awkward was that between those two? Was that literally a betrayal to Billy or just awkward?</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Watching Ellen's special made me really want Eddie Murphy to come back</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-12-19 18:54:59</DATE>
    <TEXT>Not a groundbreaking thought, and one he's threatened for many years, but seeing her finally come back made me really wish he would. Listen, I'm not saying I liked her special, I really didn't. There were a few good lines but overall it didn't have the spark most great comedy has. BUT, and I think its important, she is still a comic and there is something in her and in her delivery and how she interacted (especially during the bonus audience questions) that is so inherently funny and quick and witty that I'm glad she's at least not wasting it. Sucks that its not that good IMO but I'd rather her try and fail than not at all. And I applaud her going back. Thats difficult and takes time and commitment and she did that so I give her props there. Just really made me long for Eddie. He's that one guy that really disappeared from comedy that was SOOOOO good at stand up. Delirious to this day is still one of the funniest things ever. I'm sure it wouldn't be incredible. How could it with his expectations and the world being as PC as it is? He's up against a lot. But I'd love see him up there trying. I don't know if the "I'm a rich person, here's what I've been up to" route that Ellen and other comics have would turn out better than their mediocre efforts but I'd love to see him try. Cause its not like he's not a funny guy anymore, and its a shame to see that bottled away. I think in the end it would just be too much effort, but overall it was what I was thinking about a lot during his special that I applaud that she came back and wish Eddie had the power to do the same and stopped empty threatening it. And that maybe her doing it will push him. That would be so huge to see him have a Netflix thing.</TEXT>

Its nice to just unwind and watch some of his old stuff and just be entertained. Despite that I'm upset with the kind of person we found out he was, I don't forget the genius he is and just how awesome he truly was, and probably will be in the future. He has such a unique take and delivery on all his stuff and it really was so cool to see him go through the ranks to get to the point he finally did. He definitely deserved it. It felt like the little guy finally winning, even if he hadn't really been a little guy in the comedy scene for awhile. It was just nice to see the mainstream recognize it. Anyway its starting to sound like a eulogy. I'm happy he's still here and I don't want to hate the guy. I think that gets forgotten in a lot of this back and forth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>John Mulaney and Pete Davidson just announced a second show at the Bergen PAC in Englewood, NJ. Because Ticketmaster is a ridiculous system, I bought tickets then looked again and found better seats. So of course I bought those too and will just return the others. But assuming this show sells out, would anyone want these tickets? I'm planning to call Ticketmaster tonight or tomorrow just cause you're supposed to deal with this ASAP to actually get the refund, but with the speed these have sold out I'd gladly sell them to someone here instead. Don't want them to go to waste, just didn't want to get stuck with two. Obviously face value, not trying to scam anyone. But yeah, if you're interested, let me know and PM me. Otherwise I'll just have Ticketmaster refund me. I'm looking forward to 2 hours of Mule jokes from them.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I tried to cancel my moviepass last month and apparently it did not go through. I am still being charged and I need to yell at someone. Is 1-646-400-0801 the main number to call? Will someone actually answer? I have a decent amount of time in the car coming up today so I don't mind waiting and sitting on the phone but I want a number that actually works. And if this number doesn't work, what would people's methods for actually canceling my service and getting a refund for this past month be? App? Email? I just want to be over with Moviepass once and for all. I'm typically good with customer service people, but I hear this could be a new level of bad. EDIT: current status is I finally got through today after many hours of calling and being told it was too busy. Finally spoke to someone who I basically tried to pummel cause I'm not even pretending to give a shit about them. I said I was charged and I want a refund, as well as other compensation just to ruin them but the refund is priority. She very quickly said it was escalated, sent me an email confirming it, and said I needed to send her proof of my credit card statement that I was indeed charged. I did and need to wait to hear back. So far, while I screamed at her, they seem to be following through and it seems hopeful. Its $10, its not really about that, its just about the principle. Don't treat your customers like dogshit, and I want to hear them say that. Hoping for the refund but all in all, its going surprisingly smoothly so far. I do genuinely appreciate all the helpful advice.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I love Benjy, and haven't really questioned most of his stuff on the show, but reliving the $800 bottle of wine incident, and the subsequent private plane incident they discussed, as well as Benjy being in that studio for so long, how did he manage to fuck all that up? I know we talk all the time about Artie having the golden life there and just needing to be able to control himself in order to enjoy it, but seriously, Benjy had it MADE and pissed most of what could have been an interesting relationship with Howard down the drain. Is it really all because he's perpetually late? Is it just on the air fodder for Howard and never really genuine? Seems Benjy was given every opportunity in the world to become one of the most successful "man behind the curtain" types and he squandered them just by being incompetent. I mean, he was IN that room with Fred, Howard and Robin, even after they all hated almost everything he'd say. Yet he was still there. How exactly did he screw that up?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Sorry if this sounds harsh and I genuinely hope it doesn't get a million downvotes even though I wouldn't be surprised, but last night was dogshit. And Emma was totally game, but there was no material for her. Its a combo of a lot, the writing is really really terrible right now, and the performers just aren't really doing anything great. A lot of the characters have worn out their welcome or are just all the same (Heidi, who I like and really have high hopes for, but seriously every character is the same one note), and these performers just can't elevate decent sketches. Last night was such a far cry from Sandler last week and it showed for a multitude of reasons. Sandler heightened bad sketches, and the old guys he brought back were a noticeable improvement over today's quality. I genuinely think they need to let a good amount of these older cast members go and try to beef up or replace the new ones. And god damn, do something about the writing. I'm sorry, this feels super harsh but I'm a huge SNL fan. In my lifetime, this is easily the blandest its been. Genuinely don't think its been this disappointing week to week since like 96 or so. Genuinely not trying to pick fights, would gladly have a discussion about this, but seriously I think they need to do something this hiatus.</TEXT>

Mick fucking Jagger there to play you off with She's A Rainbow and Ruby Tuesday, each member of the cast getting to dance with her which was the sweetest thing ever (Sudekis in tears always gets me), Lorne coming up to say goodbye as well. I guess there's no place to ever really showcase this in a retrospective, but to me this is one of the top moments of the show, and absolutely the best goodbye they ever did. And Kristen so deserved it too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Excellent show. I knew it would be fun, and it was EXACTLY what I expected, which was totally fine and a really big thrill. People have never really given Lonely Island enough credit. Their albums are great, and while the shorts are legendary, its so commonplace that people do sometimes forget how truly revolutionary that stuff was. Was cool to experience it with other fans. Highlights were definitely the Bash Brothers, We're On Stage (with Seth Meyers introducing them), I'm So Humble, Finest Girl, Lazy Sunday with Chris! Reba with Kenan! So much amazing stuff. Did I have criticisms? Sure. For nearly $100 tickets, an 80 minute show seemed A LITTLE short. Also, as a major fan, it sucked that it was mostly digital short and hit based. Its what I assumed, but I love their deep cuts. Stuff like Japan, Rocky, Perfect Saturday, so many others would be amazing to hear and are vastly underrated. I also think it would have made the show less solely based on watching music videos, which admittedly it became a lot of the time. Also, while it makes sense, it was super focused on Andy like way more than I thought. So many songs are just totally him, and I know he's front and center but I think stuff like Ras Trent and other stuff where he's the only one could be cut at the expense of group pieces. But again, I loved the night. Thats if I'm nitpicking. It was a fantastic night and anyone thats a fan should go. So happy to get that.</TEXT>

I could listen to him go on and on about how to "save" this show he's basically ruining. Also, selfishly, it crushes me that the questions segment isn't included so we could finally hear the iconic Baba Booey moment of "is Marci my boss?" But hey, what we have already is an embarrassment of riches. I could seriously listen to him frantically fix this show for hours.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Summit Meeting makes Howard's kiss assing even more hilarious</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-09 14:32:48</DATE>
    <TEXT>Just thought about it while watching the address he gave. I'm a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, so as a fan its been hysterical to hear him kissing his ass SO much in the last few years, practically begging to have him on. And Bruce just, rightly or wrongly, doesn't budge. Even funnier when you factor in this video. Its like yeah, you understood that he wanted it already, but with this video you see 6 years ago he was already like "we have to inundate them. We need to be on them like white on rice." To me, it means that Howard's so pathetic that THAT plan didn't even work for some so he had to resort of openly campaigning for them on the air, something he'd make fun of any other guy for and something 15 years ago he claimed he'd never do. "If they don't want to be in here, we won't seek them out." It used to be they should be honored to come on the Howard Stern Show. Now they'll move heaven and earth to get it done. In addition it makes stuff like the Madonna move to the afternoon even more embarrassing which I didn't think was possible. He honestly might as well just have a podcast and go to their homes at this point. Just hilarious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all the negative talk about Stern here recently (always, but with the leak even moreso), which I love, I was just listening to some old stuff and hearing before his move to Sirius. He doesn't wish anyone ill on terrestrial, he just hopes eventually everyone will come to Sirius. And it just is so interesting to think now that that IS the case how much Howard is responsible for that. Piece of shit guy, sure, but he took a risk going there and ended up being a pioneer because of it. They really do owe him a huge debt. I don't know, I just thought its funny listening to how it all went exactly as he thought. And he can sound confident then but he didn't know. Its just a fascinating listen.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Surprised so many are saying Kim Goldman is the interview of the year</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-07-19 23:53:05</DATE>
    <TEXT>I know most here hate most of the interviews (I actually don't mind them), but I'm surprised the one thats resonated with people has been Kim Goldman. Nothing against her, but she doesn't really have much to say. Most of it is hypothetical "if she ever spoke to OJ" stuff or her thoughts about that trial which seem embellished. I know Cochran was a huge fucking scumbag, but I don't really think he turned to the Goldman's and said "gotcha". That sounds like something you can say now because no one can refute it and just makes them look worse than we already knew they were. And Howard here is pretty pathetic talking about how he'd probably kill him if he was ever with him, and how physically upset it made him. THIS is the Howard you thought did a really good job? I thought something like Sammy Hagar a few months ago was way better than this. I don't consider this like the guy who killed Bin Laden or a few other not so big names that have a good story. What am I missing that you all liked about it? He's done way better. I thought he was way better with Joe Namath the other week, and Howard knows shit about football.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm asking totally legitimately and honestly. I'll start off by saying I'm not a fan of this guy, or more appropriately I have no idea who he is and don't care. I just learned about him 30 minutes ago. What I don't understand is our current culture, where a few people on Twitter seem to go on a fact finding mission to take people down. Like WHY do you care that much?! Do people not have better things to do during the day? I couldn't care less if this guy joins the cast or now doesn't, but I just don't get people online who just sit there looking for shit on others. It seems so weird to me. I also truly don't get how people really do get so offended by stuff certain people say online. I understand thinking he's an asshole, or ignoring him, but why does everyone have to make a public opinion about anything. Like, who cares? Someone isn't for you, move on. I don't see why everyone has to take everyone down these days. No one is perfect. Didn't people have to do this for Melissa or something else when they joined? They like scoured their twitter and old tweets. Like, why?!!! Who even thinks to do that, why do you care, and what does it matter? If they're as bad as you think, we'll know immediately. Sorry, I just don't understand it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its not that he was funny. From everything I've seen, he really wasn't. Thats not what guys like Norm and Rob Schneider and a lot of other comedians are getting on about. Its about the fact that the show is super hard to get. That is what they sympathize with. And to have it snatched away, whether rightly or wrongly, but any rando on the internet feels wrong. Like, I get that SNL should have done better background checks, but if they didn't thats on them. The guy got the show fairly. Whether he would have succeeded or not, who knows? But there really is a movement that seems slightly dangerous and limiting that you can get everything taken away for saying something dumb. Can we not just have fun anymore? I get it, what he said was racist and bad and not fun, but we all make mistakes. I'm not siding with the guy, I have truly no involvement with the guy and couldn't really care less if he's on the show or not. But its the idea that everything you say is now under a microscope and thats yknow, not exactly what comedy is supposed to be. You'd think people at SNL and fans of the show would know that. If you don't let Eddie Murphy do his homo stuff in Delirious, would he be where he is now? (again, funny is just funny). I obviously expect the typical "what he did was different", "another rebel just trying to fight for the other side", "You don't understand racism" responses, and I haven't liked Shane's apologies, but I also have to say, I don't disagree with him on the "if you were really offended part". There are a lot of people that just like to take people down, and either say something because they think its what you're supposed to say these days, or people that pretend to be outraged. Thats not false at all. But whatever, guy's gone. We'll move on. But it was SNL's fault for not catching it sooner. If you gave him the show, you shouldn't yank it away.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-09-21 21:50:20</DATE>
    <TEXT>I'm not anti-New Blink. I'm a little disappointed in the direction Mark has gone. I feel he's just really sold out and feels the brand needs to be a certain way to still have mass appeal, instead of leading it with integrity and the spirit the band used to have. Having said that, I totally get WHY he's doing it and I don't begrudge him. We all gotta make a living and at this stage in life, this makes the most sense if you're gonna be Blink and still want to be a "new". As for this album though, I'm not sure what they were thinking. I mean, actually I think I do: we need to play stuff that sounds reminiscent of our old stuff while also inexplicably singing songs about tweens when we're 45. First song? Its literally just Feeling This lite. Second song intro? Its just Stay Together For The Kids. Blame It On My Youth is just Man Overboard. The reminiscent stuff just comes off sounding lazy, like they don't have anything left to offer. Please let me know what I'm missing here, I'm sorry I'm just not seeing it. I didn't love California, but by comparison it seems like a masterpiece to me. At least I got what they were going for with that, and I thought it sounded Lite but that it still sounded like Blink. This I just don't even think sounds like them. And not that you can't change over time or that I need it to sound similar, but I just don't get the direction at all. I'm shocked by the reviews I'm reading comparing to Self Titled.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Getting a new phone: Pixel 1, Pixel 3 or Pixel 3a?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2019-09-26 14:58:37</DATE>
    <TEXT>Hi guys, (USA) Got a new phone a couple months ago and wanted a Pixel. To my surprise, the guy was pushing the Pixel 1 instead of the Pixel 3 or Pixel 3a which had just come out when I went there. Obviously, I was surprised cause you don't usually go back buying old phones, but he was convincing. Pixel 1 was built to last longer, the new models don't have headphone jacks and are slimmer but because of the slimness some of the resistance the first one had has gone away. He said its still his best seller and he doesn't like the new ones. Bought it, went home and of course everyone laughed at me for buying an old phone. Figured he was just pushing out stock. I checked online and it looks like the 3 and 3a get good reviews so its really just this guy. Long story short, phone now won't vibrate so I need a replacement anyway. The guy said he could just give me a 3 if thats what I wanted and I'm having second thoughts. What should I do? Stick with the 1? Is he right that its way better? Is he just trying to fleece me? I'm happy to have the choice but honestly just want whatever is a good phone (it doesn't have to be the newest model) and it looks like everywhere online the new phones get good reviews so its hard to tell.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2019-10-08 04:04:32</DATE>
    <TEXT>1. I'm right there with everyone on this board that the show is a far cry from what it used to be, but it is Grade A laughable that you all fuckin hate it then are legit mad that he started early and you missed the beginning. Again, I'm on your side, but god damn is that something Howard should see and laugh at. Its basically the definition of a sucker. It makes all his stupid shit look fairly pedestrian. 2. Say what you want about his interviewing and who he could book, he got some big names today, and thats just day 1. Again, I'm NOT on his side in wanting him to move to Hollywood and just do an Ellen type talk show. But I gotta give it to him and Gary and the show that he talks a big game but when he wants Howard certainly can deliver. Its not really the delivery I'd prefer (cause I like the show and not celebrities) but come on. Its a pretty good power move on his part that he's not all talk. He IS friends with these people and at the end of the day he can legit say "I got Aniston on the show" which is a big get. So not for nothing, but for day 1, if this is the kind of show you want, he crushed it and put his money where his mouth is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know this is old news, but listening to some stuff today where he's trashing Aniston and Ellen, and its truly mind boggling to see where he is now. I knew he'd shit on them, and I remember it, but seeing last week and then actually hearing those old things its just shocking. Moreso that they forgave and ever wanted anything to do with him now. Let alone how fucking awkward he must feel meeting them and KNOWING they've heard what he's said about them. But seriously, his RELENTLESS crapping on Ellen about the animal stuff, and American Idol. I remembered him saying the stuff about her dancing, but I forgot that Ellen was on record as saying she'd have left Idol if he joined. I'd forgotten how truly personal and deep it was. And then hearing stuff with Aniston where he's saying "at a certain point its definitely HER fault that she can't keep a man" and that "if given the chance, she seems like the kinda girl that would balloon up to 200 pounds." And this is from 10 years ago or less. Its not like this is early 90s and he's no one. Its just truly crazy to hear that stuff then see him on vacation with Aniston and kissing Ellen on her show. This thing I'm listening to with Ellen he's talking about how she ran a dog shelter out of business. He paints her horribly. Now she's like "I was showing George Bush your paintings." Hollywood is fuckin insane.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Today sounded like the first glimpse of semi-classic Howard where you wanted to keep listening. My reaction to that is: that seems fishy lol. They never seem to be able to come up with anything compelling, and now all of a sudden this falls right into their lap? I've been on Shuli's side for most of this, and I hate Shuli. But its seemed like Brent talks a big game, but in the end is an ogre that can't get anyone to have sex with him. Now we have this and I guess it begs the question are they staging all of us this just to get us talking? I'm just having trouble with a lot of aspects of it. That this crew, even accidentally, is capable of creating something truly worth listening to. I'm having trouble with why Robin was SO pissed and on fire. It seemed like every person had a role that they were meant to play. Something seemed off. Maybe thats paranoia, I have no idea. I'd like to believe its real. But so much of this show is scripted now, its not unbelievable to think this might be too. The woman on the phone sounded wishy washy about the whole thing too. I don't know, it seems like the subreddit unanimously liked it, which I did as well. Does everyone think its real, or just something they've been brewing for a while now with Shuli accusing Brent and everything else. It does seem like a slow burn you could cook up in a writing meeting when it seems like there's no evidence they do any other work on this piece of shit show.</TEXT>

Thats an insult to the idiots asking those questions, not mentally challenged people for asking them. If it was mentally challenged people, the questions would make sense and I don't believe they'd deserve ridicule. Listen, I'll gladly keep going back and forth with you on this (you can keep trying to trip me up and I can keep knockin' them out like I'm Barry Bonds on a steroid binge), but as I see it we probably just won't see eye to eye on this and its probably better to just drop it. I'm not seeking out your posts because I'm not obsessed with you. Obviously you feel the other way and I'm flattered, truly truly flattered, but someone has already claimed this mess of a human that I am so I'm not on the prowl. But if I'm back on the market I'll make sure to circle back. But I'm really not sure what you're trying to defend here. I guess you thought the questions were fine and I think they're dumb. Ok. But they're really not good enough that you should go this hard on them. They really did suck.</TEXT>

But I don't think people here voted for him, although I also think they probably just didn't vote cause I don't see them being Hillary people.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>A year ago I thought he had to be leaving. I was positive he was leaving. I just didn't think he had anything left in the tank and they were out of ideas here. Now? I'm positive he's resigning. I'm positive THIS is the last time. For a number of reasons. The book was something he didn't have to do, but did, so he's still trying to change his legacy. He'd love 5 more years at that. He's still chasing those celebrities and I'd argue he's as close to that as he's ever been. That LA thing was something (not good or bad, but just such a light into what he wants) and I think he's so close, he's not gonna end it now. If anything, saying "this is it" will be used as the tagline for celebrities now. The push will be harder than it ever has been. He can live on that for 5 more years. Maybe its 3 more years? But he's certainly gonna be there for at least another 2 and he's just gonna use this next contract as a total celebrity whore hog. He's gonna milk the last of this out. Mainly because I think a year isn't long enough for him to milk the end of this show. Thats something they'll drag for a real long time and if it hasn't started yet, it means he ain't even close to being done.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thats weird, I feel like they are very well respected and were at the time. Again, its not meant to shit on this current cast, but there was a spark then that isn't just in retrospect. It was there when they were. They always knew what they had in Kristen. I feel like we all knew Bill was an asset. Andy reinvented the game with digital shorts. Sudekis and Forte fit in perfectly, as did Armisen. There really wasn't a weak link, and it sustained for many years. I didn't see the kind of success they had post SNL. Didn't see Brooklyn 99 for Andy, fuckin Barry for Bill, I couldn't imagine Armisen or Forte's humor translating after the show. But they all did. They all made it work. And I feel they were certainly respected at the time. I thought they'd go more the way of the last cast with Kattan and Oteri and others: worked for the show, respected as performers there, but this might be there big break. Again, just don't really see that with any of the people on the show now or the last 10 years kinda.</TEXT>

There's something about her that makes her out of many men's league but also very clearly not a Kate Upton or something. Which to someone like Beth is basically calling them ugly. There's a reason she only got as far as she did without Howard. She's hotter than your average woman in most of the departments but if she claims to be one of the hottest women alive, which is her profession, then she's really far down the list.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Gary has always been like that. Honestly, as he's gotten older, its something I love and hate. Sometimes, he's so on the money and he's so pompous that he just commits to everything. So when he's right, I think he's SO right. Then when he's wrong, he's earth shatteringly wrong. I used to think he didn't mean anything malicious by it, he was just super hard headed. Then I realized he's super vindictive and longing for revenge on people and just likes to throw his ego around. And listen, he's Baba Booey. If anyone's earned it, its him. He's an asshole that pretends like he's not, but of the people like that I think he's still fairly grounded and carries himself well. I don't begrudge him at all. There's times when I wince at how incorrect he is, but largely, I just think of it as a man who's paid his dues and he just gets to be the big dick man now. But I'd never want him to change. Cause when he's wrong he's spectacularly wrong, and its there for our amusement. And to give him credit, he usually takes it like a fucking champ.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, I have no idea about his mental health. I like the guy. I think his weekend update stuff is usually great. I've seen him do stand up and I think its a step below, because I genuinely just don't think he really seems to try. Which is unfortunate, as I hoped Mulaney would rub off on him, the best in the game. But that seems to be his life, he's just drifting. I guess he's kept on because he's still in the headlines because its good for the show? Or no one at the show cares? I don't believe ANYONE else would be allowed this sort of leash. I know guys like Mike Myers and stuff used to take time off for movies, but this is totally different. He's barely in the show even if he's NOT doing Suicide Squad filming. And then when he's there, he's coasting through. Its poor work ethic and even though I love him, I can't in any way defend his behavior. To me, his mental health seems fine. His life is going well. I feel like he doesn't want to be at SNL that much and hasn't for awhile so I just don't get why they keep him there. He should leave if he's not gonna be on the show. Its downright rude to the other cast members that Pete gets time as a tiny joke and Melissa can't even get on the show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The show is at a weird impasse where the old people I think have been on far too long and the new people don't get enough time. Its always been a revolving door, and obviously the old people are good and reliable, but it makes me think either they are hogging or the new people just aren't that good. Cause if there's a mass exit at the end of this season, it doesn't seem like the newer cast can really anchor the show, and this is the time they should be nurturing that transition. Instead, as good as they are, it seems to just be "have Kate do this, give Cecily that". Something, to me is not right with the cast, not at the moment but in the very near future. Pete's situation is utterly unique and its been too many years of asking him to do more. Clearly nothing is going to happen and this is the year where it just became "we tried to give him a chance. Now he should leave if he's not gonna be in sketches or good in the very few amount he's actually in."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Again, I think its absolutely possible to that the case is really Melissa, Chris, Ego, Heidi just actually aren't that good and thats why they don't get enough. Either they are too one note, or they don't step up enough like they should. I like to assume that ISN'T the case, with them or anyone on the show, because I like them and just I root for everyone in the cast usually. So I hope its a case of "they are getting overlooked" than "there's a reason they aren't used much." I like assume everyone is there for a reason and could be the next breakout. In the end, we don't really know. Its not fair to Melissa, who's been there for a WHILE, to just have to wait till the old guard leaves. Again, maybe it means we're giving her too much credit, but until they give me a reason NOT to trust her I'm gonna stick with she's being shafted. My thinking is this has to be the last season for so many: Pete, Kate, Aidy, Cecily, Beck, Kyle. Not sure if I'm missing anyone. They've all been there so long. So I think there's gonna be a major turnover this year. I feel like I've been saying that the last couple years now, but its almost getting nuts. Again, not that they're not good, but I feel like this many people haven't stayed past 7 years in a really long time.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Lol you're all a little off if you think Sirius really has a leg to stand on or is gonna put their foot down. I don't think the negotiations are what you think. They probably want to keep paying them the same, and Howard wants more. I don't think they are lowballing him. I adore shitting on Howard, but the bottom line is it WOULD be a huge blow to Sirius to lose him. He's two channels, he's his own option on their homepage website and when selling subscriptions like their all access. He generates ton of headlines, for dumb shit but still, that these celebrities come in and talk about. I'm sorry, I'd love him to be irrelevant but he's not. Sirius absolutely cares about the press they get from him, and if he's still on their main page as a draw its because its true. Sorry, but unfortunately Howard definitely has the upper hand here. He could leave OR retire "gracefully" at this age so he's really got nothing to lose. They'll cough up the money.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I agree with you, but I just mean no one gets paid less. And I'm sure they do have the true numbers, but they also let people sign up for whatever price they feel like. Clearly they either have enough income or don't care that much about many money related things. Again, I don't think they'd advertise Howard, which he is in all things Sirius, if they didn't think he was value. Because as you say, the show is a shell of what it once was. So they'd be justified in not advertising him and yet they still do. I think that means they can't afford to lose him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think those are all very good points. I actually agree with most of them. I don't feel the need TO defend them, but I guess how I've always seen them is: 1. When Susan says that to Ross, I don't see it as implying being gay is a bad thing, even though everything you say is absolutely right. I think it CAN be read that way, but I think the intention is to bring that issue to a larger audience. Ross is concerned, because of how Carol changed and he's now the one who feels left out. I get the argument of Ross being homophobic, but I almost every time I think its more that he's upset about change and he's upset about being left out. Which, as a white man, I'm hardly saying I have sympathy for him, but just saying that I don't think any of the perceived homophobic stuff is blatantly malicious which is why I just don't think its actually there. I think it can be read that way, but I also think its just using humor to show its just different, but they never say bad. I guess you could say thats a technicality, but I'm just saying thats how I've seen it. Ross is acting the way most fathers would, whether good or bad, the same way Kevin Hart and Tracy Morgan have had jokes that were in a similar capacity. But that neither are anti-gay, that the joke is just truly because its different than the antiquated "normal" system. They're pointing it out, in an effort to show its not actually wrong. 2. "Where are all the men?!" I just see as a funny line. Nothing more. Its like when Joey is arranging flowers and says "oh my god, I'm a woman!" Thats honestly just real life. Its not demeaning people that like that stuff. Its just, sometimes when you're a guy you act girly. Its not bad but I also get why people would make fun of it at times. If anything, just own it. 3. I do remember the A man Duh joke which I just remember as dumb, but not mean. Its more just bad sitcom writing than anything else. Its embarrassing for THAT, not cause its anti gay. The thing about the "MAN in the black dress" I totally think you're right and I think its the epitome of how people are just TOO sensitive now. I get it, I don't want anyone to feel left out, but its just a funny line and also has a hint of truth to it. I think someone like Caitlyn Jenner would understand if you said that line to her cause, yknow, we're all not blind. I've never quite understood why there's the argument that stuff is upsetting to others, yet we can never have the argument that maybe people are legitimately too sensitive about some things in this day and age. Sometimes funny is just funny. I assume the comeback to that would be "then if you're so funny, do it in a different way thats not offensive" which I'm sure could be done, but also if this works I don't see a problem. Again, I'm not trying to say there's no way I'm wrong. This is just how I've seen them, while also understanding that other side. I don't want to say the show is perfect but I still can't really find ANYTHING that I find indefensible, and usually the stuff pointed out is tame. Maybe I really just don't see it and am belittling this stuff but I'm really trying not to be. I genuinely feel the fact that they had David Crane at the helm is key to the argument too that its all just meant in good fun. If he weren't there, I feel I'd have less of a leg.</TEXT>

I don't know, the "I'm surprised this hack got on SNL" just seems so childish to me. I'm not saying you shouldn't report him maybe not being good, but I genuinely feel this is as preachy as the people that write articles about Louis JUST trying to cut him down and get support from the Twitter snowflakes. Like, why do the Louis fans also feel like they have to sink that low? Just sit back and watch him comeback and these other guys fail. I truly don't get it.</TEXT>

They seem either weak or like gay with their movements, I don't know how to describe it but you know what I mean. Its kind of effeminate and it also looks like they're always sort of dropping rather than having a grip or anything. What does that mean in the world of Artie Lange? That he's using?

    <TEXT>No, I'm aware he was back last season. But this is the first time he's been back since Woody. And Woody only did it cause he was hosting so it was something for him to do. Then they just kept having him, which seemed strange. 1. because he seems too big to keep doing it, 2. because does he live in NY? and 3. because Jason is an alum and plays that role oh so well. I see it differently than the Baldwin-Hammond (and even Killam) cause its a more minor role than the actual President. Hell, I think the whole system is fucked up because none of the cast plays the major candidates besides Kate which has never happened and makes no sense. You're fucked for the future, like you were with Trump (even though I get that that was a special case).</TEXT>

I DIDN'T expect him to keep coming back, but we are in a new era where there are resident celebrities who play people on the show now, over alums like Jason and Darrell. Jason was definitely brought in this time because Woody wasn't available, and I assume he didn't mind because he was going to meet Eddie fuckin Murphy this week. Think that definitely was a factor. I have no doubt in my mind Jason is second string and Woody will be back if he's available the next time Biden is used. Or, honestly, I'd think they don't use Biden in political sketches. He COULD be ignored in favor of Warren now, and Bernie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really shows how this was absolutely the end of some sort of era. It really hasn't quite been the same since he left. They need to find someone that cares about the show the way he does. He so effortlessly took this over from Tina Fey, and SNL has always been at its best when there's someone looking out for the show and giving it that final touch that it needs a lot of the time. Its a tireless, thankless job. I'm fully aware everyone that works there loves being there, that Lorne is fantastic, guys like Higgins and Shoemaker are looking over everything, but this slot that Seth held is incredibly important, Lorne's "right hand" kind of person and the show has been unmistakably different without it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>At this point I unfortunately feel you need to blow up the show and start over. You need a complete cast overhaul like you had in 86 and 96. We need a new cast, we need way better writers, and we need less celebrity cameos. That is what the show needs and are desperate and long overdue. Anything else that gets suggested I'd argue is just being picky. But my stuff would require way too much effort. But yeah, you need like 10 people on this cast to leave already, and do a new writer search cause these ones are tired.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed although also, he could date less famous people as well. He's already under the public eye and then he dates VERY famous people which make you double a target. Dating Ariana, making out with Kate Beckinsale at a basketball game. I get that love is love, I get that you wanna be a normal person and go out and shit, but he also just makes it so easy for tabloids. I don't think its good for his mental health and I just think he needs a break from everything. And I'd maybe question why he HAS to date someone famous? I don't assume its not real, but it almost seems like its a requirement for him now.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I genuinely don't think it'll be any different than Hulu. Hulu is indicative of the future. They might have more full seasons (they might not), but they'll be highly edited and I think for the most part they'll probably just keep having clips as they do now. For all things considered with NBC.com, they have a shit ton of the show. Its not complete, but they have more than you could really ask for. I don't expect Peacock to be what we've been waiting for in terms of SNL, I don't think anything ever will be at this point. The days of Comedy Central and VH1 airing things you don't normally see are LOOOOOONG gone.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its just worked too long that I can't see the schedule changing or needing to change. I think if you can't hack it, its not the right environment for you. If someone like SETH or TINA said it had to change, I'd believe em. But its just a stressful job, thats what it is. Thats what James Franco's documentary shows. It kills ya, and you can do something all week and its just not good enough. Its luck of the draw. But I think you become lenient with the schedule and the whole thing goes out the window. I think there's also two very big things that would come from that: its seen that if you give someone more time, they can do something like Tim Robinson's show. Thats great, but its 6 episodes and 15 minutes a pop. You'd get either the same or less content with a change in pace. And 2. a huge part of the show when it started was not archiving. Thats not what improv and sketch really is. Either it works or it doesn't. But back then they weren't thinking "will this be great 40 years from now?" Its does it work now and thats what SNL is. You give them more time and it changes the entire thought of the show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It probably would but again, it just wouldn't be the show. Too much overthinking would ruin a lot of what makes this show great. I genuinely believe stuff like Mister Robinson's Neighborhood comes out of short time and you need to get stuff on. Anything from any era. If you give them more time, the premise changes and arguably less funny. Its not meant to be stand up which is polished. Its meant to be "this is what you have. If you don't like it, maybe you'll like what we have next week." Its always been a crapshoot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah but they also know what they are getting into. And it also caused all of these writers and performers to do their best work. Its the nature of the show. You don't do it for a lifetime, but it works for the show. Anything more and it would truly be a vastly different program, and the writers and cast members know that too. They can criticize it all they want but they also can't argue with the results. Also, criticism is very different than regret. Clearly it didn't sour their thoughts of the job. So its obviously not THAT bad. Its just demanding. Tough, clearly many have done it and done it well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its the best with him because he grills everyone so its always fun to rag on that person then but the added bonus is how hypocritical he is. If he truly believed his own shit, it wouldn't be as funny. Its because he's completely changed who he is, with the added layer of BECOMING the people he used to trash, that makes it so sweet when there's a good way to rip him. That Pelican Brief is so amazing because he's so deadly serious and you watch it with so many emotions: mouth agape that its actually happening, riotous laughter at his insane it is, disappointment that someone I used to admire his stooped so low. Grilling him is the best because he's such a target in so many different ways.</TEXT>

If he just wasn't good at it or it really took him awhile to write bits, I'd think different. But the fact that he seems to naturally come up with these really great bits (I'm assuming with not that much work going into it) is the real crime here.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It says on Wikipedia that "Stern shot additional scenes for a censored version of the film prior to its premiere television broadcast on the USA Network in 1999." I've never seen those, on TV or online. I'm sure they're nothing special, but just curious what they were and look like. I feel like I read once that its current him coming on screen and pointing things out with like a magic marker, but maybe I'm totally wrong. I've seen the movie a ton of times so it'd be interesting to see them with some new scenes.</TEXT>

I think its simply he's not a BIG enough audience anymore to warrant getting up early and traveling to NY for. If you're in NY, you might as well just do Fallon or Colbert which is later and garners you more viewers, and is safer. I don't know these podcasts that are consistently getting A listers. They all have their niche, but I don't think they've boxed out Howard. Howard has screwed himself with his reputation, being in NY, and being early in the morning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Not quite sure what this has to do with Pootie Tang on Wikipedia. I'm still stumped there. Yes, its an interesting thought, although I think any reference to Pootie Tang doesn't really apply here. Cause you're saying do something like that but thats a comedy. If you mean the writing and directing aspect, I mean yeah, but thats not specific to Pootie Tang either. Thats everything he's done for the last 15 years. Also, unfortunately, if you mean it as a way to AVOID detractors, I don't see that happening. I get your line of thinking that its not comedy so there'll be less to pick apart, but I think people will just argue he's now trying to "reinvent" himself and not want him to do that. I think the bottom line is he's gonna get skewered for whatever he does next, be it comedy or something else. And I don't think thats undeserved. I don't think its necessarily fair, but he did a stupid thing or had a stupid kink, however you want to justify it, and he should eat some shit for it for a little while. At a certain point, yes I think it will become too much, as it has now, but only in how its categorized. I still think on whatever he decides to promote next, thats a fair topic to tackle. After then, I think its been asked and answered and he should be left alone about. But I don't think a career change or genre change will affect how he's portrayed when he returns. He's gonna be screwed, thats just how it is. He obviously has the talent to do what Jordan Peele did, he's shown that through all his work in the last 15 years. He's very prolific and very multi talented and he wouldn't have to make a "Get Out" for that to be evident.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Us was not nearly as good. Cinematically it looked better (and Get Out already looked really good) but storywise once you got the other people cornering them at the house there was really nowhere else to go. That was a GREAT 45 minute lead up to there, but then you're there and the movie takes a different tone that either you're on board with or you're not. But I thought Get Out, throughout, was far more entertaining and satisfying. This felt like he tried to tackle too many things. Get Out really was as good as the hype. As for him pulling that off in his freshman effort, I get what you're saying but also he's been in the business for like 20 years at this point, working with many important people and learning. Dude co-ran his show the last 10 years, AND did his Keanu movie which wasn't great but I understand where he got all the experience that out the gate, when he was ready, he did something as good as Get Out. I was not surprised at how well done it was, I was super thrilled and refreshed to see an original idea.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I think you're right on a lot of that but I just assume there's some in between there. I'll concede you're probably right on most of that, but say Hugh Jackman: so Hugh Jackman comes in presumably because its a bad movie and it was. He doesn't come in when its Wolverine, he comes in when its a shit movie. Why even go on at all? If his agent doesn't think Howard will get asses in the seat for a good movie, so they book him on Fallon, Colbert, Kimmel, etc, why even trod him out for a shit one like The Front Runner? Just because he HAS to promote somewhere? I'm genuinely asking. Cause we've all seen that the BIG people come in only when its shit, and Howard gets the "coup" (even though it isn't cause its really desperation on the guest's part) but I'm genuinely curious why they even promote at all? For the crap stuff what is Stern's appeal moreso than good stuff (again, is it just because contractually they have to go SOMEWHERE?) and why wouldn't they go on Fallon instead and peddle the crap there? Their A list names alone would get them on that show</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its been 20 years since his last hosting. I'd love to see him back and I'm sure I'm not alone. Came to me while looking at the list of cast members who have hosted and how many times, and the only one over two times who hasn't hosted in the last decade is Bill (well, besides Chevy, but let's be honest none of us WANT to see him and also he appears on the show at least semi-frequently that I'm not as antsy for it). I know Bill respects his place in SNL history and what it did for him but is largely over that time, and I'm happy he showed up to their TV Hall Of Fame induction, as well as doing that little bit in the SNL 40th, but god I'd love to see him host the show one more time. He's always been great when he shows up, and he's still so active with so many movies that he'd certainly have something to promote!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Fair. Although I'd guess I'd think, for the guest, since Howard still has the "dangerous/anything goes" kind of monkier, whether they'd think its more risk than reward. I'm sure these days, and we've heard specific stories, of things that agents explicitly tell Stern not to bring up that he now listens to, but even so does an Eddie Murphy or someone wanna risk that Howard might bring up his tranny thing rather than just let the film bomb if its already bombing. I never know. I'm the idiot that thought Hugh gave a good interview and they got me interested in that Front Runner movie which was then really really terrible. Thats when it sealed it for me that I was like "oh, the A listers really do only go on when its an awful film."</TEXT>

From Will Ferrell's start to Bill Hader/Sudekis/Samberg's exit, SNL was pretty god damn unstoppable. Today pales in comparison to what it was, and while I don't blame the cast for not being as talented as the super talented people before them, it doesn't seem unfair to say they just aren't as good as past casts.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm losing sight of what you're arguing, and frankly I don't care. The bottom line is with most Louie people, they think he did NOTHING and they get angry when you accuse him of ANYTHING. Cause its usually putting him in the Weinstein/Cosby camp. Agreed, the Weinstein/Cosby comparisons are wrong. But to say he did nothing is misleading. So when someone says ANYTHING, you flip about it. The same way other people flip when LOUIE does anything. So what I'm saying and showing you is you're both the same. This guy doesn't need to blast Louie, but he has a right to. You and others shouldn't be offended by what people say about Louie (because he's fine, he doesn't need your support) but you have a right to be. The bottom line is everyone should just shut the fuck up about everyone. People here shouldn't post about every retard that goes after Louis, and all the retards out there should just stop going after Louie. He's gonna come back and be a major touring act regardless of what those people think. So you could either accept it, or get your panties in a bunch about nothing, but its gonna happen either way. So they can stop trying to bring him down and you can stop feeling compelled to fight his battles and defend him. He doesn't need anybody.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First of all, he didn't really own up to it but ok. Second point: eh, he's rounding. And these are the 5 or 6 cases we're aware of. It may have been more. Its not like he said 50, he said 10. I get it, if it were to jump to 15 or 20 or 30, I'd say there's legit concern there. And when it jumps from that point, I think its the time to speak up and clarify. But if you're gonna argue 6 vs. 10, that seems silly. Its not like it was ONE incident that he's now saying there's 5 accounts of. There's some people that went on record. I assume he's referring to someone that didn't, which would make it more than 6, and I don't automatically believe the person he knows is just talking out of their ass. Third point: Disagree. Its gonna blow over. You're overreacting. This isn't like Trump becoming President where people didn't take it seriously. This is something people have stopped thinking about for the most part and the less you say at this point, the better. Fourth point: yeah, there DOES have to be a more nuanced discussion and I at least appreciate that you're acknowledge that hasn't always been happening. Cause many here do. But I don't think in THIS case, anything was really overexaggerated. Its not saying he raped anyone, which is changing the facts. Its an inflation of a number that probably isn't even inflated. Its just not enough to get bent out of shape with, IMO, but obviously you're allowed your opinion and voice and there's nothing that says I'm definitively right. I'd have a discussion about it but just saying you gotta find the goal posts first.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is his first "tour" of major cities since everything's gone down, yes. He's played smaller clubs in the US with short time windows. They were more impromptu. These are his first larger scale shows in major cities. I don't personally expect protesting. He's not playing NY or LA. He's playing NJ, and he's not even playing convenient NJ. So if protestors show there, maybe it truly means he DID do something wrong. Cause there's no reason for them to come all the way out there just to protest. As for ticket sales, seems like they're fine. Maybe not sold out, but its also not really highly publicized in any way. I'm sure they will be by the dates of the shows. By the way I'm seeing this tour, he's basically fully back, just in smaller markets. But not dealing with cancellations, not dealing with protesting anymore. He's just not playing the biggest markets he could. Yet.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Pisses me off too but unfortunately it seems like its not gonna change. I don't even need him to apologize for what he did, I'd like him to apologize for lying to fans for so long. It was out there, whether his sycophants want to believe it or not, and he rarely answered it, and when he outright did he said it wasn't true. And I believed him. As a fan, I'm sad he lied to me. He clearly has no intention to apologize for that, but if anyone could put it in a better, funny, and meaningful context, its him. I'm hoping he does on his next special. It seems like something he'd do. But yeah, I'm annoyed as a fan he's just let it sit there since it happened, instead of facing it head on and trying to clear it up. At times, I see why he doesn't, but if he truly went and tried to clear it up I think it would all blow over way sooner than dealing with all this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>However you have to spin it for yourself. Thats fine, everyone has different levels. "Must have been referring to the 'no consent' part". Ok, we can say that now, but there's no reason he couldn't have said that then. Again, rumors were rampant, and the rumors were never a bullying thing. The rumors were "he makes some female comics uncomfortable with his behavior." He never wanted to answer to that, whether it was consensual or not, so now I guess we have to go with "well he didn't know HOW to answer it cause it was already misconstrued!" Alright, whatever you have to tell yourself. He knew it, we all did, and now some feel like they have to twist it for their own gain, his fans twisting it positive and his detractors and the media twisting it negative. They're both wrong. Also, the idea that he wasn't bullying them. I'll give him (I don't believe it cause he's too smart, but sure, maybe) that maybe he didn't know how powerful they saw him, but they claim they felt trapped and I believe that. I believe the woman who accused Aziz felt the way she did, cause when you're with a powerful person I can understand how you feel powerless. It makes perfect sense. The difference was theirs was a date, so everything Aziz was doing wasn't as strange. Louis was doing it in clubs, at festivals, at work, over the phone. It still wasn't right, and to discredit the women who felt that way seems unfair. Lastly, the argument that "well his material has always been this so its not a surprise!" Yeah, I think you mean it positively, but in any other situation it would be negative. A comedian does something racist and people say "well his material was always race based." Ok, but so either way dude is a racist. So ok, either way, Louis is a pervert. Thats fine, but again, it just needs to be accepted.</TEXT>

This is one. One that things what he did was very very wrong, he should apologize, doesn't stand up for him in public because I don't agree with his actions, but one that was first in line to see the show when he came to my area. My responses are long because I'm long winded. Sue me. Again, I get how it can come across as the only thing I think about with the long responses. Its more that its just a topic I can yammer about on the fly quite a bit. I'm hardly exerting that much energy with a response, or using that much brainpower. Its 5 minutes, all said and done.

    <TEXT>1. He should have owned up to the rumors that he's a pervert. As for the definition of "lying", yes, maybe its more that he "withheld information". But if my friend tried to commit suicide, I find out through other means, I ask my friend if everything is ok and he says yes then he's lying. If he never fesses up to it, he's lying. Sure, he never said "I never tried that" because I never outright asked, but he's lying to people that want to help him. Louis should have come clean when it was clear he was being creepy with women and all of this would have been fine. 2. Again, his fault is that he's an incredibly smart man. He did not think he had consent. I'll concede he didn't know how intimidating it was, but if they never said yes, which I believe they didn't, then he knew it was the wrong. And the reason you know he knew it was wrong? Because he wouldn't fess up the many times he was asked point blank about it. I feel for the guy, I know its embarrassing, but the argument that he didn't know he was making them uncomfortable is bull. This is why it dogged him so many years. 5. He writes about miscommunication so well because he understands it. Which is why he knew this was wrong. Maybe not at the time, but in the time since. Again, why he continually tried to bury it and got famous enough (props to him) that he had friends that would help him do that. 6. That statement is so wrongheaded I don't know how to respond to it. You don't like the guy, big whoop. He's still a celebrity and still has power. I'm... I'm just not gonna get into that. 7. I liked Dave Chappelle's joke about it that "bitch, you can't hang up the phone." That still doesn't make it right. You typing with your dick out is completely different and you know it. 8. Louis did lie to me and till he apologizes to me personally by locking me in a room and jerking off in front of me I'll never by satisfied.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Cause you saying it doesn't bother me. His action does. Not on a day to day basis, but yknow, as a fan when I think of him from time to time. The way Jim Gordon killing his mother bothers me. Its a thing. Here's what I hate about Louis fans: I agree with some of things people say. I concede things, I take some steps to establish some sort of level headedness. Louis fans refuse to fucking budge. They think everything they say is gospel. I get how what I say can sound like that, but I fully admit in most posts that its not. Louis fans attack people like me for being self righteous when you can count on one hand the amount of posters who will concede ANYTHING on this site. And to me, thats more dangerous, or at least as dangerous, as the shit I say that annoys you. I just don't see why everything I say is wrong, but everything someone else thinks, like you, there's not a single thing you'll budge on. And thats not true. If he apologized before a New Yorks Time article caught him, I'd feel different. He apologized cause he got caught, not because he actually felt bad about what he did. And thats shitty. Sorry.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Driver was a perfect host. I've liked him the other times he's hosted as well, but this week he was exceptional. Did everything you could possibly want as a host, as you mentioned. Only thing I wish? The writing was better. He was game for anything and had some solid premises, but I'd argue the writing could still use a massive step up and Driver simply did the best with what he was given. I know that might not be most popular here, but a lot of the sketches could have benefitted from a rewrite. Driver, and the rest of the cast, saved most of them as much as they could but the writing prevented this from being a truly great episode.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>She's very good, and I swear I'm not trying to be a hater, I don't think she'll be memorable in the SNL cannon. To answer your question though, no, I struggle to think of times she's actually "failed" on the show. She's very good at carrying her load, and because she's so good I wish she had that extra little step to make her as good as Kristin Wiig, Ferrell, etc. Again, not an insult, just an observation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>These days, people more groan at jokes because they feel they have to. Its fashionable, and they don't wanna be seen as on the wrong side of history IF something blows up. Its a sign of culture today more than anything else. If something is gets characterized by the mainstream media as grossly inappropriate, those people are on that side because they think its better visually for them. If the media decides to label it genius, those same people will claim credit they were there or the first to recognize it. We have a terribly fickle culture.

    <TEXT>I like them a lot, but as it is right now I feel they've got a lot to do to reach the heights of previous head writers who also happened to be cast members. The main ones before them were Seth Meyers and Tina Fey. Again, Che and Jost are good, but they aren't those guys. Someone like Meyers lived for the show. He cared about it so much, he'd go to the wall fighting or rewriting sketches for him but mostly others. He cared about putting on a quality show every week, caring about every facet of the program and not just weekend update. Not accusing the current two of NOT doing that, but just noting. Similarly with Tina Fey, there was a passion that you could feel on the program. You could feel that this sketch was benefitted from a punch up from Fey or Meyers. That they would forgo sleep to make YOUR sketch, and by extension the entire show, better. They were Lorne's right hand people that he trusted like not many throughout the show's history. They are properly honored usually but I'd argue deserve more credit than they'll ever receive for helping keep this show on the air and relevant. Their passion for the show was truly unparalleled and kind of superhuman, so while I wouldn't expect it from Jost or Che or any future head writers/cast members, I also don't think they have it at all. Che in particular seems like, and I mean it nicely, that this is a cushy job and he does well but not above and beyond. Jost maybe a little more but again, very much is doing his work well as opposing to carrying the entire show on his back. If anyone were to take over for Lorne, I'd say it would be Seth.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As mentioned repeatedly, Louie does not need people's help. This makes his fans feel better, but its unnecessary. Their words won't say anything, and its up to Louis. I don't know why they can't let it be. Its cause they also, like the other side, want attention. Its purely selfish, its not for the greater good. They want their entertainment and they think THEY'VE been disenfranchised so they want to fight back against the other side. Sure they aren't shutting anyone down, but its nonsensical because 1. it won't help anything and 2. they get the same glee the other side does from shutting Louis down. It may take 3 minutes of their time, but its still a complete waste of fucking time. I think even Louie would agree with that. And actually thats not true. They're not trying to shut down a single person but they're trying to shut down a group of people.</TEXT>

But its weird how people 1. think each interview is gonna be different and 2. that they will somehow get better. They won't. They are what they are at this point. And its so weird how some people LOVE some but don't like others. Sure, there's the odd person that really does suck, but largely they are all the same and this one seems no different. I just don't get how some people shit on 90% of them throughout the year but then pick ones they really do like. And it seems kinda unanimous and then I'll listen to them and be like "do we listen to the same show? His Bill Maher interview is exactly the same as his Gwyneth Paltrow interview." His Leslie Jones interview is really no different than Whitney Cummings or Chelsea Handler.</TEXT>

Right now, something like "I'm all outta cash" would get a lot of votes cause people are trying to make it work, but if we're being honest that'll be forgotten in a year. Most sketches these days don't have long lasting memorability. Listen, I love Mulaney, the Lobster sketch isn't a "classic". Its something people might remember about him if you know him, but thats a small group. It won't be remembered in the canon of SNL sketches the way "Jane you ignorant slut" is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nothing good comes from bringing him up. the event is overshadowed by Louis, there's the real possibility that many still don't like Louie so they get annoyed by his being there and that hurts Bill and also the Patrice Benefit becomes about Louis' negative vibe that he brings. It can also hurt Louie because the more people that know he's on tour if they're still upset can rally others to protest. Not the best scenario, but just so many bad options can come from bringing him up. At this point, really the best thing is Louis remaining underground for everyone so that by the time he really reemerges in the public eye he's hopefully got one of the best hours of his career which can make people forget why they think they don't like him. Great comedy can cut through and transcend a lot.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm not sure why anyone would think anything Louie does won't be Louis and on his terms. He has ALWAYS been that way. He does shit by his own rules. Thats why I do get the argument against me of "didn't you think his apology was as Louis as it possibly could be?" And yes, at times I do, even though I think it was forced but thats another story. BUT I also thought what would have been so quintessential Louis was him owning up to it when the rumors were around and just being like "unfortunately its true, it really sucks, and I'm sorry to those who felt offended by it and I don't do it anymore." Even if he didn't do anything wrong, there are just times guys apologizes to their significant others just to keep the peace. I think thats what he could and should have done and had a lot of time to do. I don't like that for one of the only times in his life, he waited till the media caught up with him because then his apology and everything is under protest. Its by their rules, which is so not Louis. Having said that I applaud that his whole comeback has been on his terms and every step of the way I can't not say "well thats super Louie of him."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't know if it was Artie or just Howard was better back then (probably a little of both), but seriously, the show was just so much fucking better than. It was just so naturally entertaining. Nowadays its truly a pale imitation cause its trying to be the same thing but it just reeks so hard of being forced. I was just listening to a Ben Stiller interview on youtube from when Artie was there and it starts off with Jimmy Kimmel being in with the group that day. He's being the same as he was then, actually he was being more of a kiss ass saying he got the speech he gave at Howard's wedding framed for him which is just massively cringe, yet it was still so much more entertaining than today's drek. Artie helped, but its just night and day a different show.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But it isn't just Artie. Artie was invaluable, don't get me wrong, as was that third chair, but its not just that. The show isn't funny because Howard has utterly stopped trying, the cast doesn't have a funny person in there, and the show had to skew towards political correctness. All of those things, make it a pale imitation of what it was. Cause they haven't changed the format, they've just taken the urgency, excitement, funny people and inappropriate conversations out of the equation. And you're left with a hollow version of what was once a great show. But its not JUST the third mic thing.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He did do something wrong, its just different than what most people actually think he did. What he did was lie to his fans and by not admitting to his transgressions, silenced women who were trying to speak up about something that happened to them. What he DIDN'T do was rape people. He DIDN'T rape people. Thats important. What he did do was lie and use his power (in the early days as a head writer on shows, and in the later days as a relatively respected comic on the underground circuit) to keep himself protected from creepy weird things he did. It is up to you whether you think that second part constitutes a "wrong" act. Personally I think it does. Woody Allen dating and marrying his adopted daughter is another thing I think is wrong even though its not illegal. Having said that, I appreciate that he was upfront about it and never tried to hide it. I didn't like that Louis hid it for so long and made other people seem like liars by not answering to it. To me, that is wrong. everyone has a different scale.</TEXT>

Bill Cosby RAPED women, and thats wrong. What Louis did? Depends how you feel. Woody Allen? Depends how you feel. Its unconventional for sure. And I'm not saying its right or wrong cause its not a Woody Allen subreddit. But it points to other incidents where its up to the person to determine that. I think it is, and again I care less about the act than I do the lying and protecting. To me, THAT'S the wrong thing. The jerking off thing? Whatever, women didn't die. They'll live, but I didn't agree with them being silenced which is what he was doing by not copping to it earlier when the rumors were out there. And I'll ask him as much when I see him next month.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I want him to have a more interesting staff, I want him to stop being a therapist, I want him to bring back the strippers, I want him to be fucking genuine for once in his god damn life. I want him to have better games like they used to. The shit they do today is amateur hour. I want the show to be like how it was 15-25 years ago. We had a phenomenal show, and he's sucked all the life out of it by losing the best people (in fairness to him, most of them left), becoming far too PC that you can't even really do funny stuff anymore, becoming a celebrity kiss ass, and just being done caring. All of which is fine, its his life, but I'm not gonna call it a good show just because I did for years. Any 5 minute conversation they had in 2006 was gold. Now? With the 20 people they typically have in studio they can't dream of conjuring him, spontaneously or scripted, a conversation of the same caliber. And it speaks to the cast and to the lack of caring they put in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Spade tried too hard with a combination of Howard truly not caring what Spade is saying. Spade was there cause they couldn't get anyone else. Stern was on autopilot and doesn't think Spade is a big enough star that he needs to address "wow, you listen to the show!" If it was Jennifer Aniston dropping those references, he'd have brought JD in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Probably gonna get downvoted but it isn't meant as harsh as it sounds. This sketch is a perfect example of why I've always thought this cast was competent but never able to go for that second level. This is a fine idea, and obviously these two are capable of performing it, but thats about it. It never elevates anywhere. I feel like any of the recurring sketches in the past, there's an embodiment that elevates the sketch beyond just what's on the written page. I don't see that here. Its just two performers compentantly performing what's on the page, but failing to really make it go beyond that. Something like Wayne's World, the Sweeny Sisters, it was the performance that made the sketch. Not every one was great, but they were fully committed to the bit and the character, whereas I always felt these ended up rather bland. It doesn't even really have the same feel as say the Porn Stars sketch, which again is sold by their commitment. I think this sketch is pretty symbolic of what this cast (minus Kate) is: good, but not great and really able to fully sell a sketch unless the writing is just impeccable (which has also usually not been the case in the most recent years). If you have better performers, that can be masked, but if both are just fine I feel it shows.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>70% of this cast has been there for 7 years. Even if you like people, they shouldn't usually be on that long. They run their course. The cast is SO in need of a major shake up. I never liked Leslie, but I give her major props for leaving when she did. She's older and I figured she'd cling to that show, and was surprised she didn't. Give her all the respect for moving past it. I get that its easier for the rest of the cast not to, but anyone thats been there for over 5 years at this point should be rotated out. You've had your turn, let's find the new generation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The whole story rubs me the wrong way. I like Pete a lot and I really used to like Louis CK a lot. I still do, hopefully that doesn't taint this whole post. I think what he did was terrible, the act but moreso the lying and silencing people which he was able to do because he was a huge name. I didn't like the way it was handled and would have loved if he came clean, so while I still like his old material, that aspect really bothered me about him. But ok, past all that, what I didn't like about this story is it just seems like convenient timing. It seems easy to knock him down. I get it that maybe Pete didn't have an outlet till now. But its a very personal story that he's trying to use public and other people's pain to convey. It seems unLouie to do this, even though I believe the story, but its put in a worse light because he's kind of disgraced now. I think the joke relies on Louie being down and out, which to me is a sign that it doesn't really work, if that makes sense. Again, I like Pete a lot, but just seems like an easy way to get praise against a guy who's already taken down on you. Its a cool story, but he's wrong about the fallout now. Publicly yes, but comedian wise almost everyone stood by him. Again, much to my annoyance that none of the comedians will say he did anything wrong and that the media blows it up as if he did something worse than he actually did. The story just sounds bitchy to me rather than a great comic routine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Trust me, couldn't care less about the downvoting. Not gonna be slitting my wrists because someone on the internet didn't like me. Listen, its not opinion, it really is a fact, but whatever. If you appreciate the subpar comedy, thats your right. I think its sad that he's clearly capable of more and just doesn't get better. He'll stay at this mediocre level if people just accept this as being good. I think pushing him to do better when he's got the talent to isn't a bad thing to say, and its also not an opinion, its a fact. In a day, he's put me on a roller coaster ride. That interview with Charlamagne thats making all the news was REALLY good. He was really coherent, level headed, right about a lot of things. Then I watch his special and I'm like "oh, but you're still... you're still just kind of coasting though." Listen, if he didn't do his great Weekend Update pieces it'd be a different story. But he's really good on those so there's no reason he can't translate that to stand up. If he sucked there too, I'd just say he isn't that great at comedy. But he is and thats what's frustrating. Its hard for me to root for him and champion him in that interview when then the product is subpar. The interview was great and if he had a great special to follow it, this would be a great moment. Being what it is, I think its yet again another missed opportunity. His last special was better than this one.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Exactly. Its unfortunate for them. But its also the history of black women on SNL. They've never used ANY to their true potential. You could say its cause they don't push enough like a Will Ferrell might, or cause they're sidelined just because the writers don't know how to write for them. I think its more the latter. On one of the docs, it was outright said that SNL will never be the voice of black America. Although having said that, its still unfortunate it seems they've done so little to even remedy that, beyond simply acknowledging it.</TEXT>

Not ungodly strong like his prime years of Shameless, Hilarious or Live At The Beacon, to me, but incredibly solid and I laughed my ass off. I did think this was better than some of his previous hours. Honestly, it was just really good to see him up there again. I do think what he did was wrong, but I thought the media coverage of him was unfair, as he alluded to during the show. And there's another great joke in the show that I won't spoil that, to me, illustrates "yeah, you certainly deserve to keep living your life and move past this." I do hope this is a new start for him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I do not believe it is the best set of his career. Its good. I don't know why we need the hyperbole just cause he's back. Its a very good hour. I could think of at least 3 sets he's had that are better though. This was simply great to have him back with no dip in quality, and arguably a bump up from the slightly less than great hours he had before his disgrace.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>It wasn't. Thankfully there's some non brainwashed fans here. We don't have to say that. It was a really good set, thats all. Not everything these days has to be best or worst. The reason Louie got in trouble was people had to be hyperbolic and say "its the worst". Its not, the same way this hour is not his best. Its just today's culture that it has to be one side of the spectrum or the other. He's back, just celebrate that, but don't conflate it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its like saying 1941 is John Belushi's best movie. You can have that opinion, and thats fine, but that doesn't make it right. There's things that can be argued and there's things that can't. And the truth is 1941 isn't John Belushi's best movie, but you can really personally like it a lot. You should still be able to say and admit the fact. The same way it seems like your personal feelings are clouding what is essentially trying to be stated as a fact that this is the best set of his career. If you're a fan of Louis, I'm not sure how you think that, unless this was like your first time seeing him or there's something specific that made it great for you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Totally agree. You said it better than I could ever hoped to have. Again, most of MY criticism of the cast comes from that. Not from them not being talented, not from them not being capable. Sure, I do think they are... lazy seems like the wrong word, but just limited in what they can do. In that they can pretty do anything you write for them, but they don't have that extra level that pushes them to truly take the stuff off the page the way previous cast members have. Say what you want about guys like Samberg, Forte, Armisen, Cheri Oteri, Chris Kattan, etc, but they were able to do what was asked AND above. Maybe they all didn't go on to huge stardom, but they were great on the show. Cheri Oteri could do what you ask of her but was then also writing her own fully formed characters in the tradition of the show. I don't see this cast doing that. The terrible sketch with Kate and Aidy as sisters in like an old timey movie. I get it, but the reason I don't think it really jumps off is because I don't think its written by them. Its a sketch someone is writing hoping to be recurring, and they can do it well, but there's a personal touch to it thats missing. Thats my gripe with them. The political stuff is just in addition to that, and also to me a sign that they can't CREATE a character. Will Ferrell CREATED that George Bush. Darrell Hammond CREATED that Bill Clinton. Someone like Cecily can play Jeanine Pirro very well, and I think its really funny, but she's just doing Jeanine. She's not creating a character, if that makes sense. She's just capable of doing a really good impression of her. Maybe I'm selling them short, but I think its telling that the only one that CAN do it, and gets called to, is Kate. I don't even like Kate that much, but I can't deny she's a star with extreme talent that does what all great SNL performers have done in the past (whether they went on to superstardom or not after SNL) which is take every sketch off the page. I think what Lorne has, and had for like 6 years at this point, is a cast thats very capable, but isn't able to go that extra mile. They do what's asked of them, and they do it well, but they aren't truly creating for the show in their own voice, which is why Lorne has either fallen back on celebrities doing the impressions or just not figured out how to use them. And Lorne has a good track record, I really don't think its a coincidence that I've thought this for years about this cast (again, not shitting on them) and now none of them play major candidates. They needed to HOPE Warren went all the way, and now what, they're just gonna have Larry David and a revolving Biden the rest of the season? And again, still Baldwin as Trump. As you say, this is coming from a place from an SNL wannabe history buff lol. You just can't NOT notice this, while also liking this cast.</TEXT>

Don't have any problem with the current cast, even though this post will get downvoted, but they're just not memorable to the history of the show in the way 9 out of 10 other casts have been, and I truly don't know why on the internet it has to be intense love or intense hate. Why can't it just be a measured response? These guys are fine, thats it. They aren't incredible, they aren't underrated, they are perfectly capable but they don't go above and beyond and they are the definition of middle of the road for this long running program. You're wrong if you say they're terrible but you're also far too green if you say they're excellent. There's opinion and objectivity and you can feel and say both, but I don't know why so many people nowadays feel like they can't.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the record, I think he will and always have, but I'm just curious. So he's playing theaters now, obviously outside major cities but at this point clearly playing places that show enough people still want to see him. I was gonna argue Coronavirus will actually help him, because it provides a self imposed retreat from society a bit more, and will also reset people's minds a bit more about the entire world. But will he ever really be away from this thing to the general public? His fans will forgive him, and have, but would he be accepted back on say, talk shows again? Will he just plain never do mainstream media again? For example, I don't see him ever playing MSG again, but like, how much bigger than his current level do you think he can get to again? Will he ever be talked about in mainstream society without this being brought up? Just wondering how much it'll be synonymous with his career. In a way, the way you don't think of OJ Simpson without thinking of the murders. Obviously Louis didn't kill anyone, but just wondering since its still in the public consciousness how long you think it stays there? In 5 years, is it still something brought up when referencing him? Letterman's stuff never is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its amazing that its possible thats not even his best special. I think its absolutely brilliant, but I'd maybe give the slight edge to Hilarious or Shameless. But that Beacon one is just truly something to behold. I remember when it came out and it felt that way before even seeing it. And then seeing it and watching it deliver. Its insane. Again, possibly his best special, but even if its not, its the only one I watch where I'm like he can do whatever he wants on stage and it'll be amazing. He was at that "once in a lifetime" moment for a comedians, and it was a such a vindicating time for Louis fans. He had been around for SO long and was finally getting his due and it was so sweet. Every move he made on stage was just so naturally as good as it could get. If anything, its why I judge Oh My God so harshly, because I just didn't think it even touched Beacon, which is kinda unfair because Louis was in such a mode at Beacon's time that was already kinda gone by Oh My God.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Ok, I agree strongly with half of that, but the aspects about women and Weinstein are way off base. You say idiot men are to blame for MeToo becoming what it is, but I think your minimizing of stuff like women's testimonies against Weinstein is equally troubling. Yes, accusations can be offbase, but sometimes it is justified like it is there. The guy isn't sentenced to 23 years in prison just because it looks good. He was found guilty based on evidence, clear and simple. Just because they didn't run the proof by you doesn't mind it doesn't exist. Yes, people should make up their own minds about things and not run with how the fickle media feels, but you also shouldn't minimize half of our population and its alarming to lump all men getting taken down the same way. Thats exactly what got Louis in this mess. Some men deserve it, some men don't. You sound way off by saying the people that do don't, the same way people equating Louis with Weinstein sound dumb. They are not the same thing and they only make the person making the accusation look very foolish.</TEXT>

And its not like Jay needed the ratings or to change the show. He was already dominating. And its not like they tried to do the "not real announcer" thing cause John just tried to sound like a real announcer. Like seriously, while I don't care about John on the show, the bigger thing for me was I could never make heads or tails WHY this actually even ever happened. It just makes zero sense.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I don't question for a second question why John took the job. Way better money, way better job security, better opportunities even if you may not be a main player. I guess the thing is he was such pure trash on the Stern show. In what he contributed and what he was. He was just a dirty unkempt guy. I just don't see what Jay Leno's team saw there that they thought they needed. I get your point about him being a minor celebrity, but again, a very dirty one. What did they want, someone that was going to bring chaos to their writers room? Cause thats what I'd think he'd offer. Or for the actual job, he'd bring a stutter to a job that requires literally the exact opposite of that. He just seems like the epitome of the kind of person you WOULDN'T want to hire 1. for his work ethic, 2. just in quality of human he is. He's not someone you want to show up, or have people dig into his past, and I just don't get at all how the #1 winning late night show in any way needed Stuttering fuckin' John added to their mix. I don't see a single thing he is bringing you that you don't already have that you'd actually want. I could literally only see downsides in hiring him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>While I get what you're getting at, and you're not wrong in some circles these days cause there are some people who just want to get outraged about everything (I don't however believe its the majority that actively post the way you're saying it), largely I feel like people were angrier about a different thing when this all started. It definitely became overblown, but the real anger from people that weren't just latching on was that he silenced women with his power and put them in uncomfortable positions. He wasn't really like any other media figure getting accused of things, but it didn't make his thing right. Sure, it was more "weird" than "wrong" but these women deserved to have their time to speak. And it affected Louis for a bit, and now after a year he was back out doing comedy and two years later he's back out to selling a special. I think there's less anger in him releasing a special mainly because he's now just doing things on his own again, or always was. You can't get mad at a guy who's doing things from his own website, because at that point he's not forcing it on anyone, and maybe I'm giving people too much credit but I actually think they're rational enough to see that. Its not the same as when he came back after less than a year and people thought that was too soon which, regardless of whether it was or not, it was something people had to get through unless he wanted to disappear for like 5 years. My point is, I think at this point people have either forgiven him or haven't. They aren't just arbitrary getting up in arms about him releasing a special the way they were about his return to comedy in general. Personally, I've forgiven him because I was upset he lied to me as a fan about these rumors the very few times he addressed them and I just think had he owned up to it awhile ago when it was also out there this NEVER would have stained his career. And we'd all be better for it. I've now forgiven him because the consequence of it is, unfortunately, it'll probably dog him the rest of his career, or at least for a really long time now. So I can't stay mad at him since its not like he's getting off scot free. This is his cross he has to bear and it'd be silly for me or others to really be that mad at him at this point. Had he come back and it seemed like nothing ever happened, yeah I'd think that was wrong for the women, but thats not what happened and he's now going to deal with it however he sees fit but I feel comfortable giving him money again.</TEXT>

While I think the mainstream gets outraged about tiny things they shouldn't, this is one of those things where Louis fans are up in arms about something that isn't actually a thing. You're being as irrational as you accuse them of being because I think all legit news sources and websites are being way more rational in their takes of Louis 2 years later.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd like to say this is something that is representative of more current SNL, but its been like this for 20 or 30 years. Sure, it was good in the first few seasons, but this is one of the things they've been lazy about forever. I've accepted it'll never change and its just tradition.

    <TEXT>Haha ok. I guess thats what you're gonna hide behind. You make it very clear you're not worth discussing this with if you're not even going to admit within comedy writing circles, which then also translated to the stand up scene, he was a very big deal. If you're not going to admit that you're literally just trying to defend your argument and ignore facts and I just don't want to be involved in that. If you want to stop playing the "Louis was nobody" card, I'd love to continue this conversation. As if these women waited 20 years for the right moment to take him down. Yknow, they kept it in their heads for 20 years waiting for the right moment to bust it out and now completely tank any chance of having a career themselves because they are now known from this thing. Yup, that TOTALLY makes sense. If it was as innocuous as Louis fans like to pretend it is, they'd have forgotten about it long ago.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But he was very well known on that circuit and working with the big names, in powerful positions for them. How you gonna argue that if someone upsets Louis he might shit talk them to Chris Rock or Conan or someone else? Thats a very real thing that could have happened. And by 2000 when he did the stuff to the guitar duo, at a comedy club he would get more of a say from an owner than the women would have. So yes, he had some power and he wasn't unaware of it. Listen, if it helps people sleep at night to think he's the victim, thats fine. I think its wrong, but I'll sleep at night either way. No one has still come up with a reason he shouldn't have just copped to it years ago when it was out there and he could have avoided all of this.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>He doesn't have to apologize to me. I'm fine. And listen, whether he DID or DIDN'T do something isn't really the point. It was a rumor that was out there and he denied that it ever happened. He lied. I get it, he was embarrassed about it. But you knew it would come out initially. Had he copped to it when it was a rumor, all of this would have blown over cause he'd have owned up to it instead of getting "caught". I agree with you, I don't really think he DID anything either, at least bad. But it did happen, and it was out there before and he was denying it did. The wrong thing I think he did was lie about it than actually doing it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its worth the $8 easy but I also saw it live so I paid $50 and still thought that was a bargain. He's still a huge big time deal professional comedian and this is a solid middle of the pack set for him. I think, for him, he's set the bar so astronomically high that it doesn't top them but its way better and solid than his bad ones. And during quarantine I've been watching a lot of stand ups on Netflix. It really is better than like 90% of those. For Louis, I'd say its a solid 7 out of 10. Compared to a lot of what's out there these days, its fucking great. It really shows how great he is that he's still this good when all these other guys just barely make an hour.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That it was fine and had about 3 strong sketches and 3 very good ones. To say they knocked it out of the park, even given the situation, is a huge exaggeration. Which I get it, is the culture these days, but we can just be honest. It was better than last week but still had about 15-20 minutes of funny content? In an hour show, thats still not batting a home run, or even a triple. Its a double, and the fact that it is so glowing here is why he's saying interns. Its a pretty apt statement.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>There's just no way Community doesn't make a movie. I'm not even saying they should, but I just think "Six Seasons and A Movie" was too big a running phrase in the show and the fact that they miraculously made it to six seasons (thats really the biggest surprise IMO) that it has to happen. Its too PERFECT a thing for them to capitalize on to not, especially when there really aren't that many things for them to capitalize on. Plus, they all fuckin adore the show. I just think its too many factors for it to not happen. They would readjust their schedules to make it happen I truly believe. I unfortunately think its just going to be all of them but Donald and he'll just cameo for like 10 minutes or something, even though I really think he and Chevy should be involved so that its the full gang. But the fact that it made it six seasons AND the cast is all still really big in their own right independent of the show... at this point I'd be more shocked if it doesn't happen, and I'm shocked myself to hear me say that. Having said that, I do think they have to do it sooner rather than later. I think they have 3 years to capitalize on it, MAYBE 5, but they're already WAY older. I guess that doesn't matter but I think after 5 years the show just wouldn't be relevant in the same way, and I think after 3 years, storywise, it feels WAY too trying. You do it relatively soon and I genuinely don't think it would be questioned at all.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I hate how the show and Chevy handled the Pierce thing</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-04-30 06:29:54</DATE>
    <TEXT>I've simultaneously always been really mad at how the show minimizes Pierce's importance and how Chevy Chase fucked up what will end up being the last good thing of his career. The character of Pierce was great. He was hysterical, and a lot of that was due to Chase. It truly can't imagine anyone playing the character better, and he was always really hilarious and an integral character to the show to me. The character was so funny that even when he wasn't on screen he could make an entire scene, like his will reading. I hate how because the cast really hated Chevy that once he left they not so subtlety imply the character was never more than just a racist and not all that important to the show. You can not like Chase, but be upfront and talk about how god damn funny that character was and that, despite everything, Chase played him great. At the exact same time, I've always been furious that Chevy fucked up a good thing. Chevy had NO business being on a hit show. He hadn't done anything remotely successful since the 80s. He gets the unlikeliest chance to get back in the spotlight and in the most unsurprising Chevy move, he squanders it. He was working with an incredible group of actors, a showrunner who is revered in this day an age, and directors who have now directed some of the top grossing movies of all time. You had nothing, somehow got everything, and managed to ruin it all with your ego. If you just put it aside just a bit, you could have had the a rather undeserved but stellar end to a rather disjointed career. You were handed it on a silver platter, and worse, you were GREAT on the show. So either you were naturally amazing by not trying, or you tried a lot when you needed and STILL crapped on the show. Either way, it leaves me feeling disappointed because I love your work on the show but believe every story I hear about you from that cast.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope, totally agree. That is part of my whole thing against "the show". By "show", I really mean Harmon, who seemed determined to be just as much of a diva as Chevy. He fostered a bad environment for Chase, and I assume it wasn't unwarranted, but that was my whole point that if they're all saying Chase didn't handle it correctly, neither did Dan.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I don't disagree, but Dan Harmon is just as bi polar as Chevy. Funny thing is Chevy THINKS he has the clout to act that way when Harmon actually has the TALENT to act that way. But both of the ways they lash out are wrong and I don't think one is more to blame over the other. I'm not absolving Chevy of anything, although I genuinely think its too easy to say they only acted that way because he sucked. Dan was fucking with him a lot, maybe not even that seriously, but others went along with it and it became a mutiny against Chevy. I think Chevy is awful and I've read the stories, but I always think they went A LITTLE hard on him. Or at least that it was coming from a bad place when, most of what Chevy says, is harmless. That doesn't exclude it, but its usually not malicious.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>With all due respect, I don't think much of that is correct. Hader, as mentioned, was saved by many of the writers. He's also enormously talented and creative, but he was there with a good crop and that definitely saved his ass too. Jay, I hate to say it, but I think got screwed mostly because he's black. SNL self admittedly will never be the voice of black America, and its very hard for a black cast members to break through. Kenan is a rare exception, and its not to knock him, but I think Jay had more aspirations than Kenan did. Kenan has carved a place for himself, but I think for many black cast members its hard to just fit in and you get relegated to the background unless you have a lot of crossover appeal. I think Jay probably had a lot of great ideas that just didn't gel with the very white staff on the show. I'm not calling him the next Eddie Murphy or anything, but I think he was capable of a lot and his stuff just didn't click with the staff so they relegated him to impressions. It was unfortunate cause I like to think he was hired because he's more. Melissa, I have to imagine, has a lot of characters the writers just don't think will work. And either its the writers fault or she's mediocre. I really like her when she's on the show, so I hope its the latter and that they just aren't tapping into her when they could. Its hard to tell these days. I kinda like Heidi too but every one of her characters sounds and acts the same. I don't know if thats a her thing or the writers not knowing how to use her. Unfortunately, Melissa has been on the show for what, 5 years? I really have to imagine at this point she's not on a ton because her stuff just isn't good enough. Or she's been getting dealt a really crappy hand of not being heard. But in 5 years, I have to imagine its more on you than the staff. Who knows.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>Really hoping next year is a rebirth for this show</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-05-10 06:24:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Thats not to say this season or cast was bad, but I just really feel the show is kinda stuck in a rut. I give the cast tremendous credit for trying and doing the best they can with the material they either write or is given to them, but I really feel its been a long transition period between cast members who have been there awhile and seem hard pressed to give anything truly new and a newer cast that either hasn't found its footing or is getting overshadowed by the elder members. I like to imagine all cast members that are hired are hired for a reason, which is why I really wish they'd let more of these featured players shine a bit more. I'm not sure why the lack of material from most of them, but if its a writing fault they should definitely be considered more. If its the performer's fault, then maybe start looking for replacements, but there are a lot of underutilized cast members, namely most of the women, that I'd love to see get a bigger spotlight. I'm also really dying for some of this cast to leave. Its truly nothing against them personally, but Cecily, Aidy, Kate, Pete have all been there for a really long time. Beck and Kyle as well. I really think this cast could use an overhaul. Again, nothing against them, but I just feel they've given all they can to this show, some great stuff, and its time for a new guard. You have about 16 people now, 8 of which could definitely anchor a new cast, the same 2 weekend update personalities. I really think its time to shake up those 6 that have been there since like 2012/2013.</TEXT>

I know a lot of bands and personalities and TV show who had a good 10 years or so, but Howard was pretty excellent consistently for like 20 years. Again, not saying he's God or anything.

Again, not meant to be a critisim of the cast, but I just feel its been the most autopilot and unmemorable than in the last 20 years. We had Ferrell/Oteria/Kattan, then Fey/Fallon/Poehler, then Samberg/Hader/Wiig, with key anchors like Forte, Armisen and Meyers during the in betweens. And of course Kenan throughout all of that. I feel like since Killam, Bayer, and others left, the show has just been very meh most weeks. I don't even love Kate, but I think she's the only one who's carried the load in the same way Wiig, Ferrell and others have in the past.</TEXT>

I hate what the show has become, but that doesn't really have anything to do with this. Its just such a car accident that you can't look away from. I almost feel bad for him, even though I don't. I almost feel bad for the crew, but I don't. No one has to stay and I get that you stay where your bread is buttered. But it really is a master class in delusion and in ego. There are times I watch it and I totally see what he's going for, and that it makes perfect sense. In the mind of a diseased person. Sometimes I watch and its the perfect presentation. If you're a 5 year old. Seriously, every time I think its run its course, I need another helping. I never get my fill of watching this for so many reason.

Sure, maybe it shouldn't be a dildo in the super bowl commercial, and maybe it shouldn't be lotion that comes out of the billboard in times Square, but he's thinking exactly the way Howard wants him to and gets completely shat on for it. Another huge aspect of it that just makes it all the more hilarious. There was another huge hypocrisy during the meeting when I watched it again last night and I forget it now. But its just so much hilarious "This but this". I want you to dress nice, but I want you to represent the show. Just an immediate backpedal and ideas clashing. I want the news team to be all over people, but also don't bombard people. What?! I love that this exists so much.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Nope, you described it perfectly. Its a meeting for himself. I want to be the one to say this stuff, but I'm also lazy and haven't thought about how we're gonna implement it. And actually, thats because I'm SO lazy (which, all credit to him. The guy's earned his right to be lazy. Not disputing that at all), I'm gonna have someone else organize this for me, like Gary. BUT I'm also so lazy, I don't wanna do this presentation more than once, so everyone will hear it now and we'll work out the details later. There's just so many layers of stupidity to it it never gets old. His incessant calling out of High Pitch Mike. So much wrong with it on so many levels. 1. That he only sees him for gay stuff, which is completely against what he's trying to portray that Howard is the almighty PC king and doesn't have preconceived notions about anyone or anything, when this is truly who he really is. 2. That Mike has ever been portrayed as anything other than yet another punching bag in this gang of idiots. Like, why would Mike be at all able to handle this. It'd be like asking Stuttering John to do it. Or when Howard calls out Ralph as having great ideas. Its like, you realize how retarded you sound? You obviously don't. You may as well have had the wack packers in on the meeting and given Action items to Erik. Again, every bit of this is brilliant. And we only know that, because Howard would have obliterated someone ELSE for doing this back in the day. He's done it enough that its in OUR DNA to see this stuff. The disconnect is just stunning.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I watched the special: 1. I didn't think it was a very good special. I'm not a blind worshipper of Louie's but I really did think this new hour was pretty strong. Not his best, but thats hard to do. This was a way better return that could really be expected from someone in his position. And I like Patton a lot. I haven't seen many of his recent specials, but his early ones are phenomenal. This one seemed so boring and tedious. 2. Didn't disagree with anything he said. I actually thought that "bit" was the most interesting one of the special. Its not new or something other comedians haven't talked about, and done it better, but its so incredibly relatable for many of us that would never think to do it that I still find it interesting. And yeah, I thought he was totally on point there. 3. I didn't necessarily think it was as pointed at Louis as you made it out to be. I get how he's part of it, but it seemed VERY general and applicable to all the bad people like Weinstein and such. It was really just a bit about powerful people doing these weird things, and how its hard to get true consent when you're a big deal. I guess the most applicable thing to Louis was the "even if they say yes" but honestly, it didn't read to me pointed at Louis. I have no idea what he's said about Louie since this has gone down, but it just seemed like a general bit about no one is enthusiastically agreeing to seeing someone jerk off. I thought it applied to Weinstein and Charlie Rose as directly as it did to Louis, but thats just me. Either way, I thought what he said was on point and the fact that he didn't name check Louis is why I'm not gonna hold it against him. What I'll hold against him is that set was far below par what I've seen him do in the past and that was sad.</TEXT>

If it was great, it would have been amazing, but if it was bad it was just like "yeah, we expected that" and its the type of vanity project no one would hold against him. To call it better than a 4 out of 10 is being far too kind.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hey guys, Watching the Boat episode of Late Night that was recently posted and was wondering if anyone knows what truly went down with Joel Goddard? Seems he was the only one Conan DIDN'T take with him to LA, and not that Conan is "responsible" for anyone, but when Joel has been asked about it in interviews it doesn't sound like he voluntarily retired or anything. I don't worship Conan or anything, but I do think he seems to be incredibly thoughtful the way he handles things and is just an unbelievably kind and generous person. Hearing his voice on this Boat show made me remember that that is like the one thing that's always seemed very unConan, like he did have a hand in it. But I don't know and was wondering if anyone else does. If I were to ever find a fault with him, I feel thats the only one I ever could.</TEXT>

I like Apatow, but my god has he created a template and sticks to it no matter what he's doing or who he's taking on like Pete or Schumer. At least Schumer's felt like it still had her input, whereas Pete seems pretty lazy and isn't gonna offer something like writing the script and whatnot. Put it at a $5 price tag and on a good day when I have nothing else going on, I might pay it. $20? No fuckin way. I could rewatch This Is 40 or something. Make another movie that looks as funny as 40 Year Old Virgin and maybe I'll pay $20.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Really? I would argue most probably have. Either amongst friends or in private. Again, not in a derogatory way, and I'm certainly not defending the few times I've probably used it, but if a conversation drifts to that fact (either with song lyrics or otherwise) its definitely something all white people think about. When I'm singing a Kanye song, I'm present of it and usually skip that word, but thats what gives the word its mystique. Again, people will fit whatever they want to their narrative but I do think, in general, Howard is right on about that fact. Think of how many times they said it on the show. It does come up naturally like that in real life amongst friends as well.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>You clearly have a very specific story with the KKK, but most people (I'll even minimize to the coasts I guess) that is absolutely true. You can tell from all the people who get in trouble just singing song lyrics. They aren't NOT just singing something without knowing the words. That is a word people know and sing on purpose, but I also don't think its with malice. Its not complacency, but the first step is acknowledging that it is said, and not pretending like its not. People are aware of it. Face it and maybe we can change something. If we don't, it'll continue to be the same. Excuses are the dumbest part. I'm glad you check racism in the face but 90% of white America does not. They pretend its not what this country was built on and thats the real problem.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I feel bad for Artie and I regret a lot of the ways Howard treated him. I love Artie so much. However, the mileage he got from that show you could argue allowed Howard to act that way. It is what Artie had to put up with to put him on top of the world. I'm not saying its right, but also the fame Artie achieved is outstanding considering what his role was. NO ONE, MAYBE besides Robin, ever got as much mileage from that show as Artie, so the question becomes was the trade off worth it? I can't ignore though, while Howard was cruel, he also gave Artie the world, and fame he wouldn't have had without that platform.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its not good, but also people say Dirty Work isn't good and I think thats great. Which to me makes this movie terrible, cause there's direct to DVD movies then there's good movies that do poorly. I think this is the former and Dirty Work is the latter. Dirty Work seems like a real movie. This always felt like an Artie vanity project, but nothing more. Private Parts also seems like an actual theatrical movie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I heard about that and I remember Norm tweeting it. Honestly, I assume it'll be terrible. The first one is great and its unfortunately not even their real vision and was totally sanitized. Having said that, its still great, but I think if they tried to do a second it would feel very forced and they'd probably overcompensate and try to really go for the wall because they couldn't with the first one. Which I assume probably worked there, but here I assume it would just be dirty for dirty's sake and not actually help the story. Also, you'd fuckin need to get Artie for it. Or at least I hope they would.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Agreed. And I give both he and Howard a TON of credit. Artie was in the wrong many times (incredibly, not so many even though he was high most of the time), as is Howard. But for all Howard's faults, I truly have always believed he never purposely abused Artie. He truly didn't know the extent of Artie's world, or what he was capable of even if he DID know how bad it was, or how to handle it. And I don't believe any of the fat stuff was ever intentionally meant to be hurtful. As Howard said "you ARE fat", which is just the truth. Artie ribbed people the same way about sensitive stuff. But 100% I don't know what its like to have a friend with addiction and it sounds beyonds horrible. I feel bad for Artie, and I feel bad for Howard because I think he truly loved Artie and a part of him died when all that went down. He had to break off, although he could have returned Artie's calls, and I really do think it still sticks with him. Of all the things to get on Howard for, I've never gotten on him for the Artie situation.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For the most part, I've always loved the 06-2010 Sirius Artie years. I know its generally agreed the first two years were great, then it kind of went downhill, but I really did like the whole thing. The Hampton Howie thing wasn't everyone's bag, but I thought they dealt with it nicely back then. He had definitely crossed over, but they goofed on it in an interesting way and it wasn't off limits. I actually liked how he and Artie talked Hollywood, cause it is a real thing that is interesting, but the way he does it now with kiss ass stuff is just super boring. Back then, it was peering behind the curtain that Howard was definitely now a part of but not as afraid of making waves in. And he was actually getting the guests he craved, and he was doing good interviews with them then. Then you got mainstays like Chris who would come in and perfectly rag on him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm looking for a beer called Barrel Trolley, specifically their amber ale. Its a fine beer, really nothing special, but I really enjoyed it. I think I got it for like 6 months then never saw it again. I saw other Barrel Trolley beers, but never the amber one again. Then I stopped seeing Barrel Trolley long ago.  #8203; My question is is there a way to look up how to find this beer anywhere or does anyone know if they still make it? Their website is defunct, and a Google search didn't really yield much. I'd gladly pay to have it shipped or drive to wherever it is but have come up pretty unsuccessful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Watched it before and enjoyed, but just fascinating to watch now after everything he's done. Its so clear in the history of Louie what he was going for. This to Louie to Horace and Pete. Just kept getting more real and darker. Horace and Pete was basically a drama or play. The Louie series is definitely the perfect marriage of these two shows, but unfair the treatment this show got. Its really good and was something different with a nod to the original years of TV. He was going for something here and think the 13 episodes it got were great.</TEXT>

The big difference is obviously the sitcom aspect of it, but the storylines are definitely early versions of what could become Louie episodes. Its the brutally honest depiction of broke married life, and the discussions they have are based on his stand up as well as ideas he clearly didn't know how to flesh out the way he eventually did with Louie.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I still think its incredible radio but, stupid as I am, this is the first time I'm seeing this and truly seeing how cruel it is. I do defend Howard in not knowing so much about Artie and maybe being naive but just blindsided by how bad it was. He knew something was wrong but not the extent. Having said that, then the only reason they're playing this is to goof on him. They think its funny, which it is, but knowing what we know they are literally laughing while Artie is fuckin dying. If Artie's in the studio and he's fucked up, he's fair game. Thats him doing that. He's clearly so bad up that he's calling Gary to tell him he can't come in and he expects this isn't going on the show or anything. In a way this is a huge betrayal. I don't know, I never really saw this as cruel as I am right now. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive. Again, its still hilarious but its like, you definitely kinda crossed a line here, especially if you DO know he's not just sick. And you're basically playing it because you KNOW he's not sick.</TEXT>

But when you see this now you can see how completely unhinged that is. And its different than the other fights on the show. You know that Artie has an issue here and you have to fire him not for his behavior but because you Howard are literally killing him more than he already is. You're exploiting this and its wrong. And Robin laughs to herself because she knows its true and she's amazed Artie is actually saying it.</TEXT>

Kate is on the Jan Hooks, Wiig, Gilda, Poehler level where she just tackled it head on and was able to do anything. As for this group making you laugh more than any other group on the show: different strokes. I think they're fine but its hard for me to think people watch the Ferrell years or Carvey years, or the first 5 years and think these guys are more consistent. Kate is the only one who would break the top 50 for me, and even thats questionable. The rest of the cast would place below the top 150 for me.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'd say around 2007/2008 with Chewed Up and Shameless he had pretty much risen to just being fantastic, and then I feel he peaked in 2010-2011 with Hilarious and Live At The Beacon. For that 5 year period or so, I feel he was pretty unstoppable. He didn't become HUGE mainstream until season 2 or 3 of Louie I feel like, maybe even after. He was playing the Wilbur Theater near me in college around 2011 and it was after the first season of Louie and they still gave out free tickets at my college cause it didn't sell out. A year or so later a season or so more into Louie, he became MUCH bigger. I remember when they gave out the free tickets I couldn't believe everyone didn't want to go, because I'd loved Louis for a while by that point. Then shortly after it became harder to get tickets to him.</TEXT>

Then when Dave came back out of hibernation in like 2009, he was just nonstop with comedy. It was so much better IMO than it was before. He already didn't give a super big fuck back then, but he was still kinda trying to play the game. Now he just brought the game to him, or doesn't care about it at all, and it definitely heightened his comedy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That and just I think he genuinely really did enjoy her book, for whatever reason, and wanted it for his life. Then he saw that it could also translate into getting the Hollywood life he actually wanted by cleaning up. Whatever the case, it was all a genuine Howard move and he put the final nail in his own coffin. No one asked him to do it or forced it on him, including Marci. He made his own decision, based on selfish or genuine reasons, and now must lie in the bed he made.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>How is it that not a single person knows where this guy is or what he's up to? He hasn't done a single interview in the "zoom" era we're living in, either he's back on drugs or he's not, but like either way is he able to leave the house for any reason? On or off drugs, that seems tough. I know many people living alone and its a struggle. For a guy who's already had his own host of really tough times, I'm almost shocked we haven't heard a peep out of him, good or bad, in this pandemic time. I genuinely hope thats good, I mean maybe having to be inside is forcing him to get clean (this time), but I'm shocked there hasn't been any word about him. I guess I'm surprised people aren't more concerned about him, or they've just all completely given up on him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, thats what I assume too. I guess I'm not surprised people are silent, because people are more disconnected these days if you don't actively reach out them. I'm just surprised NO ONE has had an update on him at all (people who live in Hoboken, just general fans of the show, comedian friends) given his past. This situation isn't easy on anyone, but I'm just wondering if anyone that knows him is making sure its not even worse for him, as its known to be at times. I guess its possible they're all just not being public about it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>But its just, it sounds retarded, even if it WAS Leno trying to get a Howard association. Like, get someone who doesn't stutter if you're looking for an announcer. I remember Howard talking about it like Jay was taking him as the "off kilter" kind of announcer, that would be different than what you'd normally see on TV to give it some edge. But when was Jay's show ever about that? His demographic was old people who liked him because he was middle of the road. And why would the network think its a good idea? I just don't even see how it was sold. I guess thats true about his stutter, but he'd read those questions to celebrities and he'd always stutter.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>As the other guy said, many still don't get it. And your friends probably didn't have it then. The Mac notebook was big, the iPod was big, the iPhone was a thing, the iPad was kinda of a combo of all those. Gary's point was it wasn't nearly as revolutionary, and it really wasn't. They made it better though over the years. Also phones got bigger and a number of other factors have worked in its favor, but that wasn't a given, and Gary's whole point was just it wasn't something we'd never had before.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its strange, he's like the only one NOT involved, yet he was the head writer there. Literally everyone else from the show was involved. I think what also made it stranger for me is it came out like a week, if I remember correct, after he went down in 2017. Obviously, they didn't reedit it in any way, but it almost seemed like it was just like "not the right time" to use him, yet it seems like he was never included which is odd to me because obviously they didn't know what was about to happen to him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I don't begrudge him or anything. I just assume he was busy. And I also would have liked to see Dino and Kaufman, but they are both kind of aloof guys to me. I don't know. Louis felt weird because at the end they're all kinda like "i'd do anything for Dana" cause that show really was a HUGE stepping stone for them, and not that I thought Louis not being there meant he wasn't grateful, but more that as head writer it would have been really interesting to hear him speak about it. I think its invaluable info. I just wasn't sure if anyone here knew why he wasn't involved. His absence is definitely the most conspicuous of the bunch.</TEXT>

Also, why would someone stay if they know the shows have been bad for years now? Again, these are arguments fans bring up that force people to side with Howard even though they don't want to. Everyone wants to do the minimal amount of work and not have it affect their lives. Howard is doing that, same as many others, then people are upset he's taking them for a ride. If I had retard listeners that never leave, I'd do the same thing. The fans sound dumber with this argument than Howard.</TEXT>

Having said that, obviously objectively, Artie is wrong in many ways: you can't act that way, and also if Teddy's a bad assistant thats on you. Artie kept around people he could then freak on and then claimed it was cause he had to and they depended on him. It was Artie who just liked to have someone to shit on. So you can't complain about having a bad assistant when you had every opportunity to get a good one and you just didn't want to. Artie deserved the work, but I'm happy for our benefit that he freaked cause it was great radio and video.</TEXT>

That was never an aspect, and if you remember it then you're simply misremembering.

    <TEXT>Yup. Howard still needed Artie and that chair filled from 2000-2010. He hadn't reached the mountaintop he was climbing yet. Now that he's there, which just coincided with Artie leaving the show, the comedy on the show was unnecessary. He got where he wanted to get and barring a scandal, he wasn't coming down. Cause it never matters if your show gets worse, just that it was good at some point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>No I know, but at the time he'd committed to it, even if he knew it was a failure, so he had to pretend it was continuing until he could inevitably blame the studios for losing interest when really he just knew it was a bad idea.

    <TEXT>This is the same as the Corona talk that bothers people. I'm not saying I agree with them, but nothing they're saying is all that different than what 70% of people out there are saying or using. The Howard Stern Show is basically doing what everyone else is doing, and there's so much to make fun of the show for but the fact that they are literally saying what most others are isn't one of them. Zoom isn't the best but its what many places are using. Its not weird that a 670 year old doesn't know any others. Corona is still rampant in many places and testing is kinda scarce. Nothing they are saying is that strange, and of all the things to make fun of them for, these aren't the right ones. They talk the way my parents talk. Cause they're my parents age. Doesn't mean they're out of touch. It means thats their bubble. I think the people pointing out those small things they say that are wrong are the dumber ones to think they're "outsmarting" the Stern show. They are on par with most of the US right now, which is just to say the US is fucking retarded, but thats a different story.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I know Stuttering John did this like a year ago but I think the first video was free and then you had to pay? It looks like the whole thing is up now on YouTube, and I wasn't gonna post it cause I didn't want it to be taken down, but I was watching the credits and I think the guy who posted was involved with the video. So I think its alright? I assume its all legal and kosher. Jackie and Billy are always great to hear talk. Honest to god good guys and talented motherfuckers with interesting stories. John is a weasel, but he's actually at his best here just being normal and having a good crew around him to not go too conspiracy insane. Its a really interesting conversation.</TEXT>

Jackie and Artie aren't really much without the show the way Billy is, but they had a ton of talent to offer that show. John doesn't, but he's able to gather them up so I guess I have to thank him for that cause its a cool convo.</TEXT>

That felt like a classic discussion and Baba Booey played his part perfectly. There's very few things to like about the show in the last decade so I gotta defend the ones that aren't total shit.

    <TEXT>Its very funny that people count this as some sort of new low. Its been this horrible for years, that was yet another example but it was no more horrific than other interviews. He fuckin interview 5 Seconds Of Summer a few years ago. He moved the fucking show to interview Madonna horribly. I don't care that he sold out, that actually really doesn't mean anything to me in the grand scheme of things because in all honesty he sold out so long ago that I don't even really remember what he was like before then. Its always been a lie, it was just more entertaining. If you think the show has gotten worse in the last 5 years, you were one of the truly devoted. Its been bad forever now and Bella Thorne didn't anything to make that worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'll concede it has its ups and downs, but by saying that I'm considering the last 5 years or so a down. Yes it has gotten stale, yes it has recovered from that before. As I've said before, you have stale writers at the moments and competent performers who can do what's on the page but not explode off of it like others have in the past. SNL has adapted with the times and I believe they will again. But yeah, it surprises me why you can't crap on current SNL even though everyone admits the show has had its ups and downs. The show was on fire from like 97-2010. Its been on a bit of a down since then. Thats not a crime, and its not an attack on the performers. I really don't think pretending its amazing now does anything to help matters. Its 45 years, I don't hold it against them if the show was never good agin but I absolutely think it will be when they get some new writers and new performers that do adopt the new comedic styles.</TEXT>

I think she is just as good as them, and absolutely ranks with them, but I don't think any of them are any worse than Kate. They were all great on the show and the second half have all gone on to huge acclaim, while the others are definitely well respected in show history and did countless memorable sketches and characters.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Yeah, I truly don't get it either. Like, I get the "till the end" stuff and i really tried a year ago after not listening for several years but it just really is brutal. Cause I also had the thought process that he's not even live that much, so why would I skip the stuff that sucks, because I'd quickly run out. Then honestly too much good old stuff started being on YouTube that I couldn't imagine going back to current again. I actually like some of the interviews if its with someone I like, which is funnily what most people hate, but at least that I know what I'm getting into. How people would prefer to hear Bobo or Shuli, even Sal and Ronnie at this point, is beyond me. That stuff is PAINFUL. The well's run dry on the good people and then the horrible ones never had anything to start with. At least if I'm listening to Seth Meyers I know what to expect and its on me if it sucks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I honestly think its because, ironically, the women aren't whores for the air, but also because women get judged much harsher than men. A woman JD or Sal or Richard just isn't as funny as a man, and in my head the only thing they could really be a loose kinda girl but then she just ends up being a whore. Its pretty one note. The men are too, but men are such fucking idiots that I think they end up being more entertaining. Those, plus the fact that any woman competing with Robin never seems like it'll fair well AND the fact that truly it doesn't seem like there's ANY real new back office people. There's Mamet, Brent, Shuli who isn't new but got increased when others left. Then there's guys like Wilding and Nowicki but they're barely in to begin with. It honestly just seems like it would take too long to craft new back office people or live up to the past so they just stick with what they had, which is largely still people from the Artie era like Jason, Will, Ronnie, JD, Sal, Richard, Benjy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Billy himself has said he never really felt the need to go back. I don't think they're begging him to come on, but I genuinely think Billy seems like there'd be no reason. I think Gary has claimed to ask when they've seen each other and Billy's just like "I don't know where I'd fit in" which does make sense. I can actually understand he's never been back because he just genuinely doesn't see a reason to. He's not really a guy that looks in the past and is always doing new things. Jackie's kinda the only guy who's been "back" and thats cause Jackie is desperate for plugs but was also so big on the show. It kinda makes sense. Its kinda the same way John has never been back, even Howard kinda claimed they were fine for a while and he could if he wanted. But I never believed he'd give John an audience again unless he was completely unsuccessful.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I'm finishing up the fantastic Artie Lange Addiction Saga, and I'm in December of 2009. Its basically clear Artie is just not gonna be coming back, but its pretty amazing in hindsight how they just blew past the whole thing. Yes, he tried to kill himself, and that became clear he was gonna be gone, at least for awhile, but this is someone they worked with for a decade. Even if they were sick of him, it seems pretty nuts to me that just all of a sudden he wasn't there, which must have been weird for all the main people, and they basically just stopped talking about him. I guess its not totally different than Jackie or John, who rarely got mentioned once they left, but it just seems shocking to me that for all the the grief Artie caused them for him to all of a sudden not be there they never really talked about "hey, its weird Artie's not here anymore, right?" He was literally in the group of 5 with Howard, Robin, Fred and Gary and then just all of a sudden was gone and rarely mentioned. Maybe its just listening in this fashion, but its astounding how quickly they moved on. I'm not saying didn't care, but just didn't mention how strange it was not having him there anymore. I guess he'd missed enough that they were used to it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its just amazing that if I hung out with someone every day for a decade they'd be a part of my life that probably comes up decently regularly. Its like how Howard will just ask Robert Plant about Led Zeppelin when he hasn't been in Led Zeppelin for 40 years. It was so impactful that no matter what you're talking about it'll come up. Its just crazy that a guy was in that room for a decade then barring a few calls, he's never brought up and they didn't in the beginning of 2010 be like "this is weird."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I mean, Artie is a big boy. What happened to Artie would have probably happened whether he was on the show or not, and whether Howard was making a bit of it. Artie was disrespecting the show, the show addressed it the way they did because they had to say something and they tried to make it entertaining. I don't think it was malicious and I still don't really hold the show as much to blame. They really tried to help him, and they didn't want it. If he was gonna keep coming in, they were gonna keep goofing on him.</TEXT>

Agreed that he's something that moves the needle for the company even if he's not who I listen to.

Having said that, given that most of us are now inside and don't go into work anymore so I don't use my car as much, whether he was good or bad I'd probably cancel regardless next time my subscription is up. I know I can listen other places, but I generally just did it in the car, and if I don't even use Sirius there anymore its just not worth it. It wasn't forever before then anyway, this pandemic has just hammered that point home.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Hated the movie, just wanna say that off the top. Burr was good in it, but the movie basically glorifies Pete's behavior, and when it doesn't it doesn't give a firm stance on it. By the end of the movie, I guess its assumed Pete's change, but there's really no growth shown and nothing to prove he isn't exactly the same or learned anything. Ok, then about them being in it and saying things, I don't think any said anything so horrible at the time that Louis wouldn't understand. Pamela was in an unwinable situation with him. She's intrinsically linked to most of his career and he did questionable stuff. I can't imagine she didn't know, I can't imagine he didn't ask her, I can't believe she didn't say yes honestly. But regardless of the fact, she had to get past it and disassociate, and I don't think she ever was out of line. I don't like that I think she knew, but I thought she handled it well. As for Burr, I also don't think he said anything over the line. I think its fair to be disappointed in Louis, I certainly was. But I don't think he's taken low blows at him and Burr is a pretty straight shooter. I think he just thought the whole situation sucks and that he doesn't blame or encourage Louis' behavior but ultimately falls on the line of "if the man is still funny, he deserves another chance." I haven't seen him really convey otherwise. As for Pete, you know, if Louis did that, then I understand where Pete's coming from and he gets lucky to crap on Louie and I'd say he deserves to be able to. Maybe its a little childish, but if Louis did what Pete is saying he did, I gotta side with Pete and say he's allowed to air it out and hit him back a little. If it didn't happen that way, then Pete's out of line and thats really unfair to shit on Louis when he was already at his lowest in the mainstream.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Here's what I think: It was not finely crafted material, and what we got last night was fine but not fantastic. I wasn't offended, but what was missing was that Louis CK style construction that Bill is definitely capable of and probably hasn't had due to no audience. But Louis' child molester bit is a perfect example of how you CAN get an audience on your side with edgy material, it just takes a lot of crafting. Bill had premises that were capable of that last night, but they just weren't workshopped enough. Not on him, not on the audience, its just on the world right now. But the whole time I thought "Bill is capable of pulling this off, but this is a prime example of why Louis' monologue was so amazing." Cause its so hard to actually get the audience on your side with that stuff, and Louis put in the work to do it while Bill took the easy road, which I don't begrudge him for. He didn't take it purposefully as much as thats just what is available to him at this moment cause of comedy clubs and such. It could have used a few more passes.</TEXT>

They said you NEED to go to rehab and clean up, so much show that you have to leave the show before a vacation. I don't believe he was fired then, they just really needed him to clean up like he hadn't before, and it was basically conveyed to the audience that way. The unthinkable suicide happened and only then was it clear Artie wasn't coming back and would be fired. Artie didn't attempt suicide because he was fired. He attempted cause he was a mess. But I don't believe they fired him. It was just maybe their first true attempt at trying to fix him.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Its because Artie could be so nice to you in private or in public and then when he turned on you it was vicious and unexpected, obviously because of the drugs. But when he was nice to you, it was in a different more genuine way than Howard. Thats why when he so effortlessly could shit on you as well, no matter how petty it was, it stung more. I totally get it, and only with hindsight do you see (much as I love Artie) its just an insecure child just trying to make himself feel big. He sometimes had some points, but it was all coming from a deeply insecure ego driven place. Thats why his number one reason for everything was money. You can read Artie like a book in hindsight. Hell, many time at the time as it was happening.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Artie's books are also so clearly colored in his favor and you can see right through it. His goal is for you to feel bad for him despite the money they are throwing at him and the success he has. Like he's in some sort of position no one else has ever been in. I love the guy to death but 1. he's NOT in some position no one has been in. He'd always talk about it to Howard and Howard would rightly be like "you don't know REAL pressure compared to what I deal with." and 2. This was the position he WANTS to be in. If you don't want to be a star, don't be a star, but its hard to sympathize with you whining about it when its exactly what you want and you talk about how money is literally the most important thing in your life. Artie had the cushiest situation anyone could have ever had. He could have had it ALL, and in fact he did for awhile. And if he didn't want that, he could literally JUST be on the Howard Stern show and be on the most popular radio show of all time. He had NO bad options, and he basically went a bad way because he loves money too much. Not gonna begrudge someone for that, I want all the money in the world too. But not begrudging you and feeling bad for you are two different things. I don't feel bad that Artie was so pressured because it was self imposed and it wasn't for some virtuosic reason. It was ego and selfishness, and its THAT behavior that made him entitled to boss Sal and Richard around. And when you see how it all left once he left that show, it really just says everything. Yes you ARE bigger than Sal and Richard, but don't forget YOUR place in the world too. You can get bigger opportunities than them post Howard show, but fo the most part you're at about the same level.</TEXT>
