    <TEXT>When i asked my mom this question she said when she was about 6 or 7 she lived in an apartment building they had big large windows and my grandma had just finished doning laundry and went out of the room. My mom took the laundry one by one and threw it all out the window onto the road when my grandma came into the room and saw the window open and laundry gone she had to go on the road to retrieve all the laundry. Guess where i got my hate for doing laundry?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>um i dont really know the perspective of other people but my sisters friends who is from a very conservative family from a very conservative town told me that her whole town is very very conservative and all the girls are kept in the house and cant go to college or sometimes even high school and in her neighborhood there was a family living in a house they were all very old schooled didn't let girls out the house etc etc. So one day the father of left the house and his daughter was home alone when she called her boyfriend someone told her father that she had called some boy home and her father with the disgusting thinking that he had came home right that instant and took her by the hair and also the boy who was present in the house out the door took out his gun and shot both of them but he was never charged with anything and the murder of both of them was labeled as honor killings. and because of it being a small and conservative town it is now known as a warning that it will happen again if someone else did it again and i know it is as disgusting as it sounds</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so when we were like 12 or 11 we had our final exams they were all super hard our school was pretty good but our timings were strict and they were like 8:00 sharp to 12:00 and no borrowing anything no cheating and no talking to the teacher so yeah we all broke the rules talking to the teacher borrowing stuff cheating repeatedly every single exam so our school had a swing type of thing someone had to spin it while we were sitting in it. we were obviously prohibited to use it as it was for small children and not us but us being us we all went in it and it only had 5 seats so like naturally someone had to stand in it so when we all sat and my friend who was going to be standing started to get up someone began the swing so she was hit in the head not bad enough to bleed but bad enough to cause pain. But being a drama queen she cried and said it was our fault and went to the teacher who was like the head but not the principal. she called us all and we went she told us to name ourselves and we did so she told us that we will receive a punishment for going to the swing including the girl who was hit. i know right the teacher was the best and told not to go it again our punishment was that we were not to sit next to each other in the exams but we were us and sat next to each other the next day nothing happened and we were all super happy.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>so when i was like 7 or 8 in our country electricity load shedding was a common thing like every two hours or so and we couldn't afford a UPS or a generator so one evening at 6 or 7pm it went out. so every one went to the terrace to cool down cause our house felt like an oven and i was never really bothered by the dark so i stayed in my room until it was unbearable so my room was the last one and the furtherest from the terrace so while i was walking through the corridor my eyes went to the living room door it was open which was normal but then i saw my maternal grandma sitting on the couch in all white at the time i didn't think much of it and asked her "why are you sitting here?" when she didn't reply i thought that she didn't want to talk or something so i went to the terrace and there she was sitting on a chair so i decided to ask her how did she get here so fast from the living room she said she was never there. So it really spooked me and since then i felt afraid of the dark but after sometime i overcame it.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>I lost my friend today</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-10-16 14:15:15</DATE>
    <TEXT>Yesterday my two friends were going home and they had an accident, both of them were on a bike. The one who was driving the motorcycle had his throat sliced open by a pillar he was taken to a hospital where the doctor pronounced him dead but after a few seconds his heartbeat started again he needed 25 bottles of blood which we glady gave to the hospital but the doctor already told us to be prepared because he was losing blood rapidly and there was no chance of saving him and he couldn't do anything about my friend's throat. And my other friend who was riding with him on the back had a head injury as well as some other damage like his face is badly injured, and some of his ribs are broken and some other things but now he has memory loss and can't remember any of his friends (including me) or the accident but he still can remember his family. But the doctor said that he will make a full discovery, which we are thankful for. I honestly don't know how to explain it but today around 5 or 6 am i found out that my friend who was in the front passed away, he was a really caring person and was always helpful, he was a great friend but he shouldn't have died that young everyone is devastated but i honestly have no idea what to do now. Edit: this isn't something i would lie about so please don't say that, also this really isn't the full story and i don't really want to go into detail about it as well</TEXT>

    <TEXT>we gave blood as in not only me but some of my friends as well as his family and of course we tested and not only us but the hospital also had a blood bank that provided the blood and our group of friends is very diverse in age as well cause we all aren't friends from school or college but friends from the same place</TEXT>
