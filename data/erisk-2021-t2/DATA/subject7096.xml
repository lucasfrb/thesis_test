    <TITLE>Safe to ride with broken nipple?</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-07-28 23:02:28</DATE>
    <TEXT>Had a couple bails in the last month, went to ride today and when I got to the park I realized one the nipples on my back tire had snapped in half. Has anyone had this problem? Will it hurt my rim if I ride with it for a few days till I can fix it?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>BC, Canada Under $10k Car Daily driver No need for warranty, though decent reliability is needed.... Can do normal maintenance but nothing crazy. Ideally something good on gas but still  #8220;zippy #8221; for lack of a better term. Been looking at some mk4-6 golf gti #8217;s but curious what other options there were. Awd is great for where I live but not necessary, understandably at this price point it #8217;s harder to get too.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have no fucking clue what #8217;s wrong with me at this point, whether it #8217;s a good idea or bad I just wanted to put this in writing. I constantly think about dying, and over the past months I #8217;ve started to just embrace it when I think about it instead of pushing it off to the side. I #8217;m constantly stressed out to the point where I #8217;ll punch my self in my head over and over so I stop thinking about the stress and start thinking about real pain for a few seconds. I don #8217;t enjoy pain per say, I just enjoy how it has the ability to temporarily steal my attention. I #8217;m not gonna commit suicide, I know this. If there was a way that made sense I would, but I have sisters and a mom that I #8217;m not willing to put in that position. Sometimes though, I #8217;ll hop on my bike (I ride bmx, happens to be the only other time I #8217;m not stressed) and ride through the city as fast as I can going through red light after red light wondering if and when I #8217;ll get hit. I #8217;ve lost all motivation to date or talk to anyone, if it was up to me I wouldn #8217;t talk to anyone but the way my life is set up it doesn #8217;t work that way. There #8217;s a girl I #8217;ve been talking to, I say things as though I like her. Originally I thought i did. But now every time I open her text it just drains me. I #8217;ll hit my head a couple times and take a breath, then I #8217;ll respond with something perfect. I #8217;m good at responding to people with exactly what I should say. Exactly what they want to hear, and when they want to hear it. But everytime I do, I feel emptier and more stressed. This all sounds incredibly pathetic and manufactured I #8217;m aware. And I #8217;m not sure what the point of this post is.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>That #8217;s shitty, but your friends suck. Whether or not I can stop you is up to you. But do everyone a favour and just make one call and tell someone. Whether it #8217;s suicide hotline, or the last person you can think of that might be of help. Even going outside and being in public. I have nothing good to say, and anything I do say is rather hypocritical, but the second you start, your gonna feel worse.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Everything in my life is causing me stress at this point, whether it #8217;s something/someone good or not it doesn #8217;t matter. I #8217;ve come to realize how peaceful death actually would be (not to sound emo) but I know when I die it #8217;s gonna leave my family and friends in a bad place. Idk what to do at this point.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I never understand my emotions. Most of the day I day dream about dying, different ways to do it, what it would feel like, how people would be affected, etc... earlier I was with a girl. Every time she texts I feel like shit, the text is never negative, but just seeing the notification come up makes me feel like garbage. I think I like her, tho I #8217;ve been dodging her since I got home because I don #8217;t know how to keep her away. I don #8217;t want to keep living, but I don #8217;t want to go out by choice. I want to blast through intersections on my bike till I get hit by a car. But even that concerns me because if i don #8217;t die, I #8217;ll have more problems to deal with and possibly a harder time dying next time. My family (mom and sisters) care about me, even a couple friends and the girl. But I never have and never will tell any of them how I feel. This sub has been the first and only time I ever talk about how I feel. I don #8217;t know what to do, right now I don #8217;t feel any emotion, I don #8217;t want to die, I don #8217;t want to live, I don #8217;t want to talk to anyone, and I don #8217;t wanna push people away, I just feel nothing. Earlier when I was with the girl, I was at a creek and kept looking at the water longingly thinking about just falling in and never coming up for air. About a month ago I started turning my shower hotter than I could take it to enjoy the pain, every time getting hotter and hotter till it gets numb, and I step out of the shower with my back red. But I can #8217;t shower all the time, or everytime I feel like dying, so I #8217;ve started punching myself in the head, and today I got a harsh headache. I snowboard and dirtjump (basically bmx) and am good at mathematics and have thought about becoming an engineer in the future, but I do #8217;t think I want a future, I don #8217;t want to mess my head up more because I already have four concussions, but I just wanna die in a way the least affects other people. I don #8217;t know what the fuck is wrong with me, I know that no one has made it this far, but here it is. I #8217;ve also found that there #8217;s ways to starve your brain of oxygen to make yourself pass out and holy fuck do I love that. It feels like a drug and temporarily I feel happy. I just don #8217;t know what to fucking do anymore.</TEXT>
