Probably best to keep in mind the intent of Roddenberry, which is mentioned here: [http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/07/06/star\_trek\_the\_next\_generation\_why\_did\_the\_starfleet\_allow\_families\_aboard.html](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/07/06/star_trek_the_next_generation_why_did_the_starfleet_allow_families_aboard.html)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The writer probably assumed it would be addressed at the beginning of the show. The rest was likely already written. I'm sure the writer was transcribing what Hardwick said as he said it, and once they moved onto the content of the show, a quick review and the writer published the article. A big takeaway is that AMC is no longer airing the show live. They still have a studio audience, but not having the show live (with callers, etc.) definitely changes the tone (and purpose) of the show.</TEXT>
