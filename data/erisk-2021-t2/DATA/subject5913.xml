    <TEXT> gt;i think the first tape i listened to when i got back into this hobby was nirvana's unplugged album. it sounded amazing to me, and i don't even like nirvana. it's why i used that tape, cus i didn't care. but the recording and mastering are amazing and even the cassette sounds clear and clean. Totally agree. I used to listen to it on a walkman while taking classes in college... lol.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Scored an almost mint condition Pioneer CT-777 off eBay for a reasonable price. Sounded great after I cleaned the head and pinch rollers. The low end is amazing which offsets my slightly bright Yamaha amp. Also tried the Super Auto BLE system to record from vinyl and Boy! I could not make out the difference in sound between vinyl and tape! All in all happy with the purchase. There is one small issue though- The display shows 'Metal' irrespective of any tape playing. Anyone can advise why this is happening and how it can be fixed?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My new Jolida preamp with upgraded tubes and capacitors. Got it for a good discounted price. I was using a tiny Emotiva preamp before and the difference in sound is huge. Very open soundstage and greater instrument separation (especially noticeable listening to Jazz). A tad bright but that could be my vintage Yamaha amp. Overall couldn't be happier with my purchase!</TEXT>

    <TITLE>AIWA Walkman issue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2018-01-31 03:11:17</DATE>
    <TEXT>I ordered an AIWA HS-G35 Walkman from eBay which was advertised as fully functional which it is but when I played it sounded as though the batteries are dying. So I thought it's an old belt issue and decided to replace them with the ones I had at home which were a close match but not the same thickness. It is virtually impossible to replace the main belt in this model unlike most Sony Walkman's without de-soldering some wires but I somehow managed to do it. It's playing much better now...a bit if flutter when moved but otherwise good. But the RWD and FWD seems to be reversed! How is that possible since I did not touch anything else?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Thanks for your reply. I believe it's the second problem as the belt is twisted and I have installed it blindly as I cannot see it is going around which pulley. There is a second smaller belt which is on top of the main belt and it regulates the speed so I am assuming it is coming from the motor.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>My new Hamilton Khaki King Automatic with H-40 movement and 80 hours power reserve. I recently lost my Seiko SKX007J1 at an airport (Don't ask how...it was my stupidity). I had been looking at Seiko's and Orient's but a watch enthusiast friend suggested Hamilton for it's price to quality ratio. Got a good deal on Jomashop although I did have to pay custom duties in my country. It came with a tan coloured Leather band which I am not too fond of so I changed it to a dark brown leather strap hand made in Sweden from cheapesnatostraps. It's a thin strap but seems quite good quality for the price. The watch has not left my wrist since I received it on Thursday (except while sleeping and in the shower of course!). I am glad I listened to my friend. This is my first expensive watch buy and I have a feeling it's not going to be the last. Any other Khaki King owners here, raise your hands!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>First time writing on Tomoe River paper and my jaw dropped as soon as the nib glided on the butter smooth surface. I instantly fell in love with it! No bleedthrough and absolutely no feathering. And to add to it, the notebook screams quality in every sense - 183 pages but still not thick, lays perfectly flat, dot grid and comes with a loose plastic page with a ruler marked on two edges which can be used as a bookmark and 4 ink swatch pages for keeping a record of your inks. I do not need to experiment anymore. This is the ultimate notebook for me at least and those who have never tried Tomoe River paper - just dive into it. Forget the Rhodia's and Clairefontaine's of the paper world. This is the real deal. And pretty cheap too!</TEXT>

It is a stunning dark green colour with nice shading and glossy acrylic which gives it an almost premium ebonite kind of look. The size is also perfect for my medium hands, even posted. I got their proprietary steel SIG nib in Broad which is super smooth at all angles. Overall, a great EDC pen! The ink is Noodler's Lexington Gray which was on my wish list for long. Amazing shading and super fast drying!</TEXT>

    <TEXT>This is the Nagaoka MP-150 and it sounds fantastic! Bought it from Amazon Japan for much cheaper than elsewhere and regretting not getting it earlier. The sound is very musical with amazing deep bass but open high end and a warm mid range. This is like the ultimate combo one can ask for. Studio recordings sound alive and there is no listening fatigue. I had a Soundsmith Otello before this and it started giving distortion so have sent it for repair. I am sure the MP-150 will hands down beat any other cartridge in its price range or more. Fellow owners can chip in.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I recently moved to a new bigger apartment and finally got a spare listening room. So I thought why not get the one thing which was on my mind since a long time: A proper wooden cabinet to house my modest collection of around 550 vinyl and more than 100 tapes. Since I am an architect, I designed it myself and got it made through one of my regular contractor's. It is in MDF but with a Zebrano veneer finish with a semi-matt polish/lacquer. The shutters are in clear glass. Each section holds roughly 100 vinyl. Saying that, it is very sturdy and looks good too. No more Kallax!</TEXT>

If you like The Who, I would suggest check Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Doors, Dire Straits and Jimi Hendrix (especially since you are into playing guitar). The key is to be open to listen to all genres and then decide for yourself which one you prefer more. The worst that can happen is you like all genres....then you just can't stop buying vinyl.

    <TEXT>After more than two months of waiting and losing one pen in transit (thanks to Goulet Pens and USPS) I finally managed to get one from a Spanish online store. Honestly, I thought I will never own this pen as it is sold out almost everywhere (including eBay!) so this one is special to me. This is the Platinum 3776 Century SE Kumpoo #289 out of 2500 pieces ever made. And trust me, it does look more goergous than the pictures. It has a soft medium nib which is very springy but hardly any line variation. It likes like a western fine with a lot of feedback (more than Sailor) but I don't mind it. Unfortunately Platinum did not offer a broad nib or I would have gone for it. It writes pretty smooth on Tomoe River paper.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Received this NOS Montblanc 22 yesterday from an Italian dealer specialising in Vintage FP's. The pen is in pristine condition and came with the original pamphlet with care instructions. It's a tad smaller than a 146 and the cap clicks into place with a satisfying sound. I especially loved the blue ink window although it's a bit difficult to view the ink level. Inked it up with Pilot Iroshizuku Yama-Guri and writes like a dream. Very smooth and fine line (though I prefer a bit broader) with no flex but I'm ok with that. All in all, very happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>For sale is an unopened 50ml bottle of the limited edition Lamy Petrol ink in box and a Kaweco Classic Sport clear demonstrator pen with a medium Bock nib in B- condition (slight yellowing of plastic body due to average use but no visible scratches).  #8203; Price for both: USD 55 including shipping to anywhere in the world.  #8203; Please note that it's not economical for me to sell just the ink separately so I prefer to sell both together. In any case, the Kaweco has been priced very reasonably.  #8203; Verification pic: [https://imgur.com/ydlrGyd](https://imgur.com/ydlrGyd)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Electronic music from a French artist from the 70s who was close to Jean-Michel Jarre, Pink Floyd, Soft Machine etc.The music is an ode to Mahabharata and Hindu mythology which has a tale about a warrior prince Arjun (Kshatriya means warrior in Sanskrit) who had to prove his prowess in a test by killing a bird from far away with a bow and arrow and he did it by hitting the bird's eye. The sound is very Vangelisque with a liberal use of ARP2600 and Moog modular systems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Do you actually own a Montblanc FP? Or have you tried writing with a 146 or 149? It feels luxury and their nibs are among the best in the market. I will not comment on their pricing but I am surprised at the number of people on this sub ridiculing MB. One does not make fun of a $10K Rolex just because a $100 Seiko is equally good. Every good brand has it's market.</TEXT>

I already own this on CD and cassette and was thrilled when they announced this extended edition. The bonus LP could be an album on it's own merit. Such is the quality of the music on it.

    <TEXT>For sale is a great combo for those who would like to venture into piston fillers: PENBBS 309 Acrylic Piston Filling Fountain Pen - 21SF Vermouth with a Fine nib. I have used the pen just a few times but with a different nib. So technically the original nib is still unused. That is why the B+ RATING. i am letting it go to fund a more expensive purchase. I am offering this in combination with Montblanc's limited edition ink which comes in a beautiful 50ml glass bottle. I have just dipped into the bottle for testing the ink color but never filled any pen with it. It is a great vibrant Emerald green color but I prefer something more darker. The asking price for both is USD 50. International shipping charges extra. Verification: [https://imgur.com/0BH7sCa](https://imgur.com/0BH7sCa)</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The latest addition to my pen collection - The Nauka Aqua from ASA Pens from India. It is a very long boat shaped pen (Nauka means boat in Hindi) but extremely well finished. The acrylic body is almost seamless and very smooth to the touch. Good value for money! It is best used eye-dropped. I ordered it nibless and installed an S.I.G nib by the Late Jim Rouse from Franklin-Christoph. And inked it with KWZ-Walk Over Vistula.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I have a NOS 22 and can vouch that these pens are truly amazing. I would rate them better than Vacumatics any day since they both are kinda in a similar price range. The nib is what one can expect from Montblanc - Bouncy and a delight to write with. Mine has a fine nib and I prefer it to some of modern fine or medium nibs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>**For Sale:** A rare to find **ESTERBROOK RENEW POINT NIB UNIT - 9048, EXTRA FLEXIBLE FINE** in its original packaging. The nib is in a perfect condition and the flex is also nice (not too flexible) but enough for creative writing). Selling it as I'm not accustomed to flex nibs and wanted to try one but could not get used to it. I believe the nib fits all Esterbrook pens including the modern ones. Verification: [https://imgur.com/gallery/AK1Vyv2](https://imgur.com/gallery/AK1Vyv2) I am adding a **Kokuyo A5 Notebook cover** which holds two notebooks securely.  #9679; The cover pocket can hold small items such as writing instruments and sticky notes that are frequently used with the notebook. Comes with a bookmark string. Asking for **USD 50** for both including international shipping. So basically, the Kokuyo cover is free but added to justify the $15 shipping cost from Dubai for just the nib.</TEXT>

    <TITLE>[WTS] F-C Jim Rouse #6 S.I.G. nib (B+) on an ASA Nauka Translucent Blue</TITLE>
    <DATE>2020-02-09 16:10:41</DATE>
    <TEXT>For Sale: A Franklin Christoph #6 broad S.i.G. nib tuned by the legendary nibmeister Late Jim Rouse (RIP). The nib writes flawlessly. Since I do not want to ship just the nib for fear of it getting damaged, I am including an ASA Nauka Demonstrator pen body which takes any standard Jowo #6 nib unit. The boat shaped pen is in a translucent blue acrylic which has a lovely matt feel to it. The pen is an eyedropper and the long barrel holds a ton of ink which looks great when it splashes inside it. I am asking USD 95 including shipping $60 for the nib unit and $15 registered worldwide shipping. So basically the pen body is for only $20.

    <TEXT>More images: [https://imgur.com/a/YrynP9f](https://imgur.com/a/YrynP9f) For Sale: A lightly used Hamilton Khaki King Automatic watch with the Hamilton Calibre H-40 in-house movement. It has an 80 hours power reserve and is in perfect working condition. The sapphire crystal and open case back is clean with no scratches of any kind. The bezel has a minor scratch which is seen in the first photo upon zooming at the bottom between 5  amp; 6 but hardly visible to the naked eye. Other than that there are micro scratches on the bezel and lugs that come with normal wear. Trust me the micro scratches are more pronounced in the photos than they actually are. The original leather strap has not been used at all as I had swapped it for a NATO strap and is like new. The watch will be shipped in it;'s original box and instruction booklet. There are no papers included. I will throw in a 20mm army green NATO. Asking for ~~$280~~ shipped with tracking number. SOLD.</TEXT>

Using specially aged :Italian leather. Very high quality. Thickness:3mm approx (5mm in the watch case area). The color is slightly darker than as seen in the pictures. Suitable for any watch. I purchased this for my Panerai and tried it just once but I realised I wanted something for daily use and this strap is more rugged than I can pull off in an office environment. But for someone with a bigger wrist and outdoor use this will be perfect. The leather is very soft and extremely comfortable. I paid USD 48 plus shipping so I am ready to give this for ~~$40~~ $30 plus shipping (approx $20) so it will $50 shipped.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Verification  amp; Image gallery: http://imgur.com/gallery/YO4LIUg For Sale: A Limited Edition rare to come by Visconti London Fog purchased by me from a seller only a couple of months ago. The pen is in perfect condition with no visible marks, scratches or dents (might have microscratches) and cap closes nicely. The nib is the original 23Kt Palladium which is super smooth (slightly stubby) and writes a wet broad line. The nib had some flow issues when I bought it but I have had it repaired from a nibmeister and now it writes quite well. There is no original box or papers which is why I will be shipping in a generic case with a complimentary ink bottle (Diamine Aurora Borealis) and will ship via express post. Reduced to USD 600 including shipping.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>I am surprised that nobody has mentioned the Tone Poet series vinyl which are all great titles and imo suoerior in music quality than even most of the 80th anniversary reissues. Stand outs for me are Cornbread  amp; Hustlin.</TEXT>

    <DATE>2020-05-24 09:31:43</DATE>
    <TEXT>For sale is a rare to find in this immaculate condition (B+) a Vintage Esterbrook Model B in the 'Copper' finish celluloid with a smooth 2556 fine nib and a fully functional lever filler. I am also including an additional even rarer 9048 fine nib which has a bit of flex to it. This nib itself costs $40 if purchased separately. It's a great pen to start your vintage collection and a joy to write with.
